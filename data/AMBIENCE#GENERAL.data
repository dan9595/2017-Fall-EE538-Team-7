Is it possible that the only good mexican food in this town comes from place where you have to stand in line to order

If you are in for a great treat that is healthy and refreshing you will want to hit this place
With that being said this is a good place to send your mother or someone who does not yet have a mind that is developed enough to venture to a place that caters specifically to its originating culture
I will not give this place a bad rating as they do a great job and make people feel welcome
The lack of surprises make it a good place to take out of towners to see downtown and introduce people to First Fridays if you wanna brave potential waits noise levels and lack of parking on busy nights
---Atmosphere----As far as the restaurant itself is concerned they did a really good job converting a rather eclectic Mexican place into a nicely furnished and modern feeling Italian joint
The food was great but the ambiance is really what this place is all about
The setup of the place is great from the lighting to the layout of the tables to the friendly service
This is a great place to go if you're looking for a different spot before a game or concert even just a night out Downtown

This is a very interesting place offering a very casual family and somewhat dog friendly picnic atmosphere
The atmosphere as I mentioned is very casual and family picnic like
On a few occasions the patio bar has been occupied by some of the scummy mill crowd which is a disappointment as this is normally a great place

The prices were a little higher than other places but not too bad
A great place to day drink when the weathers nice of course
It's in a cute Phoenix historic house and they place cool music
The fact that these people assume they are the judges of east valley taste is ridiculous I would hate to be around a table of 30 people all scheming to write bad reviews of the place their still in
It's a little disconcerting from the outside par for many great places in Mesa
Great place great way to ditch the sonoran mexican food blues
This place really can't be that bad right
overall it's a nice little place with good drinks and toast strange i know  oh and my little sister loves this place I am not allowed to go there without her she is 8 so i'm assuming all the kiddies love this

I'm a big fan of Indian culture and food but it's not terrible but there is other places that have great Indian food that I would rather go
This is clearly a place to see great musicians and artists
Highly recommended especially for First Friday- the artists selling their works jewelry handmade goods purses sunglasses and more are lined up down the street near the Lost Leaf and you can walk a short distance to galleries and the AZ Center great place to park if you don't get downtown early
The server will make or break your experience - the food is good the atmosphere is great for family friends and/or a great night out however the experience is contingent on the service
the park behind the place is a great view too
- Seating It's not a large space but I always manage to find a seat - Beer selection is awesome- Good lighting/atmosphereThe bad- You can't take your beer outside on the porch/outdoor area- Hipsters please kill yourself- Staff please read above statement be nice to people even if we aren't artists/emo/punk/goth
What Panne Bianco gets right is -quick polite but personalized service-a great short menu with no surprises-great to go options-big portions when a sandwich and a drink cost $12 it better be good-close to my work wishing they would move into my work's cafe space-its right by lux-its food that any single person could make at home with a sandwich press but doesn't b/c high quality bread and the like go bad too soonthe somewhat bad-wierd hours and parkingkinda high pricesno place to sit and wait

What I do like about DukesCheap drinksBloody Mary barA billion TVsShuffle BoardThe layout and big spaceFree Wi-Fi No I did not take my laptop but for those fantasy football players that must have their scores immediately it seemed like a good thingAll in all a good place to watch the game whoever youre cheering for
Great place to see a show with the following disclaimers- 'traditional' concerts are best - if it's a show where you want to jump around dance etc

Other than that this is a great place to take the kids
This is the perfect place for the perfect date anniversary dinners and any romantic event

Thanks goodness we had a gift card to this place otherwise I would've paid in toilet paper
The atmosphere of this place during the nighttime is great for a date the staff is super friendly and everything about this place screams ARTSY
The place is very comfortable and the food is great
The place is cute in a kitschy French/Swiss village-y kind of way
It is however a place for great Vegetarian and healthy options that taste unbelievably decadent; flavored with spices and herbs that are typically associated with Persian cuisine
This is an unexpected little place that is relaxed and unpretentious while simultaneously offering table cloths and candles
Overall Lost my business and recommendation for a good local camera place
My friends and I split some awesome oysters which i was apprehensive about at first just because this place really is the definition of 'hole in the wall' but they turned out to be great
We all ordered burritos which were also very good I love a place that isn't afraid to use dark meat chicken
The DJ played some good music and the place was nicely setup but for food don't expect a lot of choices
Place is pretty good after new ownership took affect
It's a great place for a special occasion
All in all it was a great place to have a celebration
The place also didn't smell good and was dirty
This place is right down the street from my new office and thank goodness
Very friendly bartender and seemed like a great place to just hang out with friends and play pool or chat
I usually only review a place that is exceptional or poor but since the choices for good Chinese food are so scant in the valley one has to make concessions
I wanted this place to be good really I did
Because the pork was so bad I'm reluctant to give this place another shot
I read all the reviews are they are not good so why do I like this place
It has great atmosphere and the food is awesome
I have always wanted to try this place because I have heard such good things
But bellow Great Wall or Golden Buda the the other 3 major Dim Sim places in the valley
The salted fish fried rice was not so great it was very under seasoned and the portions for the fish and chicken were not a large as some places are with this dish
The prices are high so don't expect to leave without a big bill but Sapporo is always a good time and definitely the place to see and be seen pretty much any night of the week

I've seen some reviews where others say they feel RP is too expensive & you can get good Pho much cheaper at the other Vietnamese places
Great food Great place to hang out for a few hours Great environment
I would give the meal several points above frozen food but not as good as many other places I have had chicken fajitas at
There are so many good Mexican places here that knowing which ones to visit can be a bit overwhelming so I rely on the locals to give me tips
Overall this place is very good and I can't wait to try the quesadillas because they look pretty darn good themselves
I'm shocked by the bad reviews of this place
despite those minor issues I would definitely recommend this place-- yogurt is as good or better as mojo and yogurtland and the selection is definitely better than Mojo
Great music and excellent service make this a place worth checking out for a few of their cheap drinks
I have to admit I was kind of skeptical about this place but it turned out pretty damn good
It was a Saturday night and the place was completely empty for most of our meal which usually is a sign that you should run out the door as quickly as you can but we stuck it out and I had some really really good pork tenderloin
Over all I think Veneto is a great place to dine
This place also has really great wings which surprised me
i wouldn't buy my canned goods here but from now on sunflower is THE place for us when it comes to veggies and fruits
The food and service are consistently good and the atmosphere is always fun
Finally a good eats place near Harkins 16 on Bell never able to eat antwhere close before or after a flick
A great place to visit in the neighborhood to get a taste of revisiting childhood and a past era
The architect of record is Albert McArthur though he sought advice from FLW on the block system that was stylishly used on the place to great effect
One good thing I will say about this place though is that their chips and salsa are pretty good
they were very friendly it was reasonably priced and it was a cute little place
I chose Rustic Sage because I have always had good luck with massage therapists who work at places that only do massage
If you're the kind of person who is looking for someone to help you figure out why your back hurts or what the source of that knot in your shoulder is this is a great place to go

It is such a cute place with warm decor and awesome chandeliers
This place was busy but in a good way and I plan on going back for more
I have never bought anything here but has been a great place to take people to sight see
this place is definitely good for parties too
they have a pretty good size arcade inside as well as a food place to get like hot dogs hamburgers pizza etc
Take the time to hit up this place for a different take on great chinese food
It's a great place to go on Sunday morning and read the paper while you enjoy a carved sandwhich
Slightly pricey hot dog special is a good economic choice but the atmosphere is relaxing always clean consistent quality and they have free self-service water so you don't have to bother with getting back into line if you're still thirsty
In need of a pedi bad and this place is right down the street so I went in at 5pm
All great places and all within walking distance
Decided to check this place out because they had a good deal on GrouponNow
The set up is great - children have their own area with plenty to look at and explore while adults have their own place to study or enjoy a book in some peace and quiet
Our servers took such great care of our big table on monday night that I have to give the place 5 stars before even one plate of food was served
Good for large groups as the place is huge with many different rooms to be seated in
I give the place 3 stars because once at the table the service was really good and the place is very nice
Most sushi places put the basic rolls on happy hour but Stingray added a couple extras - the Las Vegas Roll was good with avocado smoked salmon and cream cheese and wrapped in tempura
I would have given them 5 stars because of the great food and the charming atmosphere but I can't
food is pretty good as wellBut I would say the selling point of this place is the view you get especially at night you can see the city light from there
Great place to sit back relax and enjoy the night
I've tried their grilled cheese sandwich and bread pudding which were remarkable and they have great beers on tap so I know I will probably make this place a more regular stop as it is directly on my way home from work and I can forgive the initial oversight in my first review
A great place to chill from the summer heat
well I'd say cheers to that I guess we have good taste   This place offers some really great menu items for health conscious people which I really appreciate
Great atmosphere friendly fun and great food
All the food was great and the atmosphere was rather unexpected for a restaurant in Tempe Marketplace
It's a great atmosphere and i'm probably bias because of my history here
Happy hour and reverse happy hour are great so if you haven't tried this place at least try it at those times
We wanted to love this place - we really did; and first impressions were great as we arrived before they opened
Small place nothing special inside which really does not bother me but good service
So we got there at around noon and the place is cute big patio and all
It's not a high-end place but if you're after good Thai food you won't go wrong here
As Arik mentioned in his review this place can make some good pies
Sure I wanted so badly to walk up to the band ask 'em about Austin their home city; one of my fave places to visit but I couldn't think of any words
It COULD BE a great little hang-out place
The atmosphere was nice for a casual place with a couple of flat screen TV's on the wall
We came down from Prescott for the weekend to visit the folks If you are looking for great frozen yogurt you will want to try this place
We stumbled on this place on the way home one day and thank goodness we did
We never would recommend this place to anyone sad since it does have good food most of the time when they can get the orders straight and make things as described on the menu
All in all if you're 20something and single this is a great place to stay
This place will leave you unphogettable whether it be good or bad
They have those really thin metal forks that only pizza places have and mine kept bending the dough was so nice and thick and good
Overall when you desire a good steak for dinner or a place to start off your night this place could be an option
The folks at the Clarendon didn't miss much the du00e9cor is modern and the atmosphere relaxed
They have a good system in place to get your order out in a reasonable amount of time
the place has a great atmosphere with old Chicago stuff
but for good authentic Thai food this is not the place
It's a good thing in that it builds a relaxed and quiet atmosphere but it might be a negative in the case where the space gets filled easily
I really really hope this place does not go the way of some mom-and-pop operations in Phoenix that had really great things to offer
This place really has a chance to be a good-size fish in a big pond
That's what husband's are good for ; In any case I loved the atmosphere and the company
When you walk in the atmosphere is great what with the snazzy furniture friendly staff and the plenty of customers in line eager for the fresh food they serve up
I definitely recommend this place to people looking for a good breakfast joint
Not sure how busy it gets but it was a nice relaxed atmosphere when we went
This place is always full of beautiful asian folks so you know its good
Younger crowd yes it's close to ASU but good music good atmosphere
As we walked by the gardens it was great to see some kids and adults having the process explained to them of how they grow the food organically here - and it could end up at one of their restaurants in one of the nicer restaurants in the valley or sold at their Farmers market to be eaten in their own home
This place would be great on an expense account
My husband and I went for a romantic dinner and we were not disappointed at the amibance of the place
But for a bill of $45 with tip for 3in the heart of Scottsdale it's definitely  a place I'll stop in again if it's quick casual simple and tasty that I'm looking for
I had a good birthday but that was in spite of the wait at this place
This is a great place that is close to everything on the Mill Ave District
This place is great for family singles and dates
The place is always clean and has great quality picture and sound
Now if you have a professional mixologist there - wouldn't it be great to tell him/her what I usually drink and they will create a new cocktail for me based on that instead of making me leave the place beacuse I don't like their cocktails
Great place for families and hipsters alike
There are great Middle Eastern restaurants in Phoenix but a lot of the places have food that tastes like restaurant/deli food
I can't believe this place gets so many good reviews
There are tons of great places in this city to try for upscale Mexican food- Barrio Cafe and Gallo Blanco are my favorites
When I first walked in I noticed the place was empty normally a bad sign but it was a Thursday afternoon so no big
One that a customer will want to come back for over and over againFor me this place set the bar so high most of the other chain places will never be able to compare with the quality of not only the food but the great customer service that I received from this place
It is not often that a place is able to make such a great impression on me read my other reviews but I will definitely make sure to give them my business the next time I am in the mood for a sandwich
FINALLY got to try this place after I heard so many great things about it and seeing it on the Food Network
If youre too lazy to go to goodwill and dig it out yourself for a third of the price then i guess this is the place for you
Great great place to have a drink and relax
Place is dinky and out of the way but seems clean and food comes out reasonably quick and it tastes good
The Dj usually plays a good mix but depends who's there and if there having an off night but if you want a good time strong drinks and just a packed atmosphere
I doubt I'll ever feel comfortable here but it's certainly a place I would return during the right hour of the day if invited by good company
Don't pass this place up it was great
Highly recommended for a great burger in a cool atmosphere
This is a great place to take family or go on a special day
I'm definitely going back to this place it's just a GREAT place to hang
Great place to socialize eat good food and drink tasty beer
Too pricey for regular visits for me but the type of place you can take your out of town guests to make sure they have a good meal no penny pinching allowed
Simply fabulous for say a casual day time date the atmosphere is nostalgic and funky
They did a great job making a restaurant in the corner of a supermarket but with the cooks tucked away in a room where you can't see them and only two people working the floor I didn't get much from the environment of the place
Lee Lee's restaurant is a great place to grab a bite with friends
The vast population of Caucasians in the greater Phoenix area should add a bit of culture into their lives and give this place a try
The patio was really cute and inviting and will be a perfect place to grab a drink once they get liquor license after the weather becomes cool
5 - 4 hours if you want to eat You know what I don't care how F'n great this place is supposed to be because that is not good practice it's ridiculous & any moron who waits that long for food is F'd up in the head
I just starting working in the area and have been in search for a place for breakfast lunch and good eats
For a place that is primarily a coffee/beverage spot with some good food allowing people to sit and drink free drinks all day would be a bad business decision
The people were all in good moods and atmosphere outside was really nice
The bottom line is the price is right It's amazing how cheap we got outta there really the service is fantastic the atmosphere is cute and cozy and the food is pretty great
Service was above normal as most of the staff was friendly and in good spirits singing along to the songs and enjoying the atmosphere
Cute and comfy atmosphere with a ton of different ways to order your boba
It's hard to find good Dim Sum around the valley but I believe Great Wall is definitely one of those gem of a place we should appreciate for Dim Sum
My friend and I were out and about on the town and we were looking for a great place to hang out
Not this place - they have good quality items and the prices are fair
Great place to greet then eat your meat
I highly recommend this place to anyone out there who loves a good cheesesteak
this place could be great but unfortunately can't find a way to attract a good crowd
The inside really is a mostly bar with great food so be prepared for some rowdy locals but this place is killer on teh food side and you can go for a 4 star meal in jeans which is what I'm always looking forjust a great spot that I will return to in Phoenix any day
Note to self fancy place not the greatest restaurant to take your 14 mo old on a whim and  you and your hubby are wearing casual wear
With that said even though we looked out of place we still had a great time and the service was excellent
Great place for a date especially if you want to impress
The restaurant is a really cute intimate place and my only problem with it is it's far away from my house

It's a very good place I only give it 4 stars because it's in DouchebagLand aka Scottsdale

I wanted to take her to some place nice with good food
The music is good the cocktails better and the ambiance the best thing about the place

This place is just pretending to be a great hotel while merely being a decent hotel
All in all this place has great food and In have always had great service and delicious food
I love wings and I've been trying so hard to find a good wing place in Phoenix but I think my search continues for the time being
This is a good place to send anybody that you really dislike
This place isn't exactly cheap but the food is pretty good
But overall I thought this place had good food but the price was a little pricey for me come on' sandwiches and appetizers with 2 glasses of wine for 2 people costing nearly $50
Overall not a bad place if you are in the mood for Thai food
That's like giving a burger place a bad review because the buns were vehicles for meat
Great place regularly checking back if we wanted anything if it was to our liking and offering to top off our drinks
The restaurant atmosphere was good and did not notice anything dirty but then we were there at night
it's not the cleanest place and the menu might be confusing if you haven't had this type of food before but this would be a good place to try something new
A cute wine bar reportedly set in an old Post Office- hence POSTino but is not apparent with the trendy decor and lively yet intimate atmosphere perfect for a date or group of friends
The appetizers are good food is good service is top notch but I never think of this place for dinner
If you're into desert plants Boyce Thompson Arboretum is another great place to check out near Globe
With two small children 3 and 1 1/2 this is a great place that we can come and experience a happy hour environment responsibly of course with the children

There weren't many people there but it was also after hours so I'll forgive it because it was such a cute place
Great atmosphere and for being in Old Town douchebag-free
The atmosphere is great whether you are seated inside or on the patio
The tacos at this place are little bundles of goodness that are damn near perfection
If that wasn't bad enough I ended getting FOOD POISONING from this place
It's a cute place and the staff is really well trained so that was really a nice treat
The beef hot pot was a 2/10 on the spicy scale and we are used to this place being a good 8/10 usually
It's great to find a place that has really good HEALTHY food
My wife and I were looking for a change of pace for lunch on a Saturday and since there aren't many good sandwich places in the west valley we decided Heidi's sounded good
Walked around and checked out a few things still wasn't sure of the reason we were here then we walked into Szechwan Palace and I thought gosh this is cute little place
As my friend and I walked in she said it feels like a great place
Not that this would be a bad place to be stuck per say but
This place gets so much Yelp praise and for great reason
I will be a loyal customer and I am sure will post numerous updates to this review cause this place is just that good
All in all this is a good place to go when you have some time to kill during happy hour
Fantastic pizza good friendly service cute inside atmosphere but the location is a nasty dump next to a Circle K in a seedy part of town with absolutely no parking
Food is very good almost as good as that other famous pizza place in town but my god this place needs a new location
This is a place for people watching & good comedy
This little place does a great job pumping out fresh Chinese food
The main food was done right and the restaurant and atmosphere was great
This long time favorite provides a great comfortable unpretentious atmosphere
this place is cute down to the little matchboxes which hold ponies and the custom lamp made of blowdryers and edison bulbs
This is a very cute place--it's clearly not a chain-restaurant type of place that seems to be so frequent here in Scottsdale
I had heard good things about this place in passing and so purchased a Groupon to try it out
We arrive aroung 530 on a Thursday night and again the place is empty so you'd think we'd have no trouble getting good service
A great place for celebrating a special occasion or just feeling fancy
It's a great place for study and offers a nice environment
The place was cute I can't comment on authenticity because I'm as white as they come and the strip mall was a typical strip mall not intimidating whatsoever
But I hear this place is great during the day and certain nights
Add some giardenia and that would be money in the bankThe atmosphere in the bar area is great nice and dark lots of brick with tons of big flatscreens and Tony was a vocal ambassador of the place
Not knowing what to do I started researching car repair places and found that German Car Service had great reviews
It always has a great atmosphere they're very welcoming and the food is great
The food is great and the service is untouchable for a fast food place
They are good - but not quite a replacement for hash browns and gravy
Once we've had bad experience at a place usually don't go back
Food - not badDrinks - standard barAtmosphere - ok for a sports bar downtown lots of TVsService - yeah right
I'd recommend this place if you have money to spend figuring out whats good for yourself otherwise I'd stick to some of the recommendations made on yelp without a thought of straying
More places should try this find a few things to make very well and execute on them
This is a really cool place with a nice open feel cozy and casual
They have some pretty good coffee drinks and the place just has a cool vibe
I guess that's what I get for mentioning that I heard the place had great ambiance the whole polynesian theme and requesting a table where I could check everything out
If you think of an old fashioned ice cream parlor from the pre-Great Depression Sugar Bowl would be the best place that replicates the image
This is not a place for a sushi purist but give me good food a cool gathering place close to my central Phoenix abode and I will be there
If you're in your 20s it seems like a great place to go
I love places that bring out bread right when you come in so that was a great plus and a great start
I tend to get the veal piccata type of dish at Italian places as a measure and the veal here was very good
Good pizza places that deliver are hard to come by or maybe I've become a Pizza snob I'll have to check my wallet for a membership card
so for $9 you get a pretty weak meal compared with other good/cheap Mexican places or decent sit down joints with service
Very cute place but the food like many Italian restaurants in phoenix was pretty disappointing
In the end the place smelled very fishy which you should know is a bad sign when eating at a fish restaurant - especially sushi and we decided to just split and get food elsewhere
This is a good place for groups and I've never had to wait for a table here either
I wouldn't say punk gallery meets retro-Victorian it's not really either of those things I think but it is definitely a great place for a coffee

sometimes hole-in-the-wall places are the secret and this place is my go to place for quick good chinese food

Recently moved back to Mesa I have been on the hunt for a place to get a good sandwich and fresh bread

Always makes you think the place is going to be good
There is seating in the back if you need to rest the place is intimate the acoustics seemed good
This place signatures the phrase good eats ~ hole in the wall
I read some reviews on here saying that it was a great place to take out-of-town guests so I went ahead and took a visitor there a few days ago
The Pad Thai is good but one thing I found is that the noodles were a bit too soggy - it would've been nice if they were just a tad more firm although I must commend the kitchen for fully cooking the shrimp as I've been to some Thai places where the shrimp arrive a bit undercooked
No but this is a case where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts and the restaurant is definitely on my short list of good Thai places in my area
But the owner just updated and renovated the place and it is looking good and I guarantee it is still fun as hell
My friend found this place on Yelp and we decided to go since they had pretty good reviews and they were open until 2
The food at Olive Tree is good not my favorite Gyro place but I would go again
It's a great little neighborhood place and a welcome escape from the millions of Starbucks in the area
The atmosphere is cool but comfy and the service is always great
I have been wanting to try this place out for a long time and have heard great reviews
I then got a royal tour of the place including the great leg lamp actually it's two legs not just one
Great place for visitors to the Valley and maybe business lunches
I am always looking for a good Mexican place-- on a specific search for the best guac in greater Phoenix-- and one of my coworkers thought we should give it a try
And Crossfit 480 is a very unique place to work out - relaxed and welcoming atmosphere superb equipment good location
There have been some good bands there if you like live music here's a place to check out
Definitely a good place to stop on a bar crawl night
If you enjoy activities like bowling I would definitely recommend Main Street Billiards as a great place to hang out & do something different with your friends or family Yes it is a family-friendly establishment
My verdict on this place is that it is an extremely good sushi bar with plenty of interesting cuts of fish that you don't see at the generic places outside of Scottsdale
This might be another case of a place that used to be good when they were small but lose it when they expand to a huge new building
But to me it's one of those Place wasn't so great but I'm glad I still came here for I would have never known how it is
If you are not into really good beer then don't bother with this place
Downtown Phoenix isnt exactly known for great places to eat excluding Bianco and the entire metro area in Maricopa County isn't known for places that stay open late
The service is excellent and friendly to boot and the atmosphere is hip but relaxed and not pretentious
On a recommendation from my wife for a great place to have a meeting I suggested to my new clients that we meet at Next Coffee Co
The place is cute more cafeteria style and laid back which is perfect for a morning breakfast
One day I'll go to Elements for a special occasion or when I'm rich enough to go there for no reason at all I wanted to take my bf to a nice unique romantic place for some drinks and apps for his birthday
Also the bar area was insanely crowded so good luck finding a place to sit
This place is loud obnoxious and always crowded but that's good for us
This is not a good place to scope out dudes or chicks for that matter but a great place to people watch
If you want fast and satisfactory food and a moderate price this is a good option to place  on your rotation
The only thing I wish they had are the little rice pancakes and plum sauce that Chang's had otherwise it is a great place to eat and good for all family members young and old
-Spring rolls = I never had it with such a nice aroma-Korean bbq = I don't know why my bf ordered this at a Pho place but it was good
I likemy hashbrowns well done and unlike most places the waitress listened and they were great
It is totally tucked away in a cool neighborhood and is a great place for a date or to feel like you are escaping the suburban sprawl in PHX
It is a great place to crash when you have a long night of drinking and festivities planned
The GOODSweet n Sour pork is excellent Egg foo young is greatTeriyaki chicken is greatBottom line this is a very average Chinese place
Most of the places we have tried as of late can not make a good Hot and Sour if you paid them-- which we did
We need to keep great-tasting traditional Chinese places like this around
Prices are reasonable atmosphere is great service is always wonderful and the food is awesome
great place for men their is a small TV for you to watch while having your haircut and a big one to watch while waiting the service is great wait times and price not so much but for all the old men who are always in their that just want to be mauled by younger women i guess its OK
So I already had a pessimistic attitude about finding a good place to eat in Mesa/Gilbert that wasn't Joe's
I said that this place wasn't good for kids - mostly because I'm worried they'll catch next year's strain of the flu - yup if you want to get your immune system up come here
Russ suggested My Florist for lunch since we were in the area but I said well I always go there at night and while sitting at My Florist see this cute little lunch place across the street that I've been wanting to try so let's go there
Decent pho place non-threatening and great for first timers
First unlike all you other Yelp*ers this will not be a place for us to drop casually by for a meal or our favorite beverages
anytime i find a german bier garden I try my hardest to get to it and considering i was only in AZ for a couple days i thought it was a good chance to try haus murphy's
I will try it again in a few weeks because I'm hoping that they figure out what they're doing wrong and fix it because this place has great potential
I'd heard a lot of good things about the place and was looking forward to it
My favorite part about this place is their devotion to happy hour almost as great as mine
The regular menu looked tasty which is why I went in the first place but the fixed menu was too good a deal to pass up and the prices seemed reasonable
Here's the quick and dirty keep in mind that I give some leeway when reviewing airport food versus normal foodPros-quick service-great place if you want to catch a game-really impressed with free wifi at PHX-For folks who need to charge their computer during their downtime there are outlets on some of the corner tablesCons-burger was mediocre and you'd expect them to have burgers nailed at least choice was b/w medium well and well which should have been a sign
Cute Cupcakes and the place definitely has character
This place has great decor and some smokin servers from time to time but the food and prices have been a disappointment on every occasion
Either way this place is typically a terrible place to go and eat if you want to enjoy good Sushi Sashimi etc
The set up is cool and relaxed excellent atmosphere for a gathering of friends
Great service and the atmosphere was inviting
It's a cool place to come with friends on a hot day or for a desseert after Zin Burger or one of the other great placs at Biltmore
this is a really cool place to get an oil change and he alerted me to a bigger problem which did turn out to be pretty urgent busted CV boot but I took it to my mechanic who and I already knew charged me half of what they quoted me but my mechanic also asked me whether or not my car was making any noise beforehand and I said NO everything was great until I went in to Big O for the oil change and he told me the CV boot was busted
It's a pretty small place but they have a good selection of ASU stuff at decent prices
The low-lighting environment seem to be a great get-together place for group of friend or even a date
I must say while this place is small the good is great
It's also a good place to bring a dog for a walk Sophie quite enjoyed herself when we took her and there are doggy bags conveniently located at the trailheads
Fun unique selection of delicious food that you'll find nowhere else in town great selection of cold beers cozy dark atmosphere friendly staff
Honestly I didn't get a good look at the menu food or drink but since this place is still in the process of opening everything is still a work in progess
food was great but the drinks are always the best at 40th so i figured this place would be no different
They have gone to great lengths to make sure you know that this place is hip and with it
It's located in a great little shopping and dining area that wasn't too crowed last night but I think that was more due to the weather than the actual popularity of the place
I'm a huge fan of porters it wasn't too smooth but it was delicious the camelback was nice However I'm not a fan of IPAs so maybe thats why I didn't like the last one but if you do it is very hoppy and I would recommend itOverall I'm happy that we checked this place out it was a good find
One more thing when I was reading some reviews about this place being expensive I wanted to laugh it's very reasonably priced good quality beer comes at a price
There are times i wish we had a Thaitown or there was a cluster of really good Thai restaurants within a 5 mile drive of me but sadly most Thai places in metro Phoenix are just not that good with exception of a few gems
Overall if you arent too picky and want a solid breakfast at a great price hit this place up and I promise you will be happy you arrived
To me you judge a good BBQ place by their brisket and this place holds it's own
So far over the last few years this place has been a great place to go for some good food
Now I will give this place credit for being a nice plate to rest your head when the music dies down and if you use Priceline you can end up with a great rate
Unfortunately I missed this place when it was Bomberos but I'm happy I found it in its current iteration as it's pretty great
This isn't a place to go if you want to impress a date but a great place for friends/family to hang out and get inexpensive sushi
Definitely give this place a try great hang over cure after a nice out in OT
Its a cute place and a sweet-tooth's playland
Great atmosphere with Paris Cafe type decor
Great products customer service and atmosphere
Very nice cool almost chic atmosphere very casual and welcoming staff rocks
So we sat in the bar area and when the waiter came to take our order we were a group of 4 we placed several appetizer orders right off the bat and said that would be good to start and we'd add more to the order in a bit
Anyway back to the food it was good but not better then pizza bianco but I agree it is a nice place to take a date if its casual
Cute atmosphere but the food is some of the best I have ever had
Great place to grab lunch if you're in a hurry
We were excited to try this place because we'd heard about the patio seating overlooking a lake romantic lighting and even an outdoor fire pit
Romantic restaurant for a special occassion is the definition of this place if you look it up on Webster's dictionary
If they are as good as their tacos I'll rate this place a 5
But I still find the place to be a good time if you can stand the wall-to-wall people and the loooong lines for the bathroom only the ladies bathroom of course
The food is still great the service was very warm and the whole atmosphere is still inviting and cozy
For this place being around for 20+ years you would think they would have good food
I wanted to see how good/bad my usual place Cho Dang was
they make this place look really good in pictures on their website
Overall I would give the service excellent the food pretty good ambience good and value above average
I know you shouldn't judge a book by its cover and maybe not even the inside pages either because the actual book could be really good but I really hope they hurry up and do something with the place or I'm gonna need to take some Xanax or Cymbalta before I venture inside again
Drinks are great food is great perfect atmosphere to sit and read catch up with an old friend or just kill sometime with a glass of wine or cup of coffee
But the drive and getting lost was worth the wait to dine in this great place
Houston's turned Hillstone has been a great change in atmosphere as well
What a shame that the good food and drink and nice ambience of the place has been ruined by an incompetent staff
Although not as good as Pho Trahn overall this place is far better than most
What distinguishes it service is very good something that many Vietnamese places lack
As always the staff is great the food is amazing at a great price and the place always makes me feel swanky as shit
This place is great for assisting the Snottsdale crowd and other unsophisticated palates at overextending their revolving credit a bit further but if you want good food then go elsewhere
While the sushi is good  I'd put it in my top 5 in the area it was the atmosphere that got me
The sandwich was large and I left full but with so much great food in Tempe and a few other good BBQ joints around town I probably won't stumble into this place again
This place is about as good as a nail salon can get
I can't say enough good things about this place
The salads and the pizzas are really good freshly made and what you would expect from an artisanal pizza place
And to top it off this entire place also operates as what most people think is a really cute market full of curios that other people call junk
Sixth This place isn't that bad it just has no soul
They created a great vibe that will undoubtedly be the next contender for The Place to be
Great place to take someone who has never tried sushi or still is unsure of what they like
Great place to take someone who loves sushi but is indecisive
The place is under construction and that is not good to keep it open while that is going on
Okay so it's not filled with the youngest hippest crowd in town but you can't get more elegant and romantic than this place
So in closing you want an elegant romantic dinner and don't care about seeing and being seen at only the hippest places in town give Palm Court a try
Great place to dine with someone special or invite some friends
If you're looking for good authentic chinese food then this place is one of my favorites in Phoenix
If you're looking for an upscale place or are more interested in great service then this place isn't for you
The ownership has been the same since they took over the location from Yummy China which was a pretty bad place and the food has been consistently good
The place had a good crowd but it wasn't packed
Though with so many other places in the neighborhood Via Delosantos and Los Reyes de la Torta I don't see the need to go here to often except when I'm in the mood for a good tamale
It's a very cute place nice decor the family seemed very nice and well let's get to the food because it was absolutely scrumptious
Even with a dry cleaner among other small mom and pop shops near by this place does a good job of drawing you in with the smoky and sweet smell of slow cooked meat
Others who have reviewed this place said it had a great smoky flavor and My texas brisket sandwich did not disappoint
It is a perfect atmosphere for romantic dinners or lunches with friends  I always get the Shrimp Adriatica before my meal
I would give this place 5 stars if it had a few more items but all the dishes are good
I think there are only a few places in the valley for Indian food for me but I haven't been to every one in the valley -- this place The Dhaba in Tempe on Apache and one other that has a great buffet but I haven't been there in years because it's far away
This is a very casual place  My only complaint is that it is sort of pricey
What a great neighborhood family owned place
It is an expensive place but I would say it is worthwhile and definitely good for a special night
As the mom of  2 kids a 3 year old and a 8 month old it seems to be very difficult to find a nice place to eat that is very comfortable and casual- and somewhere that people don't give you evil looks and comments  for bringing kids Carraba's
The place is always packed with a diverse customer base; which is great
The only bad thing about this place is the incessant parade of panhandlers through the parking lot and the outdoor patio
I would totally suggest coming here with a group to watch a game or hang great atmosphere
It's far enough away from everything to not be crowded but a good place to add into the rotation
The coffee is good -- I'm a no-fuss black coffee girl but trust them about the iced cappuccino on really hot days -- and if you're more of a tea person they're one of the few places nearby that stock Harney & Sons one of my favorite tea blenders in the US
There is no atmosphere to speak of what so ever not that its a bad thing
Cute little place in the Basha's shopping center
It's a great place to come for breakfast and coffee but at times the wait is really long and the food/service can suffer when it's really busy
From the outside you would never assume that such a great taco place existed but once you step inside you know something good is about to happen
It's a great place for a family dinner with options on the menu for everyone
Will definitely go back again and would recommend to anyone looking for a great breakfast place
Penzy's is a great place for finding all kinds of spices
So overall not a bad place the prices quality and atttiude serve as enough of a deterrent to patronize again in the future
I think this place is a good alternative to other asian restaurants and would make a great option for a quick and filling lunch
We ate there tonight and I have to say there is absolutely nothing bad I can say about this place
Since I have never been to a frozen yogurt place like this I don't know if that is a good/bad price
Service was great through the whole dining experience and the place is decorated in 1950's style
Equally great atmosphere for doing work or just hanging out Echo has the added bonus of a made-to-order lunch menu
It is a great place when the weather is just right to hang out and people watch
The bar is cool and a great place to grab a few beers
Another great plus to this place is that on just about any given day you can visit and see Joe the owner hanging out chatting with customers and all around having a great time
It has a calm atmosphere that is great for a first date scenario or meeting someone for a cozy chat
Great place to meet a friend and have a brew
Coming from Chicago we are always looking for a great pizza place in the valley
I've eaten at plenty of places with terrible service when the food is good enough to balance it out
Well we all  went to a going away party here at Casey Moore's Oyster House and the place was fairly nice lots of security around  but very limited parking we parked a few blocks away and had to walk in food was good but my onion soup was way to salty though and the dip sandwich was by far the worst item to order on the menu just sliced meat and bread  and I had order it
I've done some classic eaves dropping and great people watching from their place
Today for lunch my buddy asked if I wanted to go to Joey's and I actually thought an Italian Beef sounded good so I went along to try this place out
This is the living room I would want if i could design my own place with a great tasting strong Americano
This is a great place to take your vehicle to if you want an honest mechanic to work on it
There's good reason for all the hype around this place
I understand that when I got there that it was pretty late but the place wasn't empty and about to close so I DO expect good service
The place had a great vibe and if the weather would have been a bit cooler we would have wanted to sit on their awesome patio
Had to try this place out b'c of people's reviews and I'm always in search of a good Chinese restaurant
Make sure you ask if there are tables available out there if you want a quieter romantic evening as it can get rather loud inside when the place fills up     For dinner my husband had the french onion soup to start  which as always was the best you will find anywhere around and the flat iron steak with zinc potatoes their version of au gratin potatoes but with no cheese He loved the steak a perfect medium and the potatoes were creamy and perfectly cooked
This is a place to eat if you are looking for great food are on an expense account and aren't looking for quiet atmosphere
After going to canter's and greenblats and factors this place was all right i went with three others on a Sunday at 1230 and the line was pretty long but we only waited 30 min for a table's when taking a few mins to look at the bake goods counter
They can improve on little things but overall a good casual place to go
Definitely a great chill place to go with friends sip on some wine order some nibbles lots of great cheese
Also an amazing selection of wines - a great place to experiment and try new things
This is actually good place for casual biz aft five
Overall this place is one of my favorites with great meals great beverages good vibes and good company
I love this place whether its for weekend dim sum or for a great dinner
The atmosphere is relaxed and the wait staff is always very friendly
I noticed it was a small yet local place which was great
Make no mistake this place is literally just a pick-up counter looking into the kitchen but the food has always been damn good Again I quickly found what I liked and stuck with it
Wednesdays are especially great with the lunch brownbag speaker sessions and the evening filled with hacknight where all sorts of great collaboration takes place
Also try this place out for a great date night
good food in a hidden place in one of the strip malls
If you are interested in some good ceviche this is a great place to go
Great flavors and very fresh food along with a warm cozy atmosphere
Suffice it to say I didn't think this place was anywhere NEAR as good as some of my foreyelpers
The ambiance was pretty good earning this place one of its stars
A great place for dinner - just watch out for the cougars
this place is synonymous with good times and it won't break the bank either
The ambience sucks the service wasn't very good and the food was totally average
I have been wanting to come back and eat but being the good wife we have gone to other Thai places to satisy my husband
Kind of a scary place but if you want a salad and lots of it I guess its a good choice
But if you want good food try someplace else in the neighborhood - like Chevrount's
BUT this place is still not as good as Pinkberry
There didn't seem to be a whole lot of crazy dishes to try which I'm always attracted to but overall the place was quite good
Convenient location free parking great atmosphere friendly staff and quality products
I have nothing bad to say about this place
I didn't really LOVE my experience here but for those who enjoy creative and fusioned sushi or a good sushi happy hour this is a great place to go
Overall Fuego bistro is a great restaurant with creative latin american  dishes and would recommend this place to other foodies
Just a super awesome place great service with a super proud owner I assume big dude
I had heard good things about this place and based on the awards and accolades hanging on the wall my expectations were pretty high
The environment is great for local bands and there isn't a bad spot in the place
Can't say enough good stuff about this place
Great place for any environment and will be back often
This is a great place to get a protein packed chicken sandwich fast
A safe-feeling clean comfortable place where the Guinesses are poured right the jukebox is full of punk ska early alternative and reggae but is never too loud a welcome absence of sports only two small TV's and both were showing John Hughes movies and a relaxed and upscale-looking crowd all of whom probably think they are slumming
Friendly service and great atmosphere-one of my new favorites
I enjoy the communal rice that comes with most menu selections the five or so spices that are brought to the side of each table and the relaxed atmosphere
PROSEverything tastes so damn goodLarge menu something for everyoneNick a very nice and extremely helpful serverRather inexpensiveLaid back and casual atmosphereCONSWhen it gets crowded you'll be waiting as it seems to be understaffedSome menu items seem to be more Chinese than Thai but good nonetheless so I don't really know if that's a true con
The ambience was great including a live but not distracting singer and a warm crackling fireplace
I'm in the market for a good place to become a regular so I tried here its close to where I work so I tried
SO all in all I would not recommend this place to anyone yes the lady that did my pedi was great but I can't remember her name so i wont go back and i do not want to go to any establishment were the manager is rude and has bad customer service
The adjacent wine bar is a good idea and definitely the money make for the place as the food is very reasonable
but a good soup salad sammi place none the less
My wife does not share my love of this place as she likes wine and salad neither of which are great here but hey its an Irish pub and I don't think I'd want to hang out at any that were known for wine and salad
Birthdays are always a great occasion to celebrate and Philly's is a great place to do it
good service nice atmosphere dope ass grub
There are so many great places in the Metro Phoenix/Scottsdale Area
So all in all this place isn't bad FOOD wise
The atmosphere was great with a beautiful view of the golf course's first tee
This would be a great place to take out of towners for a a beautiful dining experience or a great date
This place does have great food and totally lives up to it's reputation
I am not sure this is a bad thing it just makes people realize how good of a place it is and it's cozy
Great place -- we will be there often
The inside is very cute yet I find it strange that a place named Mi Patio doesn't have a patio
At most places I notice a very thick layer of Armor All on the dash but these guys keep it light and go into pretty good detail
The topping bar look great though nothing to really set it apart from the other place with the exception of the fruit looking and tasting fresher
It is usually pretty dirty and could use better clean up  I would even go as far to say I think this place could maybe use a good remodel
I racked my brain all day trying to come up with a good Phoenix-y place to bring my BFs dad who had driven all the way from Bakersfield and was surely hungry
You can't get any better than a place that offers really good Italian food at great prices
This place doesn't try to be anything other than a great family run business
The prices were good for this type of place
The service was good the food was hot and tasty the atmosphere was fun and ladies don't forget to check out the restrooms ;  and let folks know don't come in after you if you're gone for 20 min
Price wise I found a great deal online but would be willing to pay premium prices for winter conditions to see what this place has to offer when it is at its best
Great Italian food with an atmosphere where you feel like you are part of the family
Other than that great place great food laid back atmosphere
I'm probably not a good one to ask about the waterfront appeal of the Mighty Arizona CanalNever the less Olive and Ivy is a nice enough placeIt's another Fox Concept don't you just love the branding and labeling of these kinds of thingsI suppose it would just be too darn simple to just say Hey look
I seem to get great service even in places that don't really have a reputation for good service
Chili's food just like many similar places is not very good 20 minutes later when you get home
It is good clean place to eat that is generally not very crowded
The uni was never going to be a big seller or any good at a place like this
The service wasn't too bad like others have said but I could see how it might be if the place was busier
The major dealbreaker - the reason I give this place a bad review - is the seating
The atmosphere is pretty good for weekend mornings though I haven't yet tried a dinner here yet
Thanks Dylan and Michelle for a memorable evening and I whole heartedly recommend Portland's to anyone looking for a great meal in a relaxed atmosphere with wonderful service
The ambiance makes the place and when in the area I am sure to return for a casual evening with friends in the future
The place only holds like 5 tables so the service better be good
if you are looking for a great place to hang out people watch and enjoy amazing food and drinks this is the one
We've tried a few places around town and have been looking for a place in East Valley that has good Med food at reasonable prices
Checkout was smooth and the handy Marketplace by the front desk was great for buying last-minute bottled water & tea for the road
All of the chairs in the place are mismatched making the place feel so cozy and cute
your atmosphere is fun and your location is great for a little staycation
I think this place is still as good as everyone reviewed and I wouldn't avoid it
This place is for weddings family gatherings just simple good food morning noon and night and amazing drinks
I can also imagine there would be some good salsa dancing in this place late nights
Was in the mood for a good sandwich so decided to give this place a second shot
Great place to celebrate a birthday or take a group
Cute but typical little Thai place on Indian School Road
Food is bland and tasteless but great atmosphere
This place is great for a happy hour and to kick it as the environment is spacious and hip and full of good looking people but other than that the food is very overpriced and every dish besides the bison burger was bland and tasteless
This place has a great selection especially if you are a beer snob like me
For a place that serves draft beer this is BAD
the best/most reviewed Cuban place on Yelp in the greater Phoenix area
Unable to find a good place to lock my bike the owner showed me a covered area between the restaurant and the adjacent building and told us he was currently building a bike rack thus I was impressed with the service even before I sat down
Still it is a great place for an inexpensive lunch or dinner and they seem to have improved on the time it takes to get your meal
This is another place where I have yet to order something bad here
It would be a great place to watch a game with friends if I liked watching games
I can't think of any particular drink specials this place offers but the vodka/soda's I had the last time I was here were pretty strong so that's good
This a small place that could do a good lunch business I suspect if quality was better
The space is really good outdoor seating during this time of the year is jam and ambience are spot on for a group or a more datish type situation
NUTSHELL- a great place to meet some folks for some afternoon beers always weekend music
A great place to go when you want a diner atmosphere
I can't say enough good things about this place
The outside of this place does not look like much and kind off put me off but once i got inside it was a very cute and hip place to my surprise
Pretty nice place located amoung some very good eateries in Old town Gilbert
This place screamed we are not the good egg
this place isn't really great or anything

Scale of 1-10 single visit10 Food9 Service10 Atmosphere8 ValueThis food is great had/tried the hummus appetizer ricotta ravioli spaghetti squash casserole and flourless chocolate cake
I really want to give this place a 5-star rating but quite honestly the service is pretty bad
But then we ordered drinks really good sangria and mojitos and I don't say that about very many places
Overall this place is outstanding chill fun and great for a casual group night -- just be prepared to wait
Just a very well rounded place to give visitors a taste of good eats in Phoenix and examples of well done and delish Mexican cuisine
It was a Friday night my wife had been on Yelp looking for a good place to grab dinner before we went downtown to the ballet the in-laws bought us tickets I had to go
It's got kind of a strip mall chic feel to it and the fifties music playing in the background made me feel like I got dropped in some bizarro Back to the Future scene but the food was great and the couple that owns the place was really friendly
On the few occasions I've come in when it's subdued and the bartender is wanting to shoot the shit with you it's a really fantastic great place
All in all this place is good for the sheep that need to eat downtown but lacks anything for a reason to return or recommend it to anyone
I'm all for happy hour at this place for a drink and snack and the happy hour menu/drinks are actually pretty good
Generally the portions at Thai places are so huge I feel like a whale after I leave but Thai Elephant does a good job with their potion sizes at least for lunch leaving me satisfied but not feeling glutenous
Looking at the website the chain 3 total has pretty high accolades Best of Phoenix 2009 by the New York Times just interesting that the decor doesn't match although perhaps I am being snooty and should just relax and have a good ole time which is what the place seems to be trying to say
Good beer selection awesome appetizers and great atmosphere give Casey Moore's an above average rating of four stars
My fiancu00e9 and I have searching high and low for a good Mexican place all year we moved here last August and I must say we had all but given up finding good Mexican food until we stumbled upon this gem
Islands is a great place to go if you are in the mood for a burger and don't want to spend a lot of money
I also really enjoy the fries at this place and they also have some really good desserts that are fairly large in portion
This is a great place to bring out non-Arizona guests
This is as far as I'm aware THE casual Italian place in Chandler
Great place to go for kid products for their bathrooms and bedrooms
I don't like to give places a 1 star review unless I have either gotten sick or had a really bad experience
I can't feel good going back to a place that can't tell me whats in the vegetarian sauce
It would be very hard for me to give any Bikram Studio a bad review because no matter what if it is a place you can go and practice it's good
But for all those in favor of a night out in Scottsdale this is a good place to stop
Not a bad place to be if you're a bar/lounge trying to make it in the Snottsdale Circuit
Okay so I really didn't eat here but I think the atmosphere is great
I think it's pretty evident from all the rave reviews that this place is really good so I'll keep it brief
Overall a great place to visit but if you're from out of town watch carefully--the turn onto 8th St
Not a great first date place if you're trying to impress her with your pretentious style but a great 2nd 3rd 4th and 5th date place
There are definitely sushi places with better quality sushi but the sushi here is not bad AND it's very inexpensive
I can't recommend Rustler's Rooste enough - just a great place to eat
If Star of India SoI is named after the historic ship that set sail from Great Britain to India then it is best to declare at the beginning that there is nothing worth remembering about this place and there is little that keeps you afloat in the morass of ordinary fare
The salsa isn't very good; it's bland for a Mexican place
The outdoor patio is very well set up with heaters and cute little sitting areas with fireplaces and fire pits
It is too bad because Italian places are always begging for style
I can't give this place a bad review but I would probably not go back
Great service charming atmosphere and excellent dishes
Great service and nice atmosphere made for a great evening
The building and patio are really cool and set a good atmosphere too bad the food and service don't follow suit
The carnitas are always good at this place and the grilled shrimp tacos rock
I decided to try this place for a good hangover breakfast today
I haven't any place any better than Forefathers for a good cheese steak although I would be willing to tryIt's a quaint little place that doesn't go all out in decor which is fine considering I'm used to some of the best cheesesteaks coming out of a cart
This place is in da hood and most people you will see here speak better spanish than english but if you love authentic Mexican tacos like I do this is a great place to go
Creative dishes for one of the few Asian tapas places in Phoenix great ambiance and excellent service gives my affair with Sens 4 stars
Atmosphere is great for dining but the Chipotle-Style line you go through to order your food while they prepare it in front of you is less than appealing
Entry is cute with the little organic veggie gardens growing
Waiter was good and a great atmosphere pretty people a good place to go on a date
First off it was pretty late in the evening so it wasn't super crowded or anything based on the always-present crowd at Yogurtland this might e a bad sign for this place
Hanny's atmosphere is exactly what a Downtown bar should be cool and relaxed yet sophisticated
Same great design and atmosphere and killer sliding-door bathroom with a sink big enough to wash your hair in I'm always a sucker for a cool bathroom
You know this is a great place when everybody that has reviewed the joint look familiar
Great food and great service make this a place I will definitely be visiting again
Went to this place for happy hour and found they had some great drink and food specials
The service was great and all the food was served extremely fast even with the place full
All and all a great place and somewhere we will be visiting again in the future
Review #800  I had to wait for a great place to feature for #800
It's been a while since a place surprised me so much in a good way
That place is great but it also costs twice as much and I never used half the stuff they offered
Please if you are in the area on a weekend or for lunch check this place out for a casual outing - very laid back and the staff is awesome
The atmosphere is very casual they have some great plane-related decor that is fun to look at
You got the hip but sophisticated atmosphere great eats and drinks and could walk away well-fed and pretty buzzed without having buyer's remorse the next day when you realized you spent your week's lunch money
Other than that a good solid lunch place
I love the feel of this place and if you go solo you are bound to meet someone that if anything can offer a good conversation
I would visit this place again for the great bites and interesting atmosphere
I'm not cheap but I dislike the valet in your face idea that seems to be creeping up to casual places
The staff was great at handling somebody who was trying to figure out what was what with a place that is wearing so many hats at once
The atmosphere is great very relaxed and casual without the usual pompous and fake Italian restaurant feel
I always look for Cuban food when I'm traveling as I haven't found a good place near where I live
Favorite place in Scottsdale to go for an afternoon of great wine and socializing
So $30 and a gut-ache later I find myself wondering why I thought this place would be any good at all
Good place to host a company party for sure
But if in that area and want some decent food with good chips and salsa in a nice atmosphere you can't go too wrong with Cantina Laredo
In a city with a new trendy lunch spot opening and closing every 15 minutes you will find no greater old school deli in the Metro Phoenix area than this place
It's a dark sexy looking place where the music is always good you're going to run into people you know whether you want to or not - always good for some drama and yeah the drinks are pricey but not by Scottsdale standards
Overall if you're looking for a good place for sandwiches and sweets head to Paradise even though it's a large chain
service was good  place was super cute prices were a little steep for what you get
It seemed like a good place to have a party on the patio an intimate evening with a date and anything else
The only thing I can say good about this place is the aesthetics of the place and it appears to be clean
Like First Fridays what makes the place great are the electric group of people who hang out here
As a result Carly's is a great place to people watch hang out and engage in weird and wonderful conversations with complete strangers who may just become your best friends
Say what you will about hipsters and about how small the place is--in my opinion Stinkweeds is great and I fully support them
I've only had the bad judgement to bring my tone-deaf-no-talent self into a karaoke room once and I promise you there is not enough sake in this place for that to happen again
With a valley full of so-so restaurants it is always refreshing to find a truly good place to eat
This is a good place to take well-mannered children
I normally gives places a second shot but it's a slap in the face to a real good authentic place in other parts of the valley I
The place was packed with people who were there to just eat lunch which is a good sign for a brewpub
It also would be a good place to bring a visiting friend from out of town so they can sample some good local beer
Good place to meet up with friends and hang for a few hours
They serve green corn tamales which is becoming rare for Mexican places and something we greatly appreciate
It's a fun lively place for some good grub and more than a few beers
If you like great beer and sampling different kinds of beer in the same session this is the place
Overall the place was okay it was nice inside and had a cute set-up
it is really hard to find great food and great service at the same time but this place did it for us
Other than that I really dig this place and can totally see myself going back for a casual dinner or even making the little trek for lunch
I was a bit reluctant to try this place based on some of the bad reviews that it has gotten on Yelp but I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and give it a try anyway
The only thing I'll recommend in this place other than the hot deli is the chocolate and coffee bar which seems to have a ton of delights that are supposedly good for you
If you're looking for good pasta/pizza at a reasonable price this is the place to go
- 5 starsDefinitely a great place to go for sit-down in Scottsdale Fashion Square but stay away from the rolls and stick with the main menu except give the salmon wasabi sashimi a try
If you're looking for a good lounge vibe this is the place
What's nice and unique about Mabel's is the comfortable furniture and exposed brick walls - gives the place a great atmosphere
All those ingredients other than the fresh tortilla aren't quite as good as the other places
Looked at a ton of places & figured that we should try Tapino as they had a great food/drink special & we were into what they are doing
All in all great little place with a no bull shit attitude
the place had such great ambiance that we stayed until last call
Also - this place has really good sweet tea
I just moved to Phoenix and the first thing my parents tasked me to do was to find a great place for ice cream for when they visited
Luci's is a cute marketplace located in the epicenter of what is quickly becoming the hottest area in the 602 for locally owned outstanding businesses
It was a nice exchange and it was great reflection on the place
We felt a little out of place since it was a much much older crowd in bad capris shorts and flip flops
Don't miss The patio seating and atmosphere at nightSkip  the bar half of the restaurants seats are badly placed and save your cash with Kobe burgers that barely surpass the gut-bombs from White Castle
It is such a cute little place in an old post office that opens up so there is an inside area and also a patio area but the inside area is breezy and still sort of outdoors
Well priced great place to meet up with friends or go on a date
I could see why people have said everything good and bad about the place
Place has tons of potential interesting menu great atmosphere but just needs a little help
Great place for some tasty grub and refreshing drinks
It's a great place to stay and they are very accomodating
The place is really neat so eclectic cute little hipster girls with the berets and the guys with their funky black arrow like earrings and scarves
It's such a trendy/hip yet relaxed place that I felt comfortable among the sea of people
Don't get me wrong they were really good but I feel like every place I go now claims to have the best sweet potato fries
It's a good hip vibe while still being a nice enough place to impress a date
Great food-CHECKGreat vibe-CHECKGreat staff-CHECKTheres not many places that will make me go and have more of their great food two days after i went for the first time
i think this place would be a good place to go for happy hour or a drink and one of the cheaper menu items
If they hadn't been so insistent that everything would work out great and that we could sit together and wouldn't have to wait we definitely would have gone someplace that takes reservations
Not a place I will shop at all the time but great if your looking for something special
Recommendation  For a cool young hip and classy place go here and for a great meal with 2-6 people
This place is genuine and a good spot to hit up every other month or so
So I looked up some good places to eat via Mouth by Southwest and low and behold I found this gem and knew I had to go
Not a bad place to to eat some mexican in the valley
this place it not super nice but the food is good
Even when it doesn't look like Christmas threw up all over the place the Coach House is still a great end to the night
You best be on some good behaviour or at least be able to decently hold your liquour because this place doesn't put up with crap
not a bad place for a pint or some Glenlivet
I have not had a good experience at this place
If you want a good ol' fashion American breakfast this place may not be for you
TD is not a bad place to grab a few $1 tacos - the pollo was incredibly seasoned and the steak asada wasn't bad either
The vibe is laid back but cute enough for a date night the patio is spacious and wonderful for springtime cocktails on the patio and it's been the perfect place for casual business lunches on occasion

This place has good bagels but tepid service

Having eaten at Houston's in Houston I thought this would be a great place to get a steak
The place is not overly fussy but the food is clearly made my someone with a great deal of skill
The atmosphere isn't much to speak of but when looking for a good taco joint this generally doesn't regsiter on my radar
I am always spreading the word of their bad service and when my friends suggest to go there I recommend some other place to go
If you just feel like standing around in a tight packed bar not hearing what anyone says and getting terrible service then I guess it's a good place for you
I got the chorizo burrito and it was out of this world I had heard this place was good but when you actually go there the first time and all your high expectations are met well that makes this place outstanding
Aside from the food this place has a very local atmosphere which I love and let me tell you that the service rocked and all the great looking female servers are another great plus
Great little place to stop in the morning
Sakana is a good place to take someone who really likes crab salad; because nearly every roll is a crab salad California roll
There were plenty of kids there so if you want to introduce sushi to a child or someone this might be a good place
So cute conceptually but the place was in serious disrepair and it looked like most of the stores had closed
I have always heard bad things about Ra so I never wanted to make it a place to dine for sushi
The atmosphere is just okay but the service has always been good
The service is great and the friendly staff help make it a pleasant experience it just wasn't a place that I was head over heals for
If you like a good cheesy-gooey NY-style pizza this is the place for you
The pies are good enough to offset the dumpy ambience which believe it or not was recently painted and redecorated
40 retarded the selection is 4 or 5 dishes which include chicken fried rice fried noodles small freaken veggie egg rolls and some pepper chicken WTF seat selection is not bad but you see drunk indians go behind the gas station not to mention if you need the restroom its a door that goes outside to another door smh this is NOT place you wanna go sorry but i will never return
Its a fun place great atmosphere and tasty breakfasts
Great atmosphere Not a hole-in-the-wall yet not so trendy that they blare the club jamz and that the waitresses are all augmented
Blue Agave isn't what I would call real Mexican food but it is still a really good place eat

Overall the flavor atmosphere and service was good
I have heard great things about this place from a friend of mine
how is it that this place has so many good reviews
I love me a good burger and there are a few places in town that serve yummy burgers Delux being one
The atmosphere is great casual pizzeria atmosphere IMO
The place seems to invite you in with a warm and cozy feeling but once you sit down the hurried pace and cramped table made me feel like I was in a fast-casual joint wolfing down my food
Hot Mess I was expecting something along the lines of  an NYPD Pizza since this is a local chain but instead got a cool atmosphere and bad food
It is such a great place to get some exercise and enjoy AZ
You can get a great workout or enjoy a nice stroll makes it a great place to take out-of-towners
The atmosphere is great and I actually expect the bill to be higher than it is when it comes
This is a bad place and don't be sucked in by the eclectic surroundings  Especially stay away when the bartender Kim is on duty  She is cold and very unfriendly and preoccupied with the other help instead of the patrons
Atmosphere is casual which is okay with me
Waitress was nice and I only heard good things about the place
As my friends would say its a great place for a first date
The one in the scottsdale mall is still there hopefully I love this chain their french roast coffee is great though pricey but most importantly the thing that made me move to PHX in the first place their creme brulee tart ohhhhh the breakfast of a century so beautiful you are I want to have you every morning for the rest of my life I miss u sooooo their napoleans are great too
Hard to order chicken at a place that does such good burgers but it was quite tasty

I can't believe I'm giving 5 stars to a BBQ place but this place is damn good
The place has a great atmosphere but the food isn't worth anywhere near $34
The place is uniquely decorated is very casual and a little bit hippie which I am totally cool with
This place is a great addition to the central Phoenix area
After reading so many good reviews about this place we went and checked out
Such a cute place with a case FULL of delicious looking temptations from crab cakes to mashed sweet potatoes to chocolates and cheeses and VINO
This is a great place for vegetarians as well since they use Quorn and faux ground beef
I felt like I might have just been over-hyped into believing this place was THAT great after my first encounter
The food and beverages here are as good as the cause that this place stands for
I guess if I had never enjoyed GOOD cajun food *cough* Baseline/Price *cough* previously or never enjoyed it at all this place would get 3
The fact that we were less than impressed with the atmosphere really dark decor kind of reminded me of Black Angus and staff our server was overly enthusiastic when presenting the specials but not around when you needed more water or the check isn't enough to make me take away a star or two because the food and drinks were delicious and well-prepared enough to make the experience a great one despite these drawbacks
I've heard so many great things from Yelp and from friends and I couldn't wait to check this place out
If you ever want to help your community City of Grace would be a great place to get ideas of where/how you can help

Such a cute place and the employees were very pleasant
Great place to be & lose yourself in the art
Overall though very good sandwich place and I have no complaints about the service or anything
Alexi's is always a great place to go for breakfast and that's what we normally do at Alexi's
My biggest complaint about this place is the lack of good craft beer that is kept cold
This place may have some food that could be good but I am not willing to take that chance
Food is always really good Lots of it great flavor and the guy who runs the place is always friendly and helpful
Besides that it's a great place for another restaurant
I like the patios which is a great place to meet people
The patios are a good place to actually have a conversation so I usually tend to hang out around there
A few years ago right after I turned 21 a few of my friends took me to this place it was awesome loads of people good music and two for one drinks
If you are looking for a Great Place to Relax have one of their many services or just gaze out the back of the spa as there is a Big Lake THIS IS YOUR PLACE
I have a soft spot in my heart for all of my entrpreneurial friends working so hard to make Grand Avenue a great place to work and shop

With a couple of great owners and good food this place should be a no-brainer to anyone looking for a moderately-priced Italian meal
I know I know there are no cliff divers and there are no video games but they both serve Mexican food they both have a giant waterfall and the whole place is like a cave so three out of five ain't bad

Would highly recommend Manuel's to anyone looking for great Mexican Food in a casual atmosphere
I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good sushi happy hour
1 extra star because a balcony on 5th & Mill is a good thing though I'd go to Gordon Biersch mediocre in its own right over this place every time
The place has a very cool ambiance - nice but casual
My first impression of this place was good you open that huge door and walk into the place and it just feels like quality
Even though it was a weekend evening and the place was absolutely packed the service was great
I have a good number of places to eat that are all within walking distance or along the lightrail
Its a smaller place that has good food but space is limited here
Most places don't really fry the rice but Yume does a great job--8 shrimp included for a lunch price of $9
This is one of our favorite pizza places - for the food value drinks and great atmosphere
It is in a great location walking distance to a bunch of fun bars so it's a great place to start the night in Old Town

During the day it''s a great place to just get out of the heat cool off with their daquiris and eat a delicious Po Boy
There aren't too many great options for breakfast/lunch near my office at South Mountain so I was thrilled to find that I really enjoy this place
Too bad could be different as  it has nice atmosphere easy and plentiful parking
It IS a stylish place inside & out & it wasn't bad really but I'm not likely to return to this one
all in all i think this place is going to be great for me
three stars is a little generious but 2 is harsh because the place i wanted to go nextdoor was closed i drifted in here they give you chips and salsa which was a little more like a bad marinara and half the chips were borderline stale the women working the bar was pleasant the menu seamed a bit pricey i ended up having a pattymelt which was decent and a few bluemoon in nice frosty mugs
Freddy's was a pretty decent place for burgers and fries but they fell a little short of being great for me
Overall a great place for the Dim Sum neophyte
Positives  A good example of traditional Dim Sum if not a perfect one                 Good food great place for groups
Oh yes and before I forget GRADESOverall   A- no other demerits taken other than mentioned belowService  A-  The only major demerit on service was that the English                        spoken by some of the cart pushers was not intelligible                       however this is excusable as this is a Chinese place -                        the specials board was completely in ChineseFood   A-  A good example of traditional Dim Sum
Great little place - very homey and I'll definitely come back for the breakfast with the fam again
I love the casual atmosphere has a rocky point feel to it and you usually get good service
I was relieved when I started to notice how much attention to detail my barber paid  I was then relieved even more when he used scissors to cut the top of my hair  Some barbers just weed wack your hair all over with the clippers/buzzersIt took a good 15-20 minutes before he was done which was awesome because this place had a nice TV right in front of me with the news on it
Don't get scared - its not one of those Mexican Sushi types of places its just got a great menu and everything is delicious
This I regarded as a final insult as I have no desire to return to this place and in lieu of making up for the bad meal and poor service the only apparent apology is an invitation to come back and do it all over again
This is a great place to dine alone at the bar and for happy hour
The place has the cute cafe atmosphere with the beer list written on the chalkboard next to the front door
Cute place to grab brunch I just wish they had salad options

The place is great and you can choose a burger they have created which is what I did or you can build your own from scratch or make substitutes
This place is also great for kids they cater to kid food allergies
Great place for adults as there aren't too many kids running around
The place was great the staff was running around with shirts that read LEGALIZE MARINARA on the back we sat on the outside patio the ambiance was great a very up beat and happy place to be
This place is great and thankfully for you out here in Phoenix they're scattered all over Phoenix too bad they're not in L

Not a bad place for being in a strip mall buy don't expect service
All in all great place to order to go bone- in wings
As a lodge for corporate meetings the Scottsdale Plaza Resort is a good place to meet
That was pretty good - but could have been done just as well or better by quite a few places in town
The atmosphere was cute but the food was not a good value and never really rose above Ok
Pavle Milic and Charlene Badman's other love child Baratin  FnB being the other continues to showcase the best of local organic ingredients in an inviting atmosphere
This place goes through great efforts to keep the place well organized and clean
The place was pretty busy so service wasn't exactly speedy gonzales but it was very good considering the crowd
We are in town for the week so really was at a loss for a good place
Second- the hours are great while there may be better frozen treats in the downtown area this place is more accessible because it is open when you want to go
All in all - good place to go when you just want a good old fashioned scoop of ice cream
Definitely a great place for free wi-fi and for great conversations
It is a good place for big groups although they won't seat you unless your entire party is there
It's a good place to go for takeout and unlike the Sierra Vista location is nice enough for dine-in
Hard to say anything bad about this place
I would like it if they sometimes had later showings but other than that it's a great place to go see a film that maybe isn't out yet or ever in other theaters around the valley
I personally don't drink if I am so I always go there and make my husband drive ;- It is a great place to meet people for food and drinks because they never rush you and it is very relaxed and friendly there
And I wanted so bad to ask the waitress to turn the channel to NFL football - but I did have enough sense that I was in a Mexican place surrounded by Mexican families that probably like watching their version of football
This place was nothing special thats for sure good wine list though and the bar area did look fun unfortunately we didn't both to stay and check that out
I'm waiting for a good occasion to try this place again; nice little romantic date spot I'd say ;
I'm going to second the idea that the shrimp dishes are a great way to fall for this place on the first visit
I was expecting the great atmosphere of my childhood
KO's is a great place for lunch during the work week
You get to be in a bar in the middle of the day which is great the place isn't crowded and service is prompt and there are a lot of healthy options on the menu
It's the crown and glory of Park Central and the only reason I still consider Park Central an actual place as opposed to the reality of it just being a bad idea
This is great place to grab a few dinners to stick in the fridge for the nights you don't feel like cooking
Fun hidden neighborhood bar with good food and relaxed atmosphere
I am disappointed that my experience here didn't match up to all of the great review this place has gotten I was excited
If you're looking for delicious dim sum--and a good selection of it--try someplace else
Also the tables were cleared quickly once guests left which was especially good because the place was packed and otherwise I would have had nowhere to sit
The atmosphere was great although a bit quiet for a Thursday night I thought
bread pudding If you are looking for a great atmosphere fun night date night  or just a place with flavor
Plus the place is very clean and relaxed Eric was very nice and explained everything so I could understand
This place is in a tiny strip mall that does not look like it gets much business and I would have never seen it from the road so it must be good to still be in business
The place I used to go to had some really good red and green sauces for the pupusas
Also it screwed up the amount I was trying to spend since I had 20$ to spend on the deal chicken which I guess shows that this place is cheap which is good but for this particular trip that wasn't good
I stumbled upon this place in a vacation magazine that gave great reviews & since I was heading down to Scottsdale I thought why not stop by & check it out
I would absolutely recommend this place to friends and family looking for a good place to relax and enjoy some Italian fare
Excellent service great atmosphere and really yummy food
If you're planning a party of any kind this is also a great place to go
Reviews of this place were pretty decent on Yelp but I thought this place was pretty good
In any event the great service at the Scottsdale Whataburger was just one facet of what I loved about the place
Since they closed the village inn by me I thought this might be a good replacement
And you know even when the place was packed the sight lines were still REALLY good for a venue of this size
And this place really does get some good bands for the price
the atmosphere is very casual and family friendly
The Moist Brisket was super good & moist without being fatty their hotter version Rudy's BBQ Sauce was my favorite of all the local BBQ places I have tried the Green Chili Stew was awesome & the potato salad excellent
We mostly get takeout here but we've eaten in a few times and the dining atmosphere is great
I sometimes wished they had more Cantonese styled dishes but the pho is good and they are the only place in town to get a Durian milkshake
The place is best with just you and someone that you want to pounce on super romantic however they are kind to children as well
Bottom line- Great place to go when you need to satisfy a sweet tooth without overindulging
The atmosphere service drinks and food are great
Not that I'm too good for that but I'm just sayin' there are *those* places

This is a great place to take your family to have someone else do the cooking  and enjoy some wonderful Az style mexican food
So this chaat factory in the back I'd give 4 stars but the place as a whole I'd give 3 as the selection of goods in the store part isn't nearly as plentiful as some other places in the Valley
I love this place and have trouble getting out for less than $100The warranties ae great but I'v never had to use one
I can imagine Gallagher's would be a great place to come for football games or other gimmicky nights
In the end all the service is amazing the atmosphere is wonderful and the staff is great
After not having a good experience at the other place owned by the same person
The food was good but we will never go back to either place not matter how cool the lights in the trees are
I've lived in Central Phoenix for 8 years and have always heard about how great this place was
This place is somewhat pricey $32+ for entrees but it's a great place for a special night out
And if others love it more power to them and I hope it keeps good little ethnic places like Dragonfly open
It's a great place if you are vegan vegaterian or on a strict diet
Tuck is a neat little place   When I arrived with my lovely date we were greated promtly and sat at a nice little 2-top near the back
It's easy to rack up a bill at this place with the entrees but I've heard they have great happy hour deals so check that out
The ambiance was awesome and the people there were great definately check this place out
Everything about this place is great and I will definitely be back
I wouldn't classify Le Chalet as a fondue place where the experience often outshines the food; it's more of a casual cozy spot that serves up thoughtfully prepared comfort cuisine - all the ingredients for a lovely dinner out
Great place to take a date a group or anyone you want to impress
It's a great place for pizza salads sandwiches and pasta's so hope to see you there
Warm spring nights make this a great place to hang out outside
My husband and I love this place good breakfast setting in the nice neighborhood of Scottsdale Ranch
Roberto's has a limited eat-in area and seems to cater mostly to take out and delivery but that certainly doesn't diminish the fact that this place makes great Mexican food
There are SO many good things about this place  GOOD Brews one for every taste great specials on happy hour and food the food is amazing
For what it is - a nice clean modest sized nursery with helpful staff- this place is great
Overall cute but very tiny place that deserves a second visit
But I'm told its a great fancy-shmancy place to go when u want to get laid
Where will these great Servers go when the place closes down
The place was not too brightly lit 5 guys get a clue had nice seats it was clean and had a very good first impression
Summary  Very nice place good food good ambience and just a tad out of the ordinary to be striking
They have all sorts of professional cooking/baking goods that places like BBB will not have
We sat in a great booth/chair combo table and the atmosphere was comfortable without being too pretentious
Great place and I'm glad to see that so many others appreciate it too
This is a place if you like very feminine romantic items
They still have a bar and plenty of tv's and think it likely still a good place to grab an after work libation and catch a game - but only if your part is small - it's not the largest place
This place is great for lunch and we get in and out fairly quick
Now I know that this place is a meat house but if you're gonna charge me 23 bones for my salad bar please make it great
I will say this place is a great alternative to the mall food court
While I'm sure kids are welcome this is a great place to escape the noise of the food court
And while there isn't much to DJ's it's small and all attempts at decorating the place were spared it's a good place to do some serious drinking
But unfortunately all good things must come to an end and this place is no exception
The interior decor and atmosphere were open airy and comfortable and there was a good energy to the room
go to the places with great service and spend your money there
Ahhwhat a great place to watch hear and feel some live music
The environment was kinda noisy probably because we were a group of 14 and the wait staff was kinda slow once again because there were 14 of us but they had a TV playing the knicks game so I was happy being able to watch LINSANITY and the woodfire oven was blazing away for some good ambience
I've never really cared much for this place at all but they've got a great happy hour and the food is mostly decent
I rounded up to 3 stars because of good date nights with the boy here but I wouldn't go out of my way to pay this place a visit
but to be honest even if the wait staff here was horrible I'd still give the place 5 stars because the pizza is that good
SO dangerously goodSo if you want a lively atmosphere with friendly waiters/hostesses and  really creative sushi and some drinks this is the place to go
It's a great place to go for a relaxing yet nice meal or to just have some wine at the bar
This is a great place for dates families out of town guests business breakfasts business lunches catering
It's just a good feeling place and there are so few of them left
They've got a pretty good selection of beers to choose from but the thing that kills this place for me is the service
Heard many good things about this place and went last night for the first time for a dinner I organized with 6 friends
I love finding great local places for breakfast
The menu is pretty typical and it is a good place to take the kids so they can see all the airplanes
I hope the new owners can bring this great neighborhood place up to it's true potential
At places like this I have two main expectations 1 Good beer with lots of it on tap
The service is always good and it's a better place to drink than to eat even the desserts and appetizers are good just not an all-around contender for favorite bar and grill
The only good thing about this place is the location
The people who run this place take great pride in being vegan and not being cruel to animals
Oh gosh there is everything this is a fun place to go especially if you are wanting to try to find some key ingredients to create a great authentic Mexican meal
The food may be good but I wouldn't know since this place asked me to wait for over two hours to be seated for a table for three
This is a great place to come with a group who is open to trying new delights
Definitely relaxing and a good place to bring friends and coworkers
I love this place they always have good records at good prices
This place has a great decor pretty decent prices OK food and it's pretty convenient
If you don't set your expectations too high this is a great place to grab a quick bite or meet with friends family or for business
This place is great as far as local sandwich shops go
It's a little place on the corner that has limited seating and can take a bit longer than a fast food place but that's part of what goes into a good meal
and if you read the bad review it sounds like it could be the guy who owns the place down the street that he is talking about
Indian Delhi Palace has good food good service and an atmosphere that will embrace you like a vampire who feeds off of stress instead of blood
maybe I forgot or maybe it's because I would had felt bad writing my review esp when you have a feeling that a place is just shy of closing its doors
Went in to this place with great expectations and without even bothering to recognize that I was spending a ridiculous amount of money on a cupcake
The fries were tasty and the shake although not as good as some other places was pretty tasty as well
It's a decent place to pop in for a drink and a bite to eat sometimes can get busy but it's good to have places like this in the neighborhood plus it's not a chain - bonus
It's a great place to bring friends to eat and the atmosphere makes for a relaxing environment as Jimmy Cliff Steel Pulse or The Wailers sound from the kitchen
Overall this place is great delicious fresh and affordable with very friendly service
This is definitely a place for people who know and love good sushi and would highly recommend it
Great food great atmosphere nice people and now right in the hoodI wonder if Jim is going to send me a bill for the medical advice
The garden-feel outdoor patio was great - the trees that hung over and created a canopy made it feel very cozy but it wasn't cramped at all
The only improvement this place needs is a Marquee sign to remind us of all the great shows happening on a nightly basis
It was a great place to have a great conversation and enjoy some fantastic wines
Amazing yummy food delightful service and a great little place
First of all the only two bad things about this place are the parking and the wait

I appreciate places that can fix a good meal without drenching it in calories and fat
Overall I would say it would be a good place to check out but if I had one more experience like this one I probably would skip it for other places in the area
It's such a great atmosphere for a casual dinner with a date or friends - you must go

The atmosphere of Citizen Public House is great
I've been trying to find a good chicken and waffles place
Luckily the taste of the spaghetti was still great so i don't regret my decision to wait in this place
I mean the employees are friendly the food is made to order so it's fresh you have the freedom to basically make your own burger and the egg bread that my burger came on was really good which is all great but for a college kid who's got to be financially responsible better overall value can be found someplace else
My first impression based on the line almost out the door was Wow this place must be good
As it is though it's not bad and a decent place for lunch if you don't mind a bit of the 'itis' after some slurping

Inside a bit further there's a lounge area that has a good atmosphere a bunch of bean bag chairs to sit on and it almost begs for a hookah option
Carl's Junior is one of those good fast food places you don't find east of the Mississippi
Parking  It sucks deal with it it isn't as bad as some places
If you're looking for atmosphere possibly for a romantic evening this is your place
I have nothing bad to say about the business it's a great place to grab a quick sandwich close to home but their Italian Sub is not the best one around
The ambience was great  - a little loungey it seemd to me that the staff were outnumbering the  clients most of the time but it  had a friendly open vibe  everyone was gossiping and laughing in Japanese and English and everyone including me seemed to be  having a  very good time
A good stop if you're looking for a local place where you can have an uncomplicated experience

It has a great atmosphere and is good for groups like the one I was in
Sure next year as its a great place to go to check out if you are in the area but part of your regular diet no way
But don't think my review is all about hating the joint it's a great place
This is neither the cheapest place to get frames and lenses nor the one with the most expansive selections; it is however  the BEST place to get them good advice guidance and  a history lesson or two along the way
served by friendly folk; a good number of dishes to choose from; good prices very informal atmosphere even a patio for alfresco dining
Healthy vegetarian friendly good atmosphere and reasonably priced
We didn't subject the poor people to our voices but those who chose to partake created a great atmosphere for us lurkers

Upon discovering this place on line I was instantly intrigued I love wine and the reviews on from my Yelp friends were pretty damn good
I want to give it 1 stars but I give them 2 because 1 is really saved for the terrible places and besides they were able to prepare the food relatively quick *for better or for worse*  Also it's probably because I'm in a good mood because we have inflight wifi
he said everything went swimmingly but after 12 hours of holding someone's life in his hands he too was in need of a retoxWe agreed that it was time to go see The CountessI've seen a bunch of glowing reviews on good ol' Yelp and as I always do when I read the praise heaped on a particular place by my Yelp brethren and sistren I thought I'll be the judge of that
Their breakfast burritos are also pretty good  For what it offers this is a good place to buy your groceries--just don't go into it expecting the variety of goods you may see at Fry's

It's a cute place but our waiter was sarcastic to a point it was not funny
The atmosphere It's very casual and friendly

Chic and trendy du00e9cor small and intimate playing cult favorites such as Goonies and Edward Scissorhands on albeit very ill-placed screens great second-story views a very post-downtown work crowd

The service was friendly and the atmosphere made me feel like I was back in time at a cute little dinner but with a modern twist

The service was pretty good even though the place was packed
It's a good place to take someone who hasn't ever really tried sushi before or people who are scared of sushi
Great place to take architectural buffs or HGTV fans
I loved the look and the feel of the place and it seems like it would be a great place to hangout during the evening hours
The service was just fine and the food was good but theres really nothing about this place that moves the mark for me
The problem with the old location was size and that has definitely been resolved with the new place having tons of tables and good elbow room
The coffee is good and the whole place has a great roasting aroma

You can order sangria by the liter my wife keeps wanting to go they have live flamenco dancing my wife likes the good the ambience feels Spanish and they play upbeat flamenco music in the background

I have a good friend who grew up in Maui and when I would fly out to visit her when they moved out to the southwest her Mom would occasionally cook up a dish but that was the extent of my experience with the cuisine outside of a few places in town
The atmosphere is interesting- a mix of well-dressed business and retired people think khaki pants button up shirts sweater vests in the winter; nurses just off work; people coming in for happy hour jeans and nice shirts; and people just in off the street shorts casual shirts even hats
Woodchuck Amber Ciderwoodchuck granny smith ciderBTW there are lots of TV's & on game nights football especially the crowd really gets into it which I think makes it fun lol BUT if you are looking for romantic you might want to go to a place with less tv's or none ;

I've heard lots of good things about Luci's over the past few years and had it on my mental checklist of places to go and check out here in the valley of unique and cool places
Walking in the atmosphere is calm and relaxed
I love this place its great to curve pizza cravings without having to order a whole pizza and its great when you are with a group and they can't agree on what type of pizza to order here they can get whatever they want
so that probably explains why I actually like the placeThe Beautiful Carin and I wandered over for dinner the other evening as you can see I am a little bit behind on writing my little review-like storiesWe have been a number of times over the years because when you live in Old Town Scottsdale Bandera is* Close* Pretty Decent Food* Close* Pretty Good Martinis* CloseWe generally go to Bandera in the summer and fall when the crowds are gone and they seem almost pathetically happy to see us walk through the doorI do enjoy the corn bread
I'm kinda bummed that this place lived up to the bad reviews

I rarely give 5 stars but lord this place was good and brought me back to my latina roots

Whenever an owner cares enough to be there and watch out for the place and assist I think that is always a good sign
This place seems fairly new but the atomsphere is classy/casual well at the hour that we went and pretty laid back
Although this place is new they seemed to have great reccomendations and suggestions on waht was popular off the menu
I thought it was a great atmosphere with people and ate some great food
If you live in this part of Glendale you probably know that not too many places have employees who smile or seem happy but this Starbucks has hired some good people it seems

My gf who's eaten at the little Italian family places in Pennsylvania says this place is every bit as good; I know the food's awesome
The food wasn't health conscious at all but if you're looking to fill up with calories and get a good-sized portion then this is your type of place
But that helps to keep this place really laid back and casual

The fries were also great which is an accomplishment since most places screw those up and aside from being a bit behind the times on payment systems it was an enjoyable lunch spot overall
Good quality fish selected for the sushi and everything blended together nice it didn't taste like eating rice seaweed and fish seperately like other places
On a weekend afternoon the place isn't nearly as busy as you'd expect it to be and even though there are lots of lights and noise and little kids running amok it's not too bad
IMO this has become more of a place to see-and-be-seen -- not savor good gelato

I highly recommend this place especially if you want a casual yet classy place to grab a drink
I hope that it can hang in there because it is a great place for lunch
A modern sushi place located in a condo building in downtown Phoenix speaks a great deal to the development of downtown and I give kudos and an extra star to the owners of Moira for opening where they did
Do not let the small size fool you this place is great
I do agree that the bathrooms are not the best but I don't pass up good places simply because of the bathroom
There are not to many options in downtown Phoenix however this place has a great variety
The open restaurant concept keeps the place lively as there is always a good crowd soaking in the fresh air at the open bar or on the patio
Lots of activities to keep different people coming in for a look-see and a great place to come if you need to buy a gift for a pickier
Not one of the places I would take out-of-towners and rave about but a great little spot to hit for lunch
I will definitely be back here close to home and finally a place with good prices
Laid back fun marketplace atmosphere with great food
It's a great place for happy hour sushi which happens to be every day of the week from five to seven and even til close on Mondays
Ok so I WAS going to give this place 4 stars maybe even 5 but after having a great b-fast there last week I thought I would take all of my family who is in town this week to b-fast there this Sunday
The place is clean and has a very relaxed atmosphere and the Food Network on the flatscreen at the bar during lunchtime
As a part of the greenbelt it's a great place for a quick stroll or a bike ride
But this place will continue to be busy as it looks nice and it's in a great location
I have been to great places with tacky decor but in this case the food did not impress
This is a fine place - the prices are decent for the amount of food you get it tastes pretty good and the menu is quite vast for a deli
Although it is not gourmet it is a place where I could always get a great meal for a great price served by a wonderful staff
This is one of those places I had to sadly say goodbye to when I left Phoenix
This would be a great place to take someone on a date
I would like to meet their buyer - that must be fun to stock that placeThey do a pretty good job on the detailing as well
-Reminds me of self-serve froyo places at home and the only thing unique about this place in my opinion is the strawberry boba but other than that I feel like it's nothing spectacular but it's good overall if you're craving froyo sweet or tart at your mall
One great item that I have not see any other place are the glass drinking jars that have lids so these glasses turn into great tupperware without the carcinogens being released when placed in the microwave
A good place to buy furniture after your Target/Ikea days are over
Straight up authentico feel to the place not a whitey around and just some really smelly in a good way grub sizzling away there is a sneeze guard but behind it you can see all the various types of meats they offer from Carnitas to Pastor I was in hog heaven
As soon as I walked in I kind of knew right away this wasn't a good place for families to eat especially if you have children the place is extremely small and set up a tad too fancy
Good place to be even when it was 110 degrees in there for the ASU-Georgia game earlier this year
The service is always great as is the atmosphere
Lunch specials are also good and it's a great place for a work lunch
Only reason I gave this place three stars was because I have not tried the food yet BUT I will say this place is a good place to stop by and go to the bar for a few rounds of sake bombers
This is a great new neighborhood place and worth visiting
The atmosphere is great clean modern lines and very trendy setup
The place looks pretty good slightly nostalgic with guitars motorcycle parts and old articles on the tables
This airport desperately needs a good place and people are willing to remember it
Tons of places to park friendly staff and this location is within shopping great places to eat and freeways
There are many great Mexican places in Scottsdale so skip this one
I heard great things about this place and was super hopeful but it didn't knock my socks off
The atmosphere wasn't great very dark then with a blinding spotlight on our table
Within walking distance so I didn't have to move my truck this place seemed to have the greatest appeal based on reviews
Considering we arrived with the after game crowd I think we got really good service and I would say at it's peak the restaurant inside was about 2/3 full and dwindling as we were thereOverall it is not a bad place and I would go again if invited but I want to try some other places in the area too on my infrequent trips downtown
An experience is only as good as the staff and the atmosphere of the store you're in and Paris Envy has both mastered
North Scottsdale is not at a loss for good steak places
Of course good food jeez let me get to that but as far as elemental funtastic vibes are concerned this place hits the mark on many points
Not a fancy pretentious place just consistently great food
The place looks great but it is not what I would necessarily describe as comfortable
Either way nothing bad about the place but nothing that will have you pining to return year after year assuming you're not a fan of the teams that play there
Still a good place to watch games because they have better tvs than other sports bars
The Jungle as we call if for short is one of my favorite places to go for a cheap healthy casual meal
We finally stop by on a Sunday evening; to our very surprise this place is VERY GOOD
In short a great place to dine if you don't mind spending a bit of money
The atmosphere is fun with a modern vibe and the frozen yogurt is pretty good
We only had breakfast/ brunch at the Morning Glory so i can't comment on any other feature of the Farm- Cute place; looks like a small family-run farm- loads of picnic tables and as we were driving out around 11a we noticed a long line of cars parked along the gravel - the setting would be great for baby and wedding showers great for groups FoodI had the Gourmet  Wild Mushroom Omelet with a side of sausage- Home fries and Biscuit were a 3*- Omelet was ok with a too-thick hollandaise sauce; 2
I don't understand all of the great reviews of this place
Then we go to the bar to pick up some pitchers of beers not any good beers on tap and the ones they had were super expensive for this dive place
I can't say enough good things about this place
This place gets a solid 4 stars due to good wine decent food and the enjoyable and somewhat surreal time I had there
I have a policy never to Yelp about any place of business unless I have had a bad experience regarding the same issue multiple times
Their pricing is on par with most other places they have a really good jewelry selection and don't do a hard-push up-sell for higher-priced jewelry
The meat was perfectly cooked not chewy like the last sandwich I ordered at another place the coleslaw was so good and flavorful juicy without dripping all over the place
This is a great place for the 'on the budget in a recession' happy hour
The bar area was a great place to have a drink and it is fairly lively
And if you're into MAX this is a good place to go
The place looks like it was taken from the 50's with the cute pink decor and real soda fountain
I picked a bad night to go out as every place was an hour plus wait to get in
Just not the place to go for a good conversation without leaving hoarse
I like good food; I want good food even in a middle of the road place like this
Rula Bula is by no means a bad place to spend a little time but with so many better options around the city I don't know if I'll return
Great food great atmosphere great for your waist line
And the groceries are good too - this is one of the few places in the Valley I can get a Thums Up if you don't know what that is you best find out
Yes the previous reviewers are right not an authentic indian however it is a very good place
I think if you're looking for a quick fix on the East side of town this is a great place to go for a decent bowl of Menudo
The food and atmosphere satisfy everything I look for in a cute neighborhood cafe that is trying to promote not only health but the idea that health tastes GREAT
It's a great place to take kids as they tend to like anything interactive like this
Great place to hang out with a couple of friends and have a glass of wine or two
The yellow tail appetizer was also good but you can find the same at alot of other sushi places around town
I've been going to this Gallaghers for many years it was usually a pretty good place to go and get a decent bite to eat but my last 2 visits have indicated that I need to find a new neighborhood bar
Maybe my expectations were too high after I'd heard so many good things about this place because I can't say I was blown away
The vibe is good the music is great and its usually pretty full which gives it atmosphere points
Also a great place for a workday lunch with co-workers or clients
My girlfriend called a few places and ended up going with Kiwi since they not only offered a low price but they have a good guarantee and an awesome loyalty program
Everyone was very kind not snooty as can be the case in some places in the greater Phoenix area I won't name names
The place was clean calming and comfortable -- what I like to call the three C's of a great spa experience
This place was able to take a tense slightly neurotic workaholic and turn her into a ultra-relaxed go-with-the-flow euphoric-feeling spa girl
Ra is a great place to go if you're looking for a party-atmosphere to hang out with friends and have some sake
I would highly recommend this place on a nice sunny day with a good breeze
Atmosphere was good greeting from hostess was fair and the waitress was very friendly
The place isn't that bad during lunch since I've never came here for lunch before
Service aside I would've given the place 5 stars but the food is too good
Overall I think this is a good place for being way out here where there aren't too many casual places to eat
We will definitely be back for the great burgers and the fun atmosphere
The atmosphere is fantastic for a casual dinner and drinks with wife sig other or friends
I also have bumped LGO to the top of my list of good places to take out of town guests especially pickier eaters
This cute locally owned sub shop is a great place to get a tasty sub
As Chris and Pamela said Greasewood Flat is the perfect place to go for a casual but fun night out
I saw the reviews on Yelp and thought man I have to try this place sounds great I was sourly disappointed with my burrito
90% of the time yes but if you need the food ASAP and are willing to pay $1-3 more than it usually would so you don't have to wait for it to ship out this is a great local place to support
I like a good thin crust pizza & this place fits the bill
Their galbi tang beef short rib soup is also pretty good and is CHEAP at $8 usually 10+ at other places
I so don't usually do places like this but I have to say it's pretty damn good
I am so sick of going to places that are so busy being really cool and overpriced that they forget to give you good food so this place is refreshing- Score Wildflower Bread Company
this place has a good reputation but it is not top notch by any means
no relation but it was that and the great service that kept me from giving this place two stars
The decor is absolutely stunning and a great place to go on those dates/anniversaries/birthdays/whatever days
It's a shame the food is so shitty because this place is in a great location
I read some of the other reviews complaining about how there is no variety and in my opinion that is what makes this place so great
Other bad thing is on the rare occasion when there are other people on the patio it gets kind of awkward because the placement of the tables are so close
So we chose this place it was pretty crowded but it was only thw two of us so it wasn't that bad
Thank you Yoli's for reminding me that there is goodness and deliciousness all rolled into one place right here in Chandler Arizona
What a cute little place to have breakfast
Having moved out to Chandler from Phoenix I was pretty spoiled on good Mexican food there so I had to find some places out here
This was alot of fun and a great way for me to check out many places in Old Town that I have never been
I have heard so many good reviews for this place so who wouldn't try it
I prefer to order carry out - sometimes the delivery takes too long when they get busy and you end up with cold pizza which still tastes great and not rubbery like those places that use cheap imitation cheese blends but when you order fresh pizza eating it hot is just sort of an expectation
We're always looking for places that offer decent to good food at a reasonable price where we can get in and out quickly if need be

We were in the mood for bbq one recent Saturday night and the place we wanted to try only stayed open until 7 so we found this place on yelp and decided with so many great reviews we should give it a try
Pita Jungle is a casual and slightly hip place to enjoy some good Mediterranean food
If you aren't sure what you're in the mood for then BJ's is a good place to go as they have descent food and tons of it
But if you know good sushi you will never want to leave this place
After dinner we asked if there was a casual place to hang out at and he described a bar above the Bloom Room
With so many good restaurants nearby Sandellas right next door I don't think this place will last for long

A good affordable place to ask a favor deliver bad news or just enjoy a good burger
I don't drink anymore but back in the day I got really tore up at Shady's strong drinks good conversation a good place to hang out especially on a Sunday

It gives u a sampling of all that is good at this place
It seems like a great place to relax and I'm looking forward to going there for lunch sometime when I want to take an extended lunch break
This place is in a good location and very busy always So maybe i am missing it
The salad was good size with loads of blue cheese chunks of good quality rather than the generic crumbles served at many places and large pieces of bacon
This place has a great location right outside of Mekong Plaza -- can't beat that
I find this to be a good place for hikers who want gentle well-marked trails and do not want to deal with more strenuous steeper climbs such as would be found in Camelback or Piestewa Peak
I know you're thinking good luck but aside from Fast Food places there are several out there
Great place totally didn't mind that it was a $40 breakfast for two we had a mimosa coffee and oj which added a lot to the bill
They offer a good array of menu items which makes this place a great spot to go before the bars or after
When they first opened and for at least a few years after this was a great place for a date for wine with friends for happy hour for Sunday night music and for wine tasting
great patio seating with outdoor fireplace
If you can get past the sub-par chips and salsa this place is great
This place used to be better but lately it's turning into a bus stop in the not so good section of town
Someone needs to offer the local restaurants an incentive to open up in the airport here there are lots of great places to eat in and around PHX

You know what you're getting into menu-wise for Burger King but the art work is light-hearted and the place is open and quiet which makes a great dining experience for fast food

Great seating and the atmosphere is casual
The place has a great selection of beers
The atmosphere was 4 or 5 star the valet was prompt and polite the patio looked like a comfortable place for drinks and the service was great
The atmosphere was great and so was the food
Great place for bargains as some dealers have been there a while
There are plenty of great pizza places in every city
I made mention of this to the owner who quickly offered to replace the order this is what I call great customer service
but this place is darn good and could compete in SanFran Toronto LA and a few other asian centers known for good food
Probably a good place if someone in the group is afraid of hardcore sushi/sashimi
I like cozy relaxing places and I feel always very relaxed after 2-3 hour dinner there
If you want to take your significant other out for a nice quaint getaway this is a good place to go
However the walk through the grocery portion of this place was great
I couldn't have picked a better place to enjoy a romantic meal with my special valentine
The atmosphere was very comfortable and we didn't have to wait too long so the overall experience was good
With out or tip it was about $7 which was not a great deal for a place as sketchy as this
I looked up and saw the 5 guys sign made a quick turn and decided to go there instead after hearing how great this place was from my East Coast friends
Overall this was a great place to see PPV
Atmosphere is great like other posters have said the people watching is fun
Should have read reviews on this place about BAD customer service
I liked their menu selection upbeat yet relaxed atmosphere free WIFi a must for meetings these days and the self-serve free re-fills on bevies
This is a GREAT gastropub with an atmosphere that sets up a fun night out
Their lunch menu is much more affordable than their dinner one but even then the prices are decent for an awesome meal with great atmosphere
Havana Cafe will always be my favorite place to go for great Caribbean cuisine
It was our first time at a Harkins theater we usually go to the AMC Deer Valley 30 but I think this placed might have sucked us in for good
Great place to shop - I always find myself stopping there on my golf store outings and checking out their new additions
Anybody who likes some good ol' soul food knows this place delivers
As you walk into this place you feel relaxed by the delightful Cuban music playing loud enough to hear in the background
Even after trying a decent number of other Thai places in Phoenix we like Wild Thaiger for the full bar consistently good flavors great service and fun atmosphere and we will definitely continue to come here often
The Great Hall seems like an excellent place to have a gathering and the sculpture garden was also quite lovely though it was surprisingly cold outside today
For the show itself it's a small enough venue that I can't imagine there are too many bad places to hang out and I was close enough to the stage but had enough room around me to keep from feeling claustrophobic
Great place for sub-standard food that is way overpriced
The coffee is still decent because its a Starbucks but the place just is not great
Thank you Mojo for always having a great atmosphere and great fro yo to satisfy my cravings
C  The theatre isnt so bad its just turned into more of a independent movie theatre kind of place
If you want to see how good vegetarian food can be this is THE place to go
However now that I pay rent and all that good stuff I find myself frequenting the cheaper places
It's not that bad of a place its just not that great of place either
The stools hence no place to hang your bag are pinned to the ground so you can't group together with your friends but it's kinda good that way

Overall a very good place for vegetarian Indian food and groceries
If you want good food with friends and family this is your place
As I understand it there isn't exactly a extensive public transportation network in place -- YET -- but this is a great start
Great atmosphere and happy hour menu/prices
ya know this place is so good and so unassuming it's a great find
Good drinks and creative menu in a stylish atmosphere
Basically its a 'good' place to go wine and dine
and the atmosphere can elevate your evening to 'great' status
The service is the real reason this place got a bad review
This is a GREAT place if you like good wine for reasonable prices
I haven't had much luck with chinese places and I must say it was pretty darn good
I'm not bashing the ol' Garden but it isn't fun unique or original- nor does it have great ambiance
The fries were really good too and the place has that old wild west outpost feel to it
It seemed like everyone in the place knew one another which can be a good or bad thing depending on your perspective I was eating alone so felt slightly out of place although the man and woman running the place were both very courteous and friendly
However I do think that if you want to feel like you are eating a homemade sandwich in a friend's kitchen this would be a good place to go
Overall good service good safe food and a relaxed atmosphere
It's a great place for beginners who haven't had sushi before as they probably won't have had much experience with better sushi and won't need to pay too much for just a taste
Whether the food is good or bad one has to appreciate a place where the owner all-too-conspicuously wanders about the dining area during peak times visiting with the guests monitoring the staff and demonstrating her full control over the operation
It was a great place to hang out on a late summer night
Great location hip place lots of eye candy and Sushi Roku which I cannot wait to try sometime awaits
There are so many good authentic Mexican places in this area but this burrito would probably top them all
Like its siblings Fez and Switch Ticoz offers terrific food in a hip but casual atmosphere perfect for a work lunch or night out
You get great food great atmosphere good service parking a little bit of a challenge but I live right across the street so I just walk
I'm giving this place 2 stars because the atmosphere is romantic service was great and the wine was delish
I would definitely go back to this place if you are in the neighborhood or even if you're not it is great
I've never been to a Vietnamese place that I loved if it had nice decor or great service
Its all good in the hood because the food is still good and the service is never mediocre and the atmosphere keeps me happy and comfortable
Smoking is not allowed which as a non smoker is cool however the smokiness removed from a good dive bar kind of ruins the atmosphere in a way
Nice Decor and a good hangout place not too formal and not too expensive
The place has a trendy look with b'ful decor friendly staff not a place where you would want to be in your flip flops has a small dance floor  and good music as well
We picked this place with the hopes of a good location for our spring training visit and access to some good golf
This place proved to be a great value great location and a very comfortable well-run place to stay
The Place isn't bad but it isn't my favorite either
You know I feel kind of bad for giving this place a two star review because I really liked our server but as far as food goes I can't be that generous
I was ready to love this place and all it's kitschy decorations but the food was just not nearly good enough
Inside the orange walls help to create a casual yet funky industrial feel that reminded me of a few places Ive tried in SoCal
Atmosphere was great lots of red lots of latin hipsterness
Their pizza is not bad by any means but they are more expensive than comparable quality places IMO

After several places closed between 2008 and 2010 good food was getting harder and harder to find in 85259
It's in a great neighbosrhood and I think they have made the most of the parking space they have - I've never really viewed the popularity of this place as a negative
Two For such a busy place I think they do a great job with customer service
The place is a shite hole their rolled tacos are over priced and not so good
Tucked into the Firesky Resort this is a great place to grab a business lunch or casual date without all the public hoopla of other Scottsdale restaurants
The french dip was GOOD tasty beef slices and au jus was perfect normally I think most places makes it salty
Overall not a bad place to go just bring some water
We walked in and I could immediately see what the Best of people saw in the place a small smokey sports bar with great specials on draught beers pool tables dart boards and karaoke
I didn't go back until fall had really kicked in and I have gone 4 or 5 times since once the heat stops being an issue great to bring a blanket and cozy up when it's cold this place is actually really cool
From atmosphere to food and service it was a great dining experience
While I concur with many fellow reviewers that the place did not bowl me over and was a bit pricey I did have great service and good food overall
More indoor seating would be nice and bar stools would be a great place to sit if you are waiting for your sandwich to be prepared
The staff also did a good job of not cross contaminating my bowl with someone elses I've been to places like this before where once your stir fry hits the grill it gets passed around like a lady of the night and you usually don't get back quite what you handed them
I do wish these places would post a handful of sauce recipes on a board I've been notoriously bad at over or under seasoning my noodles in the past
Great place and we had a great time to match
Really good ethnic places outside of the Italian/Chinese/Mexican/American mold are a treasure here in Phoenix
While the food is good and the service is quick if not a tad over-bearing I think this place needs some tweaks
The atmosphere was as I expected although I was a little surprised that some people dressed more casually than I would have expected
This has been a place on my bucket list to check out and I was pleasantly surprised by a romantic date night here last Friday with my bf
When this place came to Goodyear I was stoked
Servers are prompt and polite and smile even if they're having a bad day unlike at most mom 'n pop places
Would I stop by to see what Thomas has for great places to visit and dine
They had weekly lawn and garden service which was great although it came on Monday mornings and started around 7am so it was hard to sleep in
Their selection is not as good as someplace like Tinder Box in Ahwatukee but decent nonetheless
I'm told that this place is great if you like a large variety of toppings
This shopping center desperately needed another great place to dine and drink with friends and family
Yes I know the staff is eccentric grungy and not super friendly but the prices are good and there is plenty of places to sit and chill kind of like a coffee shop equivalent to a dive/neighborhood bar
Pls go to sushi Ken that is really the only good place for good ramen
Penzey's is a great place to go when you know that you want to make something special but you're not entirely sure what
It is a great place to grab a bite and a brew while enjoying local live music
This is a great place to grab a cup of coffee tea or Italian soda and invites one to stay and relax
This place is still really good however the other locations taste a tad bit better
It is a great place for a fresh dinner that's not fried in grease
Tasteful atmosphere with a great patio a cozy bar area with stylish mood lighting a sleek dining room outfitted with red leather chairs leafy potted plants and mirrors along the saffron-colored walls
All in all great place highly recommended
If you live in the neighborhood this is a great place for a romantic dinner although I warn that it is also family and therefore kid friendly
This place is nothing special to look at located on a pad in a strip shopping center but the food is very very good
I can't give it a 5 simply because eventhough the food is good and the prices are on par with many other places waiting 35-45 minutes for a sandwich is insane
Unfortunately--I will not be going back to breadfruit--the food was generally good--but I would rather spend my dining dollar in someplace the recognizes that it is so easy to accomodate simple requests and the benefit to do that is repeat customers
If you're looking for a delicious cafe/diner type of breakfast/lunch place with good prices then go to First Watch in midtown Phoenix

I love drifting and browsing through this place looking for great book CD and DVD titles
Hut to me is just not too endearing but then again I have been to some cutesy Thai named places to be very underwhelmed with the food
I was excited to try this place out after reading all the good reviews but torn about whether I like this place or not
So if you are a  golfer and looking for a great place to go after your round stop by
It's a good place to go with a group because of all the options
If anything this place smells amazing and has a ton of cute things to gift to people
So diners I still consider this place a good choice for authentic foods
Plus there are many great places in the vicinity to visit after stuffing your face with happy hour sushi
Overall this place is great - you get plenty of food for your money and it's fresh and pretty healthy
Definitely a great place for dinner with friends or even those pesky in-laws

Pita Jungle is one of those few places where it is difficult to blow it everything is good healthy and affordable
When restaurant week rolls around it's a great time to try a place you might avoid based on cost alone
Price was good place was clean and people seemed happy
However if a burger is about the meat and the bun then this place has got the goods
Ok so I came back here because I got another deal I don't think this place is good enough to go without some kind of deal
The quality is good and the place is always clean
there are lots of places for them to play and the kids menu looked good and was very reasonably priced $3 for a PBJ
I was lucky enough to find this place which I noticed had fairly good reviews on Yelp
A place can never be cool enough to excuse bad service
-The atmosphere--blue and green tones while still being warm-The friendly service-The close proximity to light railHere's what we don't like as much-The slow service sometimes it gets kind of bad I feel like you have to be an active restaurant goer and hail down your server--otherwise you may never get to order get more water/another drink or get your check-When happy hour ends I mean who likes that anywhere
Minus the 20 page menu and bad reputation for being overpriced and not that good I kinda like this place
But if you're there this place is pretty good
Its not just a great bar its not just a great place to see sports its got GREAT food and at a great price
Here is my rundown* #14 Bootlegger Club = very good and the meat looked to be less processed than some other sandwich places
Every time I've gone the food has come out quickly and the water has been replaced quickly but man it's so good I really have no problem waiting for it while I suck on a margarita
It's definitely a great place to socialize with friends and have a good time in a hip fun atmosphere
It's a great place for lunch or dinner take out for 1 because they have the 2 slices 1 soda for $5 or so
This is also a great place to watch sports as they have lots of screens that give a good view just about everywhere you sit but outside on the patio
I ordered my regular ice coffee with measured instructions and it tasted typically good like from other coffee places I've visted
Hard not to appreciate this place when they give you reasonably good sushi for such a reasonable price
Half the place is very casual and the other half which has a rockin wine bar is really nice
They have these great oversized couches a fireplace and a small music venue
I've never been a big falafel fan at most places it seems really dry to me but theirs is not dry yet not greasy has a good flavor and is complimented nicely with the tahini sauce
I had a friend from out of town in Peoria on business and we were looking for a good place to meet in the middle
I suggested we check this place out since I heard good things
This place has a great selection between draft and bottles and the prices are not bad either
They have an okay wine list and a great staff but I think what I really liked about it was the very mellow cozy feel and it's atmosphere
Without one glance at the menu it had everything I needed to call it a great place
If you value good service and a relaxed atmosphere it's worth checking out
Plus it definitely a great place for happy hour dinner and watching a game
If you're looking for a romantic atmosphere with candles on the table and light jazz music in the corner look elsewhere
This place was almost really good but where they failed they failed on such a huge level
Super-casual place in a very small re-used house
Love the boutique feel the colors the furniture the great atmosphere the art the pool the rooftop
The place is cute but others are right when they say there is a weird smell
I thought that was lame but I digress the coffee was good I liked the milky flavor and I liked that their sizes were a bit more generous than other places for the same price
I ate here with my sis n her hubby bubba it was good i have not ate at one of these places for a long time i skipped over pizza section of the menu and had the jambalaya not sure how to spell it but it was good could of been spicier i prefer mine with rice instead of pasta either way it was yummy to scarf down like i hadnt eaten for a week also had some appetizer items asparagus n arugula salad light n yum n some guac n chips also fresh and tasty and some egg rolls of some sort also on the app menu they were too effin good
I purchased a Groupon to the restaurant a month or so ago and am glad that I did because otherwise may not have noticed this cute place amongst it's neighbors in the strip mall
While I appreciate that the restaurant is more casual than some Italian joints I've been to a dimmer switch on the overhead lights could do wonders for the atmosphere
We noticed a lot of pizzas being picked up for takeout and both thought the bar looked like a cute little place to come have a drink and a bite sometime
If you want to go to a great zoo then the Phoenix Zoo is the place to go
Instead we found it virtually empty which is not usually a good sign especially for a place so centrally located in Old Town Scottsdale
Definitely a great little place that specializes in olive oil and other olive related products that are produced from pesticide free hand harvested Arizona olives
Its a great location with plenty of places to eat lunch around them after your cut and shave
Even though we did go to a rained out game  it was still such a great place to watch the Giants play
It's a good place to hit at some point during your night on Mill
The music is always good even if you've never heard of the song the performers are phenomenal the drink prices aren't awful and it is one of the best places to people watch on Mill Ave
After dinner we relaxed for a bit on their patio complete with fireplace and the most comfy patio chairs I've ever sat in see picsI spent nearly a $100 on my dinner alone but it was worth every delectable bite~
If you want a Scottsdale vibe with overpriced drinks and unauthentic food then this is not the place for you but if you want home flavor cooking with fresh ingredients with an authentic smile then don't miss trying out this great new hot spot
For an Asian market of modest size this place has a lot of good-quality stuff - sweet-potato noodles fresh produce dried seaweed salted shrimp paste Asian condiments galore
and is dog friendly alot of place to walk your dog on grass that could explain for the 90 percent occupancy but they have bad customer service the apartment is 26 year old but it has been renovated but  it is still a 26 year old apartmentIf you have a dog than its great great dog park
Great place to dine if you're ever in the downtown Scottsdale area
If you like good margaritas and good food than this place is perfect
A great relaxing atmosphere on the patio with margaritas that go down
Cool place nice atmosphere and good food to top it off
Me notsomuch into sports but for a nice sit down lunch this place is a good value for money
Unique atmosphere friendly service very good pizza and fresh peanuts that you can throw on the floor
Its a great place to watch the game grab some grub for happy hour or day drink outside on Sundays
Morning afternoon or night Zipps is a great place
I set up an appointment for installation of some Pirelli tires to replace some BF Goodrich tires that were driving me nuts as they were showing cupping wear
I'm totally thrilled with the service I got the replacement certificates and was driving on the road and there was little roar and they handle great
This is truly a great place to enjoy it all and it gets you out of the heat
I tried their garden burger without the cheese or hot sauce and was amazed at how good it was
Pulled up to a mini-strip mall with a Circle K and a unisex hair salon which created great interest for us because we love off the beaten path kind of places
It's romantic ambiance is nicely done a place to come with a date to have a glass of wine
The charm of this building is what originally attracted me to the place but the great drinks and setting is what will keep me coming back
If you're going to Vegas with the girls this is a great place to get bright disco-like shirts baubles and jewels but other than that I'd say skip it
The service and atmosphere is great and the managers/owners make us feel quite welcome and wanting to go back
To sum it up if you want some good food cheap with the risk of getting killed in a drive by shooting then this is your place
ly/5UJHERI would give this place a 5+ if their WiFi connection was better and they offered a selection of vegan baked goods
THE GOODWhile staying at the Hilton Garden Inn Cowboy Ciao was recommended to us
The atmosphere is very casual and there are a dozen Best of Phoenix awards up on the wall
This is just the type of hole in the wall type of place where you can always count on a cold beer in a frosted mug and some really good options when it comes to really unhealthy food that rocks
Well i just have nothing bad to say about this place at all
but overall its a great place for phoenix to hang out with friends at and warm up before going elsewhere
We were the only two people in the place and would have thought that the owner to make a good impression and show gratitude for what business he did have might have come by the table to ask how the food is make small talk or anything
Get out of your car walk up to the hole in the wall place your order wait 10 minutes grab your goodies and drive away
Always enjoyed the atmosphere which has not changed usually the wait staff is competant but the food was always great
The bad~ the service in this place is soooooo slow
The inside looks like Mexico the food wasn't very good and the cafeteria/microwave issues pretty much summed up this is not a place for a nice night out dining
This is one of those places that you wish no one knew about because it is so good you want to keep it to yourself
Really fun place to go to with great food
just not worth it with so many other great places to choose from
The place is cute as a button inside and out with a quaint down home cozy atmosphere that you just don't get from a national chain restaurant
I have other places I like more but this was a good restaurant
The place is tiny very relaxed-hip looking and right on Central Ave
Hot spots- They have laid out this place perfectly from the great wine tasting location right by the cheeses
The atmosphere is great both inside and outside
Won't be back and with all the good options in town for excellent Mexican food I was sad that we did not find a good new place to frequent
The place is cute and clean and feels very relaxed
Only downside is that this is not a place for eye candy so bring a chatty girlfriend or someone you can enjoy great food and convo with
The next time you're in the mood for cholesterol count busting goodness be sure to check this place out
Overall the hotel is a nice place and they usually have good room rates
Some of the menu items sounded good so we chose Babbo's over some of the other Italian places in town
This place had good reviews and was right down the street from our hotel so we came in for breakfast
A great place to get your car washed and detailed
Good lord this place was lame on a Saturday
The place is small probably seats 50 max the service was great
As a Sports Bar this place is pretty good
We agree with Ashley's review that Su Vino would be a great place to host a party
Service was good nice atmosphere and reasonable prices
SO CUTE SO CUTE SO CUTE SO CUTE SO CUTE SO CUTEMy first impression after being in Frances Vintage was Wow this place is really sparse and not all crammed with crap and good light
It's a great place I feel is trying to improve and I applaud the option of Vegetarian dishes and all low calorie body happy foods
Burrito was pretty good and more importantly  viable to eat and drive with  who says texting is the greatest danger out thereD  which is a skill that most ____ Bell places can't remotely conceive of with a third of the contents
In the end iKitchen really isn't a bad place but I would rather go to Republic Ramen
Sweet Pea did not like the layout because the place gets quite busy and there is no organized line nor even a really good area for everyone to stand in
but the food was just icky and the Place smelled bad
If you want good vegetarian/vegan food and don't want to spend this much or deal with the cramped atmosphere go to Green
From simple chips to salads to the amazing chicken sandwich I ate I can't find one bad thing to say about them The decor in the lovely place is stark and white and very contemporary
Go play some games with your friends it works well for that but get ready for louder than decent atmosphere with below average service and a great feeling of vertigo from the obnoxious music pumping in the air and you have pretty much a picture
Great place to start your drinking and driving days seen people do that there
The place seems okay the Realtors said they felt it was good and would try the other one that's in the area to see how it was
I think it would be a good place and would try the other dishes as well as come back some evening to see how it is
The outdoor bar is a great place to watch sports on TV
It is becoming one of our go-to places for a great meal - brunch lunch dinner or dessert - Chelsea's has it all
It isn't the biggest and it doesn't always the best selection but Citadelle Plaza Farmers Market is still a great place to shop
Go to First Watch for consistent food great service and a clean bright atmosphere - yes it's a chain and yes it's in a stripmall but if you look beyond that it's perfectly fine
The atmosphere was great and the service was top notch and timely
So many excellent points  absolutely gorgeous accommodations polite and helpful staff excellent restaurant breakfast/ brunch outside with a delicious cup of coffee is a must a great spa and a relaxing atmosphere
Organ Stop is a great place for having a fun evening with a group
The service is great the owner always remembers exactly what I like to order  the atmosphere is very casual
Don't let the run down strip mall and the location right next to a DES office turn you off; good food keeps this place going
The atmosphere was another great part of our experience
Bottom-line I'd pass on this place if I were you- there's lots of good Mexican restaurants around here more deserving of your business
Resort management should really re-think about playing some great house-music to get this place hopping
So with all the great reviews I am almost afraid to add my poor review of this place
We are only here for a few days but we may come back this place was great
While I was waiting for my food which wasn't long it was done pretty quickly I took a good look at the place
All in all the meal was good and while the service was slow I think it might have just been a fluke where our table was forgotten for awhile plus the atmosphere was pleasant so it was still nice
I was there for a conference and that is where they served us lunch but I also think it would be a great place for an evening cocktail party or somewhere just to hang out and read during the day
They are also a good place to take the kids since they bring out gold fish as soon as you are seated
It just might be very well my new favorite quick food place It aint no fast foodI likeVery niceEugeneEdit Been there a bunch more times and its always good
Posh is a great place I love the concept of telling a trained Chef what you love and what you really want to try and having that Chef create something just for you
Their fresh breads are an integral part of what makes this a great place to get sandwiches
I'd say this place is catering to an American palate so I thought it was bland and not as well executed as I thought it should be
95 for some seriously good authentic pho at that hole in the wall place across from MCC but hey I guess you pay extra for the atmosphere and location just don't expect the food quality to match the price point
delicious good ambience & unique place
I heard the reviews about how great this place was and had a completely different idea in my head as to what this place was going to be like
Great place to take a date or just pop in for a nice dinner on a Tuesday
I always love it when a place has a small menu of things that they do great rather than an extensive menu of things they do just OK
There's really not too much bad to say about this place they serve great fresh sandwiches for a pretty reasonable price
Sundays 1/2 priced bottles of wineRetro modern spacious designTasty pretzel buns n' brew combinedAre simply divineDidn't like the crabmeat and artichoke dipFlavor was out-stripped By competing with the spicy pita chipsWill be back to try moreAfter all there's a new menu to exploreAnd plenty more beer to pourHope I don't pass out on the floorA great place to flirtTo hear the latest dirtIn the women's restroomWho's dating whom
There is a large # of shoes but there isn't a lot of size options this place is great if you wear a size 7
I feel kinda bad updating because the owner seems really nice and our crappy BBQ platter was comped we didn't even complain about it she must have just known it was bad but I have to because of how much I raved about this place before and how much it has changed
It's a good place to grab a strong margarita before heading over to the movies or something
This place is TINY but in the cutest homey kind of way
It's a great place to take east coasters and an even better place to take someone on their power hour
It was a nice evening so we chose to sit in the outdoor patio area - great atmosphere with twinkling lights little fire pits going and a guy playing guitar and singing in Spanish
After seeing all the great reviews I had been wanting to try this place for some time
The bad jokes and cheesy Italian don't fit with everything else this place is trying to do
It's not that places like Eliana's and Salvadoreno are bad
My favorite places to go are ones that have a good bar -have some drinks appetizers and good conversations with friends
The atmosphere is intimate and quiet so this makes for a good date spot but the service was inexcusable
My partner should be the one writing this review but since he doesn't have a yelp account it's up to me to let you know how incredibly bad this place is
The service is as good as most of the Marriotts but that's about the only good thing I'll say about this place since I'm comparing it to other Marriotts in the same class
This place is good for vegans and non vegans that want to try it and decide for themselves but mostly just vegans
My husband and I have been looking for a place where the food is good and has a great atmosphere and we definitely found it here
His ideas are great but the one staff member ruins it for the whole place
QuikTrip QT is the result of Ray Kroc assembly-line ingenuity great selection and a clean atmosphere
It's a really great atmosphere and there was an amazing live band and I even liked the light-up menus but the service killed it for me
This place has a good selection of signature pizzas
Great place to hang out with friends go on a date or have drinks for happy hour
My recommendation would be to drive to the locations in either Chandler or Tempe Marketplace for the same great deals free parking and a super nice and friendly staff to assist you
The great selection of artisan products and unique gifts - back in December I found some amazing stuff over lunch to give to some of my friends and family for ChristmasIf you are any of the following I'd recommend checking LGO out-Coming in from out of town and looking for a breakfast or lunch spot that's more of a destination-A local resident that wants a place to hang out on a lazy weekend morning-Someone who works nearby and has the opportunity to take a leisurely lunch If not skip the drive and look for a local place that isn't as overhyped or crowded
The place is located in a renovated older home and I think they've done a great job
Given it's location Hula's is a good place to go but don't expect to be blown away by the food
It is a great place and I really wish it was busier
Yes it looks fun yes it's great atmosphere yes there's much to see yes
The pro shop isn't anything to write home about and there's little for food other than bottled drinks and chips but overall this is a great place to spend time
If you are going with your family it is a great place to stay
Really instead of spending all that time trying to make your place look like Jersey and NYC spend that time practicing making good food
I'm gonna have to go against the grain a bit here - I wanted SO badly to love this place
If you want some really good sushi you have to check this place out
Overall the service was good the atmosphere was nice and the food was very tasty
and all was good until I left the place and my toes were sticking to my shoes since the liquid soaked through anyways
but for those of you who do I hope I can help shed light on a place where you may or may not get good service
The setting is really initimate as many have said in their reviews and it'd probably be a good place to bring a date or catch up with old friends
It is pretty dark though so maybe it's also a good place if you're nervous to talk to the person you're going with because maybe it'll be an easier setting to talk since you don't really see each other even with candle light
Great place for people watching conversation with a friend and the surfing the interwebs
this place is another trendy flamboyant read Gay owned restaurant that serves good drinks offers trendy waiters that pretend they are the food version of a Sommelier and act like they have a PhD in food and know so much more about chicken enchiladas than you do so for the average Joe white dude in Phoenix they are impressed by this
I am at the Z a lot this time of year---it is the place I always take out of town guests to get a taste of southwestern food that is not the standard fare and there is a patio to enjoy the great weather
Good Tex-Mex in the Phoenix area - little family-owned place near Old Town
The movie theater is a fabulous place to meet friends for a Sunday matinee and the pet store has arguably the cutest puppies on the planet - always
This place is super cute with all the lights outside fire pit little water fall/fountains for the birds to play in
The food always comes out fast and the service is usually pretty good; someone will usually offer to refill your drinks which is nice for a fast food-type place
You'd think that dealing with Qwest would deserve a greater payback but I'd been wanting to try this place since the Weekly Yelp that mentioned their peanut butter milkshakes
Agree with everyone else here that the atmosphere was great
The place is never in good shape but the course is fun it's cheap and appropriate for the advanced player or a beginner
A great place for 3-6 peep sized groups but they place easily gets full
They also were really expensive / This place is not good enough for the price I dont think but it was a nice experience
Ok is a good description of the place it's not bad but not good either it's just there and by there I don't mean a place that I think I'll have a desire to return to
this place has a nice patio when it's not 110 and humid outside and a good open feel inside that's quite nice at first glance
this place looks good has a good menu and a good patio what's the downfall
The ambiance of the restaurant was cool and the pizza was good but with horrible service its hard to support this place
I hate cooing over how cute places are but the Farm is SO CUTE
Great just what I need another place that I am getting hooked on like it was crack that does take out
We were pleasantly surprised at how good  the chicken isThey have no parking lot or waiting room you wait outside for a place to sit
Anyway this is a fondue place and what was supposed to be good was excellent
Chino Bandido is a place that is a great idea and pretty darn good
If you're with good company you make the atmosphere
This is a really great place to go for a date b/c it is so cheap and intimate
The place is clean the service was great and everybody was very friendly
This place has to be one of the nest values in The Valley- inexpensive with great food and desserts extremely clean and with excellent service
Clean place good service good energy not so great food
Great place to spend the evening with your family
Scale of 1-10 multiple visits8 Food9 *DRINKS*8 Service8 Atmosphere7 ValueDon't underestimate the power of a good Marg
It looks like a great place to grab a bite or a beer while the kids are doing skate night
The place is cute and when you look at the menu you can't help but be get excited to go there the first time
I can't figure out HOW we made such a mistake with this place with such good reviews
I've heard good things about this place so a holiday mixer was a perfect reason to stop in
When I entered I immediately noticed the indoor/outdoor bar area and thought it would be a great place to grab drinks on a sunny afternoon
Maybe I caught this place on a bad night but my friend and I were left greatly disappointed
We had great expectations after eating at Delux multiple times that this place just did not live up to
This place probably has a good taste potential
I walked out of this place thinking 2 stars but on reflection am giving it three for the tamale and the good service
This was by far one of the best places I've tried and I'm always seeking good places to eat
Cooperstown is a funny little establishment and a great place to go occasionally or on special occasions
There aren't many mini golf courses around the area at least that I know of and while this place is a little dated its still a great place to come
This is definitely a casual place which I really like but if you're looking for a posh trendy place this probably isn't for you
Now when I'm buying underwear at Target I have a place to pop in for a quick pint of some good beer
So getting good beer at a Tempe Marketplace is a great thing
I really wanted to like this place and maybe it was because I didn't get the pho but the quality of the food was just bad
This is worth the drive if you live in Phoenix & are looking around on yelp for a good Thai place
If you try it email DDD and see if you can get them to show up this is a great place and one of the only places that has a local smoker onsite BIG PLUS
The place seems to have a more relaxed cool vibe
The open eating/kitchen environment makes it a great place to get a corner table and watch
This is a nice sub place they have the basics but nothing out of the ordinary actually a little low in the selections but good enough
Is it a good sub place yeah a little above the average chain but still a chain
Good place if you are looking for a better subway
I figured a classic carne asado taco dinner would be a good barometer for gauging the place
The ambience is great the bar is great -- it really should be well great
It was a cute lil area with a few tables a ping pong table couches & a fire place for colder weather
The service was top notch and even though we were seated in the middle of a very busy dining room the atmosphere was good it never got too loud nor did it really feel crowded
A great place to start the evening or bring a date
My boyfriend and I are always on the hunt for good sushi places and were thrilled when we stumbled upon this place
I can't say enough good things about this place
This place was about as bad as an airport bar and restaurant can get
The place is minimal and nothing special but what does make this special is their staff and of course their food it is not great but just good enough to fulfill your need of Buffet Chinese Food they have many selections i would have to say about 20 different offerings i have never seen any buffet offer Egg Foo Young and that was such a great treat only because i love the dish
It's a great place for a small group if you're into good atmosphere and Japanese cuisine
Must try this place for the food but don't expect great service
; Overall this place was to my surprise not bad at all
I love the concept of Lola and I want to love Lola's so bad but there are places I have been to that are much better with bigger space and friendlier people working
Great place to catch up with girlfriends and enjoy a bottle of your favorite wine
This place seems to have a lot of customers many seem to be regulars which is a good sign
Great atmosphere i use to take friends there all the time
The ambiance on the patio at night is great with gas fireplaces and all
This place is great for a variety of reasons
Good place that has been around for a long time yet keeps evolving
It's a quality sandwich shop with good ingredients great flavors and a fun atmosphere
it very affordable great hot tub and pool area my room as do all the rooms have full kitchen and its just a great way to spend a week or a weekend in a great private safe atmosphere
I was worried that it was not very well located but then again everything in Phoenix is spread out so rent a car or drive your own Lots of good place to eat and the local talent is not to be missed
I am glad to try any hole in the wall or oddball place but having had too much bad Chinese in the past will usually not try one unless it comes with a recommendation by someone
In the many times I've ordered here it seems they have a good system in place to deal with the heavy traffic that happens sporadically throughout the day
The places doesnt look like much from the outside but it they do a great job at a unheard of price
Live in the area and was hoping for a great locals type pizza place like Hana Japanese Eatery is for sushi
I thought this place was very good and considering we WERE going to go to the Persian Room that's saying allot
Nit-picking aside this place was great my boyfriend and i shared a combo plate and were both pretty full afterward
I got out as a good time though my friend also lived in the complex and her place was infested with cockroaches
-I really could have kicked myself for having chosen such a lousy establishment when there are so many other good places to eat in down-town Scottsdale
they have a few cute children's clothing stores like carter's oshkosh b'gosh and the children's place
First of all there aren't that many great sushi places in the Valley simply because the fish is not fresh like any of the coastal states
If you are looking for an interesting and original gift you should definitely check this place out as their small item selection is great
The one thing AZ needed and it's doesn't need a lot is a great sandwich place with tons of options
AZ/88 has an AWESOME atmosphere and looks like a posh resturaunt but the great surprise is that is it affordable and definately a place to impress a date
It's open late so it's a great place to go for drinks before going out dinner or lunch
I've heard so many good things about this place
This place is a great place to lounge and interact in that cool suave atmosphere
Plenty of lighting comfortable bed tons of chairs just an overall great place
Of course people are not going to magically put back shoes where they belong so you might find shoes in the right place or you might end of having to walk down each and every aisle looking at the shoe size stickers making sure they are not cute and your shoe size respectively
It was so freaking good I texted my man to make him jealous to ensure my return to this place
I suppose that's evidence of the restaurant's overall quality but their general nonchalant attitude about the situation has frustrated me to the point that I rarely even bother with the place anymore - which is too bad because they probably have the best wings I've ever tasted
This is a dive bar by the books and a great and very interesting place to visit
a great place to meet friends for happy hour or take a client
This place has potential but is lacking on some key points that make a great dining experience
Love the feel of the place - it did not feel like a Mexican restaurant - more like an upscale bistro kind of place great decor
Good service but it's a small place and can get pretty packed with a long line to get in so get there early especially on Sunday mornings - though they do have self-serve coffee outside to help with the wait
I had very high expectations for this place since I had heard so many good things about it before coming so I was pretty disappointed since my experiences definitely were nothing to get overly excited about
I'm typically someone who will like a place for the food despite the decor/service if it's good enough
We have been trying to look for a good lunch place
I've avoided yelping this place for a reason; that reason is that it sucks just as badly as their other location in the Hilton Village
However the customer service was so good that I will recommend this place to others with a warning of the smell
A great fast casual place for lunch in downtown Gilbert
I have yet to find a great place I'm still on the hunt until then it's Hubby and I taking turns with the iron because if I can't find someone to do it right we will do it ourselves
The broth is clear and there is always a large ammount of goodies in my #19rare steak well done flank tendon and tripe  I think the one thing I have noticed is the broth is not as salty as some of the other places I have eaten to me this is not a problem but the difference
Nice clean place to get some good Mexican Grub
Let me start by saying that this place has great atmospher casual yet hip
I was ok that it was a run down looking place was even willing to go in 115 weather knowing they only had swamp coolers this is how bad I wanted to try it
I may try this place agian if someone I know really wants to go but i will not go out of my way and this is not a place I reccomend as good mexican food
Although it's only about 12 feet high it's shady and provides a great place to have lunch with the local chipmunks but please don't feed them and take in the fabulous views -- including if it's clear enough downtown Phoenix nearly 30 miles away
It is so great to have a place like this in downtown Chandler - instead of Scottsdale
I judge every coffee place by their americano- Oh my word I didn't know you could get a good one this side of the 51
All in all a great place to watch any sport event that may be happening with a group of friends
However that is what gives it great character and makes for a great  place to stop by
The pizza is so yummy thick chewy crust and good sauce makes it one of my go to places for pie
This is a great place to stay in the Chandler area
A great place to go any night and grab a drink
The fireplaces are a great mood setter and the staff has been great every time I have gone there
She was on the hunt for a good vegetarian meal after her favorite place Doobys went out of business
Great customer service which in some places is a lost art good value selection and more
Up until 4pm this place is a casual local draw with close to the earth good food and plenty of seating
The decor isn't much of a date place if you were trying to have the whole package of aesthetics and good food so don't come in thinking it's a Ticoz or Tuck Shop
UniqueDeliciousRelaxed atmosphereFunny nameDuring my first trip here I was suffering from a pretty bad cold
This place has a great little vibe and fantastic music
Great atmosphere Great food Great service
I went here for lunch yesterday with a few friends/coworkers and thought it was the cutest place I have been in a long time
It's also a good place to watch a game - there are tons of tvs around the place
The atmosphere and patio were great and so was the service
Cute atmosphere great yogurt that is allegedly low calorie tastes too good but it apparently its true
No but it's good and quick when you want something light to eat and in a casual atmosphere
and the place was hopping on a Saturday night which is a very good sign
Not the best place to take vegetarians but for those looking for a not-too-expensive but not too great steak before a game I guess this is a place you could go
Was expecting more but the disappointment didn't put a dent in my appreciation for the overall Fuego Bistro package and it's become a shortlist contender for 'Great Place to Take Out-of-Towners'
I used to live in an area with a large Fry's marketplace that I was crazy about after having some really bad experiences at the Safeway that was across the street
Haus Murphy is a great place to take a family for fun
They serve up some darn good coffee here I had some tasty treats I suggest the banana nut bread or the tarts and the most unique part the place
It is a cute place to eat as it's has such a retro feel to it but the line was something my dad would not have enjoyed
This is a very nice place to take the family for dinner out and also good for weekday lunches or dates
Aside from that this place is really quite good
Atmosphere is upscale casual but not remotely pretentious
Such great ambiance for such a little place always cozy and fun to stop in here for a bite
This place got recommended to us by the hotel guy based on pure proximity but also for being pretty good
All in all a good experience and while I wouldn't go out of my way to go to this place I definitely wouldn't avoid it either
I also look forward to checking out 'Poppy's Place' which is a cute little bar affiliated with The Deli and conveniently located right next door
It isnt easy to see from the street but its a great place and worth the money for sure
When we moved to Arizona Carlsbad Tavern was one of the very first places we tried
I thought the atmosphere was okay and welcoming for a casual place
My next visit it will be the first place i choose this place rocks Great food and prices a great wait person who found out it was our first visit and gave us the skinny on all the dishes and be sure to ask for the salsa's excellent guac tuna tacos and pork tacos they also serve breakfast next on the agenda
The bartenders are pretty chill it's a relaxed atmosphere and the booths are super roomy
We knew it would be a good dining experience as soon as we noticed a diverse group of patrons unlike many other places we visited in Phoenix
Chef Brian Barry with his impressive resume having worked at popular restaurants on both coasts in the past Gramercy Tavern in NYC - one of the best places to dine in the entire country serves great food in a fantastic atmosphere
Of course they are no La Madeliene but if you are looking for some good croissants this is the place to be
They only take cash which is sometimes very annoying but that's the only thing bad about this place
This place is kind of expensive but it is good food great atmosphere and just plain fun
I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say I just got a bad hunk of meat because there is no way this place could serve food like that and stay in business
This is a cool little coffee/tea shop with great tasting coffee a laid back atmosphere and super friendly staff
This place is good in that bad kind of way
If you come on the right day this place is pretty great
Consistency in their food is solid here and nothing better than being able to count on a place where you will always get a good meal
This place has great food - some of the best bar food around
Particularly I was looking for a place that could provide me with the convenience of ordering a custom good for a very special occasion
I didn't think I'll find good pho in some place like Arizona but it caught me by surprise
The only  thing good I have to say about this place is that every time I ordered a beer the waitress brought me one immediately and then about 20 minutes later the busboy would bring another out to me thinking I never received the first either way no matter how drunk I got the food never tasted good
Love love love this place  Great store that is great for our health and community
We went there on a Saturday afternoon and wow the place was bustling i just felt the energy  and the atmosphere was great but yes it was loud
This place also passed my Mexican litmus test of beans rice and tortillas they have to taste at least as good as my grandma's
I feel terrible having to write this but several of my friends have noted the service here has been rude dismissive I would be exaggerating if I stated that was every experience-I have had nice exchanges but when I start to dread going into a place b/c of an attitude that is bad
The service was good the place is clean with nice decor
All-in-all it was pretty good and in the right situation I would go back again--I just wouldn't necessarily seek the place out
Great atmosphere and great place to get together with friends to watch the game
The beans are homemade and delicious the salsa is very good and the tortillas seemed to be more fresh than the other places I've been to
Otherwise a great place that I'm sure will become a regular for us
The ice cream was good but the true experience was the atmosphere which was phenomenal
Good lord this place is a destination in itself
I love this place the excitement and the thrill of a good find
This is the ONLY place in Phoenix that can make good mussamum and I have been everywhere
So if you ever come to Arizona and need a great relaxing place to stay make orange tree resort your final destination
We all enjoyed our food and the truffle Mac & cheese was super good but the service was ridiculously slow considering the place was almost empty and spending $75 for lunch for 4 was a little more than I like to spend for lunch
So in short this place is great for lunch and can't speak about how the service is any other time
Its a pretty good deal considering at most places that's happy hour prices
Atmosphere is both nice and casual; service prompt 99% of the time and staff is pleasant
First of all I would like to say Pei-Wei is a good chain if you compare to the quality of other places of it's kind
Service was not great even though the place was practically empty and I thought everything was overpriced
We actually had some good fun in the place
I really like the casual cool atmosphere of the Oregano's locations
There aren't many authentic Chinese places to choose from in Phoenix and its surrounding areas but considering this place has both traditional and westernized dishes as well as great dim sum you may not need to go any where else
Found the atmosphere impressive - trendy yet casual
I just have to say it was kinda dark but it would make a great place to bring a special someone and enjoy each other's company
Oh well I say that this place is a good solid place
From scrambles to skillets to steaks potato pancakes and pie this place has everything one needs for a good breakfast
Time and time again I have been to plenty of places with greasy food and the Black Bear has constantly kept up great food
We get to this place and we had driven by it a million times great patio and just packed on a Friday Night
Cook's is I would have to say that it's a great place for a special occasion or a date for the average Joe
With their silhouettes gracefully placed on their smart modern packaging GoodyTwos mixes up traditionally-made darn good toffee with a bright creative presence
It had a great atmosphere not crowded and the waitress was really friendly and courteous
Fox Restaurant Concepts knows how to serve it up honor the customer and run a great place
We have too many good places  around $9 at lunch Saigon nites  Thai House and Indian paradise  on a good day to make this part of the lunch rotation
Good forDatesInternship meetingsSending parents when you need to clear the beer cans from you placeChillin with friends
The decor is relaxing unlike typical mom and pop places where I feel a bit uneasy the selection is great you can tell them to cook it anyway you like with beef or veggie etc
Even though place was busy busy and busy our server was great
They have a great menu selection and the atmosphere is relaxed and warm
The atmosphere is still great they have board games now which I don't remember before
This place was soooo good in many ways but I really held back on one star because the connectivity was a bit wanton
The staff is friendly other than a couple of incidents the other patrons are lively and provide a good dining atmosphere
The place was cute and cozy with some neat artwork and I have no problem with the idea of a corkage fee it was $7 per person and I have no idea if that's standard/low/high
This was my first visit to the Herberger Theater and it is a great place to see a show
00 coupon and 3 being pretty new hopefully someone can season up that soupAdditionally the bar which I didnt get to experience looks like a great place to grab a pre-show beverage

You know that you found a great burger place when you feel that you need a freakin' bib in order to eat there
This place just isn't good enough to get my business anymore
I was looking for a non-pretentious place to casually drink wine in a on-threatening environment
Ladies this is also a great place to hang if you just want to be left alone from men constantly hitting on you and trying to get in your pants
I have finally found a place that has good soup at a reasonable price
I always think of this place since I have to drive for more authentic Mexican but Macayos has pretty darn good chips and salsa which is how you know your food will be good and I also get another dish here but I can't seem to remember right now
The coffee is just not as good as a lot of other local places
I was right they were not that strong and for 5 bucks I would expect a bigger glass these things were weak and for five bucks I was like come on I thought this place was a bit pricey my tab was like 25 bucks for two margaritas and three tiny shrimp tacos and some bad table chips
I would suggest someplace else I was not satisfied with the food this maybe a great meat market at night for pink tacos but the food sucks
Great beer fun atmosphere and good food as well
one of those places where the server takes your orders but doesn't deliver the goods
Quiessence is a great place to take your sweetie for a charming evening friends or family who are into organics and supporting local producers and parents or the elders visiting from out of town
My office building is close to downtown Tempe so Hanny's is a bit out of the way and if you drive instead of take the light rail the parking and driving in downtown Phoenix is an adventure unto itself but if you get there before noon and walk in you are greeted by a world of dark leather tones gently playing classical music and a lack of artificial lighting so prevalent in our modern workplace and waitstaff that know how to be efficient and helpful and not overly intrusive I distinctly remember that the waiter did not feel the need to come over every five minutes and ask how things were going but instead quietly came around and refilled drinks which I greatly appreciated
I realize that management is trying to keep the place as authentic as possible there is a recurring theme in these reviews and eventually people will stop coming here you have a great location and once upon a time an amazing restaurant
What a shame the place is great to look at and enjoy sitting there looking at the road but that is about it
It seems like a great place for happy hour and I would be back to try it for dinner the next time I visit Scottsdale
I'm used to receiving good service but this place went above and beyond to make me feel important even when the place is packed on a Friday night
It was a great place to hang out and catch up
i was ok with it but i was with someone who does not really place value on waiting a little longer for great food which kind of put a damper on things
Nice open atmosphere bright and clean and good breads upon which to load good stuff
a very good place if u just wanna chill the atmosphere has a calm and relaxing mood to it
also a very good place for lunch and its awesome that the place is open till 2 everyday and the sushi bar is also open till than
I could see this place as a creating a super great romantic evening as we did but also coming for drinks with friends enjoying the night air or in the winter the inside is divided much like a lounge
The reason I enjoy this place so much is that it is usually not crowded and the service is great
The help was swift the service was swift and the atmosphere was very relaxed
Everyone was pleasantly surprised at what a great little place we'd found so close to work
It's a shame really because the place is very good and merits a visit from you
The wife's gnocchi was great this is the only place she will order it from
I don't want to get into novel length here but I cannot say enough about how great this place is
This place has done a great job and I will likely return just for that
Below is the menu choices that we had on offeringFirst CourseSmoked Paprika Braised Pork Shoulder Queso Cotija Guacamole Shaved Baby Radishes Korabuta Pork Belly Butternut Squash Hash Tamarind Peach Glaze Hand Rolled Porcini Gnocchi Maitakes Ginger Cabbage Black Bean Miso CreamSecond CourseGrilled Romaine Fried Rainbow Valley Egg Spanish Anchovies Capers Raisins Roasted Striped Beets Gala Apples Horseradish Cream Prairie Breeze Amish Cheddar Applewood Smoked Duck Breast Peaches Sweet Corn Cranberries Almonds Arugula Frisee *Add $5Third CourseGrilled Pork Porterhouse Spaetzle Spaghetti Squash Bacon Brussel Slaw Amish Asian Pear Butter Niman Ranch Tri-Tip Steak Roasted Fingerlings Baby Rainbow Carrots Black Mesa Ranch Feta Caper Aioli Wild Caught Market Fish White Beans Cherry Tomatoes Fennel Baby Spinach Green Goddess SwordfishNow on top of this there were a couple items on top of the normal menu there were Sweetbreads for the First Course +5 supp and there was another option for the second course but I do not recall what it wasCourse 1 - I had the Sweetbreads which were had a sauce that was delicious i cannot remembe what kind the good kind with a plum apple slices to freshen it up for some acidity and they had a cornmealish fried texture to them -- I had been to Blackbird 1 star Michelin Chicago who also served up a sweetbread 1st course and this preperation blew it out of the water and that was our favorite app we had there -- Also they gave a very good portion size as well this was not a Restaurant Week portion to make tons of money this was their normal portion just at a discounted price - one thing that always drove me crazy about RW is that many places don't put their best foot forward and try to make a quick buck instead of trying to gain return clientsThe Mrs had the Pork Belly which I have to say was one of the best pork belly's i have had in a very very long time
I would not change the set up great location great spring and fall place to go
The service is friendly and the ambience of this place is casual  but lively and fun too
Good food good service good atmosphere decent prices just can't go wrong
If your idea of a good sandwich involves a copious amount of bread with very little meat this is the place for you

I was meeting my friend for lunch and he works at the Chinese Cultural Center and we were tired of the same old places in the area so we Yelped our options and found this great little hole in the wall place
I will be back for sure they had desert treats here as well the menu is small kind of like Chipotle and the service was good but when we came the place only had 3 tables with people
I'm from California and Ive only been to a place like this like twice and they really only have one diner like this available to go to RUBY'S not that its bad or anything but I've gone to it so many times and its become less of a diner and more of a restaurant you say to yourself they are the same thing
It's no secret that I love me a good cheeseburger  so I was excited to try a new place
I recommend the pork burritos  award winning type of good but you really can't go wrong with any item at this place
I couldn't possibly explain in words how great I think this place is but I will surely try
Good lord i honestly can't imagine anyone giving this place less than 5 stars
This is a great place to go when you want a good happy hour but aren't looking for the crowded busy spots
This was a great place to eat drink and catch up on conversation
Thank goodness to Restaurant Week otherwise I might not have tried this place
The food is served very fast it's very good and the place is always very clean
This place is just as good if not slightly better and NO wait
Our server was attentive and the Margarita's were decent the original is refreshing and good with a meal the strawberry I could have passed on which are the only reasons that this place is bumped from a One Star to a Two Star review
I'm glad that I donated it to a place where she can't get her hands on my things---The owner most likely sends her staff to Goodwill to stock her store
The only bad thing I can say about the place like any other stadium
You will not be disappointed if you appreciate great tasting food served in a vibrant atmosphere
Not as good as King Gyros but it's a decent backup since this place is closer to my house
It seems like a great place for a dinner with family or a business meeting
This place brought all the good taste of awesome made mexican food
Their dishes were good but not a place we would purposely drive to Phoenix for
It would be a good place to go to if we are around the area again
doesnt have a good size parking lot so you have to park along side 8th ave and walk a lil bit to the place
The only downside to this location is that the placement of the store is pretty bad and to get back on Priest can be a real pain in the ass
But overall great place for lunch or dinner
I told her I had just moved here and she was more than happy to share her tips on other good places to drink
From my perspective this place is as good as it gets
I'm not going to go on about ingredients in every dish and pretend to be the food critic I am not; rather if you want a nice atmosphere great service and outstanding food based on what you like and how you like things prepared this place delivers
griddle cakes were a bit underdone and waffle was soft and tasteless  treue belgin waffle should be crispy and light inside the place was packed with trendys service was hap hazzard at best   eggs came a good 5 min before the waffle i believe there are much better breakfast options in town and less expensive
What a great place to eat and rest especially after a long day of deals and sales
rrEarl's is a good place to have a business meeting
The place was very clean service is great and prices very reasonable
all in all a good place I go there once or twice a month
It's a great place when its packed and girls are hopping up on the Bull getting crazy
Now the bad newsThis place is WAY overpriced
Just a fun place to bring a friend or a small group and get catered to with solid food great pizza easily stacks with Bianco if you factor in the wait and a comfortable atmosphere
I've been here twice now and this place is as cute and fresh as it can be
This is the place that you go to if you are a person who appreciates good food therefore it takes time
Great place to eat after all the other bars close -- I think Mickeys is open till 4am serving food
The orange chicken was slightly better quality than Panda Express and really not very good and very odd for a German beer place
A great cup of coffee in a cozy little place with friendly conversation
I personally really like this place because it's nice to be able to get a real & good meal at a sports bar
Solid food choices great happy hour beer prices and lots of room for large groups Bobby Q's is one great place
It's an understated place that feels like an einstein's bagel location not necessarily a bad thing as we go there too
Not trying to be too critical but I eat breakfast at a lot of great places and these are good but in line with what many good places will offer
This is a great place and we WILL be back
Wish we had them in the LA area as we lack breakfast places that are actualy good
Cien Agaves is a great addition to downtown Scottsdale -- and it provides a fun relaxed atmosphere into the mix of places that either seem to be a dive-y and dumpy or b snotty and superficial
wasn't too expensive plus it's a great place to ppl watch if you sit on their patio
It's a great place to go on a night that you feel ugly
The atmosphere is great and there's been a steady stream of customers coming in

This is a great place for unique items and filling gift bags with old-school things
I would say this place is a little pricey but you can also find some good inexpensive buys
I like this place and a good thing I do because I got 6 months left of this lease
It's a great place to hang out and drink margarita's
So it is a place you can get some great deals on anything from clothes to home decorations or even kitchen stuff and luggage but you have to pay attention to the deals
On a side note I am surprised at how often I am getting invited to the Indian School and Miller area these days lots of great little places down there
The atmosphere is very cute a big bright pink wall black leather furniture and ultra chic fashion photos on another wall one of my guests knows the owner apparently he was the photographer
The place is so cute inside not at all what I expected from the outside
Ever since Texano's in Tempe closed Fiesta Burrito has been my go-to place for adobada burritos
5lb can of powdered banana pudding an auto-siphon a first aid kit and a tortilla press in the same place is a good time in my book
Upon my first visit to CMOH I liked the casual ambience and the outdoor patio
This is definitely a great place to pick up rice soy sauce and soy beans for cheaper than at a Western grocery
I would recommend this place they did a great job for a good round price and all under 20 min
The only good thing about this place is the ridiculous amount of TVs but it's not enough to have us go back again
The beer/wine is good the food is good I like the southwestern egg roll apps the price is good the service is good and the atmosphere is nice thought I was going to say good huh
I must go back when I have some time to have a drink because this place is where I want to relax and have a good time
Good atmosphere comfortable seat and lots of it
The live music was deceiving as it looked good for the out side don't we all and sounded horrible but I'm not reviewing that am I  I was actually helped by a guy there who matched the place well
I just had to update my review to five stars because this place is THAT good
Doc and Eddy's has a great atmosphere where you can hang out with people from all walks of life
Anyhow stopped by this place a few weeks ago with a good friend to have some brunch
But the whole reason this place is so great is the Happy Hours are the best around
Well worth the cheap price of admission this little gem hosts great shows in a slightly better than garage atmosphere
- Also upstairs your own personal Hall of Mirrors - in case you missed the illustrious Arizona State Fair - and an all-white room which together constitute a great place for photographing your peers
I don't think any place can afford to lose business over bad service these days so they better figure out what to do with those bad apples
Of course a staple of any great Greek place; baklava
It may be really difficult to make pizza this great faster than Bianco does but other places seem to be able to pull it off so hopefully that will happen in Phoenix at some point too
Over all my experience at Cooperstown was enjoyable was watching the NBA playoffs on all the screens except 2 screens had the Diamondback game on the staff was friendly and fun and that right their makes a place Great
He earns one star for the place just by showing up at the table with a great attitude
The only other Thai places I have eatin at are Line Thai and Siam Thai both are great but this Thai basil location is awesome

The atmosphere was really nice and the service was great
And even the teens get a great place to hang out adjacent to the bar
Good for the moving day bag of burgers but I wouldn't go out of my way to get there BTW when is Lucky Boy going to put a place in Old Town Scottsdale
I was enjoying the casual nature of the place and that I could scan over and see at least 2 NBA games going on at the same time
We had just dropped in from having sushi at a place up the way but we were both wishing we weren't so full because the food looked and smelled pretty good
so overall the coffee was good and the place/people were fine and totally unremarkable
The atmosphere is really nice it's dim and romantic particularly when seated in one of the round booths along the back wall
If you want to impress your date this is a great place for that
Great location great atmosphere service was fantastic from the moment we stepped in the door
This place was very good for the excellent price
I'd say that maybe this place is great when you're hammered but yeah I really wouldn't want to be there then either
If you want a good burger and fries you have arrived at the right place
I tried this place for lunch and the sandwiches are very good but they do not give you alot of food
The place was packed when we walked in but it was the kind of packed where it's a good sign
This is a great place for the hours in between meals because you can generally find something to please everyone
If you're expecting to have a large wedding this place can easily accommodate for it and the wedding coordinators are very friendly prices are good as well
I would much rather give my money to a local business with a relaxed atmosphere than that awful Starbucks with its bitter African beans my coffee snob husband swears that good coffee should not be bitter it should be flavorful bad tea even worse hot chocolate and limited food selection
Cute place great service excellent food and local
The place was pretty empty so when the hostess asked us if we wanted a booth or table I responded with doesn't matter really just a good spot
We agree with the majority on this hotel it is the closest and quietest near the airport and a great place to spring into business or pleasure travel from PHX
In a world of burgers are burgers this place sets itself apart from the rest with quality ingredients very good service and a friendly atmosphere
I moved to AZ a few months ago from NYC where I lived in a neighborhood of great Vietnamese restaurants and have eaten my way through the Vietnamese enclaves in Boston and in Hong Kong -- and this place ranks up there with the best of them
They kept true to the sticky buns and the relish tray which truly isn't great but i eat it and appreciate it being there because im hungry and with family which is lovely HAHA also rolls on request really on request and they are worse than grands yes i wish i was joking but really the new place is better in some aspects
I didn't go in like someone expecting to get blown away i expected a good Easter dinner based on the fact ive been here before years ago and enjoyed it so i went in expecting the price per dish to be as good as it was well its not and its sad because the place is pretty and it looks like horses can get married in the back grassy area check it out it makes sense
If you are in Old Town and looking for a chill spot with great beers plates for sharing or not you need to make Praying Monk on your to do list of places to visit and eat and drink
If your in the mood for a good sammy lunch this is the place in old town
But this place is great and and I'm sure there's something you'll like if you're one of the artsy type that seem to frequent this place
The place looks great from the outside and the inside was pretty nice also
From what I understand the restaurant was taken over by new owners in February 2010; I don't know what the menu and atmosphere were like before from some of the reviews back in 2006 I'm going to say not great but it's FIRST-RATE now
This place is so good I would not be writing this review if I still lived in Arizona because I would want to keep all the bargains to myself
Very excited that this place in in the valley as it is always hard to find good Thai food once you leave either of the coasts
This place has very tasty food and the restaurant is beautiful chic and romantic but not so much so that you're intimidated by it
The food & atmosphere were both very good
- Service was goodThe main street itself was dead that night but this place was hopping
I love a good pizza and this place is up there as one of my favorite pizzas
This would be a great place to go with some friends
Yellowtail Sushi is a great place to eat sushi
You have to love a place like Linda's that has great home-cooked food reasonable prices and is locally owned
The Good So this place has excellent yogurt
For years I refused to get yogurt anywhere else because MFY was sooo good I didn't like any other shops but alas I have ventured and found other great places that are doing a better job at creating creamy yogurt
The #1 was really good certainly not something you'd expect from a place that is essentially a bar
Sit on the patio it is a great atmosphere
I thought that was pretty cool but that's about all that was cool about the place oh and the wine selection was very good
She said the place was pretty cool and had good offerings
I am giving this place five stars because the food is good to me and throughout my years with Thai Basil- it has never failed- dishes are quite consistent
All and all I have to say this place is very good
Quickly I will give a recommended first trip order and then give details about what I love about this placeDrink Any Arizona Stronghold wine I really like their reds - Dala specificlyApp Meatball trio in Vodka Sauce - it didn't sound good to me either and then I tasted it WOW
Dessert - I know Italian resturants should have a good cannoli and this place does I am usually so stuffed from my dinner we never order it
I love a good dive more than the next guy but this place isn't funky it's filthy
Its a little small but has a great atmosphere & I love all the decorations and details
hell it's not even Hazelwood's but it is a great place to unwind
Overall it's a great place to stay and earn Hilton points when I'm in the area for business although there are nicer options if you're there for business and looking for the luxury resort experience
I did what I always do & looked on Yelp for nearby sushi places because Yelp has always been the best tool for finding anything great
The atmosphere was great - nice and quiet yet you still feel like you're somewhere happening and trendy
I've been so pleased with Andrew's bbq that I felt like I had been settling for less this whole time when I had a great bbq place in my neighborhood
Chinese sounded good what better place to satiate our craving than PF Chang's
I kind of thought that a fish and chips place would also have good strips but I was wrong
A great experience and to not have the pressure of driving into Tempe finding a place to park wondering how much it will cost etc
If you live close by & money is not the issue The place is quiet; simple decoration good for lunch meet with friends
The park has great seats and the outfield grass area is a nice place to watch a game as well
I'm not a fan of the Padres or the Mariners but this is a great place for a Spring Training visit
All in all a great place to chill and listen to some music
This is a great place to get a job to get server experience
I have this restaurant - in its former self - to thank for this  Back in its day this restaurant was really great and the entire atmosphere lent to an ambiance that actually inspired me to study Chinese and then later go live over there for some years
All of this is gone and replaced by very plain fare and not very good at that
Let us bow our heads in sadness to a place that once was very good - now passed on
I think the patio really makes this place great
It's a great little place just south of Camelback on Central
The staff is ultra-friendly and courteous the food is great and the atmosphere is awesome
If you are looking for an interesting place to kind of hang out in downtown when there isn't a game going on Friday's Front Row is a pretty good choice plus it's right off a lightrail stop
It's a great place to meet friends and hang out for awhile
The bar/lounge area is a great place to go on a date
Definitely not a casual place to go for dinner
Cheap drinks casual atmosphere and decent Mexican food- that's how I'd describe Dos
Overall this place is very good but I don't think it would do well in a true Green city such as Seattle
Nothing strikingly good or bad about this Tex-Mex placeService is very slow - took us 1
Mixed drinks were goodOverall and OK place and might be worth trying again but only after trying some of the other places aroundExpensive for what you getNice surroundings
If you want ok food and a good time this is the place to go
Great potential at this place it just didn't work for us
My wife and I finished up watching a movie and a steak just sounded good so I wanted to give the place a try
My wife had the sirloin and said it was really good too and we both agree we will be going back to this place
A very good place for an amazing date night
The Desert Botanical Gardens in Phoenix AZ is a great way to get a sample of Arizona's diverse and spectacular flora
This is a great place to take visiting relatives who love to garden or are just nature buffs
At the end of your journey is a great gift shop with books jewelry and even plants found on the garden grounds for sale
This could be a good place if they can keep up the momentum

If you're looking for quick food for the family this place is a great alternative to fast food
It looked pretty good he really liked it and they gave you two cha gio egg rolls cause lots of places are stingy here in arizona and like to give you one
He reminded me of one of my dad's friend's  I bet he even has a really bad gambling problem too  ah the curse of the vietnamese The place is really clean for a vietnamese place
I love a good diner and I have been to some great ones and this was sub par I vowed never to return because the place was bad both times I visited and there are some really good cafes very near here that are a better value and have better food
Also the building it is located in is a shoddy trailer park looking place that is sort of vintage but not in that good vintage kind of way like diners I have been to in Flagstaff and out in the California desert
This place is so versatile it's great for lunch with co-workers a meeting happy hour with friends or a date night on the town
And with the cute house vibe and great ambiance this place will score big points for a date night too
Green is a great place to people watch too
The place has a very good beer and wine list with some interesting beer cocktailsBeers with a fruit puree mixed
From the outside the place looked alot busier however Not a bad place to go for lunch on Friday afternoon
The atmosphere is definitely what makes this place so great and the staff is always friendly and accommodating
I recommend the margherita pizza with procuitto added the arugula that's placed on top gives the pizza a great contrast/different taste thats excellent
Bar Bianco an old house right next door that's been converted into a bar definitely makes this wait go by faster and has an equally great atmosphere as well
My boyfriend and I zoomed over and were amazed  to find how good  the food was not too mention the atmosphere
Great place for families and friends to sit down enjoy food and have a complementary cookie for dessert
Place is so great I just might go there today for lunch
The beer pong table is great and frankly I am angry more places don't have it
All in all GB is great place to go to
Great place to take a date late night I think
Also great to go with friends or even just late night to get some atmosphere or half price tuna rolls
Overall a great coffee shop I go out of my way to visit it due to the atmosphere and variety of beverages
They keep this place super clean and they have yummy snacks like cinnamon and sugar roasted nuts so good
They have great happy hour deals and I never leave hungry from this place
It wasn't even that good there are many other places like Parlor or Spinato's that have great flavorful pizza so it doesn't make the most sense to eat here
The refried beans are great - not the whipped variety that you find at other places
A great little place to bring a date for dinner and they have piano playing at night
The atmosphere is nice and different and the iced tea is good and fresh
SanTan Brewery in downtown Chandler is a great place to enjoy fantastic beer at low prices
Too bad the tour only lasted for two places
We were supposed to just have one drink at Bomberos and move on but I thought the place was so cute I made us stay longer
In fact this place would probably get four stars for the food beer selection & tvs except that the service is just so rediculously bad it ruins everything
I hate people that tell isolated stories about their one experience with shitty service at a restaurant and make it all one sided like they are not ass holes but I have this great story I gotta tell about this place and yes I hate myself for it so fuck off
Overall good happy hour prices friendly and attentive service despite being crowded nice atmosphere and I like that they have live music
Tea Infusion combines good service a pleasant atmosphere the BIGGEST selection of tea falvors I've ever been offered delectable desserts and an overall happy feeling
This is a good place It has been here for about 20 years now
STAY clear of this place A good local car wash that is near there is the one on Indian School and hayden its a great place
I think this is a dressy place & hate seeing casual attire there flip flops caps runners
Great Place for see/B/seen fabby lunch specials kids will luv cook tables - always an experience with out of town visitors -
At one time this place was an outrageously good value
It's a great little niche restaurant idea but once you get past all the hoopla this is place is a huge rip off
On the plus side It's a nice romantic place with super dark tables
I love the relaxed atmosphere and the friendly staff
This is a great place to bring family for a special occasion or to just be like us and belly up to the bar for some true New York Italian
Above average food friendly service and a great ambience gives Andreoli's a well deserved five stars
First off love Wild Thaiger food is excellent service is by in large prompt courteous and a relaxed atmosphere
Like you might notice from my other reviews I learn how to 'use' a place in so that I can get the greatest value for the money I am about to spend
I've passed by this place so many times before thinking it would be a good idea to stop in some day and see what they had
Hash browns eggs grits waffles - all are fairly good here for what this place is all about and it's rather affordable
that's usually a good placeSo the little lady and I had just finished up with yoga and Switch was in the very near vicinity  so we figured it'd be a good choice
It is a great place to dance and hang with friends great drink prices and they have a fun after hours
So I've always called this place Awful House and really it aint that bad
Uni-  Not freshSashimi assorted- Not fresh cut is very thickTempura- Not crispy soggyCold Somen noodles- bad texture over cookedMiso soup- Made from powder not pasteSushi Rice-  Not badOverall this place is a no go
Soma is an annual event that takes place each October for the past 5 years - it's a great way to wrap up the season and it's supposedly one of the best triathlons in the country
We ate wonderful food in an atmosphere that made us feel relaxed and at home
Overall good pricing atmosphere was ok service wasn't too bad
I visit this amazing place a few times a year only because every single time I'm there I find armloads of great things to bring home
Although I'm not a big fan of sandwich places I must say that this one is a really good place to have lunch whether light or substantial
There's a good array of sandwiches salads and sides to choose from and the place itself has a relaxed and informal atmosphere
Good to know another pleasant place to have a leisurely meal with friends in the heart of the city
Good setup with the tvs but factoring in the below average food and the some of the most horrendous service I have ever experienced make Fox Sports Grill a place I wouldnt recommend to my own worst enemy
It's a great location with a fun busy atmosphere so it's really disappointing that the food kind of misses the mark
The atmosphere is very casual and the restaurant is always clean and inviting
The place was probably half full and for a Tuesday night that's not bad
This is a fun causal place with good food and friendly service
Good place for lunch large fast service good prices and good food
The only good things about this place is the guy that works there he is pretty good and the powder or one of the powders they  use doesn't lift as much as other places
The service food and atmosphere were great
So I was looking to get a Yoga mat and thought that Dicks would be a great place to go to get something like that
I really wanted to love this place after all the great reviews but unfortunately I could really only give it three stars
I should probably go with two stars but that salad was so good that it brings the whole place up another notch
I purchased a Groupon with the anticipation of trying this place as I had heard good things about it
Our entire check with iced tea that was never empty was around $22--an excellent bargain for a good vegan meal in a nice atmosphere with great service
Somehow i don't get why this place has great rating
Nice selection of good places to eat as mentioned in Luckie's review
Not only do I find the teriyaki sauce that Japanese places typically use to be too sweet but there is always so much - sushi edamame seaweed salads - at good Japanese places that I would rather spend my money on and fill my stomach with
While I won't be back here for sushi I can see where this may be a good place to have a cocktail or two
Anyway I'm not telling people to stay away from this place as the food was very good
all in all native is a great place to hang out
but we were not dismayed as it allowed us an opportunity to walk off some of the GREAT food this place serves
my roommate and i had the good fortune of attending the grand opening last night and besides a few kinks that need working out this place is gonna be awesome
I have to admit I thought that the line for this place they explained to me was a bit ridiculous but the pizza was great
Coming from Seattle with lots of good Japanese food and moved to the desert gives me a bit of pessimistic thoughts about this place
But after entering the door and feel the atmosphere I had a good feeling already
No where else to start the discussion so I figured here would be a good place
So I won't trash the place because god knows there aren't enough independents on that side of town and the items done well -- particularly the spicy tuna and teriyaki  -- were very good
It's a FUN place with GREAT beer though
Great place for first dates places to take parents while they are visiting here or just a nicer dinner out then the usual
Great food entertaining atmosphere couldn't ask for more
It's been hard finding a great Thai place here
It wasn't bad and I did bring the rest home to hav tomorrow but it's not nearly as flavorful as other Thai places I have been to in the past
Granted this place is cheaper so if you want to go for inexpensive sushi with really great happy-hour specials then this place is for you
Very casual great atmosphere and nice patio
A good amount of seating inside a nice place to hang out for your after dinner dessert or on a hot Phoenix day
I have to say that the pool is a great place to relax if it is not a Saturday during the summer
We thought this place was great until we went to Sky Zone - Peoria
My father in law took us to this wonderful place when we were visiting him and it made such a great impression on us that we decided to have our rehersal diner here
Build-a-Bear workshop is such a cute place for kids
the kind of place where everyone talks to/welcomes everyone yet no one is nosy or cliquish where the whole place cheerfully claps when Mrs Owner breaks a glass and someone calls out it's earlier than that normally happens  free wi-fi where you have a nice patio with heaters and a front-row Fountain view wine by the bottle from their extensive retail collection or yours -- with just a $5 corkage as well as a decent 7-9 reds and 7-9 whites selection by the glass for $7-$10 a great craft beer selection Union Jack IPA
couches nice hightops an l-shaped bar great local artwork also for sale this will be your new favorite place
This place has a great vibe and one part of me hopes these positive reviews don't result in oppressive crowds but on the other hand something tells me they'd handle it with a smile and 5 star service
This is a great place to take the whole family
A great place to go grab a slice or go out for Pizza - Monday and Tuesdays the special is buy one pizza get one half off and on Wednesdays children eat free and on Sunday take out a pizza get one free
This place is great especially for children's parties
Staff is Friendly makes good suggestions and allows you to order as you go unlike a lot of Sushi places
Eventually I did replace the entire AC unit and the price I paid was well below the Accutemp estimate
Great renovation of an old building makes for a great atmosphere
The cost was fair and it is a great place to take a group of six to eight
Like Aaron's review states there is no place like Antica Pizzeria Da Michele in Naples and once you've had it you become compelled to find a place stateside that is as good or even close
I'm thinking about getting a monthly membership because it's such a great place to spend an hour or so a few times a week
Anybody who's been to Postino Arcadia or Postino Central knows what to expect from a Postino restaurant  great wine selection incredible food and a modern but relaxed atmosphere
We choose Springhill because we needed a nice place to overnight near the airport at a good rate for an early am flight and they offered a free 24-shuttle every half hour
I would not have expected such a cute little place in the little strip mall location but it was awesome
Located in the heart of downtown Phoenix The Symphony would make a great cultured date or place to bring an out of towner
Parson's is a great little family owned place where the owner still works with the staff on a daily basis
I have a habit of becoming good friends with people who like these places
This place produces really good fast food/ Mexican food
If you're in the mood for some good sliders check this place out
While this place cannot be considered healthy by any means if you are need of a good ole' greasy burger fix this place fits the bill
I still appreciate a good fluffy crust however and this place has both
Either way its a good place to get a quick bite if you're in the area but nothing spectacular
yummmmhonestly i eat Chinese/Asian/Thai A LOT and this was one of the best places i have came across in my quest for  great Asian food
their chicken is damn good and the atmosphere in the place does get a little too hot at times
Great atmosphere too - perfect for watching some futbol or the winter Olympics showing their great sense of humor they had Shaun of the Dead playing when I visited
here I am in Tempe on Mills and I'm just looking for a place with good food and drinks
In short--the service was great the grilled/fried food is wonderful the atmosphere is comfortable and inviting
It's not a bad place to stop at for a drink or two when your out with friends but not the place you'll want to hang out at all night
Aside from those and a few other minor quibbles it's a great place to see a show
We couldn't really figure out what was so great about this place
's great review that said they have free car service to pick you up and drop you off I thought I had found my place
A good place to eat is a good place to eat regardless of how many locations they have
To date they have a repaired a defective hot water heater where the parts were failing hot water heater was recalledb replaced said defective hot water heater with one that has had zero problems and installed it within 1 day of the previous water heater totally failing for good and at an incredibly reasonable ratec fixed landscaping plumbingd fixed the main water valve and additional pool and landscaping plumbingFuture work includes fixing the shower in the master bathroom
Look just because the place is in the ghetto doesn't mean it is going to be automatically good
I cook fairly similar to this at home so it's nice to find a place away from home that can treat food properly without relying on fats and butters and actually tastes good with out being 'bland' healthy
Also still a great place to drink wine with half off bottles on Mondays or $5/glass until 6 p
But this place is great and I would definitely recommend to try their special of of the day they have been so good thus far
All and all not a bad place just not my cup of tea
What makes this place great are the creative offerings and the super friendly service
The good things- bar has nice strong drinks- the pool is super cool with waterfalls- free parking- decent size room and bathroomso even though the good things could make up for the first two 'bad things' and land the place a 3 star rating unfortunately those things don't make up for a good bed so 2 stars instead of 3
DQ is a great place to grab a dessert and the best place of any of the other fast food establishments hands down
Even if you have dinner somewhere else this is a great place to come and relax and listen to some really good music afterwords
They come in good portions but honestly they are not as filling as other salad places I've ordered from
With such great food and service I hope this place gets the chance to stick around
But after our experience we realized this is a great place for a break in the monotony of multi-generational family dinners
Cien Agaves definitely has a fun atmosphere, cool decor, and a great idea with focusing on tequila and tacos, but the experience is lost with average food at best
Reserve this place for happy hour, but look elsewhere for a good meal
And yes, American buffets are infamously bad, but even so this place is terrible, and rather dirty
With plenty of shared seating outside with Maria's and a good amount inside, Carmine's is a great place to grab a quick slice pre-game or a whole pie yes, they'll make a whole pie for you during the busy times
lol  Nothing really bad to say about this place but the price
There were a couple of good stores in there that were fun to look at and a few good restaurants but mostly it is a just walk around and look at all of the stuff type of place just so you can say you saw it tick it off your list
For a great dessert place I highly recommend the Sugar Bowl
Truly I never expect this level of good in any place of business but you find only good here
They ususally have good beer fun atmosphere and tasty bar grub
If you are looking for a whole in the wall Mexican place that serves fresh and authentic food located in the East Valley Salsa Cabana is a great place
I usually give places the benefit of the doubt but trust me this was bad
It is not a fancy place but what it is is good mexican food with an atmosphere to compliment it
Overall the place is pretty small and not much going on but they serve great food
I see more of these kinds of places popping up now in Phoenix and it is a great trend in having a more varied palette in the dining experience beyond the huge chains that seem to dominate such new cities like Phoenix
Frances & Charlie-A part of the Smeeks empire this place had fun stuff also and another great place to buy fun things for the special people in your life
This place is not for the feint of heart so be prepared and excited to learn and work and you will have a great time
The trainers are great and the general atmosphere in the gym is always positive
If you're coming in with some skill this is still a great place for you to learn and grow
Highlights Good beer selection friendly staff extensive menu with the emphasis on meat and pork stick-to-your-ribs German comfort food gemu00fctlichkeit ambience
Wow this place was fresh tasty and reasonably priced -- a great trifecta
Now that they have opened the option to sit inside it is a great place to take out or eat in
Cute little place right off of Baseline about a mile or two down from the Arizona Mills mall
Overall I really like this place and you don't have to be vegan to go there which is great because they don't treat you any differently if you aren't
service is always good and the atmosphere is excellent i recogmend a nice sun set dinner on the patio
There's now a really high-end iPic movie theater a frozen yogurt place a great Nike store and much more to come in addition to H&M West Elm and the delicious Oakville Grocery Co
The location is a bit outside of Phoenix Proper but if you are looking for that Cajun effect---This is a good place to start
If you work in this area or are looking for a cheap good dinner give the place a try I sure which I had one of these near my office
The restaurant is dark and mysterious in the lounge area and completely open in the dining room which makes for a great social atmosphere all around
Pretty much this place is good for quick and cheap food
And it's definitely a great place to celebrate your birthday
Families or anyone looking for a cute old-fashioned kick will dig this place
If you're in the downtown area and really want some good Mexican food this is the place to go
My prediction is that 50 years from now when all the patrons of this place have died of heart attacks the next generation will look back on this food the same way we look back on asbestos it seemed like a good idea at the time but boy was it a killer
Nothing but a great experience with this place
That criticism in mind I'm going to have to go 3 stars even though I love this place and have spent countless hours here and bought a good number of audio books
If you've eaten at some of the great mediterranean/middle eastern restaurants in the valley I'm thinking of one unnamed delicious place in Tempe in particular trust me this is nothing like them
The Arrogant Butcher is a great place to visit as long as there is nothing else going on in the area
Two stars for good shakes nice atmosphere friendly staff and cool location
The only negative was that we opted to sit outside but at a lower table so we were crouching over our food which was uncomfortable but overall great place to check out what kinds of cars are parked in valet
However the service and stinky bathrooms were bad enough that had their beer been phenomenal I still would have just given this place 3 stars
Even if you're not a budding chef this is a great place to explore for a few minutes and there are plenty of idiot-proof spices that would work wonders in simple meals
It's hard to find a great quaint little breakfast place that is actually accessible at all times sorry Matt's
Well I'll tell ya I love a good diner and I was anticipating the opening of this place for a couple weeks and last night we went in for a late night dinner
The Great Pumpkin Festival makes it more worth you're money to come in the fall time the entrance fee for the festival is free with the garden admission
It's quiet relaxing and a great place to enjoy good wine and good company
I was very glad I did cause this place is great
Overall a great place to go out for some drinks and dancing
This is partially do to good reason as this place is a terrible venue for a concert
This place like many in Phoenix reminds me of a great spot in Tucson that somehow the superior city managed to royally screw up
Damn Lucky Strike LanesHad me insane in the membraneDowning Patron tasted like propaneDancing like I got an ankle sprainLive DJ spinning21 and over winningNeon glowing balls pinningMunchie menu for the feigningGreat place to par-tayDon't be tardyIf you want to be a smartyCz the crowds be mighty heartySexy urban-lounge atmosphereCan't talk dirty in my BF's earMusic and vibe is loud and clearTis okay cz his lips are nearI love nights like theseWhere waitstaff is eager to pleaseNaughty intentions are here to seizeLike laugh drink or get a hickeyTime to bowl and kid it upLet loose and cut it upOr dance and fire it upAdults only playgroundAfter 7pm no kids are foundGet ready to chow downAnd clown aroundTequila Influenced Gutter balls and I'm out ;
First impression was great - the place looked real nice
I'm not sure why this place has such bad reviews
All-around great place to stop by when in Phoenix
I can't give this place a good recommendation
Scale of 1-10 multiple visits6 Food6 Service8 Atmosphere7 ValueI've given it a few tries and will make a change if needed after a few more visits but right now I'm pegging it at a 3 -- which for me is average not bad
So here goesRemember how good a fresh tomato tasted when you picked it right off the plant in your garden and you took that first bite of it
Overall I think it's a place you should definitely try when you're looking for a good gourmet burger
It would be a great place to take your family
Other than that it's a recommendable place if you just want to throw back a few drinks over good food
The food was just as good as any other nice Mexican place with less on the menu and comparable pricing
everything we had was good and our experience was fine but nothing about it the food atmosphere decor menu was spectacular
And what it is is a great place to go to get a quick bite of very tasty asian food
Friendly place with some great prices and interesting creative entrees
But it is the closest sushi place to my house and the quality of the food is pretty good
Quickly seated and greeted and although our table was at a busy corner we had a great perspective of the entire place most importantly the brick-oven
Tucked away in a charming neighborhood in Phoenix Postinos is a great place to enjoy some wine and bruschetta
Overall Switch is a beautiful restaurant with an upscale yet relaxed atmosphere perfect for late night dining
I live about a block away from Payton's Place and it's great to have such a nice sports bar nearby
I've been to Payton's Place many times during lunch and I think that because there are so many businesses close by they like to get people in and out really quickly so that's great
If you want a good cup of Joe this could be your place
Location is good and the place is definitely beautiful clean modern awesome
was a great place to chat with other dads
Great pottery docents and views make this museum a lovely place
The cocktails shorty versions of beer on tap and great happy hour specials make this a great place to chill out mid-day and have a few drinks especially if you are sitting outside
With 16 theaters they have a pretty good selection and the place is kept pretty clean
A little higher priced than I expected for such a divey place but the food was great and definitely hit the spot
Other than that it is a great place for a delicious and healthy dessert
It seems like it would be a great place for dinner and when the weather is nice to sit outside on the front patio
I can have good Mexican food a lot of places and for a lot less than $40 for two people dinner drinks tip
AZ Bread Company is a great place no doubt but I somehow feel let down
The big windows here are great for the ambient light they lend to the experience where you're eyes aren't hammered having to adjust to artificial light in dimly lit places
All in all it's a very safe place to bring your old ass grandparents and sketchy inlaws where you don't have to worry about freaking anyone out with a bad breakfast choice
A great place to have a few drinks during the week they have awesome specials on drink and food
Compared with other places it's a good value for the cost
Nice  service nice atmosphere as allways good food
Good place to meet a chick from myspace plenty of witnesses
Its a wonderfully relaxed enviroment and its someplace you can go by yourself too take a date or just meet up with people for wine or beer
Price $13 - basic which is great for me since i bring my own shampoo $15; and $17 premium treatment very affordableCustomer Service  This place rocks
Great food great booze club music atmosphere is pretty cool
i was quite shocked by what i saw and i told my friends who are now getting sketched out by the place remember i heard it was good
i give this place the 4 stars because the food is actually really good
It seems like a fun and fresh yes I have said that place and didnt pull its weight with such bad staff
Happy hour all day sunday is so nice and i wouldnt worry about some reviews of the neighborhood which i think is great and what attracted me in the first place
This place is organic natural and relaxed
I was excited to check out this place after reading all the great reviews on Yelp
I am sure you can find better Mediterranean food around town but this place is really good on your wallet and fits my needs just right
Upgraded fixtures and wooden hangers make this place super chic and with great bargins to be found
Its a good place to hang out and have some fun
The food is great the service is good and the atmosphere is pleasant
not fun loud but let's crank the bad early 90s alt rock and top 40 emo rock as loud as possible seemingly as catch all for the only demographics who will like this place- early 20s and late 40s and 50s who want to seem like they still know how to get down with the younger generation
again i recommend it as a place to go and be rowdy not to eat great sushi
With the exception of the out of place house music the fusion was executed to perfection
It's a great place for a business lunch dinner party or celebration
I have nothing bad to say about this place
Great place for families very kid friendly
I spent part of 2009 studying abroad in China and compared to some of the places I went to over there this is just as good
And considering we went for early happy hour and sat in the dining room we were the only table our server had at the time she still paid just the right amount of attention to us which is great because frequently in other places under those circumstances one will get forgotten about half the time
The class takes place out on the balcony so you still get those great views with the breeze that saved my life
Over all it is a great place and we will be back
Great place for Mexican Baked Goods Pan Dulce
It's a cute little cantina-like atmosphere with the dark hardwood throughout
This was such a great place to have a mini dinner party
The atmosphere was great and we even had a short conversation with a few of the other bar inhabitants
This is a great date place and I credit Z for suggesting it
It's not a bad place to go before a game I'd go back
While it's nice to be able to say that we rescued a golden not like our golden was abused or abandoned - the previous family had evidently taken good care of him for us the real selling point was their ability to match older pets to our lifestyle and having such a hassle free adoption process in place
The tikka masala wasn't as good as other places either
Will be great to have affordable high quality places in that area
My co-workers and I heard about this place through a listing of 20 great American Sandwich shops and it apparently even had an Oprah mention
It's not high quality and it's the furthest thing from good for you but if you're in the area and you want a greasy burger Rally's is a good place to try
OK -- not much else to add to what has already been said creepy looking place but knock your socks off good Mexican food
The ambience was a little old school but the food was great
I have had such a great experience with this place
If you're looking for a new place to get some good Chinese food I highly recommend giving Canton Dragon a try
There is not bad to say about this place go with a big group and indulge in the seafood tower its a must
I've eaten at many great restaurants around the world and this one hold a place close to my stomach
I love me some diner food and this is a good place to find it
It's cozy and comfy both in the lounge and in the theater and is a great place for a date-night
There is one area where they overseeded rye grass and it looks great unfortunately every place else is brown
This place has very good sandwiches and wraps
BLD is a cool place with a fantastic pedigree that I want so badly to like but it just won't let me
I still think the custard is what makes this place special but their other food is good too
My buddy said this place was a must for great breakfast food
I started out extremely hopeful because the basket of chips placed on the table were so good that I probably would have been satisfied not ordering an actual entree
First time I have eaten at Centurion and I think it's a great place
The farm at South Mountain in great place to bring family friends out-of-towners and it is incredible for kids
The Bad The parking DOES suck around noonish but lets be honest how many places in the Central Phoenix area have ideal parking
I would love to 5 star this place because I grew up in the area and have been here dozens of times and it had been great
Their fish and oyster selection look great so I will definitely be back because there really aren't that many places in Tempe with decent seafood
Like most great places a review isn't necessary so I haven't done so
The place is small and casual but clean and the service is usually just fine
I have rated this place a 5 because the place is just such a great setting
I think this would be a pretty great place to get married too and have the reception
Seems like it would be a great place for a birthday party
All in all it's not the most fancy place to go but its a good spot if you want to have some lunch do a little off track betting or just go for some drinks and food after work
its not too bad but your $20 will go a lot further other places
The new Scottsdale Quarter location has great ambience and service going for it but I was sorely disappointed by the quality of the pizza
The menu isn't huge and the atmosphere is casual and just so so but the food was fantastic
The Rojo Chili de La Casa is my go to unless they have a special like Machaca Tostada's or Country Benedict with sausage patties in place of Canadian HamThey are really good about keeping the drinks topped off
It's an all suite hotel so if you have kids or need more room its a good place to stay
Give me a great atmosphere tasty food made with fresh high quality ingredients good drinks AND be kind to my wallet then I'm yours
Overall review Clean great service great food great ambience
It is however a great place to watch a game there's tv's at every booth
The employee was incredibly insulting and unprofessional and that's why I am giving such a bad review for this place
I LOVE this place and with good reason Picazzo's has a separate gluten-free menu which can be found online for celiac sufferers as well as those who are more sensitive or allergic to the effects of wheat
It's a nice sized place and they have some good game stuff plus a stage and a good sized dance floor
It's also a great place to start a fun day of shopping at Fashion Square ;
I agree with most of the reviews the fries are awesome and its a great people watching place
I cannot recommend this place enough so good so delicious and the price doesn't factor into the quality at all
Next time it's off to Cafe Lalibela or any good italian or middle eastern place
The pizzas are pretty good if not slightly over priced but you're paying a bit for the atmosphere instead of a hole in the wall type joint
I wanted a place that's low key and has a good mellow vibe
5 stars**This place surprisingly is not half bad
Its a cute little place at the very end of a very sad empty strip mall but it holds it own with delicious food
For lunch this place is awesome as we got to sit outside on the couches got some GREAT cocktails not cheap though and my Pork Belly was really good
2nd experience 5 stars chill lunch atmosphere with good food and good drinks
I'm not a huge fan of frozen yogurt but this place is close to where I live and has a great environment
This is a place that is trying to be the snootiest restaurant ever while pretending to be a relaxed friendly environment
I think this is a great place if you have several little ones to feed though
Froz yog is not always the greatest but this place is so yummy
It is NOT a good place to watch sports despite what they say
Then I opted for the potato bacon soup which was very very good and the spinach shrimp salad with bacon dressing that was excellent also and for $7 that was amazing compared to Olive Garden for example
I think it would be a great place to take friends and share a bunch of dishes
Yes a tourist trap but that does not change the fact that it is a great place
We had good service there was a ton of people there - all who were raving about the place
Anyway - if you are looking for great Mexican Food in Queen Creek you need to hit this place up TODAY
Hey I like the place for its close proximity to our home for their consistently good California roll with a crab mix pork tenderloin entree avocado egg roll but it's not worth waiting 45 minutes
Not a bad place to hang out while you're waiting for your table
This is a great place to get work done hang out with a friend or read the NYT on a lazy Sunday morning
Also it's worth noting that this is a good place to come over for coffee and/or dessert after lunch next door at Pita Jungle
Even though they don't serve Sake they do a great job as a bring your own place
I have yet to find a sushi place in Phoenix that has fish as good as theirs it's not the best but it's the best I've had in the valley
Get their burger combo eat there in the nice clean atmosphere then unbuckle your belt because you will be stuffed full of great food
This is not the type of place where you would stop in for a meal before a show or event; when you come here this should be your only destination for the night and it is such a great experience that it will be enough
You just gave this great place a 2 for me
This is a great place to cover anything you might need
if you are looking for a great steak this place also ain't it
but if you are planning to show how much you can spend this place is a great place to do it
In the spring and fall months this is a great place to go with a group and just enjoy some drinks on their patio
It is a place to go and have a few drinks and listen to some great music
Fattoush and a few other places serve good lettuce
I'm from Chicago and so it's going to be rather difficult to outdo some of the places in good old Chi-Town

You know a place is 5 stars when they can get simple classic dishes to taste great
Great place for a good drink and tasty burger
Its a great place to go with a group of friends

My mom thought the decor was a little stark but good healthy food always trumps atmosphere for me
Its kinda the only thing that worksThe lounge area is a great place for a date the watermelon martini is killerthats not the right name but just say that they know what you mean
I don't have a bad thing to say about this place
I can get Thai food nearly as good for cheaper in Chandler where I live but for a date night out this place will do nicely
The mac and cheese was great as were the corn and carrots but jeez this place has no business serving fish and seafood
Not sure why it was not more busy the layout of this place is great as Amber W
The place looks great and the menu has some d-lish items but
I would definitely rank CB as simply a great place to hang out with friends
Very cute little place in the middle of Scottsdale Quarter especially like the foam art on the hot drinks
Lately I've rediscovered my love of a good quick coffee from a place that doesn't burn their espressodesperate times called for desperate measures and I stumbled upon their little gem called a Rocket Latte
It's suuuuuuch a nice bar great place to have a cocktail at
A great place to go for a little taste of some of Chicago
rrI sat down in a corner seat and relaxed while The Shins were wafting through the sound system which was fitting as it seemed like a Shins kind of place
I liked the ambiance and the outdoor seating it's a cute little place to grab a coffee but my husband and I won't be going out of our way to go here again
I would add Olive Garden to the list of good comparisons
Would be a great place for Mother's Day brunch
RA's the place you visit if you want a good deal on happy hour
Great atmosphere don't be fooled by the exterior incredible food
I would usually go with 4 stars for a place like this because the food is that good in my opinion but I am just tacking on the extra one this time for the nostalgia
Good seats and full theatre amenities made this one comfy place to check out the action
If this is true I will do my best to be a good girl the rest of my life - I am afraid this place with it's stink restrooms tasteless meat and strange mordern salad dressings strange for an old fashioned cowboy steakshouse anyway may very well be the hell I'd be sent to if my  good deeds didn't add up at final judgement
Great place to buy all manner of beauty supply products and I found the owner  at least I think she was to be very helpful
There is really no other place near me that I know of that is a good place to go and just get Ice Cream yogurt aside so that is why I am reviewing a Cold Stone
We come here and it is always good service is always the same the place is clean and there is never a wait or a long wait  I love the creations they have and my kids love em too
Overall a pleasant experience good service nice atmosphere and a great wine selection
Compared to my fav Vietnamese place in NJ I have to say this is not as good but it is plausible
That said had I not had the one bad experience I would recommend this place so hold onto your stuff and if everything goes ok you'll have a great stay
Oh service wasn't great but it hardly is at asian places - I'm not trying to be an asshole by saying that but I have experience with a few chinese/filipino grammas know what I'm sayin
If you're going for the atmosphere then this is a great place for you
I found Over Easy a great place for breakfast and enjoyed my visit with some friends
I live maybe 1/10 of a mile from this place so I wanted badly to like Spicy Pickle
What a great place to have a group dinner
I disagree somewhat with the reviewer who says place wasn't good for kids yes it is fine dining but we went pretty much when the doors opened for dinner few other diners at that time and we snagged a corner table relatively out of the way where we could keep our infant in her stroller
There's four big TVs placed across the bar but someone did a very bad job placing them in their spots
Overall the place isn't much to look at but the food is good
The place is not set up for relaxed dining
Great place to hang out with friends and catch a game
The only thing this placed rustled up was my disdain and a bad yelp review
We told them to go to Mable's on Main where you can go have an amazing cocktail in 'speak-easy-ish atmosphere' with great service and no wait for half the price
Lots of flat screen TV's in the bar area where we sat so it's probably a great place to watch Monday Night Football
A great place for a nice hot meal and a place to converse with your company
The original concept of this restaurant is actually interesting noodle dishes from all over the world and sound great on the website that is until you actually go to the place
Kind of hidden in a non-descript shopping strip this mom & pop place is a great find
I'd like to try this place on a regular night--I have a feeling the quality of the food can only improve and everything else was great
The atmosphere and service are still pretty good and the raspberry iced tea wasn't bad either
I would come here again but probably not during the afternoon since the atmosphere is kind of depressing but for a few evening drinks the Armadillo grill is a good choice
The website makes this place look really great
You can't have a bad Mexican place and start your restaurant name with Los huh
I picked this place based on the great Yelp reviews
The crowd was completely into the show and it looked like everyone was having a great time not a sour puss in the place
We truly liked the atmosphere the staff was super nice and they have a good variety of drinks to choose from
Cool hip ambience with pretty good but not great food at Corbin's in the undiscovered country of Sunnyslope
Go for the atmosphere and nice service if you find yourself in that neck of the woods but don't expect  greatness
People rave about this place & most of the reviews written are positive so maybe I went on an off day but seriously this place was not good at all
So I've been searching for a good pub to take in a few English soccer matches and grab some grub to replace the fantastic Ginger's in Chicago
For a place that charges almost 20 bucks a person you expect it to be great but what a let down it was
It's a hip place spacious and good atmosphere
They also have a great little breakfast joint tucked away in the middle of the place that has a pretty decent atmosphere
After the training I asked her if she had found any good Hong Kong style restaurants and she recommended this place
Just my kind of place--good food good service and good prices
When you walk in the place has the feel of the bad chains you see in airports
Got there early thank goodness because after 630 the place turns into a seriously overcrowded hot room of typical Scottsdale barbie dolls
Maybe I haven't tried anything else because I don't know what anything is but this place seems to be consistently good
Very happy to see that as most decent places here in South Chandler close their doors within their first year so we actually dont have many good choices down here
I read the other reviews of this place and cant believe that they had bad pizza or that its worse than Domino's
No its not a 'romantic' dinner type place but if youre going out for that you wouldnt be going for pizza anyway
With generous portions the place is really good about sharing
it's a great place to grab dinner from during the work week weekend lunch or grubbing food for a day watching sports
However  since I already know a place that is much cleaner cuter and with polite service I can't help but to see it as a negative
There is no way you can say the good things you say about this place and then give it only 4 stars
Good place for a basic HH with friends you want to see but not actually talk to it is pretty noisy in there and face it the pretty girls in reallly really small outfits are distracting and I'm a girl
I can literally walk to this place   Okay the Pho Tai is great here
I'm not knowledgeable about Cajun food but one person I know from Louisiana who has been to this place said it's Really really good
Talk about fresh food and great prices this place has it all
Proximity to the movie theater at Tempe Marketplace and speed of service are what brought us in great food and a nice counter girl keeps us coming back

The place is great; comfortable warm and inviting
We came out to Phoenix for a little spring training action and a good friend of mine was twisting my arm to give this place a shot
It's a great place for large groups as there are plenty of sections to hang out in throughout the place
Such a great place to sit in Arizona's beautiful spring weather
But back to this place WOW great food and YES all the food is killer don't go in there thinking this is the place for a light snack NO
In addition to the beer they have an amazing atmosphere and surprisingly good food
If Delux has a weakness it's an atmosphere that's a bit trendy and possibly even slightly pretentious but the burgers are so good that it's overruled
It's a great relaxing place to have a few drinks and soak up the company you're with
A great place to hang out at although the night we went it was slow
Good clean modern place to pick up some wine or beer to go with the food or for a friend's party
Okay so I'm a little biased because it's closer to my house but proximity aside the place has a great vibe and the service here is top-notch
Great service atmosphere and of course great food
Every time we have gone to Blue 32 we have had nothing but a great experience this place is a must
This place sucks so badly I won't even ride my bike near it for fear I'll get swooshed up inside like I'm in one of those drive-thru bank tubes or something
You can go to an upscale place where the servers are mature Italian men and it tastes pretty good
It's a great place though with a wonderful atmosphere even if it is tucked in a strip mall
Overall I think its a great placeI just don't reccommend the chicken for wuss's like myself
Both my friend and I loved the ambience the waiter was great patient and helpful
It's a really cute place tucked away in a strip mall on Camelback
I guess if The Good Egg was the only breakfast place around I'd give it 3 stars but every time someone suggests eating there here's my thought process How about Over Easy
I've found it's a great place to spend time reading in one of the large chairs or out on the patio
I'm not in Scottsdale that much but a great place to go with friends to just chat and enjoy some good food to please everyone
So by name alone this place sounds like it could be really good and I kind of wanted it to be good
Good location old town Scottsdale and neat atmosphere
Things that make it just like any other sushi joint virtually the entire menuService my two visits to this place have been great in terms of service
The atmosphere and location were great and the hot tattooed blond sitting at the counter was fun to flirt with I think she could tell the guy annoyed me
HORRIBLE SERVICE AND BAD ATTITUDES IS ALL I GOT FROM THIS PLACE
It's another one of those places I know I can get a good meal but leaves you searching for more if you like those rare finds that provide you with culinary perfection at the same price or the complete package for slightly more
The place is extremely small which makes it slightly uncomfortable like everyone can hear your conversation and you are sitting very close to other parties but don't let this scare you off because the food is very good
Although I wouldn't say this place is the best pizza in town it is very good and I would love to eat here again
Great place friendly no attitude and great service what more could you ask for
The value for the food at this place is also great
This is a small little sushi place so not really a place for large groups but great for small intimate groups
If a die-hard regular like me is contemplating finding another wing place you need to take a good hard look at what you've changed and CHANGE IT BACK
I haven't tried the shaved ice yet but this place also has a GIANT list of shaved iced flavors and offers a great deal on a variety of sizes
A great family atmosphere the waiters are attendant but not overwhelming
The Good Egg was a suggested place to meet for breakfast by local friends
Great casual place especially 3-6pm Happy Hour when most of the tacos appetizers are a dollar off
The place is very secluded has music playing in the hallways nice restaurants inside and great service from the staff
This is a great place for good single couple or family dining
This place is great in theory Tempe has a severe lack of cute cafu00e9s and Essence would seem to fit the bill outdoor patio small menu with organic local fare a simple no-frills coffee list u00e1 la Cartel
The atmosphere here is great it has a nice ambient back round noise the colors are calming and the drinking water has cucumber in it
The owners of this french style breakfast/brunch/lunch/whatever place have made a serious effort to create a unique and very relaxed dining experience
the outdoor patio is a great place to hang and the sliding door provides a nice indoor/outdoor space
Plus the funky old building has an awesome 6 pane wall window that is an awesome highlightOverall worth checking out great drinks good food and a fun atmosphere
Combined with their excellent wine menu great staff this place gets 5 stars in my book
A very relaxed kind of place to just enjoy the Phoenix weather the food and those you are with
The folks that run the place all seem like they LOVE what they do love talking to customers and take pride in what they do which is provide great food with some nice atmosphere
Great sound great views and great atmosphere
Overall it's a chill place to hear some good tunes and hang out with friends
We've had such a hard time finding a good traditional chinese place in Phoenix
I'm a big fan of Los Reyes De La Torta in Sunnyslope and was so happy to know there was a place just as good within driving range for lunch
The coffee was satisfactory the orange juice surprisingly good unlike at other places here where I have had fresh squeezed oj but $3
So all-in-all it was good but nothing so amazing which is what I've heard about this place
we had halibut checks kobe beef monk fish duck liver it was all amazing but its a improvisational restaurant the great thing is that the menu keeps changing so there is no limit to the possibilities that this restaurant can accomplish if you have a real passion food food this is not a place that you can skip
Good thing the food was good otherwise this place would be in trouble
A great place for any celebration since the main dining area has plenty of space to accommodate groups of 6 or more
Ruth's is a great place for dinner I could recommend a better steak in town but you still really can't go wrong here
SKINNY Great food but there were too many drawbacks to this place to keep me coming back again and again
I could have had good in a couple of dozen places for half the price
Anyway I thought the place was overall pretty good
The service was definitely good and the atmosphere was good too
It's a good place to go and linger over the food and conversation
This place could put some more effort into it's atmosphere and easily get four stars because they're great at the kind of food they're offering
This place is great - another staple to downtown phoenix
This place was super yummy and the price was good too
The furniture themselves were so exquisite that I could see the place having a totally different atmosphere if the walls were painted a muted light color with minimal decoration and the furniture themselves were highlighted  It would def enhance the dining experience and draw more people in because really the food and service was good
The place is indeed crammed floor to ceiling front to back with thrift store finds and ebay fodder; mostly vintage goods with a few funky modern things thrown in
The food the service the atmosphere - all great
Great place to take family after a game or out for a fun night
This place does breakfast realy good but they are open till 3pm and they do lunch as well
Still we waited-- there had to be a good reason this place got 4 stars
If your a 30 40's or even 50's couple looking for a hip crowd and great atmosphere note to self
To me it is more important to have a great atmosphere fun hip crowd
The free wifi is nice but there isn't a very comfortable place with good lighting to work in the rooms
Seriously this place is so amazingly good
Overall great place just don't mind everyone in their sweaty gym outfits from the yoga place or gym next door
Now i know why places with good food don't survive
I guess if you are only searching for a good-tasting steak and you don't know how to cook Fleming's is the place to go
After leaving my new favorite place we went to the Taste of Scottsdale and it was surprising that none of the food there was HALF as good as what Rokerij provided
First out the atmosphere is great very modern very open
So yes good food great place I would highly recommend
To summarize I know I get a little long winded if you want to eat light have some great sangria and want to be served by the Law and Order chick this is a really good place to do that
Great casual atmosphere - sorta retro trendy
this place is always a great spot for a yummy burger cooked to perfection
It's a nice family-run cafe - the food is good and is reasonably priced and I think this place has a lot of potential
There are lots of great shopping places to go here
The fire pits are also a great place to socialize when it's chilly out
But besides that the place is a mess there's a certain woman upfront who doesn't speak good English so it's hard to place an order
That would probably be a great place to star gaze on a clear night
The service was great waitress was awareI look like a hobo she avoided my stareI usually go commando undies I don't wearThis place was good and the food was fair
Despite the place being packed and our server being the only one in the bar area service was very good and very friendly
Imagine my delight to find Joe's Farm Grill which also gives free food on your birthday and provides the same casual atmosphere prices and good eats
Seems like a good place for group happy hours but not so much for a date
The atmosphere was nice The service was just ok took them awhile to take our order and come back for refills but over all it was a good meal
The atmosphere is lovely the service is always excellent and the variety and quality of the sushi is as good as anything we've had
I focused my sights on the garden pizza which took me by surprise because it was basically a chef-tossed salad on a really good pizza crust
I really liked the subdued atmosphere- white-clothed tables yet not too stuffy intimate bar area but still allowed for personal space; and music set to very low great for conversation or working w/ a laptop
Great feel to the place casual and ambient and open and just love it
I stopped here today after hearing so many good things about this place from my fellow clinicians
Great place to have a girl's night out too
Definitely a great place to have your sushi fix
Modern Steak is a great place for a girls' night out or a Mom's lunch
Although i would rather have a bad hand-crafted meal like they serve at Beckett's than a good heat-and-eat meal made at the Olive Garden factory in some far away place
If you're looking for a standard breakfast served hot this is a good place; but if you are looking for quicker service and something different I would go somewhere else
I was a little intimated I am not going to lie but I went and checked them out on good faith that my friend wouldn't have chosen a place he wasn't 100% sure of
They showed me their entire operation and I can't help but say that the transparency candidness and overall good vibes this place gives me the great pleasure of recommending them to any one I find out is looking for an engagement ring or other custom jewelry
I have been in search for a good Jewish deli place since I have left Chicago and have yet to find one to replace my favorite still back at home but for now this will suffice
Harlow's amazing and reliable food good friendly service the hot waitresses the eclectic mix of patrons and the four types of hot sauce on each and every table make this place my favorite
Earthy mellow and a great place to spend many study hours in
Back to the food -- The mock chicken was pretty good I could eat this in place of real chicken any day
Great Place to grab a cup of STRONG Coffee
A great place to sit and watch all the action that is going on of 5th st
This place looks great from the outside too
But yeah try it outoh and its a pretty small place not that good for groups
Great place to relax and have some great grub
I would go back because it was a great location nice staff cool place and really good steak
A good place to relax and meet  people and chill
First of all walking in to the place is already setting the mood for a great restaurant
The quality isn't as good as hay I've bought from other places Tranquility Trail kmshayloft online as it's less leafy with thinner blades of grass and more brown but the price can't be beat and it's relatively close-by compared to the other two
We had great service at RnR and the atmosphere was awesome
By upgrading to an ice cream sandwich or an entru00e9e-sized sundae with three flavors of ice cream toffee cookie pieces brownie bites torched marshmallows hot fudge sauce and the kitchen sink you'll not only leave satisfied and slightly ill in a good way but you'll get to appreciate why the place constantly basks in its own glory
Sakana is a great sushi place for the area that it is in
Aside from that gripe the place is good the food is delicious
Iruna is good enough to draw me back but I'm still seeking a 4- or 5-star tapas place in Scottsdale
Saw all the good stuff said about the place so I gave it a shot since it is real hard to find soul-food in Arizona
Otherwise then that the place has great hours friendly staff and most everything you would need for eating at home
I've been craving some New Mexican food lately and thought this was as good a place to start as any
The atmosphere is great although very dressy
I don't even know how I found this place but damn it's good
Finally a good place for Italian in this city
The restaurant has a great atmosphere
It's a great place to take kids large groups and out of towners
If you've been even to another location you know this place is great
The place is run by a family and the atmosphere is trendy or Modern tee hee but also relaxed and comfortable
I will definitely be returning and will put this in the portfolio as a great place for either business dinners or drink/app dates
I'm sure if they could make all the pieces fit together the place would be great
We were expecting it to be a good place especially since we read all the reviews on the Yelp
The place was empty and still we got bad service
I can't hate on a place too bad just because I can't afford it
This place does look a little dingy from the outside and when you first walk in but it's really not that bad
I love this place we have had many great dinners here over the years
This place serves great coffee great people arts music and comfort
Situated just outside of Old Town Scottsdale Scottsdale Stadium offers a great place to watch a game as well as a location that begs you to go out after it is over
Usually this means the visiting team takes BP on the main field making this a great place for autographs
Ignoring that fact Scottsdale Stadium is a great place to catch a game especially if you are in the East Valley
this is a nice place to take out-of-towners for a casual upscale meal with local flavor and atmosphere
This is a fun place at night and several dishes are quite good
There might be some better sandwich combinations out there on their extremly cluttered back wall it's actually not cute cause your menu is in 20 places but with the limited variety of meats it doesn't mean much
last week i was craving some good chinese food so i decited to try this place since is at the chinese cultural center honestly when i came in i was already safisfied since the restaurant its very pretty sometimes i hate go to bad looking places to get legit food
It's a good place when it's late and you're fiending for some food
Score   SCOrdered  Fish sliders excellent sturdy delicious all because of the toasted bunzzzzzzzzzz this small important detail seems to almost always go overlooked at so many placesnot hereits the very foundation of almost anything Damn Good not becoming soggy messy fast food crappy
A little disappointing because it is in a great location and there aren't many ramen places around
This place has a great little patio with a super friendly staff and great margaritas
Couple that with the best guacamole in the Valley and great dishes like there enchiladas de pollo this is a cant beat place
The place is pretty crowded for happy hour and during lunch but it's a great place to catch a game
Overall a great non-chain place for unique and delicious food
It's a casual cafe type of place but the food/prices are what you'd find at a fine dining restaurant
Overall a really fun place with a great selection of beer on tap and a fun chill crowd that isn't overly into themselves
I always loved Benihana as a kid and either I grew up and learned what good food really is or this place seriously went to crap
The decor was very cool - would be a good date place
Just like the original Pizzerias and Trattorias of Italy La Piazza is a place for friends and family to gather for good food
A good deal if you come back to this place multiple times
The only good thing about this place is that fountain drinks are free in the bingo hall so bring your empty 2-liter bottles to fill up & beer is $3
The atmosphere is very casual and nobody is hounding you while you browse
Can't really say anything bad about this place but it did not knock me off my feet
Service was very good and friendly place was clean and inviting
All in all it's a great little place to sit around drink your drinks and munch on some food
All in all I give this place a 3 stars since I see there is promise in this place a great local business run by the family that owns it
Overall I would say not a family friendly place during lunch hours but anytime after the lunch rush is good
Anyway I might be exaggerating but this place is really good
I've been to many places like this where I've had to eaten salt-sodden food and this place does a good job with seasoning
What a great place to have motorcycle meet-ups
by some friends who live in the area and said this place had GREAT breakfast food
But this place is filled with good natured and good hearted people
They make good drinks and there alot cheaper then some of the other places people go to have a drink
Overall Gallo Blanco will have a solid place in my brunch and casual dining rotation
My main viewpoint on Sakana is a great lunch place with killer specials where you get excellent value for your dollar
You know this place was actually not bad but one thing i will never stand is when the staff take themselves for granted and act like we have nothing better to do
This place made me wanna start a bad-food-diet
This place is about 20 minutes from where I live but it's definitely worth it and I haven't had a bad experience yet
This place is cute clean and very reasonably priced
I've heard such good things about this place and was expecting it to be good but unfortunately it was not
I ate it and the burger was okay but not as good as I have experienced at other comparable places
My coworkers and I tried this place out on a whim one night when we wanted some good Italian cooking and we successfully satisfied our cravings with Giuseppe's - we totally loved it
Ok ok 99% of that could be due to the FREE CORKAGE that they offer and I'm a sucker for free corkage but it's also an adorably quintessential family-owned Italian place that isn't fussy but serves great food
Good food relatively cheap and a cozy atmosphere
I was not wow'd by much even at places that had good reviews and disappointed I couldn't find a decent meal
The air was filled with live music and the atmosphere was relaxed and exciting at the same time
There's often a semi-long wait for a table here but that's generally always a good sign - The staff are always personable and attentive even when the place is packed
It's a nice place privately owned by someone who cares about the property since it's kept in great condition from the grounds to the parking and the rooms
Sushi Ken is a bright cheery place with good service and great food
I have been searching for a great rice bowl restaurant for a long time and I finally found the place
The bf and I tried this place the other night and I thought it was great
and a great place to cool off and get out of the heat of the day
There is no stadium seating however everyone that was in this particular theater I think there were maybe 50 people and that is being very generous everyone seemed to make sure not to sit directly in front of anyone else so no to block their view which is good for me because I am kinda short  The woman's bathroom that I found was on the other side of where the actual theater I was in and it had that scary movie feel as like I said the place was empty and going to that bathroom made me think of some crazy random scary movie scene taking place in the bathroom
I have no idea how this place is still in business if it is always that slow but for the prices its a great place to catch a movie
This place is very comfortable and a good 'chill' bar
It is not super dark or even very 'trendy' but they have good drinks and are a nice place to relax
The Coffee Plantation prides itself on the selling point that its Arizona Owned and Operated but unfortunately it is one of the few good things about this place
The location is the only other thing going for this place it is a great location for people watching on Mill and has a counter with stools facing the sidewalk and street
Like others have said the seating is great atmosphere vibe--none of the you're not cool enough to come in this coffee shop here
If you like your sandwich toasted this would be a good place to try
It's a great place to relax take the kids to read a book go on a date etc
The atmosphere is casual with a younger crowd at least the night I went
It's a cute little place has a few outdoor tables and good selection of liquor
I gave 2 stars because the only good thing about this place were the bloody Marys and the staff
That said I appreciate this local place that offers yelpers a 10 percent discount for some great food
I used to frequent another locally owned Tempe coffee shop to get my work done during the day and to visit with friends in the evenings but between good coffee drinks and a perfect laid back atmosphere OSP has definitely won me over
Located in DC Ranch Blue Wasabi is a small but cute little place with a nice patio out front
This is a great place to go out for happy hour because you can always hit one of the other bars in DC Ranch after if you feel like going out
Great location and nice outdoor seating make this place even better
If you're looking for a great place for a great meal whether eat in or carry out choose Andrews
So I wouldn't suggest this place if you're really wanting to look around and want a good quality liquor beer or wine
After reading all these great reviews I'm wondering if maybe I and my husband just ordered the wrong thing because we thought this place kind of sucked
The bottom line is the place might look beat up but the selection is great and the people will cut your fabric and even give you a little extra if they see some damage
but everything there is so good you'll want to try all 20 flavors most places only have 8 or 10
Oh and the atmosphere is awesome servers are great and if you are feeling up to it you can eat outside
I loved the atmosphere and the sushi was great
Visually the scene is stimulating bold splotches of color on the walls romantic gold leaf dramatic lighting rustic Old West funky art and decor and asymmetrical table placement creates a sense of artistic chaos and  charm
It is a wonderful place for a birthday dinner a romantic evening out or a fun night with friends
With all the great reviews this place has been getting I had to try it out
The place had a good amount of people even at around 4 pm
This is a great place to go if you are trying to satisfy your sushi craving
This place was good just not as good as I had hoped based on the reviews
I am honestly baffled that this horrible place has so many good reviews
I'd rather pay more and have really good sushi and great service than put up with this place just for the all you can eat option
I was thrilled at how good the meal was and even more thrilled to be celebrating with my friend at a place that has so much history within our friendship
The people-in-the-know realize that Carly's is a great place to avoid whenever there's a crowd on Roosevelt and a great place to hang out when it's locals-only I
A good place to try for a good mix of decently priced and good tasting Greek foods
We prefer the meals at the place on the Southern and Mesa Drive -- a Mexican bakery that also has good food
Lee Lee's is also a great place to buy more tame stuff like rice and soy sauce in bulk
Whole Foods in Tempe has such a great atmosphere wonderful employees and great great great food
My bottom line is this if you want good quality sushi and excellent service & attention then Sakana on Elliot is the place to go
I would say that it would as good as another deep dish pizza and if I wanted a deep dish pizza this is the place I would order it form but I don't think I will want another deep dish pizza
I wanted to like this place bad but it turns out this place was just plain bad
This place suffers from bad location and bad design
The MIM is a place that feels almost out of place in Phoenix - and I mean it in a good way
If you have traveled outside the USA and/or studied geography international studies or just enjoy some good tunes this place is for you
The place is clean the employees are clean I was greeted right away when I came in and I left FEELING like I got a good cut
A good iced tea makes my world a better place and Souvia Tea is the best place to get freshly brewed tea
Very casual atmosphere made up of everyone from college kids to young families on the early Sunday evening we were there
Decent service and overall good place especially for all you beer drinkers out there
But a good friend of mine suggested I check this place out and try the chicken shawerma sandwich
I think Macaroni Grill is a great place to take the fam little ones included
It's not so much a romantic date spot but it's still a fun lively place to have some good Italian food
The kiddie menu isn't bad either and if I remember right they give kids placemats to color on or something along those lines
Good food good drink comfortable and relatively authentic atmosphere
You can drive through or come in but no need to dress up if you dine in this place is casual to the max which I love for stuffing my face with a gyro you could go there in sweats
It's a good place for bargains because some stores like Nike Bath and Body Works JC Penny Gap Neiman Marcus Kay jewelers and a few others have their outlet stores here
The chain hawaiian bbq places are ok some are even good but Aloha Kitchen takes the cake
Our server was great my only complaint was that the place was pretty noisy it was tough to have a conversation in a normal voice
So if your looking for cool atmosphere a safe venue well lite parking lots and great music check out the brick house
We were one of only 2 other tables at 1130 but by 1230 when we left the place was packed so my advice is to go early or late if you want a really good experience
Seems like this can be a really great place with some tiny twists
They have a great base----great atmosphere and the knowledge to make food
Great patio atmosphere- fire pit star lanterns comfy couches lights in trees
I love this place because they have a good amount of dim sum dishes you can try
Other dim sum places are great but i tend to order alot of things that it's kinda pricey after picking too much stuff
This would also be a great place to order take out from
So there you have it if you aren't from NYC and you want an authentic taste of the big apple or if you ARE from the city and you want to annoy your non- native NYC friends while eating some pretty good pizza Grimaldi's in Scottsdale is the place
I think this place is going to be great in a couple of months
Great place to go if you like bacon which I do
It's places like this that give shops bad reputations
The only perk I can say with this place is that they have good jalapeno corn bread muffins
Great  little whole in the wall Sushi place
Thought it was a cool local place with yummy burgers but really just a health scare with very poor service unless you sit at the bar - the bartenders are always great service
All in all a nice reasonable dinner great atmosphere and family friendly
I probably won't go back to this place while the food wasn't terrible; it was far from good
I'm pretty confused at to why this place has gotten such good ratings
The decor and atmosphere is great with a very darkened interior yet just-right lighting over the tables/booths
It is also a great study place if you don't mind a somewhat noisy atmosphere
I little family run place with affordable prices and very good food
If u hit up Westgate its probably the best place to go cause they always bring a good crowd in the evening hours
I saw this place on Diner's Drive-In's and Dive's but I didn't realize I was close by until I saw it on my Yelp app for Android-which isn't as good as the iPhone app-BOOO
Also a great place for holiday decor throughout the year
As well as being a fantastic environment and atmosphere there is a great selection of microbrew beers the food there is really good and the bar staff are also very friendly welcoming and attentive
Awesome for you vinyl collectors and a great place to pick up an old turntable
I am pretty picky about food and we try to go to places with good flavor and it's not all about GIANT portions
If you want some slop pig sized portions I don't this is a good place for you
The country cute decor is something I can get over but the food was overpriced the service sucked and the place was super dirty
there should be an endless supplyBottom line  This is a great place to go if you want tasty food at a reasonable price
It's sad and depressing to watch slowly but surely a decent business and a fun place run into the ground going much the same direction apparently as the recently closed Maricopa and Phoenix locations of Teakwoods have gone by bad management and poor decisions who put profits over people
So my theory is that the casual atmosphere of West coast Hiltons contributes to the relative sloppiness of their service and therefore to the degeneration of their brand
Now it's pretty hard to screw up a hamburger but this place is above average in terms of a good burger
3*- Sides cole slaw hard & under season corn on the cob soggy & sweet potato fries nothing specialI feel really bad for the one waitress running all over the place
Out in North Scottsdale and Carefree they have some really great places too
A lovely evening of great food and company spent in a lovely atmosphere
Everything was great though services was a little slow but I assume that has to do with the old-school vibe of the place dark booths lots of gray hair and an old-school attention to detail and the thought that dining should be an experience enjoyed throughout the evening not 50 minute race for the check
If you're up in Cave Creek Tommy's brother owns a place called #1 brothers - also very good
The atmosphere at Fez is modern/trendy but relaxed
Looks like it would be a great place just to go for drinks and they did have some drinks on the menu that sounded excellent
I highly recommend this place the food tasted fresh service was awesome and the place also played good music
Scramble could be  a great place in my list of restaurants because of a few reasons
The coffee was quite good and I liked the atmosphere
It is hard to find a place with great green tea ice cream and sushi brokers has it
We decided to stop off at a much nicer place after being on the road forever and saw that this place was doing pretty good
Parking isn't great- its a hole in a wall place in a strip mall
There's an Osha Thai back home in SF that is really good and I've heard great raves about this place from my co-workers who claim to be thai food snobs
This place just reopened today after closing for a quick remodel so maybe being closed for a couple of weeks has made them forget how to give good customer service
Pretty good shared my sista's salad slightly better than what you can get for 6$ at another small Italian owned place
I can't say enough good things about this place
As we stood in line to purchase our tickets surrounded by families with young children we found out why it was so crazy busy  the Garden was hosting The Great Pumpkin Festival which happened to be the same exact weekend we were at the Garden
Try this place the service is friendly and the ambiance is relaxed and warm - definitely a great place for a date
The atmosphere is great and is somewhere you can just sort of hang out
Just because the server will take back a poorly mixed drink or charred beans doesn't make it a good place to eat and drink
Its also down the street from my office so I was hoping to find a great new lunch place
This is a great place to go for special events
I don't have anything bad to say about this place i'll pay the price of kickass italian food any day
This is one of the two places with good dogs I frequent that are like a block away from me
Malee's is the most spicy Thai food I've had in the Valley which is good because it satisfies my really crazy addiction to heat but it'sbad because most other places just can't live up to the heat standard Malee's has set
It's a fun place especially at night when the Cougars are out and on the hunt - great for people watching and relaxing but I think the drink ordering moment proved so uncomfortable for our server that she left us high-and-dry for the rest of the evening
Cute trendy place sushi rolls are decent not spectacular
The atmosphere is casually Euro-hip and the open kitchen is always bustling with excitement
Revo is such a great place both for the atmosphere and the food
Good lighting wood with suspension cables nice place settings and furniture
They've definitely got some good choices of food on the menu but somehow this place just didn't hold our attention like some other breakfast spots have
So you Badger and Packer lovers would probably love this place
Besides the food it is a great place to eat
Thank you Joe for having these great places to eat and thank you to your staff for taking care of all the customers the way they do
During the weekend it's ass to elbows and cramped but overall a good place to chill in the heart of Tempe
I have some mixed feelings here but am still going to give this place a good rating mainly because of their breakfast
I would've given this place 4 stars but the whole credit card debacle left a really bad taste in my mouth and I wouldn't ever go back to this place based on that alone
Plenty of electrical outlets and wifi make it a good place to work and nibble on the free bread samples and get coffee'd up while waiting
Anyway the best part about all this it's a local family owned business it's a great place with delicious food near the light rail and it's reasonably priced
The service is great and the atmosphere is fantastic
Great place for families too but get there by 530 if you are bringing the kiddos
What I like  great place for gifts and food items especially at Xmas time
I thought this place was a little strange but that's not a bad thing
The place has a great amount of sports running from hockey to basketball
I know of several other places with great pizza that are closer to me and who seem to care a little more about their customers' happiness
I have driven by this place so many times and said I want to try this place so bad
Overall the place is great and I have a feeling I will become a regular
For memories if you like to swim it's a great place to go
Amazing food awesome atmosphere and mostly good service
The food is good and everything we've tried we have really enjoyed but if you're looking for a breakfast place that will knock your socks off you won't find that here
and it doesn't need to because plenty of people like this place for exactly what it is A healthy reliable and affordable breakfast eatery that always delivers fresh tasty food with great service
It had so much potential - just get rid of the patchouli freaks raise the bar on food and drink options and the place could be great
I frequent the tiny village of Youngtown and to my dismay I can never find a good place for lunch
The place was packed on a Saturday afternoon that's usually a good sign
A good place to get a quick meal maybe watch some of the game
It is one of the nicer fast casual Greek places I have eve been too with a pretty wide selection of options
I am willing to try this place again and retract my low score but it better be damn good bagel or i'm going back to Einstein's
Yeah this place does make a for a great heat shield during the summer months but it can get very crowded and most of the stores are still abysmal
A great place and a welcome addition to the area
WINCO is a great place to do your grocery shopping
so this is for my northern Californians who are searching for a place as good as La Vic's I came here last fall after a night of drinking and of course like any other drunk person I just wanted some greasy ass mexican food
I'm not sure why this place has such great reviews
I had heard great things about this place and was very anxious to try it
Too bad great atmosphere and the Grind is the bomb but this is just mediocre
They have a great atmosphere with awesome live music and while it can get crowded on busy nights it's never so packed that you can't move around
The place was clean and the service was good
I had a good time at this place but it's not my typical places it wasn't really a dive bar it was more like a crackhead hang out the bartender was nice and hooked up the drinks
If you like a good hard cheap drink this is a good place to go but only if you think you can tolerate some of the crackheads that hang out in there I'm not saying everyone that hangs out there is a crackhead but there are some that hang out there forsure
finally got a chance to try this place out and I'm pleased to say that it is pretty darn good
It was a much more casual atmosphere than I was expecting
I love visiting Phoenix and finding these cute little places that are in remade old houses
Located in a good part of Phx/Scottsdale the school isn't the prettiest place to look at but that doesn't reflect on the school itself
Looks like a great place to bring the kids and mommy was happy as well with nice margaritas and free cotton candy
There are plenty of people that have claimed they found good Italian food here or there but when I tried it i found the places were serving something that may have included pasta but had nothing else in common with Italy
so now after years of searching to find really good Italian food in the Phoenix area  I can count all the really good places on one hand
For all it's worth the sound in this place is just OK but the sight lines are good for a place that holds 1000 people
Awesome place when you are trying to eat out and not feel bad about it
the place has great atmosphere and character
the bar is a great place to unwind with friends or meet new ones or have dinner
The atmosphere was more of a computer lab full of emo nerds in somebody's basement and I don't mean that in a good way
I just don't think there are many places here that serve good mediterranean style food for people to compare
Good food and a fun place to watch the game
Nevertheless I can't recommend this place enough for a casual yet delicious meal
While it must be stated that this isn't going to satisfy the Mexican food connoisseur I found this place to be pretty enjoyable and a good value to boot
Very colorful place clean and great service
I would of given this place 5 stars if it weren't for the odd waitor & the not so good white sangria
It's a cute hidden place great for a date night
I'm not sure how long the specials will last I was in on 5/21 but it is a great way to try the place out
If I want a really dynamite breakfast I will not come here but it is a good place that you can always count on to be good
ATMOSPHERE  Very lively with great energy for a Saturday afternoon
This place has no business being as good as it is
We should have read the reviews for this place before heading out - but we all love churros how could it be bad right
Good place but kitchen closes at midnight even on weekends
great place to drink burgers have been dry both times Ive ordered them even though I always get medium/medium-rate
This is a great place to hang out with friends
However Is worth the extra 3 minute drive down the road to Relish at the Phoenician if you want a truly good burger and an even better place to hang out for a similar price
But it's really great because beside Best Buy or Target there is no place to get cds or dvds any more
Really a fantastic place and one of the few examples where I see my tax dollars going to good use
Of course atmosphere and great coffee needs to be in balance and it definitely was at Echo
A surprising first for me is getting actual lunch at a coffee place and was pleasantly surprised to find the food was also really good
All in all it was a very pleasant and sophisticated atmosphere the food was great and the prices were in line with your typical TGI Friday's or Applebee's both of which pale by comparison
As you can see from the other reviews the panning of the clientele and possibly the food although I thought it was pretty good might make you not want to search for this place particularly since it's sushi
She drove us to look for another place  we found 7 dogs across the street and low and behold they are great and they have many of her former clients
They have somehow created this atmosphere of cool by the unique blend of class along with a little bad boy thrown in
It's simple quaint good service nice atmosphere and the price point isn't bad at all
I'm hopeful that with the success of 32 Shea other businesses will follow suit great service good food and good atmosphere creates a successful business
I've been trying to find good greens in phoenix and have yet to find any that take me to that happy place encountered the first time I had them back east somewhere
Not only was this huge but was also a good $5 cheaper for a 1/2 then most places in the valley charge
Now you know you have two places in phoenix that have great red velvet cake
It was a great place and I plan to go back
The place was surprisingly crowded- a very good sign
Now I have had bad experiences at places before you know the old hair that is obviously not mine in my food routine
Good sign that must mean that people like the place
Food wise this place is pretty good and inexpensive
The manager and most of the staff do a good job of being up-beat and excited helping the fun and friendly atmosphere
I've been waiting for a good sushi place to open up in Gilbert
Just local folks wanting a good dinner in a comfortable place
It is def a romantic place to go visit if you are in scottsdale - then it is a must see
Maybe it was an off day or the cooks were really busy due to the Sunday crowd but for a place known for wings they have a buffalo in their logo for goodness sakes
One of the servers almost made up for the place sucking so bad
Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco- This is how I found this place and it was a good taco but didn't stand with my other tacos in taste
What a great place to go for Homebrew Supplies
The location is nice because it's a good place to get your nails done before or after lunch given the food places right in the Quarters and across the street
The place was really cool the food was pretty good and the other employee was SO sweet but sadly all that was negated by the shat service by the bartender
Great coffee good atmosphere and a great addition to downtown
The vegetarian platter at this place is so good though that I really don't even have that desire
So bar food can be really good at a neighborhood place
TLC ranks up there with the good CA places I've eaten at
The atmosphere of the place is warm and cute
Carmine's also stands out as the only place that serves great breadsticks garlic sticks
Conclusion  North is pretty consistently a safe bet for a great meal service atmosphere etc
and it's a great place to take a guest as they will get to enjoy the beautiful Kierland Commons before/after the meal
I agree with another Yelper on here this place is not as bad as everyone states
Average in breakfast quality and price Chompie's is a great place to go if you're looking for brunch on the weekends
Overall I enjoy this place when I am looking for a good quick lunch
If your lookin' for a good strong margarita though this is the place
This whole experience has put a sour taste in my mouth about this place which is next door to the 'mediocre' Good Egg on Central
Inside is quaint but rather noisy outside is much more romantic and quiet where you'll find a fireplace really uncomfortable chairs that may leave a weird pattern of lines on your bare legs and candlelight
Great atmosphere casual or upper scale works just fine
It's a truly good atmosphere there and despite the pretty hipster crowd the air of smug arrogance isn't as prevalent from those who lounge there
Recently I found myself two weeks in a row having to kill time while working and this was the nearest place that sounded good in the area
For a nerd like myself this place is great
Great place to dress up a bit and feel more of an urban vibe
Everything about the place is just good- the people the atmosphere the food
I only like to review places that are either really good or really bad and I'm happy to say this one is really good
Plenty more food to try good atmosphere good price
There are plenty of tables and chairs and it looks like a great place to study read or  hang out with a friend or two

But this is more a testament that Postino is a great place to hang out than anything else
No but it is a solid lunch place with great quick and friendly service

So I hollared at the sis and consulted Yelp to see where a great BBQ place is
I have tried the so called great pizza from Oreganos Gilbert pizza Bucis and all of the other places and this kills them
I popped in not too long after and was completely impressed by the selection and the ladys duds are great BUT I find it hard to resist buying something for my mister everytime I walk in-from sweaters polos tees jackets belts the best hats ever to hand printed silk ties the place is classy and edgy a difficult combination to pull off
Atmosphere - We had a corner table that gave us great privacy
I was fortunate to have a good friend take me to this little gem of a place last Sunday
Check this place out the next time you're out in Old Town it's a good time
Oh good that's a great sign for a new place
I'm definitely planning on going back because Ihop doesn't cut it for me and we need a great breakfast place in this area
Even though the service was good I don't see my self running back to this place
Great sandwiches great crepes and a cool atmosphere
You literally feel like you are going down into a wine barrel where the atmosphere is very casual and comforting
Beautiful to see the gardens as night and wander quite romantic
It's got some drawbacks but this place delivers consistently good food at reasonable prices and has a good atmosphere and lots of 'life'
Overall I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place when we craving good Chinese food
Another good thing about this place unlike other taco stand type places I have patronized this one has never turned my GI tract into a Wal-Mart the day after thanksgiving
The place is great you can't beat the price and better yet you can't beat the taste
I guess maybe because it seems everyone already knows this place is great
You see Barrio Cafe nails the little things great art horchata served in empty Mexican coke bottles banana leafs on plates a fantastic mural pomegranate seeds in the guacamole a very enjoyable adobo flavored ketchup a hip ambience a smartly dressed wait staff - all very well done and deserving of stars
went there with a few friends on a sunday night and the atmosphere was a little more relaxed so I'm excited to go on a busier night and see what the energy is like
Location  they have several this one was convenientAmbience  big and noisy not necessarily a bad thing for a deliService  not good PV locationWould I return  yes BUT to the Scottsdale location which has better ambience and service because let's face it there are not a lot of full-menu Jewish deli's to choose from in the Phoenix area
Not necessarily bad but it seemed out of place
Great atmosphere delicious food friendly service and affordable pricing all contributed to my 5 star rating of Spotted Donkey Cantina
if you are luckily having salticious cravings and would like to experience edema and other related salt and water retention this is a great place
The seats are great whether you are behind home place or in the outfield
I guess people need a casual place to eat away from the silicon breast and botox crowd over at Kierland Commons
We also tried the apple pie pasty type dessert ~ also sooo heavenly even if you're stuffed from the dinner portion Great place to go for a date night out or with friends
I came here because my coworkers were all talking about how good this place was
It is a good place to take a large group and drink margaritas and celebrate and non-romantic event such as a birthday or graduation
Love this place it's in my top 5 list of places to frequent for good service experience
So glad that my quest for soda helped me discover a great burger place too
All in all the vast ability to customize a great tasting burger with an upbeat atmosphere made for a great night
I'm a big advocate of promoting a good spot so I've recommend this place to a number of people and every single one of them has gotten back to me and thanked me for the suggestion because they enjoyed there meal so much
The place is packed which is generally a good sign for me that means the food will be turning over quickly it has a lovely bar and a very nice piano player reminiscient of the Old Eddie V's heydays
The Talking Stick it's self is not a bad looking/running place as for 270

I recently found myself at Los Olivos for dinner and was reminded of just how great this place really is
And to top it off they have really good chips and salsa which to me can make or break a place
The other great thing about this place is the first room as you walk into the seating area
Yeah it was good but it was your normal fancy pizza that I figured most trendy places are doing
The place is clean and smells good no overpowering nail-polish smell and they are always on top of everything
Other than that they are great they have a TV to watch while you're waiting or sitting getting a mani/pedi the staff is talkative so it isn't awkward just sitting there and the atmosphere is good
The food is great the place is clean seating inside or outside their Saturday Breakfast is awesome and I don't want to get in trouble for telling you what kind of experience your mouth will have with the home made root beer
Outside of those small things this is a very good place to try different ways to make breakfast and other items
We were in AZ for Spring Training baseball games and needed a good place to grab some grub
Overall this is a great place for a casual and quiet afternoon snack and libation
-The decor wasn't great but honestly I don't really care what a place looks like if the food is good
It is upsetting that more people do not give small great places like this a chance
If you ever need a cheap eats night this would be a great place for it
What can't I say that's great about this place
Not the cleanliness place but I guess thats what makes it tastes so great
Overall I like Gallagher's it's a great place for some bar food and few beers
Not only is the food fantastic and consistent it has a great atmosphere and an adorable grocery shop next door
Too weird but the food was pretty good and this area is screaming for a good place
the bar is a great place to watch a game but the main dining room lacks seats so that everyone can see the game
It is still a great place if you are looking for cheap curtains to add a pop of color to a room or a cheap rug or two
The place is energizing with a cute color scheme and lots of seating both inside and out to socialize
The only good thing about this place is they have outdoor seating
The service is usually pretty good as well but its the food that makes this place a must visit
It's a great little place to get breakfast
Modern places like this are in short supply in Tempe/Phx so it is great for a quick brunch
The overall atmosphere is always inviting and honestly I can't say enough great things about this place
It's hard to provide a review of a specific time there since I go often but that should speak volumes since nobody would go back to a place over and over again if it weren't great
The grounds crew does a pretty good job of picking up trash but no matter how much they pick-up this place just needs some serious re-vamping
Tommy did place up nice and the new bar is great place to bring a date then have a fantastic meal
I'd give Sam's a 10 star rating but then again this is my first time reviewing a restaurant so it's a pleasure to start off my Yelp career with such a great and wonderful place
Mind you these family friends are from the Mid West and chose this place because they heard it had really great Mexican food
This place BLOWS and not in a good way
Overall not a bad place but nothing amazing
or your maybe trying to promote a business heck I even thought about how this is a great place to make shirts for organizations
Kierland is a great browsing mall because* It's not to big* Interesting shops* Lots of good restaurants* Nice atmosphereOne of the reasons I find myself at Kierland so often is because it is literally five if that minutes from my parents house
I have already been raving to my friends how good this place is and how we need to frequent coffee shops like this kind more often instead of our usual Starbucks
Great place to chat and concentrate away from the main throws of other well-worn coffee houses
This was a very good lunch place definitely somewhere I'll be back to
Mesa has a plethora of wonderful little restaurants and cafes with good food and good service and good prices so there's no reason to patronize a place that doesn't measure up
I went here on 2 nights 3 total visits with my first coming a few years ago  so I think I have a pretty good gauge of what this place is all about
The entire place isn't as bad as it looks has cheap drinks and everyone seemed pretty friendly
The food is quite good but what really makes this place is just how friendly the wait staff is
Definitely friendly personal and an all around great place
Then we were seated at a table right in front of the fireplace - how romantic
So whether you're looking for the perfect romantic meal or a place to impress a business client Quiessence will not disappoint
Anyway a great place to visit if your in the mood for a tongue torta and some mariachi music
The empty atmosphere and 'good enough' food drained me I think
If you are a night owl this is a great place to hang
I'd say all in all Fair Trade is a good place in a great location and uses best practices to obtain quality coffee including Pura Vida Coffee and Just Coffee which comes from a co-op of 50 families in Chiapas Mexico but man if they were only open throughout the weekends and into the evenings downtown would definitely benefit
It's a fun casual sports bar environment and a great place for bar food
All in all a very decent happy hour and a great atmosphere
It's my favorite place to get a good jog in and do a good bit of people watching at the same time
I have been to this place many many times and have had great times here
What it boils down to The place with the fairest price a good selection courteous and knowledgeable help got the big sale
I would have given this place 2 stars but the salsa was good and their Jalapeno cucumber margarita were both really good
Not a bad place as long as you enjoy good company but overall experience was just A-OK
OTHEROnly had one instance where a product went bad or was already bad and returning it was simple just show up show the product run over to get replacement
It's a cute place and the owner and staff was very friendly everything was clean
If you're looking for a place to kick up your feet get some good coffee and read a book - this is it
Some Big Apple employees have worked for the place three or four decades so the foundation of the Johnson legacy is very good
Regardless these are still great deals and there is no place else like it in town
It's got a cozy feeling and is a really great place to enjoy a glass of one or a fresh pint with friends before the main meal
Located central to the ASU Downtown Campus and other hot spots in the area this is a great place to visit for a quick lunch or to pick up some locally-sources goodies produce and other organic products
The good thing about this place is happy hour starts at 4pm and ends when the place closes
A little overpriced but a good little place for soup and panini's
However I can say that the food it very tasty the atmosphere is cute and quaint and the pickles are indeed spicy   O
I had heard many good things about this place so I finally decided to eat there
Pizza is a staple and its always good to find places where your craving can be satisfied
Pho was large with lots of good ingredients more than most Pho places would give you and their Spicy Chicken Wings are great too
There are many other Pho places to try around Tempe/Mesa and we would rather have good service and a pleasant dining experience than not
This is one place that requires a good 2 hour serving for dinner so be prepared
This place is great for dates long converstaions and those who need to stretch their time together
This is a great place to take a date as its fun to pick out three or four different items to share

Being pretty new to the Tempe area I have to say this place is great
The E61 bar is the perfect place for chic writers who enjoy a french press and good conversation
Not to mention I had my reservation in place for a good 5 months in advanced
I think it's hard to find places that are consistently average but even harder to find places that are consistently slightly above average well above average or hardest of all to find consistently great
manager was good enough to replace with a plain cooked steak but still a little salty
At the time I thought it was good very crowded and fun atmosphere
I recommend checking this place out for both the food and the casual atmosphere
I liked this place thought it was very cute
The water is good not like some places here where you can taste the pipes
They have a great atmosphere service and last but not least sushi
Every time I have been to Sakana there has been a group there celebrating some sort of special occasion birthdays particularly it seems like a great place for them too
Black Angus is definitely not the first place that I think of when it comes to steakhouses however its not bad
The actual meeting room was sectioned off in the rear of the restaurant this would make a great place for any after wedding rehearsal dinner seminar/luncheon or even possibly an upscale bridal shower
Its menu has a fairly sophisticated selection and for the price it's a pretty good deal for a swanky hotel bar place in down town PHX
I noticed that I was the only gringa in the place - a good sign that the food is muy authenitico
Sanitation was good and the place is handicapped aware
Love this place I think the food is really good I switch from Breakfast Burrito to an omlette eggs are always cooked perfectly
I was so happy to find an apple strudel like my great grandmother used to make that even though this place is a drive from me I'm in E Mesa I will definitely be making more trips here in the future
This is really one of my favorite places to get some good cajun food
Staff and music always good and you don't feel like you are in one of those ridiculous cirque du soleil type places in Scottsdale full of shiny happy young republicans nor one of the downtown spots full of emo salty better than thou modified arts types that think they are in the East Village circa 1980
The only really bad thing about this place is the parking
I give this place three stars because it's very inexpensive and allows people that just want to play a casual game of golf to do so without breaking the bank
We found this to be a good place to use as a base for a week's holiday while taking day-trips to the Grand Canyon Sedona Prescott Scottsdale the Phoenix Botanical Garden and so on
Again thanks to yelp for allowing me to find yet another great place
A great place to get a drink not so great for food without the poisoning
A dark ambivience atmosphere- perfect for a romantic dinner or a group of friends
This place is good for the novelty Greek dancing and a flame-blower but the food is only OK
There is a casual cafe a buffet a sushi place a deli a fine dining place on the 15th floor and soon there will be a jazz club
I also tried the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco I found this flavor strong unlike other Mexican places I have tried so that is good but I didn't really care for it
Ill probably never come here again because I'm not from Arizona but I do recommend this for a hip place to be it's got a great atmosphere and exceeded my non existant expectations of Asian food in Arizona
There are so many cute and delicious places other than here
It would make a really great date place especially if you splurged on the valet out front
Just visited the new location and came to the conclusion that this place thinks its too good for their own customers
Just one of many examples of why this place isn't good enough to take your money they think they are above the customer and we are just a number
such a great place to shop for cheap manga
It is a nice place and since they were always busy can only assume that the other technicians do as good of job as Molly
If you like eating good food in a disco with the beautiful plastic people who all look exactly the samethen this place is for you
If you like a really great burger and spectacular servicethis place is also for you
Ok went kinda spur of the moment the place was packed a good sign as I had never eaten here before and it is literally walking distance from my home anyway had their special green beans as an appetitizer while waiting on the sushi and OMG they were an amazing treat I never knew green beans could be sooo delicious
I am happy to find a good burger place that doesn't taste all greasy and with the gross oils they use now
Interesting food great quality elegant atmosphere and friendly service
The atmosphere may seem a little fancy-shmancy but its a pretty casual joint
A few years ago while i was still developing my palate i thought this place was great
AZcentral mentioned this as a great place to watch the World Cup
The place is great get a sunset reservation enjoy the bar food is good to excellent and bring your wallet
For Americanized Chinese food this place is freaking good
And if you're looking for a great group place reserve a private karaoke room
The atmosphere and decor here are pretty great
Great place to come if you're on the go and want something healthy and quick
After reading all the great reviews about this place I had to check it out
In Glendale this place is very popular since there aren't many good choices of ethnic food so this is a good substitute for those who don't care about authenticity since they may not know it if they ate it
With all of the new Sushi places and good reviews on here I wish we wouldn't have wasted the time or money at Kabuki
Definitely a great place to meet a significant other or good friend to lunch
It's a great place to hang out and have a beer outside in this large patio area
For those of you that make it a habit to eat good sushi I don't know if this place will satisfy you
This was one of the only places I have been to that cooks the steak rare plus, which provides all the melt-in-your-mouth goodness with a lot less blood that rare sometimes gives
It's a very fun and festive atmosphere juxtaposed with romantic candlelight-the best of both worlds
It would be a great place to take a date and sit outside
This kind of thing happens I'm sure but not to a place that is failing so bad that they have a whopping 4tables
If you don't mind bad service then at least heed my warning on a place that no joke serves you raw pork
It's been a few months since my first review so I thought I'd drop a quick line and let you know that Liberty Market is a good place
I found out about this place by accident through this site and noticed many reviews saying how great this place is
It's not the cutest place I've ever seen not the friendliest staff I've ever met but my god
Great place to fill up on drinks and grub at a fairly reasonable price and if you think it's expensive - it's worth every last penny
The atmosphere here is one that inspires friendship and good nature not drama and rumors
This is a great place for out of town guests dinner meetings or just a night out
In my humble opinion this place is one of the most romantic hotels in which I have ever stayed which says a bunch considering that it is in the middle of the desert and the thermometer reached 105 at the pool
I love this place cause it has a much more casual vibe and service is always quick and good here
The place isn't very big and has a great vibe to it
If your idea of good wine is some that comes in a box or is called Arbor Mist or White Zinfandel  this may be the place for you
This place has a fantastic set of brews including various seasonals and cask-conditioned beers all at a good price
What this place needs is a good ranger crew a good manager a better pro-shop staff and a concrete paver to fix the cart paths
The food is great and affordable - one of the least expensive BBQ places I've been too
They offer plenty of small tables to sit down and plug-in at and the atmosphere is great
Yeah the food is good and the atmosphere is loud and always hopping
And anyway there isn't a place in this State I've been to where a good weekend breakfast doesn't involve a wait
So while I won't be going there again for awhile it's not a bad place at all
We almost turned around when we noticed that we were the only car in the parking lot we have learned in the past that there is generally a good reason no one else is eating at a place and its best to skip it but the cute little historic house was just too inviting
We have never had a bad piece of sushi here - in fact my wife and I consider it to be kind of the standard by which we measure other places that serve sushi
The crowd is usally pretty good Thursday Friday & Saturday nights the club music type atmosphere is current relevant and helps keep you in high spirits
It's a good place to satisfy a Mexican craving when I'm sober
The front entrance is lined with rocking chairs and this location has water misters out there which is good because the only place I have been that is hotter than Buckeye is Needles Ca and i think Needles Ca is right underneath a hole in the Ozone
This is a great place to spend some time and re-charge for the road
I will say that you get a lot of food for what you pay so this place is definitely good value in my opinion
I had family in from out of town and i didn't know any good local places in Chandler to visit
I needed something to DO with her and it had to be close to someplace good for lunch
not bad considering how many WIN places I've found otherwise ****Also- looking at the picture of the menu their combo prices seem to be a MUCH better value than just purchasing full chickens or full orders of Carne asada
Had a great private room with large TV separate bathroom area fireplace and great saguaro populated view
Went to this place last night having read loads of great reviews
The place is grimy looking with an open kitchen that looks like it could use a good cleaning
It was a very casual atmosphere very much many AZ bars
I'll just add my 2 cents on how fun happening and great this place is
This place wasn't bad--I definitely prefer Pinkberry any day but until one opens up in Phoenix I suppose this will do
For a sit-down place they do a good job of getting you in an out at lunch time as well
The atmosphere is trendy casual while the prices are upscale casual
I heard very good things about this place from a few people
The furniture is all heavy wood an iron a signifier of the quality of the place but the placing is not the best leading to endless bumping and apologies the only thing that could be considered a bad point to this place
That means the place is not a Cheesecake Factory but merely a Cheesecake Depot where the real factory trucks in the baked goodies
The great bartender whose name escapes me now said this place changed their menu and is using better quality ingredients
Noodles were good thought broth needs a little more flavor but I can somewhat understand why most places go on the bland side
I think it's a great place for certain people
place has got a lot of sports schwag on the walls  It just now hit me there was a good reason for this place being called Hoosier
+Good FoodNice AtmosphereCool Schwag On WallsProximity To My Place-Single Diner Faux Pas
This place is great It was the first place i dined when I moved to the valley and i continue to go back
The place needs a good cleaning and fresh paint- top to bottom
Now most wine bars have wine and no or barely  any food - this place is an exception - Great Lunch and Dinner menu - an excellent  happy hour appetizer menu as well - love the individual pizza's
It is a great place to find a gift for the someone who is next to impossible to please
It is a great place to spend about twenty minutes and twenty dollars
It's a great place to go after work with a few friends for drinks but then I gotta drive home
The reason this place is pretty good is because they have things that are atypical of other mexican restaurants
Some people may feel that isn't bad for lunch at a seafood place however for the area the food which isn't like just from the ocean it's from a bag - it's way too much money and your gut will feel like a grease pit after eating here
I went here for Las Noches de las Luminarias a little over a week ago which I think runs through to the end of December and so I only saw the gardens at night but it was still a great discovery
Granted with this being holiday season you've got barbershop quartets bell ringers and people meandering around drunk on Irish coffee interspersed amongst the countless species of cactus but beyond that you've got great walks with several pathways leading you all over the garden
Any good city has places well-suited for kicking off a great night
One of the few great experiences i had out there back in LA now was going to their Good yes capital G food places they were really really really Good
I have also been in with my kid and they don't seem to mind the mess she makes with the rice and Ikura = thankfully she is older now O- They have great stuff like Toro oh yummmmm not too many places have it
The drinks prices are standard-high but then again its Scottsdale so you should know better but I still recommend this place rather than many of the nightclubs in the area because it has a rather big open seating/terrace where you can escape from sweaty men and armani exchange cologne and attempt to have a good time
Aaaaand despite me being ridiculously mean about this place I did have a good time but then again who doesn't when you are drinking heavily right
I really want to like this place but for now my opinion is that this little cute place still needs some work
How on earth is this place getting all these great reviews
I waited and waited for this place to open hoping for a good fast food Mexican restaurant
Unfortunately there are more places to eat in this town than I have meals in my budget so sometimes I opt for a new place rather than a good standby
Well at 7 pm on Friday this place is packed for good reason
If your in the area and looking for a great place to try go here
Still a good location just basic and if you dont need all the extra stuff this is the place for you
I don't know if that's a good thing or not ; Seriously I can't say enough good things about this place
My husband found this place online and because of the great reviews we decided to try it out during a trip out to Phoenix
We asked our concierge to recommend a place we could go that had pretty good food didn't have to get too dressed up but still had an interesting atmosphere
This is a great place to seal deals of all sorts
Well  being a Chicago native I can tell you that Rosati's was not necessarily one of my favorites but it IS a place at which real Chicagoans eat and it's pretty good
Ultra-disappointing--this place has some real potential given its location and great patio seating but the food is terrible and outrageously overpriced to boot
Super casual atmosphere good food served up quick with a little smak makes this place fetching
One of our favorite casual places in Old Town
The place is cute with all the pink but it could use a good deep cleaning
This place was supposed to have great burgers; mine came out cold without the fries we ordered without ketchup
Their food is pretty good but they have changed the menu so now I must review again after trying this place again to see if the changes make a difference
I am probably a horrible person to give my opinion on what good Chinese food is so I'll offer up my take on the service and ambiance of the place without pretending to know what I'm talking about in regards to how the food tasted
Jimmy Woo's had a patio on Scottsdale Road making it a good place to go for people-watching and inside there were lots of big booths as well as tables
Its location smack in the middle of Old Town Scottsdale makes it a great place for partiers to cruise to while they're clubbing it up since it's open until midnight every day
I'm spoiled living where I do in Tempe so close to about a dozen really good Thai places so your mileage may vary
While my wife was on the search for a good nail place in the Valley to replace the one she used to go to in San Francisco I took her here a few times
This place is fantastic as far as brew pubs go - great beer and great food to go with it
I'll definitely being frequenting this place as often as my stomach allows for the great ice cream and amazing costumer service
All in all a good place for a satisfying meal
And as many of you already know this place does a sandwich good
I was there with a friend for lunch and the place was hopping with a good crowd
I cant say enough good things about this place
again
5	Hillside spot is a great place for lunch
So there's not much to compare this to in Gila Bend but I can compare it to places in San Diego and I have to say - Damn Good
A while back I had a friend visiting and we were talking about things that he wanted to do and he mentioned that the last time he was in Arizona he went o this really good pizza place
I've never noticed a line out the door that would put the system to good use but it hardly takes anything away from the place other than it is difficult to ask the employees what is good or what the hell 'B' means
I think its a bad thing but others love  this place
This mexican bitter chocolate sauce had no place on food at all but I've heard a lot of great things about it so maybe it's just my personal taste
I don't like it when places look like subway inside if I am on a date no matter how good the food
But the rare gems of places with good food and a date atmosphere that isn't so trendy that I will be wasting an hour sitting are where I want to go with my girl for dinner
The many trees and patio tables set an  intimate and romantic atmosphere to enjoy a glass or three of wine
What I had today included tasty garlic Naan bread served piping hot at the table great salad for an Indian place Chana Masala sort of a chickpea soup Mushroom Bhajee no clue but it's good
Alright boys get past the fact that it's a little chick centric Arcadia Farms is a great place to grab a light bite but leave feeling satisfied and content
-Atmosphere is great-There's free parking around the back and in the front
I'm convinced the only reason this place gets good reviews is that people are too embarrassed to give it an honest review after they just waited 3 hrs for a crappy pizza
They are a bit overpriced but if you can afford it it's a pretty good place to live especially since you'll get your own Washer and Dryer in your unit
One of the most romantic places I've ever eaten dinner is at Michelina's in Phoenix and if you haven't been there yet I suggest you set up your next date there now
While not a stunning polished restaurant by any stretch of the imagination Khai Hoan is an impeccably clean little family place cooking simple good food in a strip mall on Apache Blvd
Saguaro Lake is a great place to beat the heat in the valley of the sun
Kind of like ESPN Cafe meets Hard Rock Cafe you've got a great combination that offers quality American bar-style food with an energetic atmosphere
The atmosphere is great with upbeat music
If they were really a bad place as the others make it sound I don't understand why there would be over twenty bikes and atv's in back getting serviced
They are a great local place I want to keep frequenting but if I have to continually remind them what's in their antipasto platter
Compared to other fast-food Japanese there are other places I would frequent more but if I'm in the area it's a good choice for quick Asian food
Scale of 1-10 multiple visits10 Food10 Service8 Atmosphere8 ValueNumerous times since Verde shut its doors have I sat eyes glazed over longing absent mindedly for a good horchata
Did not really get to much because I  was not that hungry but will say this about the place it was clean the staff was friendly and knowledgeable and the bits and pieces I did try from picking at my friends food was good
This would be a great date place especially on a chilly night
great food solid value excellent service and nice atmosphere
It is a great little coffee shop with patio seating and lots of places to relax inside as well
5Didnt even know about this place but had to pick up a pizza at Pizza Hut next door on a holiday since my work address doesnt have a manned lobby for the deilvery guy to deliver Anyways Tried the PICADO Gyrothe Breading was really good didnt break apart like other placesThe meat a whole lotta meat too was consitantly seasoned and the fixins were not overpowering
This is a great place for coffee but if you want to sit and study Starbucks is quieter after a large order of blended coffees blender get it
The Clarendon Hotel is a great place to hang out all summer and winter long even if you're not staying over night
I heard lots of good stuff regarding this place so I decided to check it out and here's what I concluded1
The beans and rice were good and reminded me of what I'm used to in certain place ins California
This place is a must see on the casual bar tour of Scottsdale
Smoking inside and there is a cute bar outside for those who crave the outdoors Like I said before this place is great for your tour of Scottsdale bars  Catch yourself enjoying a good time at Drinx
the ribs are very good shakes = good atmosphere good
It's too bad because she really has been wanting full hair removal service and now we gotta find another place
There was live music playing in their bar up front and the ambience was perfect for catching up with a good friend
Please go to The Place if you are down for great food great service great prices
This is a good place to go on a Thursday not so great on a Tuesday
The place was virtually empty so at the very least we could enjoy great service right
Great atmosphere with bright colors Dia de los Muertes theme luchadors and sugar skulls
Soma Cafe gives us another great place to eat a tasty meal that won't add junk to your trunk
After reading some good reviews my hubby and I were anxious to try this place boasting wood fired artisan type pizza
Coming from San Francisco which boasts some great places current fave is Beretta on Valencia - OMG we were really missing some great flavorful pie
So normally I like this place and the corned beef and cabbage have been quite good
I have generally had their muffins and baked goods as a take out and they have always been excellent but there are far better places to spend your money on a soup/salad and sandwich
If you are looking for great food and a fun atmosphere I definitely recommend this place
I will probably never go back to Geisha for a meal but it is a good place for drinks at the bar with friends on the weekend
This place really is great -- but it is HOT
Overall the library was great i will be going back when i need a great place to sit down and study though i wish there was a little more space
Oddly enough it's a good place to go for a quiet night
That's probably not a good thing for a place with so much real estate - this place should be buzzing at all times
I wish some of the rude wait staff would quit or get fired because they give the place a bad rep
So overall sounds like I am bashing this restaurant I am not but I am dieing to find a reason to go back because there is something good about it the atmosphere the lighting the seasonal menu
There are many places in this town that have a great menu or a piece of local flare or maybe a cool patio but there are few establishments that offer all of the above and fresh quality ingredients a decent 'casual afternoon' wine list and kick-ass iced tea and lemonade with a splash of femininity all over it
Definitely on my list of places to hit for good food on my next Tempe visit
I was spending the day with my aunt and cousin so I wanted a place that had great food and plenty of it  they like to eat to lol and claim jumper was near by
Anyone who knows me knows that bad service is a deal breaker when deciding if and when I will return to a place but when it comes to eating here I guess I have to bend if not brake my own rule lol
Really cute place with a modern hipster vibe
Among inexpensive pizza delivery places I think this particular Domino's is pretty damn good
Start off with the bad the place was packed several months ago when I went with a small group
Its a good place to go every so often when it is too hot to do anything else
The smiling good looking staff make it a great place to chit chat with friends and spend a happy evening hanging out
The atmosphere is relaxed with a very open feel to the floor plan
It's a great looking place and probably cost millions
A great addition to Tempe Marketplace The Thirsty Lion provides a great atmosphere a wonderful selection of beers on tap and reasonable prices
The service can be spotty previously Maria-Maria they're still a fairly new establishment but the great atmosphere and food makes up for it
Don't overlook this place while in the Phoenix area especially if you want a great homemade breakfast or reasonably priced lunch
You just can't find many places these days that serve up homemade food that's almost as good as Mom's
I typically like to stay away from chain restaurants but the mister and I were looking for a cheap place and served good food
I love how the restaurant is open to the outside making it a great place to sit wherever you may be seated
This place is good for a date happy hour or just hanging with friends
Still love this place for a great neighborhood joint with good portions at a reasonable price
This is a great place to get fresh organic and other unique food products
I do go there every now and then and it's a good place for a beer with a few friends but I avoid it when it's busy and I usually don't get food
The place is cute with it's family style tables and very tight seating
The place is decent sized and pretty laid back which can be great on a Friday
This is a great place to get a quality inexpensive place for the whole family
This place is where you go for great cabbage rolls
If you're not into laughing being positive and casual and openly social with everyone at a dive bar    this place won't be good for you and you won't be good for it
the chicken must be really good because there's nothing about this place that would make me want to return
For a quick bite to eat it's a good place to go for Speedy Gonzales Mexican food
I really like where it is its a cute little place that is very easy to find
I personally have not had a good experience with this place but I respect the fact that a majority of the reviewers for it have
I feel bad for this place because you can tell they spent a ton on it but unless their service dramatically improves I can not see this place keeping its doors open for very long
There are good things and not-so-good things about this place
Not a bad place for a wing fix at lunch time
I'm usually very cautious about doing so in places that are not near the water I'm from Baltimore after all and it was surprisingly good and as was the fruit and potatoes
In additional to the great atmosphere delicious high-quality food great drink prices outstanding happy hour warm and attentive service they also have GREAT hours especially for an Asian restaurant
Went here really looking forward to some reasonable food and a great atmosphere
Service was not great either with servers running all over the place but none of them actually caring about the people they were serving
Okay the only reason I'm not giving this place a complete 5 star is because of the I'm too good to be serving you waitress we got
Sometimes patrons try a place out and its just a bad day - the kitchen is off the waiters are slammed the manager just got divorced
Now I ask you fellow Yelpers when a place gives you bad food and bad service - what rating are you supposed to give them
The place seems a little small but has a great layout and decor
Great place to meet up with a crowd grub and pound some craft brew
Ive noticed people complain about the price of bowling honestly it's a fair price because it includes the ambiance as well and the music and good vibe this place gets
For a boba drink fan like me it is still rare to find a tea place that has authentic tea and not just milk powder hot or cold tea choices and boba and tea that taste great individually or separately
This place isn't great but it isn't horrible
It's one of those cheers-esque places where everybody knows your name  I will be a life-long customer because this place really knows how to do good fresh food
im not a sandwich person and this place doesnt have the good italian pastas that i would order
Heard through friends that this is the place to go for good ol' Chicago food
My journey to find the yummiest pho is not complete but this place is great and tops my list especially considering it's so close to home

My wife and I are big fans of sushi but couldn't find a good place around
Fresh seafood fun atmosphere great service
This bakery is a great place to get prepared foods and baking ingredients that are gluten free and they sell great stuff
It is a great place to take a guy to shop for his first interview suit dress shirts casual off-season pieces thermals and sweaters are so cheap here since you can only wear them for maybe 8-weeks year in PHX
Decor & Service  2/5 below average Cafe is a good way to describe this place's decor style and ordering method
This place is nestled into a great little area of shops and cute patio homes small businesses and a school
They have a great atmosphere the inside has roll-up garage doors and there is a huge patio
As it got darker the place took on a very sexy relaxed vibe
Good atmosphere good food reasonable prices and friendly service
I've been here a few times and its been a good place to bowl
The place is super clean bandwidth is very good and the staff are friendly
This place is more for Americanized rolls which aren't too bad and they have interesting combos so I'll bump it up a 1/2 star for creativity

Not cool in a I wear D&G sun glasses and think RA has amazing sushi kind of way but cool in a this place has great food who the hell cares what it looks like kind of way
I am so disappointed this place isn't good
PositivesI'm Indian and I can assure you this place is good
The atmosphere is excellent staff always helpful prices are good and the place is ACTUALLY organized
My hole in the wall places do just as good a job for much less
I couldn't believe it was possible for a place to suck this bad
I had a great experience at the place the owner used to own downtown and boy I was primed
The restaurant is set up as a sort of casual rustic italian sort of place like the ones I've seen in Naples and that is a nice bit of Italian drama theater though taking it to the point of serving the wine in small water glasses a little too authentic
lets just say relative to the price I didn't think it was all that great nothing I had felt like this place was worth a second visit
Overall it's a good place to take out-of-town friends and family
It's just a great place to get lunch with a friend or a colleague dinner too
It had a dark and romantic vibe with burnt orange walls that gave it a warm and cozy atmosphere
Overall an impressive setup with great food that can be reasonably priced if you order correctly and have your cocktails someplace else
I am sure this place will be rated down and that is too bad
So the food here is good but not one of those places where you feel the need to return to try more things
it's a good go to place for a great lunch or snack
I will certainly recommend this little place to anyone looking for great tacos
I am really happy for America and her husband to open another shop especially in such a good food lacking place like AZ mills
It's a great place to cool off on a hot summer day
This is a very diverse place and has such charm that it can be a casual afternoon place to go or a dress up date night occasion
Well recently tried this place on my break and it wasn't bad
Unlike many other Yelpers I was not at all impressed with the decor of the place and the live music while a good concept was pretty awful
Meaning if you are looking for FANTASTIC food that is real for good prices and GREAT service this is the place
And although this is a very clean family atmosphere it also has a great bar
I'm sure at some point I'll cave in and return if I can't find a replacement deli but it sure would be great if they could improve the service
Defiantly a fan I have heard nothing but great things about this place but always forgot it was there until we were at the target and starving
I'd say this would be a good time to check out the pastries but depending on how busy HS gets you may want to place all of your order selections in the beginning and get it over w/
They truly set up what I'd imagine is a great bier garden experience even though I've never actually been to one
This is certainly a great place to enjoy the views and hang out with friends
Dos Gringos is a good place to go grab some drinks and some food to snack on
This is a family place and very loud but the food is good and everyone is happy
Hint We went across the street for ice cream afterward to a kitschy sundae place and it was great
Great place for an indulgence So the price point is a little higher than the average person may want to pay every day of the week but what you get is well worth it
It's okay but not nearly as good as I expected from such a hyped place
I don't know how long Stan's has been on Mill Avenue but this place is GREAT
It's a great place with a great menu and variety of food
This is a great place to come for  a cheap fast working lunch
Great Atmosphere Average FoodIt was a beautiful Sunday night not too hot or too cool so my boyfriend and I thought we'd try out Margaritaville
We sat outside which created a relaxed and pleasant atmosphere
This sort of place for drinks and good food after and in-between classes is lacking outside of Mill Ave
disclaimer not super expensive but food wasn't great and other burger places are a few $$ less - and betterLong story short there are too many other good places to eat burger and non-burger in Scottsdale
The place is super cute with the neat restaurants and the juice bar
A great neighborhood restaurant with quality food nice atmosphere and no attitude
It's a great place to introduce Thai food ewbies because the food is great and the menu has lots of photos of the entrees

We loved this place it's got a real great feel from the friendly staff who are passionate about their food and explain the process offer samples to the fact that they clearly are swedes
one bad this about this place is that every time i get a half dozen bagels i get charge a totally different prices on 3 occasions what's up with that
If your in North Phoenix and in the mood for a great burger a cool atmosphere and a tall glass of Sonoran draft root-beer make it a point to stop by have a seat and ask for General manager Courtney Cowan
I hate when places do that too but its a rough economy and the owner have always been super cool with me so that stuff doesn't bother me I guess since the food is good
This place was pretty good but it didn't blow me away
Since moving to Scottsdale 2 months ago I have yet to find a good place to eat breakfast
Cute place but definitely could be more organized
Great food and service nice atmosphere
I gotta admit that we Phoenicians are spoiled with our many drive-thru mexican fast food places and I'm spoiled knowing the greasy goodness of los betos
Cibo is a great place to bring someone who doesn't know about it already you'll score some cool points for being in the know
I went on vacation with a friend and searched around the internet for a good place B
This place was soo good we went back again on another trip to the Grand Canyon
The regular staff is also cool and helpful and the fact the place is open 24 hours helps my weird-work-hour self out  Again I'd recommend them but I don't want everybody gettin' in on MY goods so stay away
Don't expect your waiter to be a wine expert- or even know what a mimosa is during Sunday brunch- but it is a cute little place with lots of fun memorabilia
Great sushi place for lunch or dinner and right on the light rail
This is a cool place for brunch good service good selection and decent prices it's even close to Old Town go figure  I had the salmon flat bread pizza with creme freshe capers and arugula this was perfectly paired with a nice strong cup of coffee served in a clear plastic glass
Joe Johnston always respectful of Gilbert's history and people has opened a great place to grab a casual meal with family and friends
This is a great place to go during the day when you are awaiting for your red eye flight back to the East Coast you won't see anything like it east of I-95
But the place as a whole is relaxed and comfortable and had the most wonderful sofa chairs in the world
If I lived in the area I'd say it would be a fantastic place to gather or meet up at or to have a quaint breakfast or as in my case a great place to get a morning cup of coffee
Both items were excellent and the rice and beans were extremely tasty and I'm so glad as we haven't found many places with good beans
I love that my friend suggested this place because it was a great find
Some of the items are not as good of quality as I would expect when compared to a place like Crate and Barrel but they compete with the other place that Buz Light Year shops at ~ to Infinity and B-Bath and Beyond
For a place that isn't even that pretty or romantic or modern or stylish I'm puzzled by its popularity because I've had better pizza at countless places and have dined at spots with more attractive ambiance-all for far better deals
I'm glad I went to this place when there was no line and the food was good
and I must say for the size of this location and the limited menu its still a great place to eat at if you're craving pinoy food
I must say it is a great place to go when your craving some good authentic Soul Food and waffles
It always cheeses me when places don't offer a good lunch special
But the burgers here are just eh they have good flavor but to me a true burger enthusiast should want a simple burger and not have tons and tons of toppings or options and I find almost every burger place now-a-days does this
A great place for a large gathering for a party
The place is usually pretty busy since its in a busy strip of town and the service is pretty good
While the atmosphere is cute and cozy the staff uber friendly and hospitable the food was pretty terrible
Walking through the resort's courtyards to the restaurant reminded me of what a nice place the Princess really is and put me in a relaxed frame of mind
I am catholic and it's hard to find good restaurants for Fish Fridays during Lent- I will steer clear of this place
I was spontaneous one day and wanted to find a great place to sit and work and I found Mama Javas
I hope this place stays open because it's one of the few places where you can get good Mexican take out
Overall this place is pretty good and is definitely a nice break from places like Subway
I have a feeling that if Tony and his gang would have looked for an alternative to the BadaBing they might have opted for someplace just like this
I took my 2 daughters 13 and 15 on their first horseback ride here and I cant say enough good hings about this place
Saw this place on a couple of Food Network shows and it sounded good so we headed on down to try it out
This place is really only good for going and having a few of their beers on the patio and people watching
Overall a lively but romantic place with character good food and decent service
It was a first rate hotel and a great place to stay
The best late night place to go great food and with Laura back the best service around as far as I am concerned every waitress in the world should go and watch her work you could definitely learn a few things
We need good places to eat in Fountain Hills
I think the place has potential but my first outing was not so great
This place was great - from ambience to food to wait staff
I'm not gonna lie I like a good buffet and the fact that this place has a lot of variety helps in the star department period
i've tried all the thai places downtown frankly the others are not good
The wait staff is great and the building is an old home with such a great ambiance to it that you cannot help but have a great time at this place
Whether you are looking for a date place or a place to go with a bunch of friend and share great conversation this place will work great for you
This place used to have a pretty good atmosphere and fun crowd
Otherwise though this place was great and definitely worth the money
This HomeGoods location is pretty awesome and one of my favourite places to pick up random crap
We got an amazingly soft and awesome-looking huge rug there for a great price as well as lots of random glass vases plates crystal pieces and even Voss also at a good price compared to other places and it's my favourite water
i think Ra wants to be known as a late night hot spot as opposed to a place you can find good sushi
anyways for me this place had such a great mix of traditional sushi japanese grill there is fancy name for it but I can't remember small cooked plates and some cool creative dishes like red snapper carpaccio it was my fav
Plus it's great when a place quotes a price for work and sticks to that price; no unwanted surprises= me happy
Hey this place was very good in fact we split the wings and a burger with fries
Yes the ambience is nice the people are beautiful and the service is great but its the food that has brought me here four times in two months
Besides the few tables literally like 5 in the whole place he has done a good job with the inside especially in the seedy location
What a great place to take a bunch of hard working production staff who love pizza for lunch
This place has a great deal of outdoor space but it's secluded
This is a great place to have a conversation an informal biz meetinga group discussion
Tell your neighborhood association that you've found a great mellow place to have your next subcommittee meeting
I hate to give this place a great review
I really try to give good feedback on Yelp but this place is flawless
I hope that maybe I just caught the employee's on a bad night or something but I do not think I'll be returning to that place anytime in the future
This is a great place for BBQ if your in the area
It is a great relaxing place to spend a cool day
It has the atmosphere of some great coffee houses of my college years
My recommendation for SR is it's a great place to stop in for drinks and cotton candy especially when you have friends in town
hehe he said he heard this place was good from his friend so we decided to try it
We found a pretty good place for sushi rolls and Japanese entrees
The service is great and a great place for a date night
All in all BROSENbRUS' super laid back atmosphere calls for a good time and a good meal
Overall the place is really clean and the froyo was good albeit a little icier than what I like
This place actually gets packed once the weather cools down because the outdoor seating is great and connected to the bar
Besides that Five Guys is a good burger place it might not be the end all to all other burger places but it definitely has potential to be in anyone's top choices
As other yelpers have found based on the four star rating achieved this place is a good find
Its great for dates great place to impress out of towners and just a great gem of Scottsdale
The second night the place was packed it took even longer to get our food it was unbelievably hot inside BUT our waiter was great and the good was good
The atmosphere is great and it usually has just the right amount of people there
Sometimes it can be busy and loud with kids and the service can be slow during those times but it's always a good place for a quick bite
I would still recommend this place but I would definitely check the other apartments in the area first that are comparable in price because you can probably find apartments just as great that having more parking and better management
My trip to the Improv was bitter sweet the comedy acts where great & funny but this review is on the place and in a few days it won't matter
But I have to say I will miss Tempe Improv it was always a great place to go with friends or dates
I cannot say a single thing bad about this place
the kids menu looked awesome  So glad to have a great place to eat here in the hood
Overall the place was good and I'd like to go back maybe for brunch but I hope the service improves
Chompies is not a bad place to grab a bite if you desperately want deli and desperately want to spend a lot of money
There are better BBQ places in the country such as Spring Creek BBQ in Texas and Jim 'N Nicks in Alabama but I highly recommend it whether you live in the Valley or are visiting from anywhere in the country including the places with great BBQ
I can't say enough great things about this place
My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place on Saturday and had a GREAT lunch here
I went here for my very first time back in April and I was amazed that first of all it sat inside the Phoenician Hotel which was such a great atmosphere
The food is usually great at places like this but the lack of uniqueness is a bit a of put off
The waitress came by quickly to check on us and took away the badness I was very nice about it to her face of course and brought me the BLT I should have ordered in the first place
It was a great place to find unique/alternative clothing at a decent price
For what it is this place is a good find in the Az area
Another really great thing about this place is the prices
It started with me craving stuffed french-toast and to yelp I went to find a place with good reviews
This is a great place for anyone to go to
This place has a great atmosphere and decent food
If you want some good ol' fashioned country home cookin this is the place for you
Sparse atmosphere but who cares when the coffee is this good
They cook the pizza perfectly so the cheese on top is brown in places and the sauce is great too
Sometimes it's a bit crowded being that it's not a big restaurant but it is an overall nice atmosphere and great place to eat
Not a bad seat in the place we sat in the front row down from the dugout on the 1st baseline
Had breakfast at Dicks Hideaway this morning before a big day of shopping a group of friends is furnishing a room at a transitional housing program for women0--It was a great place to start the day--I hadn't been there in awhile and had forgotton how good the food is
if you can't get to new mexico any time Dick's Hideaway is a great place to get the red or green chili fix
Anyway I wouldn't refuse to come back to Majerle's before or after a game but I definitely wouldn't choose over 15-20 other places in a 5-mile radius that have great food cheaper drinks and friendlier service
I really hate to give this place a bad review but I have to keep it real
Can't say enough great things about this place
I told myself and therefore I can eat whatever I want because everything in this place should be good for me
There are TVs throughtout the inside and on the patio so it is a good place to catch sports
Our burgers weren't any better than what I could find for $4 at other really good burger places our service was non-existent and we had drunk patrons coming over to touch our kid
I've read so many good reviews about this place and its close to where I work so I thought I'd try it out
Great place to go if you know nothing about wine and just want to gawk at the ladies
Yes it is Americanized but 90% of the places in az are its all good
Home to the Mariners and Padres Spring Facilities Peoria Sports Complex is a pretty great place to take in the action
It's super relaxed and one of the best places to enjoy some baseball
The atmosphere save for the soda machine in the middle was good and dessert
The location patio and $6 menu items on the patio should ultimately make this a great place to hang out
All in all it was a great meal and I can't wait to go back to this place
I keep coming back here for the awesome food great service and relaxed atmosphere
I know that it is a chain but as a chain goes it goes out of it's way to fool your taste buds into thinking that you are actually eating artfully prepared Italian cuisine at a more casual and affordable atmosphere
Every place has their bad nights but this particular Carrabbba's knows how to treat their customers
For a buffet- this place is really good with a variety of seafood dishes from crawfish to crab legs to salted shrimps on a stick to sashimi
It is a clean place and both time there I had a really good experience with the wait staff
If you're looking for a good eighborhood sushi place near FLW and 101 we think this is a great choice and encourage you to give them a shot
It's a fun place busy on weekends and good people watching
Last Chance is not a place to take your date your parents or anyone else you're trying to show a good time
The DJs that frequent the place are quite good and bring an interesting mix to the music scene something Phoenix needs more of
since I figured an Italian place would have great pizza
Of course I placed 1st in all categories but if I finished last I would have still had a great time
This place makes a mean grilled cheese with a great selection of cheeses
The quality is great and every time I go to the Phoenix Public Market on Friday afternoons for lunch its always a toss up between this place and Short Leash because both places are top notch
Typically my mark of a good sushi place is the quality of their fish in either the sushi dinner or sashimi dinner
The atmosphere is great kind of dark and mysterious classy and a progressive wine and food menu
Whether you are with your spouse/girlfriend/boyfriend or just friends and looking for someone else it's a great place
This is a great place for Happy Hour and special times like birthdays etc
Wonderful service great atmosphere and terrific food
And as a side note - you might not want to come here if you're trying to watch your weight Hawaiian food in general is high calorie-laden goodness which is why I always leave this place full and happy
It's a good first date place if on a weekend
This is a great local sushi place in Scottsdale
Find this place and you will find a great dining experience
Final verdict I feel a little bad for suggesting the place to my friends but if they had suggested it I wouldn't hold it against them
Comfortable atmosphere and great wait staff
But if you are in the mood for good Mexican food and you are not in a hurry this is a good place
All in all the place gives off a very relaxed vintage villa aura with a smidge of contemporary to it
If your idea of an enjoyable experience includes good food surrounded by SUV-driving soccer moms with ears adhered to cell phones this place might just be for you
The patio area of the Coach House is a great place to be
They even have a large community table that seats 16 which I really think fosters a great atmosphere of communal dining
but rather a good place to go to kick it with some Telemundo and delicious food
Normally I wouldn't review a place like McDonald's since we all know that the food is fried greasy and all around bad for you
It's probably just me but I never get a good vibe from this place
This place is a really cool hip place really friendly staff and great craft beer selection will be back for sure
I'm no Pho expert but this place is pretty good- I've gotten Pho to go a few times from here and they are very quick but they don't give you as many add-ins as some other Pho places
The place is called upper crust they better have a good pizza
A little steep but it's a good environment and doesn't feel snobbish like a lot of Whole Foods-type places
My assessment of this is not a place for the casual every day diner still stands
This place is so wonderful and the location is great - I usually trail walk/run before or after my class as it is near the trail I like
This is not exactly what I was expecting as I am comparing it to Bay Area Thai but the presentation and portions are great and the atmosphere is cozy and inviting
Wasn't  bad considering the place was PACKED
I love the atmosphere of the patio also lit with those great off-white lights and fire pits
I've heard good things about this place on yelp so we decided to have dinner here
Sure you get good value for your money and they give you large portions but the service and atmosphere left much to be desired
Overall this is a good place to go in & grab a quick meal - the food is on par with a Rubio's or Baja Fresh but you have the opportunity to support a local business which wins in my mind
I decided that a place called the tortilla factory has got to have good tacos so I ordered the house tacos
This is a great nail place- as I have been to many I think this place is one of the best
It's a great place to go when you're hungry but want to eat healthy
However they give generous portions and I could have easily given them 5 stars if Haji Baba's Chicken Swarma wasn't twice as good as Pita Jungle's This place seems to be constantly improving their menu and is a must go to for a date or just to try it out with some friends
In addition they have a 24 hour Wal-Mart and an entertainment area with movie theaters and a few great places to eat
The Mesa Riverview is a great place to see a movie during the week as it has great theaters and hardly any crowds
I have NEVER had bad service or a bad meal - this place is GREAT
Anyway this is a great little independent coffee shop with excellent service and a very relaxed atmosphere
The interior is very cute and they carry about their pig theme very tastefully meaning the place isn't covered from head to toe pigs
But for all you music lovers looking for some oldies but goodies I would imagine this is a very cool place to get your vinyl swag
I love this place for the food and the good service
Overall good place to hang out with your buds convenient location and fantastic value
I suspect my experience wasn't the norm though they seem like they would be a great place for someone who likes spicy meat
It is a great place to take the family since the kids can stay in the first part of the room on the sofa sleeper while you can crash on the comfy bed closer to the TV
LoLo's is a great place for lunch or breakfast but be prepared to wait outside in a dicey neighborhood for a little while
we're gonna be the only asians eating at this place but it was GREAT
The food is good not great but I'm a salad girl and this is a steak place so I should really just order a steak or burger
After a wild night out you'll probably find yourself hungover and lazy the next morning looking for a good place to go for breakfast/brunch
I love paradise bakery but the last experience I had at Tempe Marketplace was not good
Yes the food is good but it really doesn't take 45 minutes to make pancakes and eggs no matter how busy the place is
The place was pretty dead which was good because I don't like crowds or waiting a long time for my food
I'm really not the biggest fan of strip-mall sushi places but the sushi here was ok and not bad at all
A beautiful relaxing atmosphere great food a sushi bar with a top notch chef making it fresh for you reasonable prices and Tottie on top of everything make for a great place to visit
This place will be great during NFL Sundays
In the meantime I have a good opinion of this place
Terrific place great decor huge flat screen tv's encouraging you to eat eat
I like this place because you get your subs super fast and they're good for the most part too
The egg rolls aren't good though but seriously for $3 this place is pretty great
Xtreme Bean is a good place to go to get decent coffee and decent service
The prices are average for most places nowadays and I think the grilled chicken plate at approx $7 is a pretty good deal when you can make two meals out of it
What a great place to hike/ run/ shred
Restaurant week is the greatest thing in the world because you get to eat at places like this for $30 a plate instead of the standard $50-$60
Great place to take someone when you've got a birthday coming up so you can point out all the things you wouldn't buy yourself
Great atmosphere for a quick lunch or a large party for dinner
It's also a great place for finding food brands from other countries small food distribution companies and regional and local brands
It's a great place to shop for gifts and for finding distinctive items for your home and pantry
If you have never eaten at a Brazilian churrascaria this place is a pretty good representation of one
Overall a quiet little place with good service and great prices
Friendly Service Interesting Variety of Packaged Goods Nice Atmosphere
But Food wise it was okayI cant complain it was good and will probably come back after I check out the other plate lunch places here
The bartender/server was engaging and helpful and most of all exuded a great pride for his place
If you live out here in Phoenix there are a number of good BBQ places many of which have a strongly Southern focus on BBQ pork specifically ribs and pulled pork with the meat served already mixed with or covered in sauce
Well this place based on the BBQ brisket always my ultimate test of Texas BBQ makes some great BBQ and even better it has the bare bones approach to cost that is standard in many little Texas BBQ joints and many great food hole in the wall places in general
Telling hundreds of people over the years how good the place was has caused them to grow into a doublewide store then triplewide and now currently four or five valley locations
For side drinks my wife from South Africa loves to get a picher of Guava Juice to soak in a flavor from home and this is a great place to take kids or buddies for a game on the many TVs
The food at any random place could be great but if the service is lacking and unfriendly I will never return
Aroma- although most sushi places have a smell to them the down side of sitting at the bar is you get the normal smells plus thestale beer of the bar but I think its such a great place  you get over it real quick
It's a fun place when it's busy and has a great traditional Irish pub feel inside
Great place for some next day drinking recovery
Alright I'm always up for a good burger so when a coworker pitched me on giving this place a try I was all in
Bottom line if you want great vegan food this is the place to go
Checker has great warranties on their batteries - 24 months guarantee for a free replacement and big discounts thereafter
What a great place to be for a work conference
I was excited that they would prepare their Pad Thai a dish that serves as a very good baseline to judge everything else served in these places Thai hot despite it not having the associated chili icon next to it on the menu indicating that this was an available option
The atmosphere was classy but very relaxed - he was in tie dye jeans and a nice leather jacket and I was in a skort and a t-shirt with a vest straight from my son's field trip to Tucson
There are a lot more exciting places to eat within a few blocks but I'm old and I like restaurants that serve good tasting food
My mom had purchased a Groupon for this place back in March and yesterday we were all deciding what sounded good for lunch
Even if Travis had been sub-par I would still give this place 5 Stars because that's just how good the food is
This place is casual and could use a lot more in the decoration department but the food is what's more important and the food
Zen Sushi offers a lot of perks that one could enjoy Trendy yet relaxed atmosphere outdoor seating with misters happy hour--and reverse happy hour friendly hostess servers and management and plentiful portions
Granted I still wouldn't go if this place was set in Old Town but at least they wouldn't be gasping for air while the distant populated beach of Goldwater shrugs a casual shoulder
It's been a while since I've had a good breakfast sandwich NYC and London were the last places so to discover The Farmhouse Restaurant in downtown Gilbert is great news for my weekend mornings
I like the breakfast at Liberty Market and a few Good Eggs around the valley but this place beats them all
I've been meaning to check out Retro Redux as I had it's a great place to shop for all things vintage and retro
Delicious breakfast food and great space really make this place
Finally a place in Scottsdale that is hip without being douchey and has great food and service
Atmosphere inside is kinda like a Mexican version of Chompies -  good sized counter restaurant flanked by market and bakery oozing ethnic energy
Great atmosphere great food and great service
This place has good pizza except it is always SOGGY
Give this place a try for hanging out on the patio or for a good breakfast spot in Old Town
Yeah this place makes their own noodles and the dude making it was pretty good and well skilled
Only place I'll buy meat and they have a good selection
Hanny's is a great place to take company or anyone for that matter that enjoys great cocktails and an atmosphere that is perfect for conversation and picking at one of their amazing pizzas
The atmosphere is totally casual and seating used to be a major biatch until they opened up the back part a year or two ago
+  A really good drink menu+ A great happy hour+ Great atmosphere- Long wait for a table even when several tables are empty this has been the case for me on several occasions but luckily not last nightWait staff is hit or miss - luckily our server last night was fine although he didn't have much personality- Tables really close together both inside and outIn my case the positives really outweigh the negatives
The place is very dark and very loud so it is a good place to hang out with a group of friends and dance or drink
This is a great place to have some rambunctios fun with friends and the food is better than average
This could be a great place once they get ownership who's willing to throw all the recipes out the window and start over from scratch with higher quality food
I suppose this is probably a good place to go as a couple
I'm terrible at pool but this place is always great
This place is great if you just want to get drunk and dance
If you are in the downtown area and need a quick lunch or a good sandwich this would be the place to go
So good traveling to New York and Boston I've had some amazing hot pastrami sandwiches living here not many places offer it hot so finding this place was awesome
i'm sure this place has some other great dishes so i may give it another shot in the future
It still gets 4 stars for cool atmosphere an open-mike night good Guinness and a great outdoor patio
The burger was nicely grilled with a great char flavor stacked with a good amount of condiments lovingly placed on a standard bun that was just the right size however the fries left much to be desired
A great place to pick up odd and end materials for painting
There really arn't any other teriyaki places around that can compete with Yogis plus the food is pretty dang good
Yay for a new place in downtown Phoenix especially next to the great FilmBar
If you work downtown around Adams and Central Jacquee's is a great place to grab some grub to take back to your desk for lunch or breakfast
If you want to try a really good burger AND FRIES place- go to Paradise Valley Burger Company at 40th Street and Bell
However I'll round up to four because I value places with good happy hour specials; plus La Bocca is a nice addition to Mill Avenue and a good place to escape when you want a more grown up night out on Mill
Went to this place for dinner a few weeks ago and it was great
I have been to other Regal Nails and they have been fine - good prices so so atmosphere but worth it for a pretty good pedicure at a good price 19
I told him this place was actually pretty good and to give it a chance
It's an unassuming place with a concrete floor and simple tables and chairs no big cushiony booths here and it's fast casual so you order at the window then they bring it to you
When we want an easy decent meal in a relaxed environment without spending a fortune Wally's is our go-to-place
I'll be honest--this place is good for Americans
Otherwise their mock  food was salty and pasty perfect for Americans in search of a good Orange Chicken replacement
Urban Beans is for grown-ups and for people who want to experience good coffee in a friendly atmosphere while nibbling on a salad then continuing with life elsewhere after an hour or so of kabitzing
I also like the quaint atmosphere and how it's always busy enough at lunch time for you to know it's good but not so busy that it takes an hour to get in and out of there
But the place does good overall and sells beer unlike their place at Pima/Frank Lloyd Wright so I'll give them 4 stars
Nice views of the lake but other than that there's no atmosphere and the lighting is bad
I'd eat here again if it was the only place that didn't have a huge wait but I'll stick to the Good Egg for now
This place is soo cute at night on the inside with all the hanging lights rustic feel and the deejay which played amazing music
The staff was nice the place was a little dirty around the edges and can use a good scrub
Back home Cioppino might cost you a little less even at the classiest place however I will say its pretty good but I'd have to wait until I become a millionaire to try it again to indicate any authenticity
The service was good but a tad slow but we didn't care because we loved the place so much
Overall nice ambience good food good drinks cucumber martini was a-ok tho
It's the only good place within a mile of Mill Ave
It's very clean inside and the overall atmosphere is pretty relaxed
I'm not sure how long La's has been here but mom has been ordering takeout from this place pretty regularly for quite awhile now and always has good things to say about it
One thing I have to say about this place and for me this isn't a bad thing at all is IMO the curry is a bit on the spicy side but I like mine spicy
It is a great place to take your pooch and maybe a bento box and enjoy the shade as your pup runs around contentedly
A few too many cocktails great food fantasies about noodles and hot cheese that I stored away in my spank bank and the company of the hottest girl in the place
The boys also had some garlic cheese knots to starts and those were pretty darn good as well over all a great place for the kids and the pizza and of course they do a pretty good pizza cookie to so if you are in the area it is well worth the visit
It's a good place to meet those with cool jobs
1- great tasting dish 2- good value  3- atmosphere location service ambience
Cause this place is SO good I ordered the avocado club burger and some fried pickles Delish
A great place to take SPECIAL guests or a lucky date who might enjoy watching the sunset over the mountains and an endless sea of city lights
The initial impression of the place just left a bad taste in my mouth
Overall not a great location awful service and not the place to go if you want a sports bar rather than a mini-club/lounge
It's a simple place with pretty good food
Checked this place out for a Thursday lunch thanks to the great yelp reviews and interesting menu
Used to be a decent place but had a REALLY BAD experience recently - food poisoning
I still miss the diversity and options that Boston presents but I have to say I am very happy to have found a really great place here in Tempe
Ever notice how your whole experience at a place can change just with some great service
Then we have our Goofus and Gallant twads traipsing around the place causing the do-gooders headaches by snatching cheap wares because they saw it first or bouncing on the couches to see if it meets the durability quotients of their friends who might someday crash on it
We now have a favorite new place to stop on roadtrips - this place was great
My go-to spot in the neighborhood when I want to become lost in a thought or find good conversation in a friendly relaxed and open atmosphere
Place has a great feel and I would gladly return in the future
I admit it is pricey but the ingredients are fresh and we are in the desert so you gotta pay for good stuff and this place is for sure worth it
The moment  I saw this place I had a feeling that this place was going to be good
I was a tad worried that a great local place that knows that they've really made it would have a bit of an attitude but i didn't get any of that from the people who served our table
They have a lot of customers which goes to show it's a good place to eat
So while I am not going to rave about Macayos to my friends and tell them they need to try this place it is a good lunch destination
I espoused only saying good things about good places with the marketplace taking care of the bad placesMy wife and I had errands to run and took the very scenic drive north on Scottsdale Rd toward Carefree/Cave Creek
We stopped at The Plummit in the hopes that it would be a good new place
This is a good place to come if you want quick service on a weekend and don't wish to wait in live forever
This place has a great location in Tempe Marketplace and it's quick if you want to catch a movie next door
It is a great place to find something for yourself as well - my pick would be the toffee
Good relaxed nice place with good staff good food and even a baseball player sighting though we have no idea who he was probably a minor leaguer
Also some music would help to set a relaxing setting-  Old and really old customer base-  Friendly service- Tandoori dishes were well prepared including Tikka Masala and the chutneys- Prices are high and naan is extraOverall good place to go for Indian food in N
This resto is significantly smaller than that in Ahwatukee which gives it a nice romantic ambience
I would imagine that it'd be a great place to chill out during happy hour I've spotted nice-looking people here when I wasn't even looking to meet any
The lounge has a great  cozy atmosphere with just the right amount of lighting
I didn't even know this place served other breakfasty stuff until I came here myself but the other pastries & coffee drinks sound good as well
Fine service great presentation nice and large bar area with every spirit you could imagine mood lighting lively atmosphere free AND valet parking centrally located
A great date nite and a very nice location for a tucked away little neighborhood place to grab a quiet bite
Not a bad place to be for some casual time
Having split everything we got to sample some great food that doesn't necessarily need the hip atmosphere to be successful but in FEZ's case it certainly doesn't hurt
We met at 1130 to beat the crowd -- good thing because by noon the place was packed good sign
Great place went there for first time last night
His body language implied he was up to no good so be careful if you park over there because that parking lot is not lit at all and as overgrown bushes and trees with a low wall surrounding it making several places to hide behind
salivating now A great place to catch up with the girls =0
Forget it this place is too busy for their own good
That's GOOD not negative how can you possibly rate a place bad because it is small
BTW my first few visits to Matt's were BEFORE Triple-D and it was and remains a place to go for people who have good taste
The fries were good but not as good as other places and the dipping sauce was just ok
The drink prices are great but if you're looking for a deal on food this is not a place to come for happy hour
It's a great place to grab a quick bite a few drinks watch some sports and play games
Maybe that's why the place gets such rave reviews - after a few drinks almost anything tastes good
Not a good place to stay and eat expect to make a to-go order
We haven't seen each other in awhile and I have to say that this place was a great place to meet somebody and just talk
You will not be hassled into buying a rap CD or knock off perfume in the parking lotCons Bad place for People of  Walmart photo's - everyone seems normal hereYou do get shocked a lot like previously mentioned
I saw so many good reviews of this place so I just had to give it a try
With multiple locations and online ordering tons of topping cheeses bread and sauce options this place makes it easy to get a good pie
We heard from some friends that this place was really good
This will be a great place to hang out on the patio after work with friends drinks and cool conversation
* Not a great place to go if you are in a rushWe will definitely be returning to Chompies for more of their Jewish sliders in the near future
They've got great food and ambience - just a perfect place to sit outside grab one of their honey lattes and anything to nosh on
For wanting a chill night with great people watching this place is great
My date and I were chatting up a storm and the server was great she just kept checking on us but wasnt hovering or rushing us to place our order
I am still on the hunt for a GOOD chinese place here in Phx
Besides the service being slow the place is clean and has good seating
Okay maybe it wasn't thaaat bad but Iri'e isn't a place I'd frequent
We searched and found this place and based on a pretty solid group of reviews we decided here would be good for dinner
This place is really great the food and the employees
This place is pretty good from the dishes I tried but I was clearly not as impressed as other people
I suppose I was expecting more for the price point of this place but it is certainly good food
I've noticed that this place has gotten a majority of 5 stars well that may be due to the awesome chicken with the tasty skin that you just have to devour and the greens that had me picking up my bowl and consuming the goods like 3 year old but can I get some room please
The atmosphere can be loud decor and patrons alike but for this reason it is a good place to bring kids because no one cares when your kids are as loud as your adults
If you are looking for good mexican food and mostly chips and salsa that should be part of the food pyramid then Via Delosantos is your place
Came to this place to show some friends from Jersy a good time and good food
The atmosphere was great as always with a live Irish band and all
Sad to see such crappy service bring an otherwise great place down
The location is great who knew Mesa was becoming such a cool place to go
Good food lots of TVs with games on fun atmosphere - but where you can still talk nice outdoor seating with misters on those hotter than hell days and an amazing beer list
It has a great atmosphere with an indoor/outdoor bar area
During the day this place is great for kids
Great place and I'd highly recommend it but you'll only have a chance of seeing me about twice a month
Summary Overall worth the priceRecommendation If you're at the hotel on business as I'm sure most hotel guests are this is a good place to wind down at the end of a long dayI was at the hotel for a meeting and decided to take some time for myself to get a facial
First off I learned early in my Saltys experience that this isn't really a place to go for good eats
It's a good place to people watch without having to go to Old Town or even Mill for that matter
It's also a great place to day drink with cheap-ish beer
Overall it has a very casual and friendly atmosphere that's also family friendly
Over all if you can wait a bit to see the latest flicks and aren't afraid of out dated creepy statues then this place is just fine and a good bargin
There's nothing worse than paying top-shelf prices for poorly executed food and I'm happy to report that this place was great
I stick to the classics though so I could be missing out on a great specialty dish that would have made me give this place an extra star
The sad part is that the interior is very well done if the food was actually good this place would be extremely interesting
The beer is always good and I love ambience of Gordon's
If you are looking for  a great place to stay and enjoy in Scottsdale this is it
It's a cute if basic atmosphere and I really like how they put alot of their menu up on the chalkboard above the coffee bar it looks very hip and colorful
I'm totally up for a good dive bar experience once in a while but dive bars are supposed to be cheap and this place is not

This place is the best place for great beer and great food
I had read that this place was over priced and not very good
The atmosphere is casual and the staff is friendly and attentive
Make sure you get a dessert to go so you can split it with family or co-workers My boss calls this place Calorie Jumper with good reason to
The store is a great place to find unique music and still get vinyl
or just a great place to browse and find out about new artists
This place is awesome - great food comfortable ambiance and convenient location near Scottsdale's civic center and old-town
We had been in the mood for some good BBQ but have no idea where the good BBQ places in Phoenix are at so we thought we would just give it a try since we were starved
All in all I'd say this place was pretty good
I'm not especially interested in eating here but the price is right making it a good place to meet up with some friends for a frothy adult beverage
The Good The unique local and atmosphere
The decor and lights make for a casual atmosphere that puts you at ease when you enter
If you are looking for a great happy hour then this is the place
I'd recommend this place because of her even if the food was bad
The food was of decent restaurant quality and definitely a good place to get steaks but it was no where near the quality you would get from Texas Roadhouse or Outback and neither is the price
Pool was nice bed was comfortable TV reception sucked room and bathroom was big towels felt like sand paper parking was terrible food was good but pricey even for that place
I'd never been to one but had heard they were a pretty good place for Italian
I loved this location felt like a mom & pop place and it even has a good size outdoor patio w/ heat lamps
However today I wanted fresh tortillas and I heard this is a good place to go so I went
I didn't take advantage of the menu options there cooks were smoking up the place which wasn't great smelled good but hopefully its not always smoky there
Hubby and I love gyros and we read the great reviews plus this place is close to home

I know absolutely nothing about New York authenticity but I can tell you that this place is damn good
Good hostess + decent service + lousy drinks + lousy and mediocre food = a place I'm not running to ever visit again
just a big friendly restaurant good food and lots of memorabilia in a nice atmosphere of dark wood and crisp white linens
Overall a very good experience that I will go back for but definitely a guy kind of place to hang out and watch the game
Chloe's Corner is a great lunchtime option for any of the following lunch goers- Solo diners - Diners with children - Friends eating lunch while on their lunch break - Shoppers wanting to take a retail break and revive their systems The atmosphere at Chloe's is that of a trendy kitchen
This place has only been open 6 months and it has a great vibe
Prices are high here but the place is impeccably appointed very comfortable and food seems great

D Great place for a quick inexpensive meal
Place is opened for breakfast and lunch only great for them but bad for me Im working not so local and my weekends are well spent out and about with my girl but one rainy Saturday we will get there
Other than that I think this place is pretty good
f=1&i=21641&t=21641In looking at the ingredients through out Fresh and Easy they are downgrading rapidly to low quality no reason to shop there but to say hi to the great staff kind of place
In some ways it embodies a European sensibility--the communal dining small menu limited drink menu rustic decor and the uber-gracious hostess who went out of her way to save a table for our large party when I called ahead are all reminiscent of places I've been in Europe where dining is about simple flavors good wine and great conversation
After all great atmosphere and sangria should enhance the food not mask the fact that it's really overpriced and not that flavorful
I just can't get too thrilled about a place where the food--the crowning glory of any great European restaurant--isn't that flavorful and isn't generously enough portioned to allow everyone in the group to really share in the flavor experience
In short this place is the real deal and a great place to go from never even seen a yoga mat before to advanced practitioner
When you want good Thai and are not up to trying anything new this is a good place to go
first thought as we entered was the place was quaint clean good music and empty - we were the second table to be sat for dinner at 515
My Mojito Ponganot was amazing and that is the only good thing I have left to say about this place
To their credit most of the maintenance team does good work at least within the management's complete refusal to give them any money for repairs parts etc but don't expect them to actually replace anything
With the new design that has taken place over the years the prices have definitely gone up but still pretty good
The place is a little strange b/c it is cowboy/ranchy but the food is very modern and VERY GOOD
This is a good place for a dates or hanging out with a few friends more intimate smaller group not as great for a big group
I hope that this Changs keeps up the good work because everyone needs a good go-to place
So as a place for lunch- I think they are GREAT
This place actually has really great food
If you haven't been to this place I would say for sure check it out they have a lot of local goodies and desserts and as stated on a nice day you can't beat the setting
In fact I feel sort of bad for anyone who likes this place for the sheer fact that they can get a verbal beating by a dude with an IQ lower than the goldfish he torments
I have heard lots of good stuff about this place so my expectaions were set high
I was so hoping that this place would have good Chinese food

I had read and heard many a glowing review of this place from friends but the lingering question in the back of my mind was How can bacon toast and eggs be that good

All in all I was happy to discover a great place nearby to eat and drink
Ok beer selection but they have good daily specials that make it an economical place to have a meal and beer

If you are stuck in Tempe though its not a bad place to go and they do support the local community
None of the food was spit-it-into-your-napkin-because-you-can't-swallow-it bad if it was this place would be getting a heck of a lot fewer stars than 3 but it just

They seated me and my friend in the corner but we end up having a great view of the place and seemed a bit more intimate that way
The place offers free wifi which is great although the actual decor and ambiance of the place is less than charming; Subway has New York propaganda everywhere and this place is certainly ready to tell you all about Colorado although not in a very engaging or interesting way
In some of the press I've read about this place it's referred to as fine dining in a casual atmosphere at an accessible price
Not exactly a hole in the wall the place is not that grimey it's a bit cute I might add

I was kind of disappointed because the place had such great ratings

its a great place with great atmosphere decor and classy bathrooms

Having a great place like this within minutes from my home is both a blessing and a curse

5 StarsWent to The Arrogant Butcher during its first week and for a place just getting its sea legs it was pretty good

This is a SUPERCENTER version of Walmart which means it has all kinds of extra stuff like home/garden furniture electronics vision center and an auto shop good for oil changes and batteries
I could think of bringing friends here to have some ice cream chat and enjoy a relaxed atmosphere
I guess I should have looked this place up on Yelp like a good little Yelper would and then I would have known a while ago that I should check this place out
I have come to believe that most of us generally desire that unique union of a robust menu composed of carefully planned and executed dishes with a splash of unique drinks a dazzling wine selection excellent service that offer suggestions to round out a dining experience and finally an atmosphere that lets us focus on our palette not our survival instincts
Anyway great place and I will be back
and I have heard so many great things about this place it seemed the right time to splurge
Here's a great affordable place to eat
location across from Phoenix Art MuseumGiant Coffee is a great place to just get away and relax or meet up with friends
A great place to take first timers who are afraid of Indian food
I started off with every intention of a good review about this place because the food was amazing and because I love to give props to local joints popping up in Sky Harbor
and I never actually saw a menu but from what I gather the place is totally popular based off the amount of people and the wait I was told about also that they have a great beer list also a full bar and some wonderful orange special sauce that you definitely need to dip your french fries and whatever else in
I've been searching for my replacement for El Paso's onion rings and this is as good as I've found so far
Not a bad deal since we both left the place absolutely stuffed to the brim and we are both big eaters

Some of the paths seemed like they were missing tape or holds as the way up just seemed unreasonably impossible but the sheer size of the place and the helpful staff makes this a great visit

I am sure that was not intended and is probably just my pet peeve and not a reason not to return to a place that had really good food in a beautiful setting

I'm not vegan/vegetarian but this is still a great place to eat
The food is great and so is the wine atmosphere and service

That was a good move as the crowds were thinner but the atmosphere was still great the the ful menu available
I would come in and work here the furniture isn't the MOST comfortable I've been in and plugs are hard to come by with some tables but it's such a great atmosphere that I don't even care

The staff was super nice but this place just needs some help if it's going to be a great coffee place to hang out at
The place had a good vibe jukebox playing people shooting darts  we felt totally comfortable and found a table to sit and catch up
That was the point I realized I needed to let the company know that they have a bad seed ruining their paying customers experience at an otherwise fun and friendly place

The atmosphere is okay the service is good you don't wait forever for your food
This place is great for Breakfast but don't be surprised if you have to wait to find a seat because this place can get very busy and that doesn't surprise me since the food is absolutely amazing

People here know how to appreciate and participate in good music so if you've been looking for a place to get down and meet good people look no further-the Sail is for YOU
The sushi is about as good as most places here in AZ maybe a little better than the average but not stellar off the chart good
Seems I have a lot of meetings at this place so I guess I'd say it's pretty good for meetings
This is one of the few places I order omelets because they are really good
rrAunt Chilada's isn't a bad place by any means as you could go much worse when it comes to gringo-ized Mexican joints but it's nothing much special either college-age hottie waitresses notwithstanding
I enjoy the casual atmosphere with music playing in the background
A quiet and chill atmosphere if you want to work/study/read as well as a great place for delicious grab n' go coffee in the Biltmore area

I had heard great things about this place from friends and had been wanting to try it for a while
This a great place to to start your night but I would recommend using the restrooms at your next stop

As a poor college student who loves pizza Slices is a good place to go
This place is great for kids or adults and although I do think it's a bit pricey it is also fun and creative
The staff is friendly efficient  and it's a great atmosphere to watch a game and have a good meal
The naan here is also very good - light not too greasy and never burned at some places there are blackened parts which means you're eating carcinogens
They had baskets of clothes out front that were free for homeless or needy people which I thought was great considering places like goodwill often overcharge for clothing that should be donated to those in need
The atmosphere is great - small and cozy and very warmly decorated for a former post office
It's a great place to stop by if you're walking around downtown and want a cold treat
Good place for under 30 and killer beer selection on tap Gulden Drak on Tap
*gurgle*Anyway I don't have a great feeling about this place's future in my repertoire of places to drink

The atmosphere is very romantic and peaceful
The place carried a very nice relaxed ambiance with light jazz in the background

Theres plenty of light coming in--seems like a great place to lounge around after your meal chatting or reading a book
I really didn't expect much from this place since Fountain Hills has an unfortunate shortage of good eats
not saying that there aren't good places just that they are few in number  Anyways I had a feta and walnut salad with a vinagerette
The inside is nice and bright a drastic change from when I was there when it was Bada Boom Pasta Room another overrated Scottsdale place
But its a good atmosphere if you have to wait Tempe business folks and college students alike enjoy meals here
It's not a bad place to grab a 'real' i
A good place to meet a friend for a pint before diner or to stop by after dinner on Friday's and Saturdays for the live music but only rat here if you are desperately hungry
Their green tea is a bit watered down the green tea smoothie is ok but too sweet for my tastes and their baked goods aren't quite as fresh as other places
Still the cacophony of the crowds give it a bustling exciting atmosphere and if people-watching is a pastime for you and you're not looking for a Fortress of Solitude this is a great place to be
This place would be great to take tourists
Other then that Its a great place to eat and get your comfort food fix
The atmosphere was so great that I didn't even notice how busy it was until I decided to look around

I would give this place a second chance cause service was good but no recommendations till then
The place is really cute and not what I expected it to look like
I have found a new place to cure my sweet cravings and can't wait to try more flavors as the website has many more I didn't see in store so I assume they are on rotation which is great
Other than that what a great place to go
And yes it's quite messy - so maybe not a good place for a first date
It's definitely one of those places where there are more natives than gringos which is a good sign
Food is great the place is cozy inside it is not what I expected from the parking lot
The atmosphere isn't bad with the dim lighting and all but I could do without all the Arizona nature porn on the wall
If you don't think this place is good you are in the vast minority
All in all still a great place to eat just not as entertaining or as impressive as the Scottsdale one
This place is great not cheap but very tasty
Also try this place for a delicious brunch with great drinks
South Mountain is a great place for a nice hike within the Phoenix metro limits
Yes I have tried Los Dos Molinos which I feel is really good and different yet if I had to recommend one I still feel this place does New Mexico cuisine much better
If the food wasn't as good as it was  I would've given this place 2 stars
The free WiFi makes it a great place to work and hang out
But I just don't get how this place is getting good reviews for their burgers
We just enjoy this place great for families

Good songs by Maroon 5 Lenka and Katy Perry were cut off after twenty seconds and a Charmin toilet paper commercial took their place
Overall if you enjoy a wide selection of good beers and a casual place to hang out definitely check out Papago brewing company with some friends
Great food good prices and excellent service all set in a romantic atmosphere well; there is one caveat the hours
Considering this place is next door to several other really good restaurants I can't help but wonder why anyone would choose this particular establishment instead of one of the others
good location great atmosphere and a good variety of stores
It's a really cute place in a pretty random location - smackdab in the middle of the parking lot of a strip mall it used to be a drive through coffee shop
Four Peaks has been a great place to go eat and drink for many years now

Visited last night and there are lots of great things about this place
For a college campus town Tempe has surprisingly few places to doll up with a spa experience--it's amazing that all the processed looking girls on Palm Walk can keep they're toes looking good in their platform flip flops I went to ASU so I have to knock it a little
Finally a place that northern phoenicians can go to to get good beer
The place looks and smells clean always a good sign
This place is classy yet casual at the same time
Divaz is a great place to find new clothing and accessories in the latest colors and styles
Atmosphere super stylish and well executed
I just didn't get a good feel about this place
The food was great just as I expected the place was not to busy for a Saturday afternoon I was by myself so I moseyed on up to the bar to make my order
Great atmosphere once you walk into the place
Yelp pointed me to this place while on a business trip-- looking for good pizza in the area
Overall a very nice place with great quality pizza that tastes delicious
Either way it is a great place to go and you will not be disappointed
Located in a strip mall it is not a place to impress a first date with the decor but a nice place to take someone for a good Italian meal without breaking the bank
the place is small nondescript and tucked into another strip mall and oh-so-good
It is a bit more expensive than most of the places in the area for lunch - but you get what you pay for and I walked out knowing that I was supporting local businesses/farmers and eating a fresh and great organic meal
So I was looking for a quality dry cleaner  this place was in a good location to where I work and also to where I coach football
I don't know how there are so many good reviews on this place but trust me I wouldn't trust a T-shirt to this place again
It is a great place to relax with comfy seats and a great vibe
The food was good Festivals=crack the atmosphere and the service is EXCELLENT and it is close to home
The atmosphere was relaxed and casual perfect after a long work day
Got clued in to this place by a coworker of mine many moons ago and have to admit I was surprised by how good it was
Why won't I give the place greater than 3 stars
Charming and lovely Cibo is a great first date place appropriate for business mingling and even the kind of place you'd want to take your mom to
Saturday afternoon a couple of friends and I thought this would be a great place to go before our evening festivities
I think it's great when owners engage in conversations with patrons - really offers a more personal feel to a place
The store to the left-hand side had a pretty good-sized selection of Middle Eastern goods except you can obviously tell that this place is right by a college campus with the near-entirety of one long shelving unit dedicated to every flavor of hookah tobacco known to man
Reasons Why I Love CPC GREAT FOODGREAT PRICESGREAT ATMOSPHERENICE STAFFDELIVERY
The look and feel of the place is casual and hip with the clientele being mostly hipster/yuppies and business people
Zinburger has a lot of what I look for in a restaurant experience -- nice staff cool atmosphere and good food
Lots of nice looking college people around and great place to meet some people
I wish this place great success unless it gets too busy and I can't get in anymore   It is a kind of small space so calling in for a reservation isn't a bad idea
Overall a good and inexpensive place to go before a movie at the Camelview but don't go out of your way for it
The tuna appetizer was good though and the view as always made for a nice atmosphere
Very disappointed since I have so many things that need alteration but I am sure yelp will point me to a good place
I rate this place 4 stars because the service was some of the best I've ever had and did have some really good things
I get the concept of this place with a simple fast order menu but if you are looking for good Greek food
All were really good and something we can't find at most places
The food was wonderful the service was great and the atmosphere is something I wanted to be part of
The service was great the place was beautiful and for the one night we were there it was damn perfect
Plus leather chairs pews short round tables red velvet couches with dark wooden floors big plants tiffany style lamps classic bike hanging over the bar bookshelves crammed with books suspiciously resembling those from the free cart at Changing Hands and a cute little Wii this place is nice for the desert man
Parking at Fiesta Mall is great and I love being able to shop in air conditioned comfort in the summer as opposed to slogging around in 115 degree heat in open malls like Tempe Marketplace
The portions enough to fit my lifestyle if you are single a couple or have a fairly small family this is a great place to get your groceries
For me this is a good place for a morning cup
- If you're scared of heights this is a great place to face it
Our server was great the food incredible and the atmosphere upscale but not pretentious at all
Id honestly say if you want the variety this place gives go to a GOOD chinese buffet instead for less money and save your money and you still get great variety
So is this place as good as everyone says it is
The atmosphere here is a very large social gathering and seems to be a great place for the alternative crowd from mill and college kids
It's a great place to go to spend an evening with friends or to meet new people
I discovered another place in Ahwatukee and only then did I realize how bad Anna's can be
I've made this my place to hangout with friends and enjoy some good ice cream
This place is very good and convenient when shopping at Arrowhead Mall
The seats are great and they have Security to make sure vandalism does not take place
It reminded me of bad Chinese places where you question if there really is meat in what you are eating
This is a great place to go if you haven't eaten in 2 days and want your stomach to swell up like a bowling ball
All in all the food is pretty good and prices are decent for being a cafe in Nordstrom's but I still think Tomatoes is the best place to eat in the mall
Urban Yoga is a great place for a newbie or yoga practitioner with years of experience
Red chairs tables of all sizes with such a great atmosphere
Menu selection and prices were great and the place was jam packed
Anyways place is great I love it here and I will probably be back for more in the future
Since this dentist has all good reviews I thought it'd be a great place to try
Overall the place is clean the service is good and the food is great
To those of you who stand around in a drab lobby for an hour to eat at Olive Garden and then complain about a two hour wait at this cute bar you're insane
The Good-Selection of equipment both cardio and weights-Pool-Several Showers-Spa in the respective locker rooms not co-ed-Several Group classes and various times throughout the week-Several trainers if you want one-Basketball court-Reasonable price-Several areas for stretching and mat workThe Bad-Pool heater has gone out a few times and it takes a couple of days to get it fixed-Sorry but the old people retirees invade the gym in the morning hours they tend to take longer on the machines-Training sessions are expensiveOverall I think it is hard to find the perfect gym but you should select one that has a variety of equipment that allows you to have the flexibility to change your routine; but more importantly you need a place where you feel comfortable
We will most likely revisit this place because it is in an ideal location right in the middle of Tempe Marketplace and the food is pretty good for the most part
I can see why this place has gotten the accolades because relatively speaking there isn't a lot of good accessible chinese food here in Phoenix well unless you go to Cofco Plaza Lee Lee Market Great Wall etc
The place was packed always a good sign and I found out why
It was good not as good as a certain favorite margarita place of mine but I'd give it a 4 star on a 5-star scale
Small cozy place with attentive service and great reasonably-priced farm-to-table fare
Service was also good and friendly and the place is as clean as anyplace I've been
It has a fun atmosphere and is a good place to go with a group

*Filet Mignon = wonderful*Service = exceptionally great*Atmosphere = very relaxing and classy
We have done plenty of wine tastings at all sorts of places and at most pay $8 for normally 6 glasses of wine with good servings
We've all had monents when breakfast can take it to the next level and this is a great place to get breakfast but it's not the be all end all
The place is clean has good service but I just wish it was a bit more quaint and less like a cafeteria setting
While the fish and chips we ordered were very good the fact that despite being part of the largest party in the place we had to go and pay for our meal at the bar was slightly annoying
I wish this place was in California but it is probably a good idea that it isnt otherwise I would be broke
I love this place like crazy wild good times
The inside may be a little noisier but it's still charming and a great place to grab a bite
The decor of the place is great and pretty unique and very family friendly
Great place that I'm going to have to hit up again

Love this place - one of my favorite places to run a great place to walk the dog check out nature with the kids a walk at dusk with the wife
Great date place family fun place and a retreat from city life right in the middle of the city
If you want average Italian fare at a good price with nice people this is your place
It's a great place to take a date or friend
However where Space 55 lacks is in parking a good place to park your bike and the coffee shop that closed inside
Marketplace offers a simpler fast/casual option for breakfast lunch or a comforting snack in Old Town
People seem to want to compare this place with Richardson's due to similar DNA unfortunately the place is not anywhere near as good as Richardson's was and I can't really put a finger on why
This would be a great place to have a drink after a night of dining at Marcellino or FnB not a place to go before you head to Axis Radius or Myst
The white table cloths dimly lit and somewhat romantic environs and overal sexiness make this a great spot for a first or second date or a perfect place to go before heading to the art walk or an event at the Center for Performing Arts
A couple of small knocks on a place though; they don't have a great selection of draft beers in fact  I was rather disappointed to see they had Guiness Bud Light a couple of Four Peaks and Pilsner Urquell on draft
this place is great especially if you find yourself sick of the endless subdivisions and pavement that is phoenix
Pretty good place to wash your dog though
there's just too many other great places to go
Secondly the atmosphere is hip urban and casual at the same time
ok i gotta start saying that the vig is one of my fav places to go n have a great timethe place has great specials on winebeer and food i usually go to arcadia on thursdays they have a great dj and i go to uptown on fridays when they have the same dj also ;the decor and staff are awesome as well
if you are looking for a place where you can talkeatdrink and listen great music in a mature atmosphere the vig is your place
A great place to cool down during happy hour
Now the main meals good to bad my son's philly cheesesteak on flatbread was terriffic my wife's fish was badly overcooked & had to be replaced and my Gyro was surprisingly bland & luke warm
As a restaurant this place is really not bad
This is a great place for a quick hearty bite
My cousin had told me about this recently opened place that he had only tried once before and said it should be a great choice for Polynesian food
A great place to meet friends and even bring the kids
The upside to this placeBartenders were fast and politeCool bouncerThe DJ played good songs including the ones a friend requested
A great place to get unique southwest decor that is more authentic than cheesy
It's been my go to place for business casual clothing that is required at my job
Seems like a great place for happy hour too
The furniture in my place that comes from IKEA is now being phased out piece by piece via craigslist or Goodwill but I'll always have a soft spot in my heart and my wallet
It may not be as posh as Zipp's and the wings might not be as good but if you want to watch a game Hazelwood's is the place
I had driven by this place for a long time due only to it's choice of name and location - I thought Mucho Taco in a strip mall how good could that really be
Overall this place seems to have good food but there are some down sides which include not many non egg options BF is allergic to eggs the pancakes were meh and the call ahead didn't really work out
*hides in shame*But eaither way - it's a great place to eat
I also like the comfortable atmosphere here on warm days and nights their patio is lovely with a nice fireplace those good white lights not the god awful led ones and a selection of items that will appeal to everyone
First while I loved the romantic table we had by the fireplace outside it did get chilly at the end and I think that made Alison want to go home early
There isnt much room to sit and it isn't fancy but if you want good food this is the place to go
good reviews on here got be curious over other nearby places2
I want to update this review when I've tried other dishes so conceivably this place could take a tumble down to an A-OK 3*** but that's still good because remember I'm a cranky reviewer
I've heard good things about that place too
Good place to get tequila with delicious tacos he said
No surprise this place has an average of five stars it is great
The atmosphere is always fun and warm lots of things to look at and the food is great
This place is super cute inside even the bathrooms were impressive the perfect atmosphere for a ladies lunch
Very good service and I loved the atmosphere
With superb food and fabulous service this place certainly has a great atmosphere
If you don't like to cook or you like to cook easy but good quality food F&E is the place for you to shop
This place is close to where I live so we were hoping to find a great bar with good food
the place was still not busy so we thought great here before the crowd  well
If you're looking for random import foods like the real Hinze Baked Beans or a really good wine this is the place
I think we got the last two seats in the place so I thought - it can't be bad
The flavors were great and he said the Chorizo was exceptional better than most places we have had since we landed in AZ several months ago
Thankfully their food is good and the atmosphere is nice because otherwise I wouldn't recommend this place based on service alone
It was the type of place where the servers actually knew the names of a good amount of customers
I was feeling like having a Mexican breakfast and although I had heard bad things about this place I decided to give it a try anyways because it was on our route
Multiple generations of my family have come here; my grandfather brought my dad as a young boy when in Phoenix for business in the '30s with cattle all around back then; all of us kids had our 16th birthday in the Pink Room; my uncle would visit from dry SLC and my dad would treat him to martinis and dinner at Stockyards; it was the place for serious dates the place we unanimously chose to go for dinner when we were all home and so many good times
I've been waiting for this place to open for the past few months with great anticipation
These two places are great places for treats tea and friendly service
The service was pretty good and the place is really nice inside for a sub spot
A place with great atmosphere service and food
beautiful setting with a great view and great atmosphere
I've never heard anything bad about this place so I suspect AZ State Senator Cheuvront's restaurant must be suffering from light rail construction
If you want to be at Daily Dose or Breakfast Club not that the food isn't good there to people watch and 'be seen' this is not your place
If  you like going places that make you feel like you are hip this is probably a good spot
For anyone that has been trying to eat healthy and find a great place to go - Seasons 52 is definitely the magical place
Now I HAVE been here at least twice since my last review 17 months ago & nothing has changed but TPB&MMM deserves a fresh update because this is a GOOD PLACE if for no other reason
Its sad to see that a place I used to take my kids frequently has got this bad and I also can see why I travel the extra distance to go to a cleaner and safer location
Overall a great time and great place to watch a game
I went with Melissa Tiffany and Anthony today for lunch-what a cute little place
For a place that is kind of hidden away it is a great stop
The only bad thing about this place is they dont serve ranch but they do serve bbq-ranch which is petty good
25 I would tell anyone to try this place its really good
This is a great place to grab a burger and drink on a Saturday afternoon and watch the game or take a date on a week night
Like most Vietnamese places the prices are great; about less than $10 for a meal and you will get more than enough food
The outdoor seating is really quite pleasant and a great place to bring your pup
Personally I wouldn't bother with this place - a sandwich shop that doesn't make good sandwiches is not worth the money
They have a great atmosphere and the bar area is really cool
Service is pretty good about what you'd expect for a restaurant at Tempe Marketplace
Order simple enjoy the reasonable beer prices and great selection and move on to a cheaper place if you're looking for somewhere to party
But they only time I've ever had a chicken parm sub that good was at Andreoli Italian Grocer and that place is THE top rated Italian Deli in the city
Tempe is always pretty loud with airplanes as it is so close to the airport but the room I stayed in seemed to have less sound insulation than other places I've stayed so it seemed louder than usual and then I got a fantastic surprise of super loud trains adjacent to the hotel that take awhile to rumble past I was in the army and I'm pretty good at sleeping through almost anything but the only louder thing I've attempted to sleep through was when I had to camp out next to howitzers firing all night
I just moved here from Dallas at the end of last year and had been asking around trying to find a good place to check out a show and everyone kept telling me tempe mesa or somewhere else in BFE compared to where i live north phoenix
The atmosphere at this location is dark romantic yet casual and comfortable
With the wooden decor and the choices of alcohol it is a good place to relax and hang for a while
so yeah great flavors huge portions great service and an all around awesome place to eat
The atmosphere is great but I did notice one small problem
It seemed like it was a date place too lots of dates going on when I was there that always makes for good people watchin'
The highlights for us are the relaxing atmosphere good Mexican food attentive service cold Negro Modelo beers and talented mariachis playing music
Overall a good bar to get a properly poured Guinness above average bar food and a really unique atmosphere
This place smells great before you walk in the door
Great food great beer great tvs great atmosphere
Overall a great place that I will visit again
Definitely a small place but not too smallI'd say intimate is a good way to describe it
I love good BBQ but this place really doesn't do it for me
This place was fun different and I thought the food was good
The food was good but I'd definitely recommend another place for the future
I can't say enough good things about this place
The ambiance is very nice and it is a great place for a romantic date
The only good thing about this place is the people watching
This is a good place to chill/meet friends and just internet surf but the music was a bit too loud for my taste if you're going to study here
Not a lot of parking space but overall a great place if you want to avoid the starbucks/chain ambience
Great place to sit with your laptop and drink coffee
Its a great place to meet friends for coffee or to sit on the sofa with your laptop
Just a great place to relax and unwind after a busy day
Now while this isn't the most authentic food the place is great
Sorry Drew But it's great we had super service and enjoyed the heck out of this place
Overall I really like the food here both brunch and dinner love the location and atmosphere great patio and pretty decent servers
My only complaint would be that service was a little slow but it's a quaint quiet atmosphere that is not packed with hostesses and servers jostling everywhere so in my opinion the quiet evening with fantastic food was completely worth waiting a little longer for service  This is a great place for a date night or a girls night check it out
While this is a great place to take a date before an evening in downtown Phoenix only because it is nice inside it's a horrible place to grab a drink with friends or co-workers
Maybe it's the breakfast sandwiches the relaxed atmosphere that sparks my creativity the clever marketing pitches and the cheese platter with pesto jack and apple slices
I have been on a quest to find a new sushi place since moving to Goodyear from the east side
This just isn't the type of place I would go looking for great' Chinese food at; nor is it a place I would take somebody promising the same
What a great place to enjoy Pizzeria Bianco
I work from home and was looking for a great place to get out and get some work done
Great place for me to get my work done
On a recent trip to visit my mom's place I just got the biggest hankering for some good ol' Chinese food we all get this right
All and all the place is a great burger at a decent price
It felt like the one place in my adventures where the people were good and music was true and the atmosphere was
It's an awkward place to be when you have nowhere to sit but if you can secure yourself a seat at the bar or even better a table this is a great place to chill out with old friends sip wine maybe a little light petting whatever you're into I don't like to judge
It's a tiny place that has a homey feel right down to the TV playing bad Korean soap operas in the dining room
It's very good kimchi not at all rank or sour like other places I've been
All in all this is a nice place to relax grab a good meal that doesn't leave you feeling gross and stuffed
Even on a Tu night it seemed the general atmosphere was business casual
The ambiance is good a bit arty but not trying too hard--it's a good place for relaxing and feeling a little chilled out
Place is great for young kids 10 and under full staffed and family friendly but a little run down
The Sandwich wasn't all that although the cake turned some heads as it was placed on my table btw two neighboring tables copied my choice -yup it looked that good- oh Its delicious too and the strawberries whipped cream scoop of ice cream drenched in strawberry sauce made the cake- eating- experience  all too good for Yelping words
We are snobs when it comes to good Indian food and we were giving up on finding another good place to go to
Fantastic retro style unique culinary approach fresh food good service and a relaxed casual atmosphere for evening dining
It's a good place for pizza and you're not compromising anything in return
This is a great place to take co-workers you don't like when you don't want them to know where you normally have lunch
Obviously this is the only method for producing a supremely great cup of coffee ie freshly ground beans [roasted recently on-site] placed immediately into an instant coffee maker that produces one cup at a time
The place was cute the music was the right level and the drink menu was great
I've stopped here several times to pick up replacement bulbs and always had good service and advice
I am willing to give it another try on a non-holiday weekend because it's close to our house and we need a good brunch place
The service like most places in Scottsdale was exceptional even though there was a little wait and it was a little slow but hey it's a good place to relax and chill out for a bit
It's a great place to get a quick gift for a fellow sistah
Restaurant has a great atmosphere and the service was very good
BUT again I give it 3 stars bc for here its a great place to grab any kind of breakfast you want
This is a great place for me to hang out while I do paperwork and make phone calls in between visits at work
TV's are great and pretty good place to watch any games or see how short the shorts are that college women wear to bars in 2012
-- The atmosphere is generally relaxed with a front that entirely opens think Giant Coffee
the entire menu is priced great the atmosphere's laid back the staff is friendly and efficient and it seems fairly clean
All in all Z Pizza had a nice atmosphere and good food
Great place for lunch and take out italian
Don't be dissuaded by the 3 stars It's a great place to satisfy a craving for Mexican food beers et al before the game
I really wanted to like this place as I heard good and bad things about it
It's spotless airy and light -- a good place to spend a few hours on a Saturday afternoon
I would recommend that if you are looking to try Pilates this is a great place to see what it's all about
It's not a strict traditional Pilates place but it is  friendly relaxed and you can go it at your own pace modifying the tension coils as you get stronger
can't say that we will come back there are just too many good pizza places in town
It kills me when you see someplace with good food and good wine ignore something that goes better with their food but ignore it because it isn't upscale rnough for them
All in all this was a great place to visit and has become a must visit ball park when I attend Spring training
ps the place is looking pretty run down & didn't smell too good inside which another reviewer also mentionedi'm not sure if management changed or what
we receive such great service and its the one place that we can go and KNOW that our food will arrive hot and delicious
Atmosphere is nice and dark and semi romantic
It's a relaxed place and that's a good thing
Overall the selection is good fairly organized and placed well and the staff is friendly
It's also a great first date place because it's not too fancy not too casual and if the date goes bad there are plenty of things to distract you
It wasn't the perfect place for a speaker with awesome pictures of Mars b/c the projector situation was meh but otherwise this was a great venue
This Greek restaurant is a great place to eat
This is a great place to try inventive tacos but can get a little pricey
1st comment Booo for the road crew who is blocking off one of the main entrances to this great place
The food is great the staff is laid back it is locally owned and has been around since I was in high school so many good memories in this place
This place has just the right atmosphere for a good night out
Good quality beef not that fatty crap that some places serve
I wish the parking lot were swept a little more often and I wish this location had a grocery section but otherwise it's a great place to get stuff you need
InteriorIf you're nitpicky about a place having good interior design well this is just average regular fast food resturant look almost nothing special
It's a great little place and you'll know that for such a small place to make it they have to construct interesting and tasty dishes like Hibiscus Enchiladas
This place is probably really great to study in considering the fact that I see a sea of macbook apples every time I walk in here
The vibe of this place was great although I heard that Obscura only happens once a month so it may very well be different on other nights
I'm very sadden to say that Smashburger is the only place that's ever served me bad sweet potato fries
Finding great sushi in the valley is an overwhelming challenge so I am relieved to finally have a default place to go for amazing sushi
My impression here is that folks who rave about this place have never had really good food with flavor
We loved coming out to this place  even with the crowds of Valentines Day it was a great time
Like I said before though great service and atmosphere worth coming back for
The atmosphere was nice and had a great vibe and was pretty busy for a Tuesday night
You may find it cool in there hey it IS a WINE store and with that much inventory you wouldn't want it to go bad in a warm place
I suppose truly this must not be for everyone but as far as i am concerned this is a great little chinese/mexican fusion place
Rice Paper is a great place near downtown to get great tasting and fairly authentic V food
But I guess the fact that the place was full and that there wasn't any parking is a good sign
So here are a few other good things about the place* No cover charge
And the couple of times my rice-high from the sushi place next door son dropped his cone on the floor they were so kind and understanding about it they just scooped up the mess while they joked around with my little one about all the ice cream they've had to wipe off the floor in the past with other customers and made him a fresh new cone adding extra sprinkles for good measure
We should have read the Yelp reviews before going to this place but after now 2 bad experiences I feel the need to write a review
This place is great for studying or any romantic date
So after seeing the sheer volume of good reviews on the place it was pretty much destiny that a trip to Fez was in order
It's a small little place pretty simple inside with a great menu of chicken waffles kool aid and a variety of other menu items that are tasty
This place totally makes up for the other pizza place that unfortunately shares the same name as this place but has absolutely no affiliation thank goodness
Top everything off with great service people that actually know their stuff a fully stocked bar with beer sporting the name of the Kilt Lifter and nice cozy atmosphere
My partner had misjudged his piercing placement and when we went back we were prepared and knew that we were going to pay for another piercing duh they ask you if it looks good but Andy ended up not charging us
Moda Fina is a great place to shop for jewelry
Since I moved to AZ from Los Angeles I have been searching far and wide for a sushi place that met my high standards for great sushi
-Fun atmosphere great decor large patio Minus - The brunch menu today was limited
This place is great if you want healthy mexican food and great service you need to stop in here
The food is very good the waiter was very nice and the atmosphere is fun
This place does both and a really good job of the later
The atmosphere is laid back the dress ranged from t-shirts and shorts to sun dresses and collared shirts the wines are good and the food is really good
It's tiny it's not a good place if you really want to sit down and eat and it kinda sucks having to work your way through the crowds to order food and again I feel like if they don't know you they don't pay as much attention to you
I mean don't expect the best place ever just bring a humble taste sole cash and good company and you won't be disappointed
A good place for a date or friends and family although a little over priced for the food
Its a great place to get outside and socialize with the neighbors
All I know is this place wont be seeing me again and if you guys value a good fade avoid this place like the plague
I highly recommend Crazy roll i normally get some spicy tuna roll with itThe servers are always helpful and nice it's a great place to have sushi
Other than that its a great quick place for lunch
The place has a great location in the heart of downtown
with their patio under construction and the mix shops Canal will be a great place for food fun and fashion
But if you're ever in a rush a good thing about this place is that you can call ahead and request for them to start cooking your pasty so that it is ready to be served once you arrive
The bartenders were friendly and the places was just real casual and dive but fun for something and somewhere different
This place probably had some bad reviews when they first opened up
I appreciate that this part of town has some great places like this and not just stuck with Panda Express or even Shogun Express for that matter
I stopped in last night and this is what I found; Place was empty buffet was full but all items were badly dried-out and looked horrible table and menu especially menu was greasy and sticky
I have heard great things about this place so we went
which isn't exactly a bad thing but considering that Lobby's is supposed to be a tasty quality burger place frozen crinkle fries are kind of a half assed approach
Good prices cool modern decor inside the old Clarendon Hotel good place to take clients to good for lunch happy hour dinner
Hanny's is a great place to meet up for drinks or happy hour with friends just make sure to eat before you go
I like this place because the service is great - they have always had friendly helpful and accommodating employees always ready to teach you about how it works and help you with everything even mixing your own sauce blends AND I like that I can eat as many vegetables as I want I love stir-fried/sauted vegetables
I thought this place was great for the kids and has great photo ops
One star because it isn't as good as other Mexican places in the valley just isn't fair
I couldn't find anything bad to say about this place
Fast forward 7-8 months later we move to Mesa AZ and I excitedly tell my wife about this great happy hour place near our new house
Great hidden little place in MesaIt is owner operated by a husband and wife husband takes care of front of house wife cooks so service and quality are always at their best
He is an important part of why this place is great
Nothing was bad about this place - it's very much an authentic classic pizza joint
A very comfortable atmosphere for an intimate conversation relaxed clean and friendly
The other locations I go to are always good but this place is baaaaad
The place is crawling with Indians and that's a good sign considering most Indian joints are littered with white people
It really is a must visit place the scenery is beautiful the owners are so nice and the coffee is great
the fact that Eggington's is the first place I know of that has turned the stone classic of a salad The Cobb into one of the greatest sandwiches I've ever had is reason enough to check it out
Great bonding place with friends and I can imagine a very romantic date place
Ok good service nice atmosphere good food excellent sake not priceless
Lyte is a good place for socializing as there are some large tables with couches a large open floor and a smaller area with tables and chairs seperated from the rest of the place by a curtain
Nothing outrageously good but if you need a place with great service and accessible give this place a try
Giving this place a 3 again its good but nothing stands out and the price point could be better
Nonetheless if you want some good used Jeans that you know won't shrink or some party shoes this is the place to be
Great place to have a beer or five with your meal and I think you'll be coming back often as well
Overall not a bad pan-Asian food place but the flavors just didn't fulfill my craving for Vietnamese
Tortilla factory's food didn't rate on par with even some of the taco carts around town some of which are actually quite good so it's probably in insult to the carts to compare them with this place
The decor is charming the booths create an intimate atmosphere and the service was good
Sure their might be a few other places that have better BBQ Ribs Brisket and/or Smoked Sausages but Pork on a Fork is as good or better than most at these and the are the BEST at Pulled Pork
One great thing about this place is that all of the sandwiches are named after types of marijuana
The squash blossoms were wonderful the ambience was great
It's also a good place for families with picky eaters as they have some selections of non-asian dishes available; pizza fried chicken garlic bread deviled eggs etc
Great retro/rock/glam atmosphere excellent music and if you're facing inside the restaurant you can easily forget your 4 hour layover
Its a great place to snap a few pics of the enormous city below
Overall this place is great but here is my gripe- last night we wanted to get some food but we were informed that they don't serve anything but apps in the bar area or outside and we couldn't get a table in the restaurant for another 2 hours or so
The food isnt bad for sports bar fare the beer is ICE cold and for an older central phoenix building this place is really well maintained
A good place to visit for really cold beer and that all important scoreline when ih the city of Phoenix
Its a great deal good ingredients and the lettuce is finley shredded like any good hoagie place does
I wanted to take her to some place that would be fun but tasty near her hotel and Carlsbad fit the bill
I will be back soon for appetizers and main course but so far as dessert spot with a few pints this place is great
I also had the Green Curry with pork which was also a very good curry as good as i have had at other Thai places in town
The place has a good variety from sandwiches and salads that are good to items like meatloaf and fish and chips
I think this is a good place to give it a shot
Place Newer relatively clean good locationService below average - average ***The nail color came off before we left the place
If you're trying to decide on a place for ramen and you've ever dined at Ippudo Naruto Minca or Totto in NYC and thought they had good to fantastic ramen you will NOT like Republic
If you've never tried Indian food before this is a great place to start
The kind of local place that you know is going to be good
Why does this place have such great reviews
The person that helped me seemed really nice so I kind of feel bad giving the place such a hard review
Open late with no long waits to be seated especially with a big group Lo-Lo's is a place to visit in Arizona for some good chicken and waffles
Since I placed an order to-go over the phone one time and my burrito was pretty good and in tact I decided to take hubbs to this place
I may give this place a second chance because the service was good and there are other good reviews but if I had to make a judgement on just food
I have nothing bad to say about this place
Service was great - we ate alone essentially not a lunch crowd type place I guess - went at exactly noon on a Wednesday
Sat at the bar once or twice but mostly sat on the patio which has a nice relaxing atmosphere and is a great place to people watch especially on a nice fall day
They also offer table and bottle service sky bottles starting cheap and champagne starting at only $40 a great place to get a buzz on mill
Food is generally tastier than the other concepts in my opinionServers are friendlyValet parkingNow the negativesFood was 'meh'Awkward patio seating with uncomfortable chairs sitting on dirtSlow serviceOver-priced especially for a kids grilled cheese plate that didn't even taste goodDon't come hungry  gnocchi was ok but was served as a diet portionValet parking I don't get this place but then again it's a Fox-owned business catering to the masses looking to make the big bucks
I don't like to trash a place based on one bad employee but I don't think I'll go back here
Atmosphere was pretty good considering it was at a Casino
It seems like the perfect place for a meat and potatoes sort of guy plus I heard there's a great selection of English beers so I'm planning to take my boyfriend there for dinner asap twice in one week wouldn't be overkill right
I wish we had more here but it is a good place for older kids
The place is pretty much a replica of The Good Egg in decor and set-up
I mean  I dig Salty's in Glendale/Arrowhead and lot's of places around the greater city
Tacky and given that they place a table by the serving station something a good manager should realize
It's a good place for children if there is something on the menu yours like and who doesn't like ras malai or rice pudding
The location of the place is not very good and it looks more like a convenient store than a restaurant
This place does exactly what it sets out to do which is to provide comfort food at a great price
Basically a good friendly non-pretentious atmosphere
The bar high tops are a great place to eat if you're not looking for the sit down experience
during day light hours it looks like nothing special but stop by the place around 1045pm and its a a local spot filled with hipsters and tons of other people just down for a good time
This is a great romantic place to go small but not crowded and lit nicely
Last- the Thai iced was great and the place was beautiful
After visiting many hole in the wall nail spas I find this place to be a great hidden gem in Tempe
A place like that will get my money as long as they continue to have good service of course
I definitely recommend this restaurant if you like family owned pizza places and great New York style pizza
It's a great spot for meeting friends and people watching and has remained consistent over all the years that I have enjoyed this place

Charles started this place not too long ago and except for the porn place next door it's great

Overall the wine was good the atmosphere was good and the prices seemed average
The service was great and the cozy atmosphere was great for a date night
Count on Bomberos as a great destination to gather with some friends in an atmosphere that has all the warmth and relaxation of a lounge with a little of the spice and energy of somewhere zesty

Its exciting to see a new place like this in the area and nice to know that good restaurants and bars can continue to succeed and thrive in Central Phoenix

Okay I went WAAAAY out of my way to check out this place after reading the great YELPs about it and when I saw that Food Network Star Guy Fieri covered it on Diners Drive Ins and Dives
It's not a great place for wine and I have to visit more popular supermarkets like Fry's for liquor and say tin foil
Over all this place is pretty good friendly staff and lots of room
WCG is one of my favorite places in the Greater Phoenix Area for a number of reasons* The menu is so varied creative and well executed
I love their different toppings and it's a good place to hang out with friends and get your Mojo on
Those are pretty good standbys and it's nice that they give you bread and butter on the side no matter what you order even if you do get a sandwich which a lot of places tend to skimp on the bread if you ordered bread as a staple of your meal which is probably better for you anyway but thanks for the extra bread Sauce
Great place to watch sports but arrive early although its a big place it gets crowded on game days
You know a place is bad when I feel compelled to share my bad experience with the world

Tired of the good ol' boy type places that the vendors keep picking I used the Yelp
This was the first conveyor belt sushi place that I've been to in the US but I knew that just like all sushi in the US it wouldn't be as good as what I'd had in Japan
This is a good place to introduce people to sushi and it's cheap and fast once you have a table but if you've been to Japan and had the real thing this Americanized version just won't cut it

The place is cool the food is good and the girls are pretty but my only draw back is there is only one poorly lit pool table

You will not be disappointed unless you are always disappointed and then stay home and leave these great places for the rest of us
You were probably right because that is how most places destroy the savory goodness of which is known as Gyro meet
Just really good people who clearly loved the place and who wanted their guests to love it too

Beautifully decorated they serve up some great local and foreign beers and offer a very intimate atmosphere

One of the ladies at the store was plain rude accusing me of doing things illegally by trying to return and get a replacement for a bad product
So great to see a place proudly displaying their love for our country too
And judging from the lack of good reviews for this place without anything being changed well I'm not sure I trust LA Fitness at all

But I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for some good boba drinks
Mostly Asian clients so you know this is a good place
It's a good little place and they retain employees for years which is a good sign
In fact I would say this place has the cutest staff around
Got there last Sunday around 1030am the place was packed I was thinking logically because it's so good or could be because they are so slow
So if you want great street style Mexican food this is the place for you  but if you're uptight drone  who value style over substance stick to the tex-mex joints in your generic suburban strip malls

Pro-Its a cute place nice bar and what little food I saw looked solid
Good place to go on a weeknight with some friends
I've been to Ocean Trail 3-4 times and think I have a good feel for the place
Though the design is interesting the atmosphere is good it won't blow you away and you should avoid sitting nearer to the casino as the occasional smoking gambler passes by and crop dusts your food with their cancer stick
But this place not only have great food but great service
I really enjoy it here I almost always have terrific service the food is consistently good I love the overall atmosphere of the place and sitting at the pasta bar to watch them cook everyones food is mighty fun it's just that the prices have gotten out of control

This might be a good place to meet up for an early drink or a happy hour snack before heading out for the evening
Great place for large groups plenty of seating
Its hard to find a place that makes a truly good tiramisu but Grimaldi's has mastered it
Great beers on tap I'll give them that but it's a bar experience you can have at a dozen other places honestly
Service wasn't great and I think i was just a little disappointed in the general atmosphere - I was really hoping Phoenix had actually gotten a Blues bar
Good stuff the lit pool and jacuzzi at night makes this place a winner
We asked where to get a good cheap taco and this place hit the nail on the head
they are good but seem as though they might use canned fish instead of fresh grilled chunks like most places
The proprietors do a good job of keeping the place neat and clean
Cuz any place named Sprouts that is known for it's healthy food and can still satisfy the likes of me is pretty good in my book
I think it must just be that cool - I'm trying to pull it closer to the other really good places to go
Whatever it was it left a bad taste in my mouth - which is why I definitely can't rate this place any higher
Perhaps I am overly critical having eaten at great Greek restaurants in other cities I've noticed that ethnic places - Mexican aside - are over rated across the board in Phx but as a 'Greek' restaurant this place falls flat
both pretty good too - not watery like at other places

Anyhow here's how it was for me here today*  This is a good sized place & I managed to find both a parking space & a comfortable table inside to land at even though they were ROARING BUSY
I didn't care as much for the menu here as Sunnyslope & the TVs were a bit of a nuisance but with that said I still think this is an very good place to eat & the value was AMAZING at only $6

The place is ran by a cute couple and their sons nice family owned restaurant
The atmosphere is relaxed casual but a tad upscale
we should have left right then but I had heard such good things about this place I really wanted to try the fish

So specific to this place which we visited Friday - Chile Relleno w/shrimp wanted a change was great no complaints
This is a great place and a great parking garage to have in the middle of Phoenix
Anyway I think this is a perfect first date place and also a good place to go if you want to feel like you are part of high society as long as you don't mind paying a lofty price for a drink or two

I give this place five stars because it is so relaxed
A great place to drink a cold one after a long night at work
Finding a place dedicated to bubble tea was surely a great find

Harkins 101 has always been a great place
Obvious hyperbole alertThis place is so romantic that even if a clown juggling three chihuahuas rode through the patio in on a unicycle every 20 minutes you'd still get laid
Our group agreed that the food was good though not memorable; just could have more sauce and quantity compared to the other Thai places nearby
Our egg rolls were good but we only got 3 and most places usually serve 6

Over all we wouldn't recommend this for spicy food enthusiasts or authentic Mexican food connoisseurs but we think that it'd probably be a good place for families
I tried this place out based on the many reviews but I seemed to have gone on a bad day
Service was great placed an order as its one of the only sushi places that has sea eel and the waitress came back to tell us that they ran out of sea eel
Its probably still a great place to go for lunch and even dinner but since I've had the best they had to offer this lessened watered-down version is no longer appealing to me

crowd or grabbing some pizza in a dimly lit dining area The Grapevine is definitely not a bad place to stop
The place is super cute with flat screen tv and cyber looking decor
Well I was taken out the other day and the person who knew I love a good burger suggested this place being that I never heard of it I was like sure ok
Their portions are small for a breakfast place and that's great I just wish they'd charge a smaller amount to reflect that
I bet it's nuts around game time but a really relaxed place to grab a drink from what I could tell
While almost all rave about the place I haven't a clue what glitch in the universe caused the two complainers to have bad experiences
There were actually a lot of handsome strangers maybe a good place to find a date
But for some reason it caught my eye today and I thought it sounded like a great option for lunch although a wrap joint seemed a little out of place in this neighborhood

Anyway the updated decor is a good improvement and makes the place feel better and more comfortable
Francis's ambiance is great for both day or night and seems like the kind of place I'd like to revisit time and time again for anything from brunch to dinner

The food was good ambience was lovely service was a tad slow but very earnest he was very busy running around from table to table
There is not one thing I can bad about this place when it comes to their food
Maybe we're spoiled since we have two great breakfast places within walking distance Joe's Farm Grill and the Coffee Shop
I thought to myself when I saw it this place is really cute
but we STAY here after hours to play poker because the servers know us by name and the food is priced right and the poker crowd is really cool and it's a great place to eat-n-learn
Good place to indulge your fried/crunchy needs
The rest of the anglo menu is probably more extensive than most places and I'm sure this is a great go-to option for take-out in the area
Normally I would say that a place like this is culturally-confused but they do a good job at it so I can't complain
At any rate AHS is at least a place where people can give up their animals rather than just turning them loose in the streets and hoping some good samaritan will find them before they die of heat exposure/get hit by a car/etc

I wish the great atmosphere was matched with great food
While some of the people that dine at the Capital Grille may be pretentious I think it's still a great place to go for a special dinner now and then
You know who they are- the ones that call this a bad neighborhood and whose idea of adventerous food is ordering a pasta instead of the soup/salad combo at Olive Garden for lunch
That kind of recognition is always a plus and makes a customer want to frequent a place more do to the venues thoughtfulness and great customer service
As far as cupcakes go this place is great
It was bad enough I brought my parents to this place
The food service and atmosphere are old school good
Friendly staff nice atmosphere great tasting food with quality ingredients

Don't throw them under the bus and compare them to some of the greats in Orange County or San Fran those places are in a league of their own
Everything that I have tried so far in this place has been great
; The simple but classic Pho Thai which consists of Rice Noodles Pho Stock and Thin slices of beef that are placed in the Pho bowl just as they are served is flavorful and great for a newcomer to the Vietnamese Cuisine
The service here has always been great and very quick considering that the place is usually full everyday at lunch time
But this place doesn't just have a good menu it's full of good people and a great vibe

Also the atmosphere is relaxed and not stuffy like some fine dining restaurants
This is definitely a good sign - if a place this small in this location stays in business it must be good

I recommend this place if your looking for a good bite

This is a great place to go when you are looking for a laid back meal any time of the day
Yea yea this place does have some junk and don't expect years of good service out of their tools BUT for those usually expensive tools which you probably will only use 5 time in the next 5 years like lets say a sliding hammer then this place is just right
This place is also great for the everyday type of stuff thats ether disposable or brake able like clamps zip ties gloves drill bits and so on
I thought this was a great place to get good pie and hang out with a big group

First the postives  Great locations easy to find lots of parking nice decor/atmosphere cozy booths friendly staff interesting name
I want to love this place so bad but it won't let me
Though I was a little afraid of the area and the sketchy look of the place I was taken by a good friend and my visiting father so I couldn't say no

It's a great summer lunch place or an early dinner after a long day at the pool
If I had to put an analogy to this one - I would say that most restaurants are like watching a concert on tv and this place is like being in the front row at a great show
Sign #1 this place was going to be good; they were very busy when I walked in; hence there might be a reason why busy usually = good eats
Sign #2 this place was going to be good; I noticed there were a lot of older peeps aka snow-birds eating here as I walked in; hence there might be a reason why older peeps usually know where the good deli's are
Sign #3 this place was going to be good; the smell of fresh cooked bread hits you in the face as you walk in; hence there might be a reason why fresh cooked bread usually = fresh cooked everythingWell to my chagrin this did not hit mark but it was an enjoyable experience
The patio is a nice place to hang out and the beer is good not phenomenal but good
So far after two trips there I would say it's an average  place to get something predictably good and a beer to go with it
I don't really have anything negative to say about this place but nothing superlative either it seems like it's a good place for the nights you want something you don't have to think too hard about
Now the downsideThe place is old and run down outside looks great with the 2 pools and tennis courts but when you get in the rooms they are old musty and dated
The atmosphere is casual and it's family friendly so you don't have to worry that you shouldn't bring your little ones
Overall it's just a great place to run / bike / walk
This is a great place to knock back pitchers
Bar was very comfortable proper glass ware was used to serve the beer and @ $5-6 for good IPA a great value for such an atmosphere
Not a bad place but I will be returning to my old salon

Love this place -- walked in and had a new pair of great looking sunglasses in less than 20 minutes

The place turns into a club at night with pretty good music if you hit the right night and not ghetto-rap night

---This place has maybe 6 tables 2 parking spaces and located next to an oh so romantic Circle K
If you need a cheap bike in pretty good shape DEF hit this place up otherwise its really hit and miss

- I sort of feel bad giving this place only 3 stars with all the other rave reviews
Leno here is a fast casual place & I found it to be clean modern somewhat stylish & comfortable except for a TV blabbing out some movie
It's not a good place to be unless it's morning because we all know teenagers don't even know what the morning looks like
Fish was good atmosphere stunk service was incredibly slow and it seemed like a cross between red lobster and chilis
Most importantly they keep the place well ventilated great for pregnant ladies with sensitive sniffers or concerns about chemical fumes
This is a nice little local place to eat great food on the go and enjoy a few surprises as well
Despite all the recent bad reviews of this place I actually liked it

The great part about this place is that you can come in and get a great breakfast even at lunch
I have mixed feelings about this place- the gelato is good but not amazing the prices are pretty steep for what you get and when I was here recently the girl behind the counter was giving everyone the stink-eye

I love the overly rustic atmosphere but it really could use some updating and maybe a good scrub
The place is clean with a good layout the chairs are actually very comfy and everyone I had to deal with was friendly and professional
The place looks great real industrial feel
Upon entering the cute little bakery it had a very light atmosphere they have classical music playing three table sets you can sit at although I was hoping you could also sit outside to enjoy eating the sweets and the weather and in the back through a window where they place the finished orders through you can see the Patisserie making sandwiches or new bakery items
For the past couple months I've pretty much had to stick with a mix of cake batter and oatmeal cookie which is good but I'd like to see a few flavor changes like some of the other places in the area
The food is great and the salsa is really good but I was shocked when we ordered the fried ice cream and it came battered and fried instead of the nasty mock batter basically ice cream rolled in corn flakes and re-frozen yuck that other places serve
The feel of the place is great too with the dark stone walls and coziness without feeling too crowded
Visit Greece without leaving PhoenixI'm on the hunt for great places to have breakfast along the light rail and while I love creative twists on the classics I also appreciate the basics

Nice to finally get good service great food and a great atmosphere

Such a great place to get small gifts for anyone on your list and also treat yourself to some new yoga gear

Very trendy place with trendy drinks great view of the very still brown canal but otherwise a happening place to be
If you're looking for a great place to stop and eat while at the resort you need to check this place out

All in all a fantastic place to go to for dinner and this only makes me want to come back for breakfast/brunch considering how good dinner was
Atmosphere really is great with the dark wood ceilings to floors big place but broken up with all sorts of nooks interesting apothecary stuff Apollo over in cabinets with Seattle Seahawks stuff thrown in
Open airy brightly lit and with minimalist modern decor this place was a far cry from the pizza parlors of my youth-- which isn't a bad thing at all
For being a small place it is great for some plays as the space get's to be more intimate
It's great for kids who aren't culinary adventurers because it's attached to a pizza place

The coffee is great the pastries are to die for and the patio / garden area makes you say Toto we're not at Starbucks anymore
The Price is great but the thing I like most is the Breakfast Diner atmosphere
The view on the patio isn't bad for being on a main street and the owner treats the young counter help when the place opened they were all friends of the family like family
It's one of our favorite places as we enjoy good authentic Italian food
The delish food the cheerful knowledgeable waitstaff drinks and even the music any place playing The Doors Led Zeppelin and the song Relax has my vote was great
On a Saturday night the age range was very eclectic--some families even seemed to be there yet it is a good place to take a date
I had driven by this place many many times and would tell myself   hey that looks like a good place to eat  but I'd never actually  stop
I respect a place that shows the calories and fat in their dishes and gives people options to enjoy good food that is healthier than the usual lard loaded calorie disguised foods
In all I gotta give it a 4 because the place is so well remodeled and they did such a good job of keeping the original parts of the home well preserved

But over the years this is still a great place to get a great beer with some food and just hang out
We have good food here in San Francisco but this place stole my heart for some reason

Must be a great place to hang in the warmer weather on the patio
The food looked good; people have complained about the prices but why are you going to a coffee place for food
I had such a great time at this place both times i went
I eat at Zipps on a regular basis and it's a good place to take kids because it's loud and no one can hear the kids if they get loud or out of control
My friends and I could spend over an hour just nibbling at our dim sum sipping tea and enjoying the time away from the office which is exactly what work week lunch at a good dim sum place is all about
I asked my friend wow do you think no ones here because it's not a good place to eat since it was around 1230 lunch hour I thought it would be busier
Lots of places to eat and cute little shops to browse around in
After some deliberation and a great backup plan from my fiance we actually decided to go across the way to the British pub Rose and Crown I believe; awesome place too but that's a different review
But really it turned out to be a great place that had a perfect area that sat all 30 of us
I especially enjoyed my fish taco's as it is hard to find a place that makes good ones
No high end bikes here but they do have an inventory of old and hard-to-find parts good service and free air that makes this place
I mean the place is nasty and the staff looks like they would really like to be someplace else but the pizza and calzone were really really good
It's a good and helpful place to pick out some goods for your furry friends
So I would not say that this place this location is good for large groups
It was packed as usual great vibe nice atmosphere I really enjoy this place
On weekends they have live music which adds to the already casual urban atmosphere
Carly's is a really great place to drink some yummy small brewery or Belgian beer and have a snack or a sandwich while listening to live music
Most ail of the good staff are gone the place is always nearly empty and you can usually find the owner Kwan on a barstool getting drunk
I would mos def go back to this place good food good ambience great place to go just chill out
Coach and Willies is always a good place to go before a game
Again I would consider this a great option before a game especially because of the atmosphere mixed with pretty good food
They can typically fit you in as a walk-in Friday lunchtime is a hit and miss but in general the place is clean the people are friendly and they do a good job
I've never had a bad experience there and I've never had an exceptional experience there so I'd say if you're in the neighborhood give them your business but don't go out of your way to frequent there if you have some place closer
A good place if in the area for Italian food but I wouldn't say somewhere that one would go out of their way for chain restaraunts usually aren't
It's a great drinking atmosphere and a cool place to chill but I wouldn't go expecting great service of great food
I gave this place one extra star because there beers here are very good
If you're in the airpark for lunch drive a couple miles north and give this place a try; it ain't bad
It's always good to gauge a new restaurant by standard staples of the cuisine that's why my first orders at pizza places are pepperoni etc
We are always searching for a place as good as Bodo's
Everyone knows you don't want to eat food at a place where nobody from that culture eats so it is a good sign when you see a lot of Mexican folks eating at a place during lunch
If you are looking for a good cheap breakfast I would try this place out for sure
I am so mad I just found out about this place - I heard from the lips of Henry Schulman this was a great breakfast joint and boy he knew what he was talking about
I love Postino for providing a great place to be with friends wine and great food at an excellent price on a Monday or Tuesday night
I went back to this place because the one close to my house was very very good
5 StarsThis place is great for that Saturday or Sunday morning cure for the hangover
Great place for happy hour or to catch a game and can generally find an area to hang out
I don't fancy myself a great pool player but that doesn't detract from the place at all
Friend 2 had the veggie sandwich which had portabello mushrooms grilled onions on ciabatta and I had the BLT which is kind of a standby sandwich for me when I want to see how good a place is
Baiz market is so great that it now has a place in regular rotation on our grocery outings
As a bonus the Al-Hana restaurant inside is a great place to grab a cheap but excellent meal during the trip
This would be a great place if the music was turned down
In summary great food great atmosphere - a great place to hang out with friends for a quick or a long dinner - whatever you are feeling like
Great food great atmosphere great hostess
I'm a tourist from LAThis place wasn't that bad looking
Chandler low light candles small cute place side bar small dance floor side table service
I have yet to find a great place that doesn't overdo it in the chintzy 80's style gaudy patterns and carries a great array of new modern and classic designers like Heather Ross Tanya Whelan Amy Butler Denise Schmidt and maybe some fun Japanese manufacturer's/designers like Nani Iro or Lecien
A very good place to take a date or hang out with girlfirends
I will tell you exactly why this place is so great
This place is great for staff lunches
All in all it was a great place for the kids and adults to have dinner
Lowdown Really greasy and bad tasting sandwichJust noticed that Lukes had opened inthe place of the greek restaurant next to paradise bakery
This place is the full package the location decor and menu are perfect for an evening of relaxation good drinks and great food
shady's is a good place to drink an afternoon away
Now there's lots of other options by ASU like smashburger five guys fatburger etc but when I have a hankering for a good burger Chuckbox is the place to go
Anyways if you've been to other clubs in Scottsdale or in any other city let alone Europe like me I might have been spoiled but I was really looking forward to a fun happening place with great 80s music and loads of people dancing
They have a great happy hour and a super relaxed atmosphere
The place is hidden in a strip mall and it's pretty small inside but the menus and decor are really cute
I will be back though maybe it was just that particular barista The service was great and did I mention this place is SO CUTE
They have free popcorn and you can play board games at the bar I said Yahtzee anyone now I am drinking great craft beer and playing Yahtzee by this time the place is packed
This places serves sushi and other goodies on a conveyor belt that goes around the entire restaurant
And with the death of Bandersnatch Four Peaks is the place to go for some great local beer
This place has a great bottle beer selection with a catalog giving an extensive description of each
This place has always had good food and good service but in the past the service has been sort of slow when I've dined there during the lunch hour with larger groups
This place is not a fancy salon where you will spend 60 bucks on a hair style and a lot of pampering - - but - it is a great place for a $15 hair cut
But all in all I would definitely recommend this place as an interlude to a romantic evening or better yet to woo your current or future love
It's good - the dressing isn't over powering as some places can be
Stores were flourishing the movie theater was convenient and it seemed like an all-around good place to hang out see a movie and do some casual shopping without being overwhelmed by a large atmosphere of crowds or getting lost in a huge maze of buildings
Here's my summary of the placeGood-The tacos are delicious
It's really sad how bad the services is because I absolutely LOVE the food/atmosphere
I'll be back but there are plenty of other places I can go and receive great food AND great service i
Over all the place was clean the staff was great and the service was very quick
Great atmosphere friendly welcoming workers and of course delicious food
The service was attentive and friendly and I dug the casual atmosphere of the place even though the food was significantly greater than casual
Overall great atmosphere and would recommend you give it a try
I used to go to a pretty good one in San Francisco back in the day so it was nice to see another conveyor belt sushi place
I haven't heard a lot of great things about this place and when I saw the reviews I was skeptical about ordering a pizza from here but after a long day in the lazy river we wanted pizza so I threw caution in the wind and I'm glad I did
Yes FEZ is a really great place to go and just hang out
It is such a great place to find an eclectic gift
Every element about this place is great the architecture interior decor rustically romantic lighting valet service and patio
The place had a great look and feel to it
Ambience is quiet and unpretentious the service is fast the prices are great
Music people atmosphere food drinks desserts baked goods
This is high quality fine dining with great atmosphere and attentive staff
Let me just say this place was not that great
maybe its because i'm a cook that i didn't like this place too much because the prices were a little steep and the quality of the food was also not so good
Not by much but I just have a great rapport at the other place as I have been going their longer
Seems like it would be a great place for happy hour or evening cocktails with the ladies before a night out
I love the atmosphere here the organ is great
I can only imagine how great this once every 5 year place could be if they had even good pizza it would not even have to be great
Way too many great places in this area to get great food from servers who aren't going to give you herpes
This place is great just how I like it
The place seemed relatively busy which I think is always a good sign
As the other reviews say this place is super-cute albeit very pricey
The atmosphere is very relaxed and when the owners swing by they really make an effort to get to know you
However for fast food Mexican this place is great
It's a little dirty and dark in the dining room but I don't mind an old divey place if the food is good
But even though this place would be a typical great frequent in California Bar Smith holds its own out here in the desert
Over all I thought it was a great time great place for such a party and would definitely go back
It's a good place to take a bunch of hungry kids or a big family to enjoy for above Pizza Hut style grub
This isn't a bad place if you're looking to go somewhere nice
Went here a few weeks ago sorry about the late review entry but this place was pretty good
At the end of the day I do plan on giving this place another chance   Great atmosphere
But its a good place to stop by if you have no other choices or are on a limited time schedule to pick up some lunch or something
This is a good place to bring your family
One thing I cannot understand is why with so many great televisions the place would rather play the stereo than put the volume on when there are games on
A great place for fun dinner a little on the expensive side but worth it if you do not want to look at what you are eating
Mexican food oh yeah some very good places mostly but Asian youre better off staying at home and cooking
Good God this place was really really bad
This is actually a pretty authentic place; the service is pretty rude the American inspired Chinese dishes don't taste that great but the real Chinese dishes are pretty damn great
I like to have these choices and felt it justified the cost but if you are just looking for a good basic burger there are other places out there
It sounds as though this place is a good breakfast stop but our dinner was definitely not up to par with what we've had at similar restaurants
My usual Indian haunt is Flavors of India because the food is mostly good and it's close but I think this place is a close second
As a ramen lover it's difficult to find a good ramen place in the valley
I really like the atmosphere and they have great specials
The place also had nice little snack foods like fries and calamari which aren't bad
In their places a half wall Ottos sign a fresh coat of paint great new matching tables and chairs some Coke themed signs and other things and my fave the new wall art
The location is great in the DC Ranch Marketplace shopping center near Thompson Peak/Pima intersection
Overall this is a great little local place
I have to admit that I was initially going to give this place a bad rating
The Roosevelt as a place to forget your angst and meet cool new people = not that good
Pretty big place and good size crowd as well
The restaurant had a great atmosphere and each tapas-style dish was very good
we wanted some bomb bbq and figured Arizona should have some good placesor at least decent
This restaurant is a prime example of why places that have been around forever aren't necessarily the greatest places to eat
Service was good and the atmosphere is nice especially the outside
but I think its a great place to start a night out with friends
It's really cozy inside but definitely a place you could have a romantic evening or just a nice dinner with friends
Since most places have decided that sprinkling one or two crystals of kosher salt on a bagel is good enough this made me happy
On the positive side I would say this place is fairly priced for what you get and they seemed to have some good specials going for locals on certain days and thankfully on that night for us still serve food late night
Great atmosphere friendly staff reasonable pricing pretty good food
Great atmosphere and service but crappy food
On first sight it was a great spot and it was exceptional to see that the parking spots in the center of the compound gone and replaced with tables
The place was busy mid week for a late lunch and that was a great sign that all was going well with this new concept because so many of downtown restaurants would have been empty this time of day
You need to give this place a try It's a great new addition to Old Town
Great atmosphere especially if Renee is working behind the bar or serving or what ever they need her to do
It seems as if they lost the cook that made this place so good
Regardless Mojo Yogurt is better than all the new tart tasting not terrible for your health fro-yo places of late because it actually tastes good
This is a great place to attend as a group - the dishes are lovely and there is much to choose from - especially if you are a fan of light somewhat clean Asian fare
Overall ImpressionThis place wasn't a bad apartment
I'm not going to say that this place is outright terrible because it's an edible burger but aside from being new and still spotless this place is inferior to it's nearest competitor the Chuckbox in almost every way it costs quite a bit more the burgers are good but nothing great the chicken tasted quite good but a tiny piece of meat on the bun for a $6 sandwich the fries were garbage there's no free parking and it just has nothing special going for it
If you are looking for unbelievably great tasting organic fresh and healthy food; this is the place to go
Our service Gwen was great  and we really loved this place
Sure the parking lot is super busy but there are some 15 minute spaces right up front for quick in and out that make this a good place to stop
This place does a great job packing in lots of rubber stamps and stamping supplies in a small store
i've been to the location in chandler and also in peoria and in both places the service was good and the food comes  out QUICK
It's also a great place to bring my dogs and sit in their shady garden area
LGO Grocery is just a fun laid back place to get some great food
Great place to go if you're looking for a sports bar that has more thought and effort into their menu than other sports bars
It's also a pretty good place to go for UFC even though I think it's lame
Either way if you want to chill with some good food and drink and watch some sports check this place out
Great Place to grab a beer and hang out
Good place to bring a small group of people to have fun
We frequent this place quite often and for good reason
It is funny watching business people use the free wifi and try to use this spot for a business meeting as it is not really a good place for that
This place is great with positive management sharp staff and intelligent ownership I look forward to visiting this place for years to come
The taco was good too but as I mentioned there are a few places out there that are tough to beat
Freddy's is a good place to eat when you hit them on the right night
I was super excited to try this place after hearing all the rave reviews of their toasty-goodness
Not that any of you care but this could be a good pick up place as well
Dinner is awesome and with a great atmosphere
A little pricey but great food people and atmosphere
We will be taking it to be repaired/replaced at Stanley's were they have been doing a great job for us over the last three years on all of our Jeeps
I mean yeah asian fusion is good when done right but this place is far from that
I can handle bad food if the place was clean and they had good service
Although I''m reluctant to go to a theme restaurant inspired by an SNL sketch I found cheeburger cheeburger to be better than a theme restaurant with mediocre food I was here once before when Tempe marketplace first opened and was overwhelmed by the topping choices Think last time I had a burger with feta mushrooms and olives trying to imagine a Mediterranean    burger really what ended up happening was flavor overload that I couldn't really taste the burger so I decided to give them another try this time around I got 1/2 lbs burger sorry a pound is just too much food with cheddar jack bacon and sauteed mushrooms we ordered a half order of the best of both worlds which is a basket of fries and onion rings with a side of cheese  the fries are good very crispy well seasoned and appear to be fresh cut  or at least a very convincing fake the onions rings are very crispy with a light batter that almost takes on a yellow tone my burger was well prepared they use sliced whole mushrooms instead of pre sliced the bacon was crispy and the cheese was nice and gooey so all in all it was a pretty decent burger I must say my burger was a bit greasy I cut my burger in half to eat it and by the time I moved on to the second half  my lower bun had become one and fused with my burger pattyOverall my experience was good and I would go back but I don't see it being a frequent choice and not just due to distance the main attraction seems to be the wide variety of burger toppings and the build-your-own inspired menu despite the food being consistent and good it's nothing I haven't tasted before though if I ever get the urge for a pepperoni peanut butter coleslaw Sri racha burger I can sleep easier at night knowing I've now got that issue handled
Cute atmosphere; almost like entering another world
I had picked the place hearing that the food was really good
Update - Well I like this place and get it once every week or two so I feel I am a good loyal customer but the past couple times I called at around 730pm to 8pm or so they tell me the kitchen is closed
When my friends in from out of town asked for a nice but casual place to have a late dinner I recommended we meet here
Great ambiance and good beers on draft  that are reasonably price which has made me want to like this place
So the ambiance and beers make this place good
Went looking for a place to buy some fresh stuff to eat so I didn't gorge on all the great restaurant offerings in Phoenix and stopped here
Located in a small house close to old Scottsdale this place just has a great feel to it and a menu that would satisfy any food lover
Essentially if your in the mood for a quiet place that serves great french food I highly recommend this place
And if you're looking for a place to drink that isn't Mill or Old Town Scottsdale TMP can definitely hold its own with a couple great places to grab a cold one with sometimes ridiculously good specials
This place is a small family owned Mexican restaurant common in CA if you're from there Maria is such as nice lady and the food is quite good and cheap
This place is always crowded check the weekends some time and for good reason
I see a few of the previous reviews discussing issues with service but I have always had good service at this place
The staff are all smiling and welcoming you and just the atmosphere of the place was great
The ambiance offers a great place to read a great book to discuss have a study group have a great discussion about politics or literature all the while savoring the coffee and teas and nibbling on the pastries and offerings
This would be the perfect place for someone from/a fan of east-central Europe food and goods but for someone who just wanted a super tasty cake it didn't hit the spot
Great place to meet up with study buddies but a little too loud for me to study on my own
I've been looking all over Phx for a great wash and so far the only place that comes close is the wash near Scottsdale Rd and Shea - their personnel is hit-and-miss sometimes good and sometimes just OK/kinda shady but their WASH is always top notch
The atmosphere and vibe at the bar are relaxed and tropical
Great place for folks who enjoy Vietnamese cuisine and also their friends that just partake of American food
Lively service staff less romantic steakhouse than business place
If your looking for private and romantic  this isn't the place
A good place to have with friends the location is a bit under the radar but very close to ASU west
Great casual upscale dining atmosphere
Please know my manager loves all the great non-chain places Vig Postino etc I take her to when she comes to Phoenix so all the more disappointing to have such a terrible meal
So if you are in the area & looking for a place to have drinks then it is great spot for that but I would avoid the food
But again I can get good pizza at those other two places
Only 2 bad things no place to change my son's diaper in the ladies' room
The du00e9cor is the nicest I have seen at any Indian place in town and the owners are usually there and make sure the food is consistent and good
It is always clean staff is always nice and helpful and it is just overall a great place
They serve nice baked goods from Simply Bread wish they had Tammie Coe and MJ Bread but you can't have it all and some delicious cheesecake they buy from some famous place in Chicago
Of course Joe's BBQ in Gilbert is great too and even Famous Dave's kicks this place
After living in Ireland we've been searching for a great Irish place
All of these components make for a great meal at any place in the world
For me - Pizzeria Mozza is the best pizza in the country I've had some great Neopoliton pizza consistently at Il Ritrovo in Sheboygan of all places and I love Grimaldi's coal fired pizza in NY but really every single one of those places is distinctly different
I highly recommend the place only if you can maintain an open mind if you look at some of the worst reviews here you will have a difficult time understanding what was actually bad about the food
Q to U is a fantastic place to bring your family next time you're searching for some really good BBQ or just plain hungry and enjoy tasty almost sinfully~deliciousness food
The sandwich was pretty good but at over seven bucks it was a little pricey - any lunch at that price including my favourite Fuji Apple Chicken salad at Paradise Bakery places it into the rare treat category especially when you can buy one whopper and get one free @ less than half the price from Burger King these days
A-ny-way good place but bye bye one star for calling yourselves a bagel deli but not actually having any bagels on the one day of the year that I actually decide to visit
It's a great place for dates kids or just acting like kids with a bunch of friends
The ambience is good and service good even if a tad slow Cons1
In summary get over your Scottsdale prejudices and check out some of the great movies at this place out if you have not already
A friend who's lived here all his life raves about this place as a good fast-food alternative
Maybe it's a matter of taste in view of the other review on this page  but we thought this place serves GREAT Chinese with excellent attentive service and excellent prices although I'm used to LA prices and Phoenix is generally more economical across the board
This place is great to go to eitehr before or after a concert or a sporting event as there's plenty to do
And before i went i checked for reviews on yelp for a good sushi place
Ok positives--good location great service fun decor relaxed atmosphere
It was a goal of mine to hit up a new Dim Sum restaurant this year as opposed to the same amazing place we usually go to which is Great Wall on 35th Avenue and Camelback
so I've heard ; For a tiny local brewery this place is great
i went there one time Cause everyone was like this place is sooo good they jack off on your food its great
It's absolutely not a place I'd want to go for a date night I'd feel very upset I'd wasted the time and effort getting cute because you probably won't see other human beings - probably why they offer a 20% discount for sit-in dining but its great for good reasonably priced take-out Chinese food
Overall it was a great place for having been open only 4 days
While the video and sound remained great I didn't enjoy the experience of food and beverage service- too distracting the presence of servers the aroma of ketchup and then the necessary chatting to place the orders and to purchase
This place is not in my hood but would definitely make the drive to this place over and over if it stays as good as today
There are 4 or 5 separate rooms inside that create a cozy atmosphere and a great sense of privacy
Decorated with fancy wall papers flowers on each table and a nice collection of candles the Roosevelt would serve as an excellent place for a casual first date but works just as well for a fun night of beer sampling and cheese-eating snobbery
All in all the Roosevelt is a great place to go enjoy a few beers relax and enjoy some conversation
The owner was very nice and the place was very cute
They also have a good selection of scotches and whiskey that one seldom sees outside an Irish pubs so i guess that's what makes it an Irish place along with a few menu selections
Bistro 24 - great place to eat downstairs but you can walk over to Biltmore too
The place itself is cute very old school and I love the comment on the menu that says no cigar or pipe smoking
Friendly staff great food and a calming atmosphere give this restaurant an A in my book
What sets Liberty Market apart from other places with a great burger is the great service
We had many of these in Nebraska where I attended college but never really took advantage of a good breakfast place
It's a great place to go when you want a filling healthy meal for lunch
Head there for good microbrew selections check for their seasonal brews great food and a good lively atmosphere
On our way to Sedona AZ from Long Beach CA we were looking for a place to eat  more particularly a good pizza place
Under these circumstances one can drive around till you find what seems to be a remotely good pizza place or log on on yelp
Great place great food but not the greatest location
It was good all 4 bites of it but compare it to other places Fez Dicks Acacia and it pales in comparison
Other than these quibbles it was good food and a nice but small place
The drinks were bad the soda in my vodka was flat and pricey but still a great place to catch a drink
This place amazes me because it's one of the few buffet places where the food is actually consistently good and fresh
I don't know why this place has so many bad reviews
What makes this place great is the people
The drinks are on the cheap side and good Guinness comes in 20 OZ pints are are cheaper than other places around
I did know that it was hidden and that it was in PV but as soon as you take a look at the place it becomes obvious that this was going to be a great dining experience
We waited for the bill to come which took a while and while we were waiting we noticed that this place must be good when actual Indian people go there to eat indian food
In conclusion the atmosphere is great you can eat outside and sometimes the floor is a little slippery
If you want a really nice place to have a good conversation-you'll love it
Moving from Illinois I had a really hard time finding a good pizza place in PHX
Did this place end up with a great location
This place is so great & you just need to go visit it
If you are looking for an old-school Sonoran style Mexican restaurant with a good assortment of foods on the menu this is the place
but my good soup was worthy of the ghost town atmosphere
It's a great place to bring a lot of people as they have room upstairs and down and the scenery is good
The service was great however the prices are a little steep and when you walk in to the place it smells a little like they have a sewer problem which really curbed my appetite
It's a great place to pick up some good fresh produce
My order is always correct and the wings are still crispy when I get home so overall this is still a convenient and good place for wings
I prefer ordering in to dining in - the service wasn't all that spectacular though it wasn't a bad restaurant atmosphere
and I must ask of you who loved this place have you EVER had GREAT sushi
Great place for an AZ rugby referee social after a rainy tournament
The food was great and its a very cool atmosphere
good place to look for Staff is very friendly and helpful
classy but casual atmosphere; intimate service; and locally-sourced high quality ingredients prepared simply and perfectly
The atmosphere is nice and it's a really cute place
Atmosphere and service were good dark woods tall ceilings crisp white linens
I had heard great things about Zinburger including from my Tucson in-laws so my husband and I decided to try the place out
I've very rarely had a bad experience with the food but I will agree that the service can be meh at times but that's probably because the place is packed with loud and obnoxious college kids most nights
I've had many-a-good-pizza in my day and been to some places that I thought were my favorites until I had this little joint 7 years ago when they first opened
I totally dig all the old movies they play up on the tv bar and wall it adds a nice sense of style to the place and the tunes weren't too bad either
One great thing about this place is they select different valley organizations and charities to benefit one night a week for a selected month
It is a great place to start the night sip some fun cocktails at the bar or sit on the patio listening to a great mix of music
Our group of 4 headed there Saturday night and were immediately charmed by the atmosphere with the cute patio seating and white lights
As my wife and I sat down we noticed we were the only gringos in the place another good sign
Bearing in mind this is airport food and there is a distinct lack of options at the airport this place wasn't too bad to us
I hope it makes it as this is a great place to grab a bite
Streets of New York is an awesome place for lunch and I would guess it's also great for dinner but more pricey
It was so good flavorful with a good selection and they place had an understated atmosphere
This is also a great place for vintage lighting but it has nowhere near the inventory of vintage lighting that you will find at Stuff Antiques
This is one of the bastions of Old Phoenix at its best--or maybe its worst since a lot of the bad old days of corrupt city governance likely took place within Durant's walls
Jared and I felt like trying something new one night last week and after reading about how great Black Chile's burger was from our friends at EaterAZ we thought we'd give this place a shot
Well I really wanted to find a great place for lunch while in Carefree AZ one day
to anyone who enjoys great food and a friendly atmosphere
I passed on the baked Rigatoni which the place is famous for I was told it was good but it's not really my thing
It's got a nice ambience the waiters are really nice and for 3 people our bill was only $66 which in my opinion is a great deal
Great atmosphere decent prices and cool people
The place is also very clean  the ambiance is fabulous and service is always great
Great place overall and I'm sure if you were going for personal rather than professional reasons it would be even better
I mean don't get me wrong Koreans and Chinese have good Sushi places too but they arn't Japanese
So know your differences in Sushi before you comment on things like Yume is not as good as places near by like like RA or Sushi Brokers it makes you uneducated
other great places like Hiro and Sushi Ko are Japanese Sushi bars; owned and ran by Japanese folks
five stars to the food it is exactly what is supposed to be a Korean sushi place; with variety of good cooked Korean items on the menu
This is a good place to go for hapy hour but don't go to this place seeking good Mexican food
Good price for a healthy sized sandwichMy coworkers and I frequent this place about once a month
good place to try if your a sandwich lover
This is a really good place for a first date
The great thing about this place is the food which is why we keep going back
On a whim and hoping for the good old days when this place was one of our faves
I'm thinking Man this place must be good
So- go at happy hour stick to the signature apps and sushi and it's a great place
I will return to Corbin's despite this bad experience because it's a great place most of the time and right near my apartment
It is such a romantic place for an evening out with the one you love
My take is that this place is great for ambiance and almost there for food but something's missing
My overall impression of this place is that it's a good starting off point if you are hitting the Scottsdale clubs
my boyfriend said that the pad thai was good but did not say if it was any better or worse than my favorite spot in arizona  Thai Rama oh how i love that place
The place was dimly lit and seemed a bit stinky I need to have a good visual image of where I am eating
I would even come back to this place just for a coffee it was that good
What's a bummer is that the pizza joint on Mcdowell Mountain ranch that  changed locations was actually pretty good and this place simply isn't any good at all
This place has gotten really good reviews so I had to put this restaurant on my short list of places to check out
I've seen it happen time and again at places that come out with a great new presentation awesome flavor and a tremendous concept
I went here on a Friday night and it's a great place to grab a drink and some excellent appetizers
This is a really cute place though much bigger than the outside lets on and I would definitely give it a second try
You've got people here on a date celebrating a birthday or a place to take cute dinner photos with a nice picture-esque backdrop
Definitely a great find and a new item on the list of places to take out of town visitors
good atmosphere whether you like sports or family dining
Ok--go ahead and make that two napkins to be safe All in all this is a great little place especially for the surrounding area
Su Vino is a great place for a first date; meet up with friends or coworkers
Fun bartenders great atmosphere delicious appetizers and entrees
other then the service being a Lil lousy id say its a great place
A great place to eat daily for lunch I will be back
Great upscale old school romantic atmosphere
Having lived on both coasts I'm always skeptical of going to seafood restaurants in landlocked states and have actually had some good experiences but this place was an EPIC FAIL
Overall another great pizza place in the Phoenix area
I can't say I am an expert critic at music venues by any means but what I can say is that I love a great atmosphere and this place has just that
I hadn't been before but I had read some good reviews below and this place hit the marks
The Chandler location can be found just outside the Chandler Fashion Center and sounds like a great place to stop by and have a burger after a long day
A great place with moist delicious cupcakes
The fig was also really good though it was placed on 1 small spot on each slice of the flat bread
This is a good place I think for the small mom and pop places that have a higher markup than the corporate giants
Everything else I've tried here is really good and I recommend this place when you want Chinese on the fly
Its a fun place but do not go there expecting the greatest food or drinks
Overall its a great relaxed place for nightlife I heard its one of the best so maybe one of these nights I'll stop being old and go out
This place is spacious and cute; grab a quick meal on the counter
Not much seating inside but very well cooled down a great place to escape the heat
If you're in the area it's definitely a great place to try
That special treatment includes Great Service; Great Food; Great Conversation; Great Atmosphere
Good food small hole-in-the wall place but food is authentic and yummy
All together a good restaurant I love this place
This is my favorite place to go when my work isn't serving something good for lunch yes I'm spoiled lolAlso try the jamaica they make their own and they do it very very well
If you're looking for a great dim sum place I highly recommend China King in Chandler
relaxed atmosphere and plenty of TV's to watch your fave game
This place apparently is also great for some evening drinks so we look forward to seeing it in that type of setting too
Accessible food budget-friendly prices and an onslaught of Chicago-themed decor confirm this is a great place that I would think someone native to Chicagoland would be proud to have here in PHX
This place is definitely great in all the other options you can choose
This place is quite expensive and relative to taste it not a very good value
The laid-back dress code and atmosphere make this a great place to drink in a large group and mingle with fellow bargoers
not a great place but a good location to view Mill Ave
It's a good place to hang out if you've trolled up and down Mill Ave
Du00e9cor and Service  The place is very nice inside and the service was great servers and hostess are very friendly
The atmosphere is very relaxed which is not surprising with the owners' Pischke's connection
So it's been almost 3 years since a friend of mine told me this place was not so great so I never went
From first impressions I thought it was an iffy place trying a little too hard but I must confess that I've spent some great nights holed up with a load of friends drinking in one of the corner booths
Absolutely awesome food decent prices and great ambience
Jade Bar is a nice pre-dinner spot or just a good place to relax while enjoying the views
the only bad experience I had was when one of the hostesses said she couldn't seat me and my date w/o a reservation for an hour at like 6pm on a weeknight when the place was basically empty
This is my official breakfast after a REALLY good date place
Great place to take a date that you'd like to impress
If you're looking for bulk rice cardamom seeds black mustard seeds paneer or anything else from the multitude of Indian ingredients that are overprices for being exotic in normal groceries this is a great place
;Four Peaks both locations puts out a consistently fun atmosphere with sporting events including NFL and MLB games of all teams and a good vibrant and happy crowd
The place is definitely a hole in the wall and the service was good and very nice
Great as I would be there in 40 min so I had my name placed on the list
another great thing about this place is Churn next door
I like having a great place like Made in my neighborhood
Recommendation  If you want to get some frozen yogurt at a good price remember they go by weight like every other frozen yogurt place in Tempe
Cute place - I especially like sitting on their cozy covered patio
We decided to sit outside - great choice there was a big fireplace and lots of heat lamps which I sat right underneath
I highly recommend this as place to come hang out eat on the patio and have a great meal some margaritas and maybe a few beers
They have great food a great selection of wine and a trendy atmosphere
The deep fried chicken wings were real good and they had a soup they called Mexican soup that had beef tongue in it  it was not bad but out of place in a Chinese buffet
For beer lovers Papago is probably the best place in the greater Phoenix area
It's just a great place to drink a good beer
If you want a very high end burger thats super tasty - this is a great place for you
Did we hit the place on a bad night or what
Its our favorite Date Night Place with a twist of our own romantic sentimental value
The atmosphere looks like this place has great potential so bummed
but seriously this place was clean enough and had a cute little patio with picnic tables filled with lunching professionals
Overall it's a bit too americanized for my liking but still not a bad place for a quick lunch
Ultimately a locally owned place with great beer fresh and local food and fair prices in a cool atmosphere
It is a great place to find some of the more exotic items like fresh lemon grass and other greens
It's hard to rate this place because a good part of the responsibility for the quality of your dish is your own
Overall a great place for noodle lovers like myself
They remodeled a few months back and the place looks good
This is a great location but the placement of the building within the parking lot is questionable
This little place is quaint and romantic with excellent food
It's a great place to stop in and have a bite at lunch
I'm an anti-Starbucks girl and I'm a bit picky when it comes to my coffee places but this place was really good
As other Yelpers suggest this is probably a good place to introduce people to Vietnamese food but if you're looking for authentic/flavorful dishes you should pass
Down and not so dirty - This place you can get down on their dance floor and all around the bar and do it with a good amount of cleanliness around you
Delux is the perfect place if you are looking for a good classic burger and a cart full of fries I like the sweet potato
Maybe the ONLY good thing I like about this place is that the person at the door  stamps your whole family's arm with a number that can be viewed under a black light---that way Peds or Weirdos don't try to leave with a random kid if the number doesn't match under the glowing black light
The last couple of friday nights I've found this place with a pretty good crowd which is a nice out this way
All told a good place to grab a drink and catch a game
And the place looks good so it doesn't get just one star
Just returned to Richardson's after more than a decade -- really -- the place is just as good as ever
This place is great if you have no idea what the offerings are supposed to taste like
All in all you get really good customer service a lot of food at a CHEAP price cool atmosphere
We both loved the atmosphere food and drinks were great staff was very friendly
The place was very busy but we were all having a great time
My experience with a rude nasty bartender has put a bad taste in my mouth for that place and next time will be spending my money elsewhere
= So if you are looking for someone to call you sweet nicknames while eating good pizza this is the place for you
He promised me that nothing but good things would be found in this small and darkly lit place  kind of got this feeling that I was in the restaurant scene from the godfather and  that I was not going to come out alive LOL
OK so it is out of the way for some and yes it does look like a place that may have been really popular in the 1950-70's but that just means they spend more time making the food taste so good
The point is try this place and make sure you do as the old saying goes do not judge a book by it's cover or you may miss out on some really good food
The service is great the food quality is awesome and the ambience is upscale and refreshing
It's really supply and demand with some of the stuff ie cutesy planning books desk ornaments etc but the stuff I go for is completely curriculum-related an insult to have to buy in the first place and completely unaffordable on a normal teacher's salary
If you just want some good Mexican food but don't care about the ambiance this is your place
It was always I nice laided back place with a great Atmosphere
It is located in an unsuspecting place and in my opinion the location is something that makes it even more appealing -- the food is good enough that if the location was slightly more hip you wouldn't be able to get a seat there
There are many other great places where the staff is welcoming and anxious to help
Everything about the place screamed greatness
Excellent food good wine awesome atmosphere
I realized when I hit my navigation this place is close to Goodspeed Performance Lab where I hang out alot so I plan to be back often
Good place for a cheap meal and centrally located close to Mill Ave and ASU
Not a bad place but definitely gets packed despite how large the place is
Serious props to a friend for mentioning it because this place is great
This place offers good food at a good value which is just the thing during a recession
Well wish I could say this place was top notch as the service was good
what it is and the only way i found the place was doing some work about a couple blocks away and wanted to get a good bite to eat
it's a cute place but if you don't want cute don't want to wait and don't appreciate the kind of place that matt's it----go somewhere else
but my bad that's not allowed at a family place
The aesthetics and atmosphere looked and felt good to me
The decor and style of the place was great
They are a very clean cute place for eat-in or carry out
The Vig is definitely not a bad place and the new location is a HUGE improvement over the Arcadia location which was taken over by gross trolls from Scottsdale
There are much more delicious places in town but the service was good and you could bring your entire family here and squeeze them all in
This is a great place to take a date your parents or just dine on the way to an event at any one of the venues downtown
I'm from New Jersey/New York and go to ASU and came to the conclusion that Arizona has NO GOOD pizza places at all let alone Tempe
Sure places like Panera are great but Wildflower is in a league of its own
My fiancu00e9e and I have been looking for a great Thai place
The dim lighting and cozy seating make a good atmosphere and all the flat screens give you plenty of sports to watch
All in all great place friendly owner and I would definitely recommend
Pappadeaux and Mammadeaux too~ This place is kicken for Happy Hour Mon-Fri 3pm to 6pm with crazy good food at great prices
The main restaurant is a great place for groups however can be a little loud for intimate dates
I would recommend this place to people looking for a small town diner feel tasty food and good prices
You don't find sweet tea that much in the Phx even at BBQ places so it is nice to know there is a place I can get some great sweet tea
Overall a great place and I will come back for moar the first chance I get
Great place to peruse the look only beef is most all furniture accessories etc are VERY pricey
If you're looking for a casual night out with delicious steak and potatoes I would recommend this place
This place is a great resource for hard to find middle eastern ingredients
Brad's Place is the kind of great little neighborhood bar you find all over the midwest
All the servers were polite and efficient  The interior design makes it a great place for anything too
I guess the people who go there aren't the most glamorous like the people who go to Scottsdale Fashion Square but I wouldn't mind if I can get in a good deal and all my shopping done in one place
So this place is not too bad serves up some great sushi
Overall not a bad place to shop if you are in the area
Sunday's are great to visit this place as it's usually not busy between 3-5
In Arizona you have less but this is good for Green because they are one of the yummiest places I've been to
When Johnny Apple suggests one eat someplace I usually do as before his death he had seen it all ate it all drank it all and knew the good stuff from the bad
I always thought Lamp's signage was cute and put it on my mental list of places to try
The total bill was about $45 which is a little high for brunch but the service was great atmosphere excellent and food incredible
The place was very busy which to me usually means the food is really good
This is a good place to go with a group of friends if you're not looking to meet other people
The seating and atmosphere are really relaxed but fun
Contingent upon the crowd on any given night this place could be packed with thirty thousand dollar millionaires or the more modest variety of Scottsdalers just out to have a good time and be entertained
That being said NY&C is a great place to get stuff for work
Overall this place is very good but too pricey
I've had it at their pizza place it's really good
It's one thing to pay a moderate amount for good food with good atmosphere but this place is just Panda Express in trendy clothes
After reading the great reviews about this place some friends and I decided to try it
On the flip side our server was really sweet the drinks were great and the atmosphere was nice
Great ambience relaxing nice art on the walls
I'm just really mixed on the place I want to like it so bad but the fact of the matter is you can really tell there is no pride of ownership
Not too many places offer it and we both love a good chili on any kind of bad for ya meat
Overall Chuhgajib is a pretty nice place --- not my favorite but pretty damn good
Great food and great atmosphere thats what I say about AZ88
This is a great place to go for some drinks with friends or to indulge in their wonderful food
I go to this place at least two or three times a month usually if not for any other reason then to get a Medicine Man they make me feel good
Good place for a celebration with lots of people though
I used to think this place was really good when I went to school in Arizona but when I moved to San Francisco I learned what real Italian food should taste like
The service here is fast the food is fantastic and this is a great place to seek out for a delicious lunch or dinner
I have no idea how they should fix this problem but this pie wasn't great even though I still love this place
But if you are looking for a good hamburger that is different from the typical chains I would recommend this place
This place has a lot of bad reviews but I've never had a problem here
Postinos normally good service food is ok but that blonde server on Sunday placed a sour note on breakfast
There really isn't a whole lot to say about MacAlpine's other than it's a really cute place with lots of fun stuff to look at
The food wasn't bad it just wasn't as good as I come to expect from the place
I had no intention of complaining or changing my opinion of the place since I've always had good meals there
It's a small shop but a great place to be nostalgic for a few minutes
I was craving great pizza and this place was recommended by a friend so I went to check it out
This place was a pleasant surprise and I wish the owner great success
I'd say this is a pretty good chill date place
Great place wish i still lived near there
so great I decided to sign up on yelp and contribute to the rave reviews that encouraged me to try it out in the first place
They also do take-out and unlike some places the take-out is just as good as if you were eating in the restaurant
I am a Brooklyn raised Puerto Rican who lived on a 3 generation mafia owned pizzeria LOL and let me tell you this place is just as good so go there and let them make you a offer you can't refuse  ;
Trying to decide where to pick up dinner for my family I decided to try this place based on the great Yelp reviews
This is a great place for a fast lunch without the fast food
This diner is a good place for a fast home style meal
Very clean friendly atmosphere fast good food
If you're looking for something good and fast and don't want to settle for the typical fast food fare give this place a try
Eddie V's is an interesting place very good service over the top good
And the food was good too We are new to the area and have a favorite sub place back in Michigan called Jersey Giant where everything is freshly sliced and huge
Overall it is a great experience with fabulous service food and atmosphere
It is a quality pizza place with good prices
I thought I wrote a review on this place but we will try this again this place sits in a half empty mall but it is a great down home breakfast spot but they also do lunch and dinner Service is good wends day and Friday are fish fry night  which we gave a whirl as well it was good but being from Seattle we have a tough time finding good seafood except at sushi restaurants we frequent this place is well worth a try
Great prices cool atmosphere young friendly attentive staff
Located in the Desert Ridge mall this is a great casual place to go with friends and family
The atmosphere was casual but outside we didn't experience the noise of the tvs and music that were all inside
It would be better if they had more sides but on the other hand when a place only has a few things to choose from those few things are usually great
Not the place for a quiet romantic dinner
i can't say enough about Sutra- great class selection and times kind capable instructors Sebastian is especially goodhealing meditative challenging and fun workoutsa hip relaxed atmosphereaffordable ratesa focus on individual practice - no ego - and a focus on women with many classes for moms and even childrenand above all what keeps me coming back is the amazing owner Rebecca who always remembers my name even though I come so infrequently
Overall this is a great place to watch a game/games and I am looking forward to College and NFL games this fall
The atmosphere is great - friendly hip personal - the likes of which i haven't seen since I left Manhattan with the exception of a couple vacations to San Francisco and Amsterdam
It is a very nice restaurant with a great atmosphere but the food is kind of blah depending on what you get
This is a great place let me say that first right off the bat
Nice atmosphere but TFC The Filipino Channel on the tube set on VERY LOUD quickly ruins the good vibes for me
This place totally rocks and I recommend you all flash mob this place to keep it alive and well serving up goodies for years to come
Definitely a great little hole on the wall place
As other reviews for this place go taste of the food is good
The prices are reasonable the food and service is great and the atmosphere is really nice
An OK place to bowl and the service was good but I think there are better alleys in town
Anyway I am obsessed with shredded beef crispy tacos and this place has really good ones
Great place for a date with someone you have been dating for a while
The place looks beautiful and in a great location but feels like a fast food joint
I'm from the East Coast and have had a hard time finding good Italian places here in Phoenix
But I'll say Uncle Sal's reminds me of a great Italian place back home  in NJ called Goodfellas
Great place for sexy sundresses and flattering skirts
There are too many other great restaurants in Phoenix with fantastic views and ambience to waste this type of money on poor service and mediocre food
It's not often I give a place less than three stars unless I had a real bad experience there like shit service huge wait or a cockroach in the pudding
So this place left a bad taste in my mouth even after all the ketchup
Ok the beer specials during the games was a great deal with $3 anything beers pretty cute waitstaff  I wish I remembered my waitresses name but she was very sweet and looked like she was 16 but very nice and quick with drinks especially since we had like 20 people in my group I love places where waitresses can keep up with a ton of tabs and not complainOverall very good I only had scalloped potatoes since I was not feeling well but everyone said the food was good
Sacks is a great sandwich place that I went to on a lunch break at work
Other than that this place had a welcoming staff great sandwiches and price was not bad
Definitely a great place for a special dinner
After all a place named Bacon has got to be a good spot right
The atmosphere was great very comfortable for the morning
I wouldn't recommend going to this place if you want some good Mexican food
This is another real authentic Mexican food place in the Phoenix Metro area that has quality Mexican food at a great price
I'm always down for an escape from reality and some good R&R and this place definitely hit the spot
I would like to see this place turn up the notch on the food keep the same menu but make it taste as great as the menu tells me it will
He was brilliant it was a great tour because the place is still a working school rather than a museum so you can touch things and see up close where he lived and did his work
The atmosphere is very casual and open
Great little place tucked away in a semi-residential area of town
Keep up the good work because this place is clearly satisfying a need of many
They serve food till pretty late so this is a great place to go after a night of drinking
3 Great place to take the family for a cheap meal
I would say this is the best most consistent Mexican place we have found nearby and have never had a bad meal here or bad service
I really wish I could give Thai Lahna more stars because of their location - the Arcadia area needs a good Thai place enter Sa Bai
You want good service and a great place for your pets
If you have a sweet tooth I guess this place is good for you
It's a nice casual feel and a perfect place to go before catching a movie next door
Something as simple as eggs should be cooked to perfection if this place was so good
Among the beverages the Thai ice-tea is especially good better than the tea at the Thai places that I've been to
I heard a lot of good things about this place and was looking forward to some great food
it's a good way to start or end your night but there's not much to the place since it's rather small
There is no competition here for them - Sandbar food is not great the other 2 places here are good but not awesome
I have been meaning to check this place out since I moved to the valley more than 3 years ago but had not heard good things about it
If you are a cigar smoker then Goodfellas Cigars is the place to be
I have so many dishes that I love that it is hard not to spend a fortune when going there so now that I live on my own I save this place for special occasions and good paychecks
Chars is a place that I had meant to check out for months but never got around to it but when I did I had a great time
I guess the reason this place doesn't get more stars is the food - while not bad it doesn't stand out much
This is a great location though you'll have to pay to park before 6p and a nice atmosphere to enjoy a glass of wine delicious food and conversation
It feels like you're dining in someone's house great family atmosphere
The service there is great and I really like the decor and atmosphere
A perfectly good place for a chill Friday night dinner
Wife - Teriyaki Chicken very good even though all places only sell breast meat on chicken entrees
If you need just one thing this would be a good place to run in and out
Have frequented this place for brunch over the past couple months and it has been a great relationship
And the food offered is all over the place from meatloaf and cheesesteaks to great dinner items you find in upscale dinning restaurants
That combined with the place being pretty empty made it a good place for having young kids
The burgers here are great I love the casual atmosphere and set up where you pick everything you want on the burger
The atmosphere was great the people were friendly and the location for me is excellent
dont compare this place to Cibo Cibo is great but its not Biancos however it is a great alternative choice
Our server was excellent and professional and I'd say it's a great date place if you're in the area
I love places that make you feel at home and Arrivederci certainly does that with zero pretentiousness from the staff and I also appreciated the casual elegance vibe the place had
I would say the only draw back for me is certain nights it is a league night and all the big tables are taken up but that is not really a problem as the place is packed so its a good thing but if you want to play pool on league nights then join a league I guess which I might
It seems interesting to me that this place has gotten some really good reviews
It's rare for me to give a place a low rating but My Big Fat Greek restaurant is nothing but gimmick anymore and has gone from bad to worse
it's never been as good as you can get from a 'Ma and 'Pa place
Atmosphere is great and the tables and wine racks are interesting
I had my hopes high after hearing so many good things from long term Phoenicians in the valley that love love love this place
The meat was great but sliced a bit too much for me but each place does things differently and there could have been a bit more on the sandwich
Now a place like this I would expect really enjoyable if not great service
It is never a good thing when a table full of famiodis foodies take in an entire meal at a new place without a single rave or a 'holy socks Batman this is killer
While there I asked around for a good place to eat
This place is really small so it's only good for you and a friend unless you want to sit on the wall bar
I sat at the bar a great thing about this place is that it has HH on the weekends
The bacon and sausage are hearty they know how to poach an egg and their coffee is great-really a rarity for a breakfast and lunch place
This is another place that I would encourage all Yelpers to go patronize because they serve up great food with a smile and a lot of heart and are more than worthy of our hard earned dollars
Next - there are only 3 places in Phoenix that can make good table-side guacamole and this is the best of them
I came here this afternoon because I was feenin for some sushi and heard good things about this place
too bad I don't work downtown anymore this place would be real convenient and has a great return factor4 STARS**
The servers can also be a bit absent with such a large place so you're much better off to sit at the bar the bartenders are great
Come mainly for the beer in a place with attentive bartenders and relaxed atmosphere that doesn't get too loud for a bar
While the atmosphere is a little too hippie/hipster for my general liking the food was really good and the staff were awesome and very willing to help us first timers
It was a good thing we had reservations because shortly thereafter the place was packed
For many many years Scottsdale Fashion Square has been a great place to see and be seen
Great place to get the things you just can't find at the big chain stores
If you are going on a date or out with a group this is a great place with affordable food
This is not a place that puts a great deal of emphasis on presentation but for about $2 less than say Red Robin or about $4 less than El Paso for ribs with 2 sides I think it is a good value
The food and service was good but the place was small
I like the casual atmosphere with dog pics on the walls and peanuts in dog bowls
That was the only good thing about this place
Parking and etc 2/5Kyoto is located in Old Town Scottsdale which is probably the only good thing this place has to offer
They even have a cute little garden outside
This place is great if you are looking for something sweet and are in Scottsdale
Sugar Bowl is also open late so its a great place to go if you are hungry or drunk or have the muchies and need something good to eat
Nice atmosphere great service and a surprisingly good dining experience awaited
The staff does a great job of getting the orders out quickly and keeping the place clean and appealing
Fez was a great place before I knew Thomas and the world of Yelp and although those things make me like it even more now it is a solid restaurant to try out
I was glad to be contacted by the new management who tried to help us out by offering us a meal on the house but the fact of the matter is we had such a bad first experience that I cannot convince my boyfriend to try and give this place a second chance even with a free meal dangled in front of his face
I know that airport food isn't usually good but this place's just horrible
From food and drinks to a great staff this place has really outdone themselves
The atmosphere was relaxed with low lighting and trendy decor
This would be a great place to start your First Friday Art Walk
I just didn't see any other reviews for such a great place
Great place to take beginners to medium level
Physically the place is open and nice for an extremely casual hang out wear your t-shirt and flip flops
I would recommend this place to anyone who loves great atmosphere with their great food
Paradise is a good I am not sure where to go so I'll stick with what I know sort of place to eat
Don't get me wrong the pasties are great but there are a few reasons why this place isn't a four star restaurant1 It's overpriced
It may be slightly pricey but it has a great atmosphere fun trendier relaxed and the food is A+
The service was good food was delicious and atmosphere was festive
The atmosphere is great and dollar bills cover the walls and ceiling
You know those people who keep telling you how great a place is and will not leave you alone till you try it
I've never had a bad experience here and it's the one place I regularly wish I could visit now that I've moved away from Arizona
This place will be strictly 'to go' orders for me and I'll use the good German mustard in my fridge
It's not a good place if you want to actually have a conversation or see the people you're with
The prices and varieties are great for those who rated one or two stars I really think you need to give this place another shot
I just placed an order yesterday via online VERY EASY PROCESS for a meeting we were having today for our office and they did a great job
The atmosphere is great a large patio with long tables and bench seating plenty of room for a large group
I don't know about the stuff that gets filled with cream cheese and deep fried or other cooked stuff all I care about when I go to a sushi place is the quality and freshness of the fish and this place was great
As one of my fave restaurant's in Scottsdale the Herb Box is the perfect place for a great patio and lunch
At dinner the atmosphere is subtly romantic with string lights illuminating the patio
I have to admit we have a lot of great eateries in north east phoenix & Chick Rotisserie & Wine Bar is a place that I will frequent often
Nice place great service but the food is bad
Large booths make this place good for groups of 6
wasn't bad just noticeably louder than most places
I live in the area but there's SOOOO many good places to eat around here I just hadn't made it in yet
Sure the bar was empty except for me the ex-husband and a guy named John for more than half the time we were there but just as we were leaving the local regulars started showing up and you could tell that this is the type of place that good people that lost their way go to die
Lunch was cool the place was fairly crowded with a good mix of young old and families
Overall this place didn't blow me away but it was very good and I would consider going back here
I expect the light rail to help out a bit with this as it really is a great place
The atmosphere here is great and very sunny
If you're in the area looking for a great lunch the Asian Island is a solid place to go
below this place definitely gives his town a bad name
Great place if I lived near ASU to walk and grab a quick burger but overall it was pretty average
Glad I found a good bento box place close to the office
It was a pretty casual and relaxed atmosphere
All in all the place is great to chill out have a beer watch some tv and grab a decent burger
Your clothes will smell of this place for a good 2 washings
A good casual place to just hang out - Pomeroy's holds a special place in my heart and always delivers a good time
Try out Maximum Pilates it is a wonderful place with really great people
Best place at the mall to watch sports and great place to relax/drink if the girl is inside shopping and spending money Not sure how long this location has been here because I think I remember it being something else but then again I'm not one to frequent malls too often
Although not as authentic as some of my favorite small Mexican restaurants it is a great dining experience and someplace that I can bring friends and visitors
The decor and atmosphere are cool the crowd is diverse it's a good place to meet people and a fun place to go with your friends
Sprinkles is a great place to go for a sugar fix but I have to say there are some negatives
Lets get this out of the way and on the table first this ws not a bad place to go but it wasnt my favorite by any means
This place is like that great pair of sneakers you have a very good fit
Not many places will say that since most restaurant in the Valley will fold less than 3 years and it has endured a good 20+ years
The atmosphere is casual/comfortable yet almost genteel that's a silly word I regrettably can't think of a better substitute for
I definitely recomend this place if your looking for a nice upscale place for dinner with really good steaks
I work downtown and Jim's is a great place to grab a lunch when you want to take an extra 15 minutes or so
True it is a great place to people watch but do I want to sweat like an animal especially when I'm trying to look hot in my new clothes
It's a big place so it's good for groups or an event
Lee's is one of my favorite Chandler Gems and a great place to eat when nothing else sounds good
Lee's because a place this good deserves my respect
I love this place and it really is the only good Chinese restaurant in the area that's not super super casual
The store is always very clean and bright and the employees are really great and treat customers well and I have seen some really cool exchanges between regulars and employees- it's that kind of place
It's not quite Cuba but the aromas and warm welcoming atmosphere are enough to make you feel as relaxed as you would on vacation
The place feels like a whole in the wall restaurant with good food
The service is great I love the casual yet not too casual feel of the place and I love the menu
And this place knows how to make a good spicy Thai dish
This is a great family place so much to do and see
i recommend The House Dynamite with chickenThe Spicy Saigon with tofuThe Pad Thai with chicken or tofuThe Hot and Sour soupThe Thai Chicken saladand the cucumber martiniI love the atmosphereeverything is great exceptthe wait is always incredibly long for not only for a table but service and food as wellthe seating is uncomfortable close togetherthe food is overpriced

This place is great for a special occasion a romantic date night a nice work dinner a girls night out birthday party
I will go back to this quirky kind place with great food
Overall this was a good restaurant but I would only come back when the place is less busy
The bad Everything about this place is filthy--bathroom tables and often the beer mugs when you actually get glass ones not to mention the broken pool cues busted darts and three-legged tables
If you want a great meal and service save your money for someplace like BLT or Rancho Pinot
The patio is a great place to have a lazy Saturday afternoon drink with friends

This place is new and its evident that they are trying extra hard to get brownie points which isnt necessarily bad ofc and I guess its working
The place is located quite close to the other good Indian place Kabab palace and is in direct competition with it and I already heard many people say its better than that because food is a tag tastier and a tag cheaper

They also loved the location surrounded by old town Scottsdale great places to walk around if you're into taking a little stroll after your meal
Not a bad place to get that kind of stuff as some was pretty reasonably priced

In all honesty this place is not too bad at all
It is a great place to do some power walking when it it  100 plus degrees outside

The food is spot on service great and the ambience is romantic
Cute little place and I like going to non-chain businesses so already a star
This is not a date spot - just a good place for tasty food
Most vegan and veg places simply preach to the choir and just don't do a good enough job of attracting omnivores

I feel bad giving this place 1 star so I'll give it 2 stars since a buddy of mine frequents this place
Visited this great place last week with my parents and sister and we all had a great time
If you're looking for a nice restaurant with good food that has an American Tavern feel this is your place

The good news was that it was right outside of Essence and I've been wanting to try this place for quite awhile
Renegade is great place for a romantic meal a group meal or even a meal by yourself

But like all good bbq places its the sauce that makes all the difference and Fritzi makes some of the best sauce you have ever tasted
I guess my guy learned that not every place is ranch friendly and roasted red pepper aioli is pretty damn good
It was good but nothing to really get excited about and it had a strange peanut-brittle topping that seemed to be kind of out of place
We walk in and this place is so freaking cute that I almost peed my pants
I really didn't want to have to write this review since I live in the neighborhood and want this place to be good
Before it appeared on Food Network although expensive this place was quite good
Maybe I had a bad experience here because I don't understand why previous yelpers found this place to be noteworthy
Quiet chill not busy and a relaxed place for some dinner and a drink
The patio is a great place to be during the spring and late fall when the weather is probably what heaven is like 24/7
This place has some REALLY good pho and if that's what you are looking for then you'll leave happy
My kids and I love this place great specials on Monday night but we go there on other days as well
And it's a good thing they keep the lights low not only for all the TVs but I'm sure the place has needed a renovation for at least the last ten years
So for the fast friendly efficient service and the great food we give this place 5 stars because it well deserved
Now I honestly think that they are pretty overpriced for some of their gluten-free stuff but they do offer some varieties I haven't seen at a traditional place like Whole Foods or Sprouts - AND this place is super cute too
This small taco shop that is family owned is just the right kind of place to go for lunch for some fast very good Mexican food

This placed is loaded with tons of great food

-dirty place Yes as I mentioned it needs a good cleaning those pew cushions were nasty and the wax should be scraped off and menus cleaned up-smells Yes but we deduced it was the cabbage
Never again --- and the food was fair --- not a good place to return to -- ASU take it away -- its all yours -----
This place is solely for indy/punky/trendy which they do make quite clear so they are what they say they are which is good
Overall a pretty good place - the only gripe I have is that I know two chicken cutlets rice and spinach costs about $7 to buy and they charge $17
Overall I'd say FEZ is a good place it just seems a little scatterbrain in presentation full of ideas and great food on paper and just a little overpriced
i think this place is great for not a special occasion but say a better night than usual
This place was a very pricey bad nail experience for me
Do I always get good food at great prices in a place I feel comfortable wearing track pants and a bandana at
After having eaten at Golden Buddha China King C-Fu and China Chan I have to say that Great Wall is probably the best place to get dimsum in the Valley
I really enjoyed the atmosphere of Carlsbad Tavern
It wasn't bad and I probably made a bad menu choice I ordered a steak at a place specializing in New Mexican cuisine
Not bad but considering it was the least expensive option on the menu the presentation atmosphere and quality wouldn't be enough for me to spend $25-$30 per entree as most were listed
Not when there's a Nellos and a  great falafel place so nearby
Overall I would definetly go back plus there are lots of other great places in the DC Ranch area
Yes- think of this as a great place for a cozy cup of coffee but definitely think of it for a great lunch/dinner or get together with a group of friends-any age
Pretty good place to have a corporate event
Italian beef is apparently pretty popular in north Scottsdale - there are three Chicago-style beef places within 2 miles of my work - this one Luke's and Taste of Chicago all three with good Italian beef and other Chicago classics
The fries are very good - freshly cooked and well seasoned with a home-cooked flavor that beats out the fries at most places
FEZ is still the go-to place for good food good atmosphere and good people
All in all its a great place to watch a game
I usually feel that food trumps service and as long as the place is nice and the food is good I can deal
It's a great place to kill an hour while you're waiting for a table or your wife to get our of H&M ahem

it was a good mix and there weren't any gangsters or thugs in the place
There's also pool tables and darts so all in all this place is good

It's a casual atmosphere the servers are friendly and there was live music on a Thursday night
Bright friendly casual slow paced atmosphere
All in All O'Connor's is a good place where as the sign says You're only a Stranger Once The long bar seats around 20 and there are tables high top tables and booths also
Seemed like a great spot to have a beer and relax but I think I will try other places before returning right away
This place is a great addition to the downtown scene
It's both casual and a pseudo-foodie place

The atmosphere is very fun and people don't really go there to mingle itsmore of a place to with your friends and have a good time without having to impressanyone
This place is a cute kitschy place to have lunch with an extensive menu but sucks when it comes to nightlife
The ambiance of the restaurant is very nice the du00e9cor an lighting set a great atmosphere for a casual yet classy dining experience
This is my favorite fast casual HEALTHY place for a non-gutt busting lunch or light dinner that is  somewhat close to the Arrowhead Mall area and it is NOT A CHAIN like the one on same street near by
Not bad compared to some places but nowhere near as good as the typical 5 minute wait at Jobing
Altogether a good place with a nice atmosphere and attentive service
Good thing this place is over 30 miles away from my house I couldn't afford the calories if they were closer
Since a lunch sashimi combo would've cost me $18 $3-6 higher than most other sushi places for lunch I opted for an Atkins roll $9; pretty good; never had a roll sans rice before and a $10 lunch combo with yellowtail sashimi fine and some Japanese dumplings which came fried yuck
While visiting Phoenix a group of six of us decided to go out for dinner one night and chose Tommy V's - gourmet pizza casual atmosphere is what the website promised us and we were not disappointed
All in all nice place with pretty good service and pretty good food
This place gets a 4 star because the burgers are good- not great
If that is all you are looking for this is a great place to go -- if you are looking for something more let me know what you find
The sushi was good but the atmosphere and missing bar stopped me from giving it 4 stars
This place actually reminds me a LOT of that place which is great to have right in my neighborhood not to mention right next to my favorite strip club but that's another review
As someone else said a good place to bolt from if things didn't go well
There is a good reason why this place doesn't post their prices it's because if they did most folks would walk right out
Out of kindness I am giving this place a 2 star just for the good crust--and it is really good crust--but their idea of pizza is lots of tomato sauce
The place is small but the Host/ waiter / Owner's Son did a great job serving the 4 groups of people
I'm used to going to scary places in interesting neighborhoods for good food but this place is pretty scary even for someone used to hanging out next to K-Mo Mo

this is a great place to go with friends or right before the move
If people give this place a bad review because it's a chain then that's just silly
If your day is lacking a good decision this place will change the course of your life - at least for an hour
sure there's better places to get great Mexican food in the town but after spending half a day to have an IHS dr
perhaps now with the temps dropping and fall approaching the patio will be a great place to watch games
In a part of town that is lacking great places to eat lunch I am glad Nello's is in my neighborhood
The servers had no direction in what they were doing the place was way understaffed which made for a less than great dining experience
I moved here last year from Orlando which has a suprisingly robust Vietnamese community and tons of great places to get Vietnamese food

This would be a great place to have downtown
My wife loves good tempura so we went to try this place

I would definitely return it was a good place for a group to have a nice casual breakfast

The fried chicken is great fried like no other and not like any fast food place
From hard-bodied shirtless regulars to local families--it is a great place to people watch and interact
I wish we could find a place that would do calamari like Ken's where it's sautu00e9ed instead of fried but alas It was still pretty good
The place was a bit empty - not a good sign - for a Tuesday night
I recommend this place because the food is so good but bring your patience for the parking and slow service
If you're looking for sushi I'd suggest elsewhere but if you want a swanky time nice teppanyaki good drink specials and eye candy aplenty both male & female this is a great place to stop by
Side-note there is free wifi the customer services is great also the atmosphere is perfect for meeting friends getting work done and studying
For being a 24 hour Mexican restaurant this place is as good as it gets
Overall a great place to try different small dishes and share
This is a great place owned and run by great cooks and owners
I will say the place is pretty spendy try about $28-$55 for an entree and all ala carte but worth it for special occasions especially when the service is so great
For such a casual dining place the prices are just exorbitant
I guess if you are into that this place is located in a pretty good area
beef tongue - if you've never tried it yasu is a good place to start
Hoping to taste great things from this place whenever I get the JJ craving

They're local they put used and new books right next to each other on the same shelf have consistently good author events kid friendly attached to a good place to eat have clean bathrooms excellent staff good website great selection of gifts and always have sale books plus they are located 3 doors down from another smaller used book shop and everyone gets along
The only thing good about this place is that when i was finished i was able to go to the frozen yogurt place a few doors down
The edamame were great but the calamari had waaaay too much batter on them they were more like the calamari you get at an Italian American place than a japanese restaurant
Since I moved to the Valley in August I have been on a journey to find the greatest locations with nice quiet laid-back atmospheres and House of Tricks quickly became one of my favorites
I think these places are a great value for the money
I hate giving bad reviews and I really want to like this place
Also I've ended up having some pretty great conversations at this place and that must mean something
But the place was cute the food was great and the price very hippie-reasonable--you rock Two Hippies
The fact that the place makes you smile probably has something to do with the fact that everyone and i mean everyone looked to be having a good time
This place is a good go to when you're looking for a mexican infused panda express
the beers are good service is fine by myself with a group with my dog without my dog- I've never been ignored and the ambiance is chill the constant hip-hop music seems a bit incongruous with the 'image' of the place but as I like the music they play no complaints
Apparently it can damage your transmission so badly you may have to get it REPLACED
I'm not a big gyro fan but my wife likes them and thought that this place made really good ones
The facility is clean and attractive--overall a really great place to eat
Atmosphere - 6Food - 6It was a great price for the meal - $6
We got here at around 445 which was good because by the time we left the place had a long wait and was packed
This place has a good system- you pick out your flavor of yogurt and toppings and make it any way you want then just weigh it at the end
Great location super cut atmosphere food looks good
And I've had many good times at this place over the years
* a crappy parking situation* a 20 minute wait which isn't that bad if the place is worth it* being so crammed in that you are basically sitting on top of the people next to you* being ridiculously hot because they couldn't spring for more/better fans or an outdoor A/C thing my fault for going in September but tons of people were standing in line to be crammed and hot so I thought I could stick it out* bad service god forbid they ask you if everything is ok if you need anything else or want a refill on anything but waterOh and if my server is reading this I am still waiting on my toast you said would be right out
HAHAAll in all this is a good place to watch a game with your group of friends on one of the many TVs in a warm atmosphere thank you dark wood decor and eat some good bar food
I have nothing bad to say about this place
having waited for an Asian noodle shop to open in the East Valley i was thrilled to read good reviews about this place that was right down the road
My husband and I heard about this cute little place in Phoenix

He replaced our malfunctioning fan and the unit works great now
When we arrived I was pleased with the casual atmosphere and good service
The Great Indoors is a phenomenal place to get lost and dream about what you would like to have your home look like
One final note while not a place for extreme bargain hunters if you play your cards right you can get some great deals
I don't feel right calling this converted house a bar; it's more like a laidback casual but elegant place to kick back with your buddies or a date while sipping on good beer or a nice glass of wine
I freaking love Pimm's Cups and only a handful of places in Phoenix serve them so when I get a good one I remember it vividly well as vividly as i can remember things that occur on patios at 100 AM on a Saturday
I recently discovered Tony when searching for a good place in Old Town to take my only pair of brown shoes that were pretty scuffed up
Republic Ramen or as I tend to say - Ramen Republic is a great little place if you're looking for a huge serving of fantastic food for decently cheap
Overall great little place with a fun relaxed atmosphere
To the romantic patio with its fireplace cozy chairs and christmas-lit desert trees that brings out the worst in every horned up yuppie jackass
But damn if the place ain't great on a normal night
I guess the best thing I can say is that this place from the sounds of it seems very authentic the food is good and the server was cool
Cute place to have fro yo while walking around Scottsdale Quarter
I want specific places to get my specific goods
I will probably pass on the ribs next time not because they were bad but rather because there are other things I am longing to try in one of the best places we have been to during our visit to Scottsdale
looking for a ew great breakfast place
Easily the greatest bar in Phoenix the Bikini has more moods than any other place I've been to
I've never seen a place where a more diverse crowd gathers to have a good time quite like the Bikini
Let's face it there are a lot of places to get a good gourmet burger including my back yard but the yummiest burgers are at Lobby's
The room was lovely - beautiful decor great materials no detail was compromised and the place was perfectly clean
This place used to be quite good but I think they may have had an ownership change recently
When I think of service at a casual place I really focus on speed
not  a bad place if you're willing to wait or eat what they bring you rather than what you ordered
This place can host exclusive private party for the movers and shakers of Arizona as well offer a great lunch menu for the common foodie
I can't forget the SteakIf you know your steaks this is not a bad place to stop by but don't come here on a tight budget you'll miss out
I would definitely recommend this place for some good Texan food
My boyfriend was much more pleased as well and said he can definitely throw Lobbys now into his list of places to go when he is craving a good burger
So it's a good place for lunch or to grab a quick slice if pizza
Great place to go and grab lunch or even dinner
My list of 'badass places' only contains of about 10 places in Phx; and SideBar is one of the best
This is a great place to dine after work if you work downtown
There are lots of places with good dough good sauce good cheese and good toppings but a true standout pizzeria will make all the individual ingredients work together to make something truly delicious that haunts your taste buds for more even weeks later
This place was pretty awesome in terms of ambiance good vibes cool live music fun app's a great and savory meatloaf and an awesome dessert called Monkey-bread
Scottsdale really does a great job keeping this park up and it's a great place to relax and recharge
Pretty standard Chinese fare but the place lately has been spotless and the service great

A place where the owner greeted each patron upon entry and gave them a hug or a handshake to say goodbye
I figured 4 stars from Yelp this place cant be bad

Usually pretty picky about who cuts my hair and rarely take a risk to try a new place unless I HAVE to and my this time I needed a cut bad
Overall it was a nice place but with all of the good choices in Scottsdale I am not sure I would go back again
So I strongly suggest that if you need a place to get your nails done Nancy's will do a great job and your feet and hands will feel extra pretty and loved
It's not a cheap place but not at the top of the scale either so it won't be a weekly visit but they have some great happy hour deals and it's worth any special occasion outing
I love this place for a casual and delicious lunch
Cute little place with a patio outside and a bar and a few tables inside

I've never had a bad experience at an Olive Garden
I cant say that I've had many canolies in my life but if they're all this good there will be an eternal place in my heart set aside for these delectible deserts
Good place for an occasional visit but regular visits might incur a larger waistline as it is a very carb heavy meal
I had heard a lot of good things about this place before going and I brought my mom here while she was visiting
Most places only give you 1 so this is a great deal
This place does satisfy cravings I have for good rice plates and they also have a pretty diverse menu
So other than the annoying kids that work here this place is pretty good
But it's really not a place for ladies I am guessing otherwise they would have spent the $20K to get decent equipment and make the gym worth visiting especially since there is no place else to go besides the golf course or horeback riding-get a room on the end bc you can hear your neighbors and make sure to get a good view of the desset-overall I would give it a 6
I never thought that any place would ever do this to any club that lets them know in advance that we're coming shows up very regularly with good numbers behaves well and provides much-needed revenue for the bar and the wait staff
Cute place I felt like I was in Mexico
If you don't mind the high-energy brunch scene this place is probably pretty good
It's a good place for a date or to meet a friend for a casual happy hour
If you've never been here this place is impossible to find; look for the neighboring liquor store which is great for heading to afterparties
The food is good the Kiltlifter is cold and tasty and the atmosphere reminds me of some of the stuff that the McMenamin Bros do with old buildings in the Northwest
It's totally a man's bar and one of those places you feel silly ordering a martini or glass of wine but that's what is great about it
All in all it was a good lunch and I would definitely recommend this place to others
I never considered it one of my favorites but it is a good solid place
Great for trail running--not so scrabbly that you need to worry about foot placement at all
We're spoiled by having a few really great pizza places in town
This place won't spring to mind first when I recommend pizza in Phoenix but the good service and decent variety will assure that I probably come back again
There wasn't a bad table in the place even the 2 tops which is what we had
Casual atmosphere quality food friendly staff decently speedy service
But sadly they shut it down about a month ago and I've been at a loss for a good lunch place ever since
HOWEVER the owners also have another place that is doing great and its Baby Kay's Cajun Kitchen
But the rest of these trays and their relaxed seating and awesome patio make for a great place to get happy after work
Indulge comes very close and it has a great atmosphere
Super cute place has a roll up/fold up door so the whole front of the building can be open right onto their little patio
The atmosphere the service the music the fireplace the comfortable bar stools the clientele are all great
The DC Ranch location is beautiful what a great place to sit outside with a delicious pizza and a cold beer
Being HUGE Pizzeria Bianco fans we heard a lot of talk that this place was just as good
Dinner was great I dropped a grand on it overpriced for atmosphere walked into kazimierz where the owner Peter and the bouncer treated us like we were here to wash the windows
The atmosphere of this place is also pretty great
I hope more places follow their reasonable happy hour as opposed to rip-off Tanzy but I guess for now I'll continue to stay away from Zipps and go to our good 'ol stand-by Tilted Kilt
Great Beer Atmosphere and patio furniture

I did a lot of research of romantic places around the Valley and this one really caught my eye
It is a great place to go and try something new
It's a great place to meet friends and hang out
Well consistency is what makes a place great
The service and food should be good if you are there on a Monday night when the place is empty as on a Friday night when there is a line out the door
This is a great place to come to just to take in some fresh air
The atmosphere was welcoming - casual and old school; I especially love the disco ball in the main dining room
All in all a cute quaint place with good not great or memorable food
Everything I ate--the gyros the hummus the tabouleh the walnut baklava which I agree tastes totally homemade--was made with the freshest ingredients I've ever tasted at a Middle Eastern casual place like this
The place looks cool and they have beer so how could it be bad
This place is very unique and has a solid concept but having Great Cips cast aways as stylists is not helping their cause
I mean it's kind of difficult not to like a place with great food and a fun atmosphere
The service was really good the place was kept very clean restroom as well
Hey when the cash gods give you your chance to cash in you might as well but some places don't sell out and its too bad that this place has fancied itself up

So this is a great place to exercise your bargain-hunter eyeballs
Another good thing about this place is that they have speedy and efficient service here
Definitely a good place to go for breakfast
Great place to dress up and have a few drinks with your friends
Regardless it was good to see the place packed on a Tuesday night
We went to see Frank Turner here and the first thing about this place that I will note is that its a great venue to see someone you are really excited about
This place has very good food and they take pride in the fact that most of it is not only organic but local
But the wait is worth it and if you're not enjoying the company of your dining companions in the meantime enjoy great bar drinks awesome original art on the walls sports generally on the televisions and great upbeat ambience that makes it a fun restaurant to visit
It's a pretty cool place but it's very busy and popular so it's often difficult to find a good seat
They have several different rooms with booths to sit in wi-fi and pretty quiet background music so it's a good place to work
I am not a fan of coffee shops for dining experiences since they are small and too similar to fast food places for me so I tend not to go to places that have good food like Acacia Cafe when I want to dine in
This used to be one of the very best places to have a great breakfast at a great price served by the most beautiful coeds ASU has to offer
I like this place but my meal wasn't as great as i had hoped
But seriously a place that calls itself a cantina should have great fajitas right
Lolo's was a place I had heard lots of good things about so I was eager to give it a try myself
The service is always great very nice people run this place
This place reinforces the idea in my head that car sales is a big racket designed to squeeze buyers for all they can letting good customer relations slide on by as they get busy counting the money and selling the loans to quote their own rep
I mean who knew getting my windshield replaced could be a great experience
If you like The Farm at South Mountain you'll love this place -- less attitude more attentive service and the same great quality food
Francis is good place for groups or for a romantic dinner it just wasn't as spectacular as I thought it would be
I thought it was going to be fancy smancy but it had a good casual laid back atmosphere
While this place has a great ambiance and I love the patio there's nothing more annoying than a restaurant that serves a plate of food that doesn't come close to satisfying a normal person's appetite and it's a high price
Erm anyway this place is pretty freaking great
Good service too but to be honest I like the food so much this is one place I would still go back even if the service wasn't good
The Long Island Iced Teas are wonderful and the atmosphere is not bad
Many of the goods are the same as in the grocery some stuff from regular groceries other stuff from Sprouts/Trader Joes type places but they cost more

This is a great place to grab a quick cold treat in the summer heat

Overall a good place especially with the Groupon deal
I'll take Delux's casually modern and hip for my burger place any day over dark LA lounge-y
Great place to have a quick affordable filling and delicious meal
The food is OK not good but not bad I'm from Southern California so my standards for Mexican food are very high and sadly the food here doesn't cut it enough for that fifth starBut the place is so cool that I would bring anyone here despite the fact that I could have better food elsewhere
I think sometimes we have bad experiences and that's probably what happened to the two reviewers that hated the place because I've been referring sushi lovers to Sakana for a decade and no one has ever said they weren't impressed
It Is a good place- as others have mentioned in a very unassuming shopping/industrial center
And they actually give u a good slice for the price compared to other places that give u a tiny sliver
I've settled on several good dishes and the place is always crowded and lively these days I was new to the area back in July 2009 when I first visited - I guess I should be amazed that they were even still open at 9pm at that time of the year
I would say this place is a good alternative to the pricey Melting Pot good for a date or a group of friends not so great for a special dinner or anything
They have great periodical selections and a good place to just relax and read a good article - even though you should really buy it rather than reading it there
The service was great four servers despite the place being small and having only about 10 or 12 tables
Great place to hang out before and after the game
The replacement certificates I got were $16 per tire back in NC but they're good here too and worth every penny
I think its a good place to come with family or spouse
Fantastic Artworkgreat atmosphereamazing satff and a killer music selection
I decided to go with 4 becasue I can't fault the sweet lady who owns this place for the lack of GOOD service from the servers
Next time you need a great way to cap off a late downtown night check this place out
I know that my review of Mylynn will fall onto deaf ears with the owner but I can't recommend this place as good Vietnamese food and let my country's cuisine reputation be tarnished
The fish was the best we had EVER had the drinks were exceptional the atmosphere was great for our date night and the service was on par
Great service food & atmosphere; love the new location

A honest good quick boba place that I make sure to hit whenever I'm in this part of town
Overall the meal was great and I will keep this on my list of favorite mexican places to eat in Arizona
But when the weather is right and you want to enjoy AZ's beautiful outdoors this is a great place to sit for a while with good company
This place obviously had great reviews and was open on Sunday so we decided to check it out
You would expect it to be good because the place was empty but the staff really went out of their way to make it an EXCELLENT experience for us
As the owner brings us our food she was sure to point out tell all of your friends that this is a great place to drink
Ironically enough as we're sitting there empty cups check ready to be paid Channel 3 TV comes in to film the great place- I couldn't help but tell my boyfriend how unsatisfying the experience was as the camera man panned across our table
PS I think the 3 bean desert is okay since there is many place offer a good ones
The owner even came out at some point to wish us a happy holiday& introduce himselfAbsolutely everything was taken care of for us as expected in a good restaurant ushered in chairs pulled out napkins placed water & wine topped off without even noticing
I recommend this amazing place and can`t wait to return for more heavenly goodness
The bar is the place to be but if this isn't your style a small line of booths horseshoe the pool table and a selection of comfy chairs are arranged in front of a fireplace that I have never seen hold more than a few candles let alone an honest to goodness fire
I kinda feel sad about the two 2 star reviews because this place is really good
They seemed to have a lot of employees working here for such a small place but that's a good thing because the place was very clean and they brought our food to us
The feel of the place is very authentic I did not walk around the entire farm so I missed a great deal of it for sure but I will be back again soon
The prices are on the high side but you figure you are paying for more than the food more the experience so if you are looking for somewhere to meet up or show someone a new place this place is great
Really great place for the kids families dates very versatile

In North Central Phoenix we need a good frozen treat shop and this place I think would do well
The location of this place isn't in the best neighborhood however the food is GREAT
With that being said Bikram Yoga Avondale was a great place to be a newbie
This place gets an easy four stars for being a good spot to catch bands grab some decent but appropriately greasy bar food and enjoy an always decent drink selection
This is a great place for happy hour especially with a big crowd since they take reservations and let you order off the happy hour menu from anywhere in the restaurant
Inside the place was dare I say cute quaint and cozy
Giligans possesses all the benefits of a good dive like cheaper booze in big bottles comfortable atmosphere jello shots games karaoke beer pong a midget bar lots of funny drink specialsfor cougars and people with a breathalyzer in their car  and an interesting crowd but it's not a scary dive like the ones filled with Hells Angel bikers
All in all not a bad place to grab a bottomless beer and a burger during HH at good prices
Not only did he diagnose and replace a bad hard drive but he rebooted with an updated OS for no extra charge
Overall a very nice spot and a place I'd definitely return to for the baked goods as well as to try the pancakes plus perhaps the griddled bread pudding with a side of fruit as a starter and one of those incredible looking Sticky Buns or scones as dessert
If you're looking for a great place to get some tan on this is the one

The staff was friendly and the atmosphere is great for kids as well as adults
We were looking for a place to linger on a Sunday afternoon so we saw the two hours our meal took as a good thing
All in all not a bad place to come if you are in the area and want to do a little shopping to boot
It's really too bad to watch a spiffy place like this start its descent
A bit pricey but I highly recommend this place if you want good American cuisine
All in all this place is great and I strongly recommend it
Vincent's has great food great selection and great service and atmosphere
Our favorite is the garden patio which has great ambiance with nicely situated tables twinkle lights plants heaters or misters depending on the season
So happy to have this has our neighborhood French place - great food great ambiance great people
A great location we found parking easy enough even with construction and I was surprised to see this place really is industrial
NOT a romantic place and while our seating was fine all the other huge groups seemed to be having fun and were totally drunk-but think either large groups of diverse gay males or mixed groups but def
The service was pleasant and a nice relaxed atmosphere
Great service great food and great atmosphere
This place is great and compared to other Pita Jungle's I've been to the one on Shea Tempe and Downtown Phoenix this Pita Jungle has to be the best
This place is great for smaller parties who enjoy a good beer
I also seem to find better audio book selections from this branch as well I think it's a great place to return items to b/c of the location
Now i had heard this was an old school ice cream parlor with a nice family atmosphere and great service
Show up at 330 or earlier to get a good place in line
I didn't expect there to be a good number of people there on a Wednesday morning but the place was poppin'
Not only is this a great place to grab some grub with friends or family but its a great alternative for take out when your looking for something to feed a group and not wanting to cook it yourself
The second place was actually good so honestly although I cringe to remember this I almost didn't keep the appointment for Hillside
In Conclusion great place for special items for a few meals but won't take the place of Trader Joes or Fresh and Easy quite yet
Anywho as we pulled in I was like I hope this place is good
Also the place itself had great atmosphere the lighting and the decor made it  modern and cool
This place has a been favorite of mine since my ASU days and it doesn't get as good as having to travel to the Middle East for Shawarma Falafel Hummus Kabobs Kibbi Tabouli Salad etc
The place was dimly lit and filled with the aroma of backed goods
Great service all around and a fun atmosphere
There's outdoor seating next to a fireplace which looked great as well
Postino did however have a very cool contemporary design and a great atmosphere
We stayed away for a while as it is a pretty good hike from home and didn't want to be disappointed again - after all it's a really expensive place but worth it when you have NEVER I mean never ever been disappointed before
The bar area is also a great place to hang out
For older kids with good gross motor skills prob a great place for them
I think this is a great place to take your older kids but for your younglings maybe not so much but then again maybe it was just our kid
This is a great place to relax with a couple of friends or a casual date but not a good place for large groups
So while I wouldn't say it's the most remarkable place in town it's a great dependable place to get flavorful food
I don't know if I would go for dinner necessarily but it's a great place to start the night out in Downtown Phoenix
This is a good place and appears to be a neighborhood staple
If you are looking for a good time with some great food this is your place
I only use the Versa Spa Spray Tan Booth and honestly it's great for a last minute tan if you want to have some color and just want the convenience of walking into a place and have a machine spray you
A good place to introduce newbies to Thai food and a place that will continually draw you back on weekday nights for hearty healthy tasty thai foods
Great little place at a reasonable price
HOLY GUACAMOLE was the guac good at this place
I haven't tried Pinkberry and other similar trendy froyo places and I tend to prefer good old ice cream or really high-quality gelato
Like any good irishman I like space to roam around - this place has it with ample space and seating upstairs and downstairs patio
Mojo Yogurt is a great place to hang out and enjoy a cup of frozen yogurt
It is a great location in Tempe Marketplace with seating outside and inside
It'd be a great place to have a group dinner for 6-10 as they have these rooms that are a bit more secluded they could put you in
Even if the weather isn't good its still a great place to go
Overall Good Food Great Atmosphere and I will go back
What Culinary Dropout is NOT good for- High Expectations - You have to take this place for what it really is
Over all its a great place to do some good climbs that's close and convenient
Wowwhat a fun place for great deals on Happy Hour food and drinks The bartender Andrew is top notch never missing a beat in seeing our drinks refilled and questions answered
I've been here on two separate occassions other than work and while the atmosphere is beautiful the seats and booths are roomy and comfy and there are even more seats that stretches out to the back leading to a small VIP section the food is just not that great
Other than that a great place to work out
The food wine atmosphere staff were all great
All my lunch crew has said such great things about this place so I had such high hopes
I don't really expect really good Korean food in the Peoria/Glendale area so this place actually went past my expectations
History atmospherelush  vegetation savoury smells great wine list best tomatoes clearly sophisticated but not pretentious and hospitable service
I kind of felt bad because I picked the place and he paid
But he was nice enough for the casual type of place it is- definitely not fine dining
I liked the feel of the place right away too with the high beamed ceilings big open glass doors and cute stylish touches scattered about
The short rib was very good as well - we replaced the mashed potatoes with more roasted veggies but it also comes with string beans one of my other favorite veggies
This is a great place to find some gently-used media bargains
It is a cute little place and like most places in the area the parking lot is TINY; practically minuscule so you have to get their valet or sneakily park next door
This is a great place to hang out and just browse as well
The friendly couple in their fifties sitting across from us greated us with a smile and gave evidence to another asset of this place
The atmosphere expressly stating share food share drinks Sangria by the pitcher share words laughs and good times
I had the great fortune to happen upon this place after seeing a post on Coronado Historic District's facebook page about a sale
The place is clean and they offer a nice looking menu with an array of breakfast items but the quality of customer service is bad
It's great to see a place where it is obvious that the staff enjoys where they work
I thank Posh for their excellent service but if the food continues to let diners down making it right with great service will be no substitute for not disappointing in the first place
The Atmosphere  Eva's has a great atmosphere
I had tried a few Chinese places that really sucked so I was hoping that this place would be good and boy oh boy was it
Let me say first that the place is cute the staff is friendly and the salsa is good
I was in beef heaven initially because although the burgers were a tad pricey in comparison to the other big fast food joints the kids meals were very affordable & pretty good sized to boot & the taste of the fresh food combined with the energetic ambience had me hook line & belly
This is absolutely THE BEST place we've experienced on all of our sojourns and we've been to some really good places
It is my favorite place for a casual day date
We went to Little Saigon a few months ago with the expectation that this is gonna be one of the few places with great Vietnamese food we can fall back on when we crave it due to all the great reviews on Yelp
Almost a four star for me and a great departure from forced fun atmosphere of other places in Scottsdale
Service was good and the ambience -- well pretty simple Thai decor
It was just a couple of less than great visits that make me knock this place down a star
It's a great place to celebrate a birthday or take your mom when she comes for a visit
Great place if you just want to have dessert too
I don't mind paying a lot for good  food but we left RENEGADE CANTEEN feeling like we had been ripped off EVEN THOUGH THE ATMOSPHERE WAS GOOD AND THE SERVICE WAS GOOD it just didn't make up for the lack of flavor in the food
There are too many other places nearby where we can get a good meal that is worth it's price
Missing out on great service instant refills perfectly cooked deliciously spiced food and a solid place to eat
I love Serrano's so I figured that this place was going to be good as well
My first impression was not a good one based on the atmosphere and cleanliness of the restaurant and the service from the hostess
Great place to rent DVD's and save some money
This cute place is tucked in the back of the plaza walking distance to AJ's
I'd heard great things about this place and so when I was in Phoenix for a few days and had the chance for date night with my wife I jumped at the opportunity to check it out
Many other bars offer no cover or 5 at the most it almost toally threw me off the place if my wrap wasn't so damn good
We went here mid morning on Monday they have an incredibly cute atmosphere with really interesting artwork and very friendly staff
This place has good light and a lovely modern interior
Most bars point you the the wall of beers and say any of those are good Also on that same night she had left her coat on a bar-stool outside and the bartender immediately saw that and placed it behind the bar
the place felt like a tourist trap in the center of i just graduated from yale wanna party and get loose wearing some faded jeans a cowboy shirt and a clean cut lookin like i just left the frat party last night and feeling a little too stuffy to be real sitting with this chip on my shoulder and a bad taste in my mouth come on Phoenix is this what its all coming down too
Good food this place is very authentic and good prices I am never upset
At the end of our meal she mentioned she'd like to find a really good Chinese place to take us to and was going to talk to her friends
Since I'm a big fan of new American food good drinks and stylish atmosphere I thought Bloom and I would be a match made in heaven
The atmosphere was swanky but romantic at the same time
Chicago pizza places the good ones anyway can churn out of some the best thin crust pizzas ever
I wish that this place were not so good - I have not been able to drink the coffee at my office in weeks
Pub Crawl stop 5 Another place that wasn't on the plan but I was distracted by a cute girl handing me a flyer for 2 for 1 drinks
Pulled over on the side of the road and huddled over the phone we saw that there was a new modern Vietnamese place within a few minutes drive and that had great reviews and our minds were made up
the carrot juice was great always love a place that offers ginger beer and the brown chicken stew was sooooo good
The fruit was actually good and fresh which isn't usually the case at a place like this
Yet another great place I would have never found without Yelp
It's a good place to go for a fast lunch but don't expect quality food
We both liked the casual cottage atmosphere
It's definitely not a bad place to be and look around but I like bargains a lot more
Every place that serves or sells hummus manages to provide a vastly different taste - some are good some are very good and some are not edible
Not only is their hummus good but few places that I have been to create chicken that is as flavorful so it's hard to pass that up when I go to Pita Jungle
We didn't think too bad of the place when we left but that night we were both sick to our stomaches
Since it is located next to the Deer Valley 30 AMC theater it's a great place for a pre-movie quick-but-quality dinner
Finally a pizza place that delivers to our home AND has good pizza wings & drum roll please RANCH
The wine list is good and has some favorites and some different labels than I have seen in other places - so you have choices
After getting fed up with our other vet we tried this place when our pup needed to have a pretty bad cut but one that had stopped bleeding taken care of
Overall I think this is a good place for late night eats - meeting the gang for some Hookah before heading out to the clubs but certainly not for a comfortable and delectable dining experience
however no one told the patrons it was a soft opening so it just looked like a badly run place - from wrong orders to a severely misspelled menu I had fun going through it with copy-editing marks to what seemed a lack of caring about the patrons with a blase attitude
However I gave the place 3 stars because 1 They had good service 2 While they don't cook the greatest steak in the work their Rib-eye wasn't bad 3 The side of mash potatoes were fairly tasty
Not to sound cheap because their wine menu was great and they have a full bar seemingly a perfect place for drinks with friends or more fancy times-- but this was lunch
Will need to come back here to pass better judgment but so far- open late on a Monday- friendly staff I've never heard of someone mixing beers to approximate something that you wanted that they ran out of but they did- cozy atmosphere in which to either zone out by your lonesome or chill with votre amis I'm on business travel by my lonesome for three weeks so I was the latter that third-parties would likely take pity on when I'm in reality running a GREAT buzz and fully entertaining myselfAnd no cons to report
There is no jukebox but the music that fills the place is always solid with a good mix of some of the better trendy tunes from recent years
I do like to partake in a finely crafted beer on occasion and they have a great selection of tap and bottled beer that you won't find at most places try the Rogue Hazelnut Brown and their house beer made at Four Peaks Brewery
It's worthwhile to support a local place that's doing good by its customers
It was a casual atmosphere which I enjoy and the food options looked enticing
Their food was great and they had awesome decorations and little touches that made this place feel so authentic
I find Harmony House Music a great place to shop for almost all my music needs
Over all I find Harmony House Music a great place to shop
This is generally a good place to go for a nice ladies type lunch
We're used to brunch in central Phoenix so this place was a little more casual
If you want to retain water for a good 2 days go to this place
I recall a line forming before the place opened for dinner on my original visit so it is probably good to think about timing
Overall I feel this place is hit and misss some good some bad
we were asking various staff members where a good place to eat was or what was nearby fun to go do
I love burgers and fries can eat them three or more times a week if I allowed myself however this place doesn't do the great American meal any justice sorry they could fold up and close their doors without making a blip on any radar screen of dining experience
There were a lot of good reviews for this place so I gave it a shot
The atmosphere is very relaxing the service was great and the food was really really good
replace the tabletops on the tables with the cracked plastic coating that doesn't look very good and 2
Great place to enjoy lunch and the $5 pitchers are a great enticer
the food is always decent the prices are not bad and the atmosphere is fun especially if you like loud music and people-watching
As a result of actual culinary school trained chefs/cooks showing up at places like BSA the quality of food is quite good
The atmosphere is modern and sort of zen-like - they did a great job with colors lighting etc
A great place for morning coffee meetings with tables in a nice open space and decent patio as far as patios in downtown Phoenix go
La Stalla Cucina is a great place to take your guest during the upcoming holiday
Bottom line this place is pretty cool and a great place to take out-of-town family
This is the kind of place to go when you want food but not really caring how good it COULD be
which is the type of place that gives Scottsdale a bad reputation
It was a great place to sip an espresso and sit by the little water river fountain thing on a rainy cold winter days
Safeway is one of my farovite places to buy groceries if I need good stuff reasonably
I can't say enough good things about this place--- I guess the only thing left is to send a big thank you to the doctors and staff for being such a blessing to our family
The long bar is a great place to grab a cocktail or glass of wine on a weekend but the real reason to dine at Cowboy Ciao are two of their signature dishes The Stetson Salad and The Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry
~the prices were all pretty decent and nothing was out of order all fairly commonplace for the neighborhoodthe bad~the ingredients; while my sandwhich was delicious and im sure everything on the menu is as well i noticed some key factors that made me go tch  -shredded iceburg lettuce c'mon really
If you are seeking a warm inviting atmosphere with great service then this is clearly not the spot
Great atmosphere I loved the fact that in the dead heat of the AZ summer you can step inside and it feels really nice to have the fireplace going and nice and cool with no windows
Prices are great and the menu is surprisingly diverse for a place that prides itself on its curry
Our check and sugar/water drenched oranges were delivered promptly after our meal and we left happy and excited to have found a good sush place in AZ
A great hotel for the kids with plenty of places to walk and lots to do
It's a great place to go for dinner or just for drinks or like we did both
Even if it is a chain I think this place is unique and a great addition to Mill
I always have a great time at this place when I'm in Arizona
Great restaurants if you want to eat better chains include Cheesecake PF Changs Morton's Tommy Bahama's Restaurant as well as smaller trendy places
So much blah blah blah this place is so great spewing from Yelpers and the media that I felt like I was missing out
If I want cheap good mexican food I guess I'll stick with 'Bertos because this place is a disaster
If you live in the neighborhood Arcadia Tavern is a good place to grab some late night dinner and drinks
Everything from beginning to end was perfect - service ambience seating and selection and amount of food was incredible along with a very good wine selection
Or perhaps take a romantic stroll across the grounds until you come across a secret garden tucked away waiting for you to find it
If you want to come here and enjoy a nice meal with good music and in a place where you can sit and read enjoyably-come here
After a couple of tries this place is just not that good
As a whole I would absolutely bring my friends here for happy hour as they have a really cool bar area with a decent cocktail selection and the modern look of the place is a great conversation piece
With free breakfast and free drinks every night this place is a great value
I hate giving bad reviews but this place was just Meh
So if you are in a hurry and just need to get in and out quickly or want really good produce give this place a try
On the positive side they are friendly the service is good the place is clean and it's also relatively nice for a strip mall Chinese restaurant
Turns out this place was basically built for him and for good reason
Clean cute cafe atmosphere I loved the chicken wire on the menu
The service was great the people who run the place are very nice
This place has friendly service a sunny interior with a relaxed atmosphere and comfortable if slightly cramped booths and tables
The atmosphere is very casual relaxed and kinda hippie
Good thing we only purchased our prescription food for our cats there because I can't fathom taking my cats or dogs to a place like this for medical reasons where customer service is at the bottom of their list
If you are looking for extremely well priced lunch buffet of great Chinese staples this is the place
Casey Moore's is a place that was a hole-in-the-wall and is now firmly ASU establishment - a good place to network with the future VPs of Dupont
The Atmosphere  Beautiful restaurant with a great water-bridged patio
There are all kinds of signs/posters in the place telling you about how good the sandwich is and who says so
I love the casual atmosphere and how quick the food comes out
The patio is a good place to sit on an amiable night
Great place to grab a steak and I am a huge fan of the hawiian pizza
Since I live in northwest Phoenix this is a great place to go when I don't want make a long trek to the other big Asian supermarkets
The atmosphere is great the food is wonderful
I agree that it looks like a great place to watch a game except the seats aren't exactly comfortable
Not to mention the wings aren't even that good I mean I wouldn't wait to eat there and I can think of many other places with better wings
Great atmosphere where you can actually enjoy a conversation with your group and not have to yell across the table
It is a good place to bring parents and your relatives from the midwest -- it's a nice local place with a neighborhood feel but the food is non-threatening
Now for the GREAT parts about this place
The place looks great inside and the service was excellent with the only hiccup being a long wait for our first cocktail
Good place great drink selection small food menu reason for 4 stars wonderful service
Although the location is in a strip mall the atmosphere is cool but casual and we were seated next to but not outside on a great patio area
The place seems good for kids as they were running about
we got like 23 cds or something tho so obviously it was a good deal oh i got two of my friends some gifts from there too-zia is a good place for random fun gifts
Lots of great bars and stuff to do in that area so skip this place
Pick a rainy night when nothing sounds better then cozy-ing up to the fire listening to great tunes and sipping a fabulous blueberry lemon drop or sophisticated glass of wine and there is no better place to be in Phoenix
Good atmosphere good product good people
Bad service will kill this place eventually
What i CAN say is that the food was delicious and the atmosphere was quite romantic
I am so tired of poorly executed places that charge a premium for the category and deliver poorly
I dug the vibe of the place and everyone there was having a good time
When it first opened this place was awesomeHentai playing in the bar area and good spicy tuna rolls which were my favorite at the time
Now the place has increased the quality of fish they have fresh chopped wasabi available on request and a great selection of cold Sake
This would be a great place to go if you've never eaten sushi before so then you'd have nothing to compare it to
The good- Great toast/bread- Cute atmosphere- Friendly peopleThe bad- Slow service I had to ask for coffee refills- Have to wait outside with no misters 20+ minutes- Very bland hash browns - Very hot inside we were sat next to the door but still when it was closed it was hot
Lowe's has a great policy for their plants; if the plant you purchase dies before a year they either refund your money or replace your plant
The place looks really cool I love the decor it is elegant and yet casual
Overall this place is a very good pizzeria
Great staff great food and high on our list of places to eat
It is still a nice place to eat even though its in a strip mall because of some great interior design
But still overall its one of the few great independent places on the west side along with Mike's Rigatoni Bistro and Touch of Thai
I was kinda hoping it was going to be as good as the burgers at Zinburger in Tucson another Fox place but it wasn't quite as tasty
It's too bad because this place is right down the street from us and we occasionally like to go to bars to watch a game and grab some food
It's a smaller place and the prices are good but overall it doesn't really have anything special
There are some good things about this place and some bad
I love their unique soups and the fact that they now carry gluten free buns for your enjoyment and I am sick of eating lettuce wraps at other places because I have to eat gluten free  There is an additional charge for the gf bun but it is very very good
The place seems mighty fine for down home Texan cookin and it hasn't got a Good Ole Boys feel to it at all as one person had told me it would
This is a great place for heat-lovers
The service is quick and friendly the place is clean and the salsa is good I prefer the green over the red or both
However for the most bland white washed white bread place on the planet it is good pizza
This place is great but Cafe Lalibela has the special place in my heart
I might have given this place 3 stars for the annoyance factor but the mocha was so good it deserves its own star for sure
So we avoided the restaurants here after our 2 payouts and used yelp to find a super great taco place one exit up the freeway
I highly recommend the Scottsdale Plaza Resort for anyone who wants to just get away for a weekend or who is looking for a great place to hold their next conference
Was looking for a place to wash the dogbut found this placewhile cute and allto be a bit pricey do it yourself wash scenario
This place has good breakfast with a great selection
We came to Arizona to visit family but after seeing some really good reviews we decided to check this place out with my two year old
The place is really cute safe fun and most of all cool for the kiddos to enjoy even on the hottest of days
On a good note this place does give an awesome workout if you enjoy a bootcamp style workout in a large group
Or is supposed to be a place where the food and service is so great that I can't wait to return
The atmosphere is nothing special but it's fine for a casual dinner and if like me you fill up on soup and salad you may leave with lunch for the next day
Good place to go on a date or out with the girls for drinks
But despite its rough prison-esque exterior Sam's is a great place to shop if you're looking to purchase the finest liquor money can buy
This is a great spot for dinner before Glendale Glitters or any of the many other festivals that take place in downtown Glendale
Picazzo's gluten free pizza is delicious the crust is pretty thick and has a good texture not like a big saltine cracker as most places tend to be
A great family place and reasonably priced
The one nice plus about Scottsdale is the selection of places to eat is so HUGE we have the great pleasure of finding a trying out so many great places such as this
Great place for breakfast lunch or dinner
The staff is super-friendly and the atmosphere is great
I can't say enough good things about this place
The menu is good the atmosphere a little dated and there are a lot of blue hairs dining in this restaurant
I like the old school ambiance of this place what I didn't like was the waitress telling me the lunch salad was a good portion I'm sitting here starving as I write this review
All and all a good alternative to the chain monster restaurants that dot Scottsdale and a nice local place to take the fam
There are WAY too many great Italian places in Phoenix to not bring your A-game every time
As Jennifer P already mentioned it is not super-close to anything particularly nice or interesting except for The Farm at South Mountain which is literally next door and features a great breakfast eatery a decent sandwich place and a oft-written-about dinner restaurant serving cuisine that features locally grown and sustainable ingredients but is definitely centrally located and convenient by freeway to downtown/central Phoenix and Tempe and close to South Mountain for hikers
- The atmosphere was very nice; we sat in the room with the Great Glass Fireplace in the center and floor-to-ceiling windows all around with a view of the fountain
This is a great place to come as a working person because you can really just get in and out in a hurry and not have the experience of a crowded grocery store with long lines and walking forever to try to find a couple things
This one was no exception  great food nice atmosphere TVs all over the place
Everything looked way to good to give up on this place after only one spicy chicken incident
I'm not sure it's a good place to go on a date since yes there were plenty of kids around and this was just a Saturday evening
For some of you it would make a good baby making place
The great thing about this place is you can try so many things because it is cheap cheap cheap
All that said the ribeye was pretty good but the meat might already have been chopped and placed on the grill because despite what the cook said I never heard him chopping up my meat on the grill and the sandwich was ready way to quick
The places and ambiance is very contemporary yet casual and fun
Maybe its just me having bad luck since this place gets so many rave reviews but once again the large sausage pizza that I was staring at seemed to be a bare crust totally devoid of any toppings
Mu Shu is a great place for a fast pace lunch and low key quiet dinner
Its a great place to eat healthy food but be careful you don't over eat cause the portions of food is incredible
So I'm trying to eat healthy I've got some sweet ass vacations lined up in the next couple months that I'm gonna be smokin' hot forAnyways this place has a lot of great healthy option
The bar area is large with a nice fireplace and well stocked with a good roasted tasting salsa and chips as well as plenty of icewater pitchers while you sometimes have to wait for your table
Only downside is they don't let you get your own samples which is my favorite part at Mojo and there cups are as generic as they get not the cute little green spoons and decorated cups like other places but for half the price WHO CARES
If you are looking for a great place to take a date or just hang out with your pals drinking beers in a great atmosphere then this is the place for you
It's a place you can sit and talk and enjoy good food and drinks for a few hours which we did
At a place like this you can actually order your burger cooked like a steak since they're so good and the flavor is enhanced even more
I'm pretty happy with this place overall; drinks are good service is friendly atmosphere is enjoyable and I delight in the immediate neighborhood where I inevitably have to park
said this place is good so I whipped on in there today for lunch
I also love a good dive restaurant too so I was excited when I heard about this place
Anyone who lives in the greater phoenix area would be well advised to stock up on some meals from the Gardener's Kitchen for those nights you want foodie quality food without any fuss
How many curse words can I say in one sentence to describe how good this place is
We decided to stop by this place because we felt like continuing our sushi quest yesterday it was close and it has good reviews
At the end of the day I decided that this place is good for what it tries to be
Atmosphere aside the food is very good
The food is amazing the service is great and the atmosphere is clean and inviting
Didn't seem bad for all that but the portions are a bit smaller than I'm used to for a hole in the wall type Mexican food place - for that price at a place like Filiberto's you'd get more food
The atmosphere is great and the service was fantastic
I suppose of all of the places a girl can go to break her ankle this little lounge/club/whatever was not too bad
We saw great reviews on Yelp and decided to try this place out
We were looking for authentic Mexican food and this place had great reviews
Food I would say is good it just seems like the typical big box franchise Italian restaurant that looses that special touch you find in the mom and pop type of places
My family and I have always enjoyed going to this NYPD and the food is very good but  I will definately be looking for a new family oriented pizza place
This place is currently in renovation so the lobby is not in good condition
They are usually good for a quick lunch and have healthier options than most of the other fast places in my area
Coffee was great too even the decaf which to me is a sign of a place that pays attention to detail
Service was good even though the place was packed for UFC and they had a bunch of beers on tap and never had to wait for another beer
I can't say enough good things about this place
We got their around 8 and the place had a good crowd
I subsequently revisited The Parlor because while I don't think it's the second coming as many of my very good friends do it's still a very cool place to grab a beer and bite
Good place to meet a group watch a game or grab a quick bite
I brought two rookies with my and they both thought that the homey interior made the place so cute and loved the home-style theme of the menu
As I have said in previous reviews I don't give fast food places great ratings because the food isn't great quality and the service is poor as there is no waiter service
As a side note the owners of Windsor opened up a pizza place that is pretty good
The food is fantastic good service good atmosphere it's perfect
The place has a great atmosphere and a large patio in the back
but since I have no place to buy them from nor have I mastered making them these are quite good for a band-aid craving
Great atmosphere I feel like I am in San Francisco when I eat here
I think they come here for the great food/atmosphere I feel rather than the types of people that go to Ra for their Happy Hour if you know what I mean
As with any place it depends who is cooking it it may come out a bit different every time but all times have been good
This place has a great concept and nice environment
The atmosphere is great an ideal place for a casual meeting or just getting some work done
I should say I rarely go to this place but people know have always had great things to say about it
Overall I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a romantic place to take your someone special
Five Guys is good but should be compared more to places like Fat Burger regarding size and price of burger
The walk among the court yards and gardens is beautiful especially since the weather was great this year
Great place to go with a group for either having some laid back drinks or for reserving some lanes for tipsy bowling fun
This place has a lot going for it in terms of atmosphere and the food is like other Sam Fox restaurants consistent and pretty good
In sum the food is pretty good and the atmosphere makes this place an appealing restaurant to return to however the sub-standard service hit-or-miss drinks/chips can taint an otherwise good experience
I like hole in the wall places that you'd never expect to be great restaurants and Raimondo's is just that
This place feels like a casual local spot with a friendly counter staff
I ordered from here because I was craving a good sandwich and needed some place that delivered
This place is also great late night if you have spent the evening having several alcoholic beverages
If you like a good greasy burger then this may be your place
Now I still don't think this is a bad place to see a film - just don't see a high-graphic action film
I think that this place would get a good audience by playing cult classic films either weekly or monthly
A couple of things that would make this place great
This place has great food and great prices
The big difference though between this place and Macaroni Grill is the fact that the food is actually really good at Bobby Qs
I liked this place because of its simplicity and of course because the food was pretty good
Great place that feels comfortable to eat in
The food is always there- and it's surprisingly good Pub fare but what this place sells most successfully is soulful ambience a down-to-earth yet diverse  crowd interesting live music a gorgeous patio and a cool-as-hell waitstaff
It's a great time and cool place to meet other cool people
When I first moved here 15 years ago this was a great place
The place is often crowded - so I believe many patrons just don't know what good Japanese food should taste like
They smell bad and there were paper towels laying all over the place
Typically I would have written a great review for this place
My husband and I just moved to Phoenix and have been looking for a good place to eat Indian food and we finally found it
It's a cute little place in downtown Gilbert
This place is good for folks who like TT roadhouse and complain that TT has gotten to friendly
What pleased me the most is after going to several sushi places my future wife has had a heck of a time finding a good Spicy Tuna roll
Overall it is a great place to cure your Pho need or cure that hangover
This place is really fun really cool and the 3 super cute waitresses don't hurt anything either
As the other reviewers have stated don't go for the decor but the atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable
If you have someone hard to shop for this is a great place to buy some unique/cute gifts that will definitely get a smile
Atmosphere was really nice and the service was great - until the end when they forgot to bring my friend her coffee
If you're looking for a quick blah coffee on the run or an over priced pastry or sandwich practically from Costco than this place is a pretty good bet
Now I'm not saying Plaid is a bad place
the food was good the service was good the atmosphere on a warm spring afternoon was delightful and it was splendid little spot to let the dishes and the glasses pile up
So many positives I was really looking forward to trying this place always hoping for a good sushi buffet but always having been disappointed
I usually have no problem quitting after two slices but the  flavor squishing around in my mouth was so good I couldn't resist taking a third piece at this place
I was a little shy at first because I am not starting with a traditional plant but am trying to Bonsai a Gardenia but Charlie told me it was great that I was trying it out on something so pretty
It must be the combination of the sushi and the customers but I just didn't feel like I was in the right place for a great Japanese dinner
Also have tried the egg rolls which are very good and the b/f who is a short rib enthusiast says this place has the best ones he has yet to come across
Whoever designed the place did a pretty good job
I titally can not find a bad thing about this place as their service is always good prices are fair and more often then not they even have 25%-50% off sales
The place is very cute and has good service
It was a really great fun and entertaining place to go
I can't blame though because the place was busy and I who doesn't want a new place to be successful when the food and atmosphere are good
Great sense of place and food to match
For this type of sushi place the prices were reasonable and pretty good
too bad this place was NOT what I had hoped for
This place is good for dinner and the AYCE Sushi on Saturdays but for a first timer I would really recommend the Happy Hour over anything else
It's a nice and relaxing place to people watch or have a good conversation with the person you are with
The pulled pork is as good as any I've had from a bbq place here or anywhere
Great place to sit outside & enjoy an afternoon with a friend especially since the AZ weather is startin to cool slightly
Any way every time I have visited the place there has been no patrons and it breaks my heart because that is a good sign that it isn't going to be around long
Given that kind of vibe and the fact that they serve some good bottled beer this would almost be a place to meet some friends after work
This place is as good as I've had in any city in the country
A bad ass place to eat drink and be merry while a big game on the tube
This place isnt as bad as all these reviews make it out to be
Which to me when a place is there for so long and the food and the Shrimp and Chips Which i have to say is the best thing to get here goes along way showing that they are a good restruant with a huge customer base
We had a good time exploring the place- the elevator shaft the crazy bathrooms the little make-out corner upstairs- but in the end we both agreed that we should have gone to SideBar
But when you don't have a lot of time and find yourself in the central corridor cruising for something between fast food and sit down this is not a bad place to end up
Water was good I'd go back it was a nice place
You can occasionally find good deals on their website but most other places around downtown are as cheap or cheaper than Camden's regular prices
types of places and had my haircut by some woman that was more interested in speed than giving a great haircut
You can get just as good food a lot of other places for a lot cheaper
They could petition their property owner to help build out what could be a great beer garden on Scottsdale Rd
I'm really really biased because I love Vietnamese food and this place is just as good as it gets when you're talking Vietnamese but regardless of all that it really is just damn good cuisine that you can't beat for the price you pay
They have a terrific selection a pleasant but small atmosphere to hide away for a time --- next to a glass of something and a good conversation with that special someone
Unlike other brunch places they open at 930 am which is GREAT
Michael Johnson did a great job designing the place
This place is the epitome of GREAT customer service
I had some time to kill and I thought this would be a good kick-back place to hangout
We've been back once since initial experience and still a good place to have breakfast
It results in piles of trash near the entry of them and not good for when you take a tray full of garbage to the can only to have to find a place to set it down to sort
The atmosphere is clean but bright and casual
It's a little place not really good for groups or kiddos but when you enter you truly fee the atmosphere shift and guess what
All of their food is great and this place is always busy it seems
Lo-Fi was a comfortable place that served good coffee
The place is cute the girl behind the counter was extremely friendly the prices are good for what you get holy cow was that a huge scoop
There just aren't that many good places for vegans in Phoenix-- especially for good old fashioned American food
A great place to hang out enjoy the nice weather on the patio and have a few drinks some food maybe
The reason I gave SMG one star is because it's a really neat place great seating and great concept Pacific Northwest has been doing this for years btw but the service and food was HORRIBLE
The atmosphere is industrial/beach style very clean as other reviewers stated and the burgers are a good value
I had heard all sorts of good things about this place
I'd like to give this place more than 3 stars because the food is pretty good but the uncleanliness of the restaurant prevents me from doing so
Great atmosphere and superb outdoor dining
From the top notch linens to the concierge who pretty much thinks of everything from the immaculate grounds to the gym better than the sort you pay for at home the place certainly has it all but at a price - and then another $25/day resort fee tacked on for good measure
I'm from Dallas and was visiting Phoenix - in Dallas we have a TON of self-serve froyo places so i'd like to think i have good context when i say that Mojo is just eh
Food was good but I have to tell you what would bring me back was the atmosphere
Basically if you'll be out of your room the entire stay this place is great
the servers are good people the atmosphere is typical for a steak place
The food is good and it's such a unique place
This is a great place for a quick and healthy lunch
Don't get me wrong this place isn't a total train wreck - I would certainly pop in for a glass of wine at happy hour and there are good deals to be had it's cheap enough for sure
How can a place that smells so good have food that tastes so bad
The atmosphere is good the service is good but most importantly the products they sell are awesome at a great price
Very casual and convenient the bartenders are very friendly and the place is seemingly run by people all very comfortable and familiar with each other something I really like
Even though we were a bit disappointed with the food kudos to this place for the service dog-friendly setting and great coffee
I end up picking up a few things elsewhere but I'm attached to some Trader Joe's standbys that I just can't do without and they're a great place to grab a sandwich or salad or whatever if you're running errands on your lunch break
I on the other hand enjoy being an omnivore but regardless of culinary position this place is just plain great
This place is VERY reasonably priced and the portions are great
The deep fried tofu was very good and prepared well--you can argue that it is hard to screw up fried tofu but I have some at other places that were not very well prepared
It's a great place to start out the night
The largely windowless interior makes it a great place to take refuge from the often brutal Arizona sun and enjoy a drink or two while hanging out with friends or getting work done
If you are interested in a trendy place with great atmosphere and are unconcerned with cost this is the place
Thanks for a great atmosphere with a solid staff all around
Seating is pretty bad- either on the outdoor patio freezing very few heaters lots of people smoking overlooking the driveway to the mall garage with cars driving through the entire time or inside smells wierd tables placed awkwardly people walking through the mall stare at you while you're eating
There are so many good sushi places in the valley
Mido  Authentic little place with fast service and great prices
The atmosphere was great for either a quiet afternoon lunch but I could also see it being a really fun place for night life too
This place is good enough though that I am willing to give it another shot
If your looking for quality breakfast great customer service at a good price this is the place to go
This is a good place to start the week for the Sunday Rock Garden night
The apps here are a good portion size unlike some other places where you can actually share with people
It's a good place for food and the environment is really awesome
It's not a bad place but it's certainly no Mortons
They serve Chimay on draft the servers are friendly and it's got the fun great atmosphere to boot
but since it was located in a strip mall you have random people walking by with a cigarette in their mouths gawking at you so it kinda kills the whole romantic atmosphere
perfect place to just chat with friends etc because trust me you'll be there for a good amount of time waiting for you food
must go place if you're looking to splurge and have a nice relaxed evening
A family owned restaurant that has great prices great food and a great atmosphere
The place is really clean and cutely decorated situated in a old Whataburger building
Plus if you need a good laundry mat the whole place is brand new so I have to imagine the washing machines are all probably pretty sweet
The food is good the atmosphere is even better
The atmosphere is very relaxed in an uber hip somewhat pretentious way but it is tolerable
As another reviewer said the southern end of Tempe lacks really good and reasonably priced dining and we didn't want to add another one to the likes of Marcellos chicken killers and such places
On a lark we both ordered their chicken enchiladas - goodness even most gringo places can't hurt that - but they did
I reserve my 5-star reviews for places that I can't say anything bad about - not for places that fold my napkins when I go to the restroom
As for plusses of this place I'd really recommend sitting on the patio/terrace which is great for sitting on and watching all the goings on happening on Mill
Good service inviting atmosphere super clean appearance and most of all freshly prepared food that is attractive and delicious
Over Labor Day weekend they were one of the few places open on Sunday and good thing they were
If you want to buy local grass-fed good quality meats you have found the place to do so
They had really wonderful spaghetti with white clam sauce an item I often try but rarely find as good as my home place in California--San Fillipo's in La Mesa
Now I won't say that this place is authentic mexican food but hey it's good food
The atmosphere is nice - they do a great job of making you forget that you're smack in the middle of the quintessential Arizona strip mall parking lot
For one of the more expensive casual BBQ places in town it is easily one of the worst
This is a great place to stumble over a designer piece you have been hoping to obtain all for a discounted price

Great place for date night and if you love trying new foods
This place was great for a casual get-together
I've been to this place a couple of times and I've never had an experience nearly as bad as the other reviewers

Overall Hanny's is a really cool place to hang out if you're downtown with a great atmosphere and fabulous cocktail menu
Like a previous review I have to agree that the location wasn't that great it's a dying strip mall but I never let location influence my judgment of the place as for the atmosphere it's nothing special or awful it's forgettable
The variety of protein choices is great and any place that has TOTS is a friend of mine
The water here is really great I've yet to find a place that has filters that get the water as good as here
Like others we noticed how empty the place was at 630 on a Saturday night never a good sign and  $80 a head later we understood why
New place and great location for my regular biz trips to Phoenix but they have a lot of kinks to work out before I'll stay again

On our way to AJ's on Easter afternoon I noticed St Francis and said hey that is the place with all the good reviews on Yelp
First tried this place for dinner on Thursday night was so good I had to go back for lunch on Saturday
But the indoors is just as great-cozy little house with a fire place
It was ideal for family and we used the grills nightly which ended up being a great place to meet the other owners/renters
The atmosphere is good especially if you get there at an inbetween time in order to enjoy the quieter times
It's right near good places like Best Buy and Fuddrucker's
Their selection is quite large for the space it occupies and their sale areas are a great place to find books

This place has great coffee a great space and a great attitude

There really isn't a bad seat inside the entire place
That being said the garden/veggie patty was fairly good and at least the Chuck Box has a veggie patty
Walking in you get the feeling that this place has been there for years which is always a great feeling
Even the rice and beans which I usually don't even eat because at most places they are so bland and obligatory tasted really good
If only most other little Mexican food places were this good think what a better World this could be
It is a great place for a relaxing lunch romantic dinner or night out with the girls
BUT It's a great place to hangout for tea coffee & people watching too

Many many others must agree or they wouldn't be so packed most of the time great neighborhood place too that's why you see them do so many take out orders
I have decided that besides the amazing quesadillas and good aguas frescas this place is just average
The horchata was very good- and not gritty or powdery or too sweet like many places
We are always looking for a great place to eat
Partly thanks to Coffee Plantation Pita Jungle and the Gelato Spot but these are great places to visit before and/or after a movie as well
The Good Egg is a breakfast place located in a strip mall and this is one time where you probably could have guessed the book from its' cover
And it's not so bad here hearty food in a reasonable climate extra newspapers at the front of the place for browsing and a small patio out in front
My burrito was good & not too big of a portion like some places
It was such a relief to find a pizza place in Phoenix that resembles a good old fashioned NY pizza parlor

This place has good food and huge portions

-We had two pizza's and ended up taking home almost  1/2 of each pizzaA great value at under $80 US money for four of us including multiple cocktails two big pizza's and two appetizersFinally while the du00e9cor hasn't changed the atmosphere has
There are so many great authentic Sonoran Mexican food places around town the chains just ruin it

I had never sampled Thai cuisine though I had always been interested in doing so and when I discovered a Thai restaurant near my house last week I thought it'd be a great place to have dinner with the fam
I will say that the chips were great and the smell of Cinnabon in the place was divine
Maizie's is a small cute place right off the light rail

It is a great place for breakfast lunch and dinner
A casual diner-type atmosphere with food orders submitted at a front window and orders collected at another

Its a fast casual type resturant where you walk in place your order at the counter and they walk the food out to you
I rated it high becuase I think overall its a good place and the food isnt that half bad
I walked in and told the lady that me and another family that were on their way were looking for a place to eat and wanted to know why i should eat here just giving her a hard time i asked if the service was good the place was clean and if the food was good and what mexico city cuisine meant
This is such a great place with a great food selection
The service is always good the ambience is sophisticated
It was a good relaxed atmosphere and a quick walk over to the stadium
This could be a great place with some attention to basics
Very swanky modern place with a fun and eclectic atmosphere and a great variety of drinks
This is a great bbq place and the service is always fantastic -- thanks Famous Jim
The service was great and there's plenty of space but there's really no reason to eat here and in my opinion there are better places to get beer
Great place for a one on one date or with a group of friends
Go to Green Carnivore or Herbivore or anything in between for the good food/atmosphere
I know we'll try Great Wall again and here's hoping that someday some restaurant can replace our beloved Big Wong
I quickly walked through the back patio due to the rain but it seemed like it could be a really inviting place on a good evening
All in all a very good place to go for a night out
This would be a great place for tourists staying at The Pointe to pop in before they head out for a busy day in Phoenix
[can't even describe the taste but were yummy]Plus the restaurant is such a cute and trendy place to have dinner
The pickles at Goldman's weren't good either they seemed strangely similar to Claussen's brand and they were pretty stingy with the pickles in the first place we had to ask for pickles throughout the course of our meal
This is a good place to meet up for a drink and hang on the patio for a while to watch a game or catch up with a friend
The atmosphere is good but really hit or miss as far as the scenery
The atmosphere here is so cozy casual and relaxing
It must be a good sign if you waddle out of the place whining and holding your gut
One really good thing about the gift certificates is it allows me to check out places I probably wouldn't visit otherwise particularly places that happen to be right next to a Five Guys and have entrees that cost more than $12
only if they had a sound proof door separating the dance floor and the dinning room than it would be a good place
Our service was good if not a little overbearing otherwise I would give this place 2 stars
Service was good food was good atmosphere was cool
There are very limited choices about 4-5 items per day so not a place for picky eaters but I sure have found a great lunch spot
The atmosphere and service were nothing special but the food was good
It's a great place to meet up with friends
Likely not but it's a GREAT option if you are down here in the 'hood going to the airport a museum a play the courthouses or another place in Central Phoenix
But still this  place wouldn't even cut it as a hospital cafe in a bad part of Tokyo
This places is great for lunch dinner or even takeout
but you can't get their braised short rib sloppy joe's or three cheese and short rib grilled cheese sandwiches just anyplaceThose two bad boys alone are almost worth the ringing in my ears that usually persists for 48 hours after a visit to GLC at lunchtimeOn the plus side GLC is nearby and safe in the sense the a Mickey D's is safe for the inevitable business lunches
And I can imagine if you were looking for study spots in the area have the requisite Macbook and want t be a cool hipster kid this is as good of a place as any to plug
Take a pass on this place truly not worth it they specialize in bad food and bad excuses and not much else
Always a great place to be even when it is busy and have to wait for a seat we were there when the Suns swept the Spurs a couple weeks ago and the bartenders are very attentive despite being busy
Randomly finding a place has never ended up so great
The atmosphere of this place is great
It's not the cheapest place in the world but the happy hour was $3 for a pint of good beer so no complaints there
It's so great to have a place that's not the typical chain in your neighborhood
I really love this place their food is sooo good
Casual atmosphere great for lunch or for dinner
Great atmosphere sitting outside is nice when its not hot
Judging by the reviews for this place I figured that would be a good choice
What made this place great and NOT like all the others was it was NOT LIKE ALL THE OTHERS
During the day the music was great in setting an enjoyable atmosphere
In Conclusion unless you have a good reason to check this place out don't bother
Oddly years of bad service bad food and surprisingly boring bread haven't stopped people from giving this place a chance
The meat is great quality and the rare beef is always brought out freshly placed in the bowl so that it doesn't get over-cooked
This Lenny's is extremely clean inviting and has a great atmosphere
The butterfly tent has different butterflies at different times of the year and is a great place for macro photos
Place was empty at 9am on a Tuesday morning but the atmosphere was casual this place is pretty much been here for as long as I can remember and I am one of the 2 people that are native to Phoenix
All in all - great place to catch a game any game
Bombero's has an uber chill atmosphere that I really enjoy and the food is really good
This wouldn't be too bad if there was an organized way to do this but the place is so small you just kind of get stuck between the people ordering and the people paying
OK the ambiance is about as good as it's gonna get in a strip mall next to a Fry's Marketplace but hey -- this is Phoenix
I recently moved back to the East Valley after a 6-year hiatus and I'm trying to find great new spots to rival the places I loved in the other places I've lived
+++'sDecent food bottled beer on ice friendly service good cooks fresh and filled condiment buffet fun to squirt your own ketchup and mustard from the buffet area free refills outdoor patio not too busy for weekday lunch time- - -'sChintzy du00e9cor no eye candy a tad overpriced for what you get yellow circus awnings drab atmosphere no wifiIn sum if you are in the mood for a hamburger a quick bite to eat and are in the vicinity of a Fuddruckers this place delivers
As always there isn't much seating inside so they try to put some outside too bad the summer is nigh and will render this place of little use
I had been wanting to try this place out after so many people telling me how great it was on here and offline
All in all a good place to go during lunch if you are over in this area and you want to avoid all of the restaurant chans that populate this area
Someburros is a great place for lunch and a relatively inexpensive way to feed the family
Overall Mickey's is a great place to go after a night of partying in Scottsdale but if they worked on the above issues it would be even better
Moreno's is known for their Sonoran Hot Dogs and because they're good I'm recommending the place
It's a good place to go if you want to try something different and have a craving for Mexican food
The place is kid friendly and it's a great place to have a Manzanita Apple Soda or Aqua Fresca with your food
It might be a good place to watch a game or meet men watching a game
I'm on a quest to try good meat markets and sausage places around the Valley so I finally stopped by Schreiner's
I cannot say enough good things about this place
I was introduced to this place by some co-workers who are very familiar with what good REAL Mexican food is
if you want a breakfast place that is delicious and great for the family great for
morning date or a great place for a recovery after a long night out this is the place to go
this place is fun and a great place for the neighborhood
We read so many good reviews on Yelp that we had to try this place
although the service wasn't as good as i expected it to be - our waiter disappeared for long periods of time and didn't check on us very often - it wasn't bad enough to the point of knocking the place down a star
Zipps is my favorite sports bar because it has an upscale atmosphere and great food & drink specials
This is a good place to watch Sunday football
Very odd though in a good way for a fast food place
So it may not be as exotic as it once was but it is still a good place to spend a little time and money
This place has grasped the concept of the slow food dining experience but not in a good way
I don't think it's a shorts and jeans type of place but a dressy/casual type of place if you know what I mean
Same great vibe though perhaps even warmer/sexier atmosphere
I come to this bar time and again because of the awesome atmosphere great service and delicious menu
Having grown up in Vancouver and SF it is tough to get 5 star dim sum in AZ but this place is good and they have the authentic girls going around with the carts
great ambiance location fresh garden of veggies and great prices that don't change from lunch to dinner hours
This place is nice to go but not for a romantic date
For happy hour this is a great place - and the Tempe Marketplace location is convenient to several friends
I have been going to Carlsbad for years and it is one of my favorite places in the valley
They have great specials during the week making this a very affordable place to have some fun
This is not a cheap night out but if you have a friend in town and want a great steakhouse this place can't be beat
The atmosphere is upscale casual and the food is like a modern American fusion cuisine with southwestern influences
The place looked like a regular donut shop by the naked and it was in the afternoon so I didn't think  I was in for a good donut
Overall this is a great place to get a quick bite to eat and enjoy some good ol' fashion diner food
This place is great for a fast pita joint
Place was cleanit smelled good the people taking down orders were attentive and bubbly
I did see they have pretty good drink specials and the place was quite busy so someone must like it more than I do
I will give the place anohter shot becuase the food was good and I know that sometimes people only work as hard as they have to
I've had other dishes here which have been pretty good but the prices keep me from coming back to eat unless I get a gift card for this place
The valley needs more places that have a good to great breakfast
It has lots of great flat screen tvs and full bar so this place would be ideal to watch a game or just grab a beer afterwork
All in all this place was good but not great
A perfect date night or great place to take someone while looking to impress
Great atmosphere and friendly staff make for an amazing experience
My family and I have tried this place before but we couldn't get in it was so packed and for a Thursday night there was a great showing
I felt that this was a great place being the only non asian family dining here
-Which is not good for a place called PITA Jungle
5 stars after 144 reviews it's not like I am going to share anything that will ruin the secrecy of this place and just how great it is
This is definitely on the short list of places to have a quick great meal in my hood
The patio is a great place to hang with friends
The food service and atmosphere were more than great - I felt like I'd been invited to the most hospitable of all Arab homes where the hosts and the food left you speechless
And as I was parking I saw two separate Asian families walking in which was a good sign I knew this was place was going to be different
Once inside you notice the place is extremely casual and is family-run
Lest I forgot I should also mention that the few times I've been there's been a really great DJ adding even more to the cool atmosphere
Great drink and food selections along with an awesome ambience give The Vig a five star rating
Last night we met friends at Hillstone's and we truly enjoyed a great meal and great atmosphere
The service is professional the food always looks and tastes great and the ambience is mature dark and potentially romantic
Charleston's is a great go-to place when you just wanna go out for a nice decent dinner but don't have a desire for any particular cuisine
The place was clean and the staff was great
but if you are looking for great tacos skip this place
The location isnt as great but the food service and drinks blows this place outta the water
Great food and love the local small business feel of the place
Not anti-kid but not a lot of options for kidsAll in all a good place and good food though
This is a really cute non-scene place perfect for a casual drink
I think it would be a great date place BYOB so plan ahead
I really like this bar and it is a good place to hang out
Coming by authentic Asian cuisine is difficult enough in this part of the world and when you find a good place boy do they make you pay for it
The atmosphere is great with folded cloth napkins big LCD TV's and spacious booths
We eat out alot and are always looking for a good breakfast place
Pretty good but we're still looking for that GREAT fish and chips place in the Valley
The atmosphere is similar to that of Postino with exposed brick dim lighting and a swanky yet casual feel not to mention their wall of cassette tapes very cool
In all honesty it is a great place for them to interact with other dogs and get out of the house and run all day
I think it's a fun place to come when you're tired of the standard Italian or Mexican and I've always had great service here- so no complaints there
The service was great the atmosphere was cool the wine was fabulous however I have to admit the food didn't live up to my expectations
Nice ambience good food quality friendly service
I see why this place has such good reviews
When I first came in here I was like okay the elevator entrance is nice music is pretty good and dang this place is huge
The place is really cute inside with a nice view of the street
It seems to be a nice place to hang out and eat some good food with a nice glass of wine
This place gets good reviews but I just didn't see it
Found that strange based on the fact that I had heard the place was really good and I was looking forward to finally getting my mouth on some of their menu
Its a great place to be near to your house a state of art facillity
On the upside service was great and still reasonably priced but this was a terrible disappointment and not at all the place I used to love
This place is as good as it gets in Tempe and I have lived here 20+ years
As was the case there the conversation quickly turns to great places to eat and where to find that great island style food that we grew to love
I was so excited to find that this place was good and super close to where we live
I feel bad about doing that in Harlow's because it is one of those places that the waitresses make more money via the turnover so I don't think extended lingering would be appreciated but Cartel can fulfill that part of your Sunday morning experience if a little Sunday paper downtime is part of your preferred weekend experience
The coffee is really great and the atmosphere is totally comfortable but to be blatantly honest it's really all about those cupcakes
Firefighters are typically great cooks and if they are eating at a place it is a great sign
This place has a really great scaled back elegance
An older couple I knew 70's told me about this great place they loved going to for a burger
The place cleared out all at once at 830 good for next time so we can have the restaurant to ourselves
Likes really fresh ingredients they picks herbs from their own garden for your pizza great atmosphere we had a good server- My pizza came out wrong and he was amazing about making up for it
On the negative side the place is in kind of a bad area
They do a great job turning over tables and the size of the place keeps it from experiencing a Matt's-like backup outside
The atmosphere was great and the place was very clean
All in all the Tuck is a great place for a romantic dinner and I could see stopping in for drinks when you're looking for more than a tavern
This place has great Hong Kong/Canton-style food in a place that looks like it came from there - crappy tables and old lame dishes and those 70's style brown plastic glasses
just stand in line place your order and wait for the good stuff to grace you with it's presence  I remember people comparing Lenny's to In n Out and Sonic
tacos were good - salty beans seemed to be placed in a dish as an afterthought
They have a great paint color selection super comfy chairs and a killer massage that lasts much longer than many other places
The bar itself is just a nice bar great place to have a beer
Its a great local place on the Waterfront and be a great place for Sunday Funday
If you don't mind waiting this is a great place for brunch
If you are looking for good food avoid Majerle's If you want to watch sports and drink this is a good place to beAnd it's nice that they turn music on during commercialsI really don't understand how Majerle's food is as bad as it is
If you must eat something off the HH menu get the slidersThe patio at Majerle's is a great atmosphere although their policy on reserving tables is inconsistent as hell
I want to give this place a 2 but it's not that bad
If Majerle's had had better food this place would be a great place to watch games
From all the great reviews I've read I had to try this place
The Coffee Bean is a great place to come and chat with friends
I've heard good things about the restaurant downstairs but I stopped by the upstairs hookah lounge with some friends one night and was definitely put off by this place
Service was top notch atmosphere was comfortable and quaint without being cute
the place is cute inside small but looks like it would hold more than you think
I would definately say that it's a great place for small gathering small family dinner or for those who never tried Korean food before this would be a great place
One of those places thats literally a shack that you hope is a diamond in the rough and the good news is that it is
Sure when it comes to painting the inside of your home you want it to look good but you also want to create an atmosphere
I was a little sad at their lack of ciders - I was hoping for find a place when at least one new cider on tap but they only had one - Woodchuck - which is good but hardly difficult to find you can buy a 6-pack of their many varieties at most grocery stores
We have been coming here for a while now and cannot get enough of this place They have a great tasting pie
So in summary great atmosphere great owners out-of-this-world food and very affordable
Why haven't I been coming here for the last 10 years this place is great
Great place to bring the family great music playing nice and cool and they are open till 10 pm every night
I know since recommending them to some area friends they've also switched and found it a great place to bring their children as well
I felt like I was in a bad John Waters flick - if Sid and Nancy were alive and traveling here is the place they would be
I buy all the expensive kinds of bottled teriyaki sauce from AJ'sI make my own in all different waysI try every place that has teriyaki sauce on stuffI was SUPER pysched to try Blue FinIt was good
So yeah this place is pretty darn great
This place is so cute; a historical old fashioned ice cream parlor in the heart of old town Scottsdale
Now NOTHING in this place is even remotely dietetic everything is rich creamy goodness
It was so bad I had to comment When you go to a Chinese place order Chinese dishes
On the whole this a great place to let 'em loose for a while and wear them out
it would be a great place to take a new person your dating
They don't take reservations anymore and they don't do takeout although I did order a pizza to go and with there always being a huge wait I think he's got a good business going where you eat and drink while waiting at his other place next store Bar Bianco
we just can't say enough good things about this place
It's completely worth supporting this place - if you've read my other revues you know I am a fan of supporting local food and this place does a good job of providing that
Earth tones are abundant throughout creating a natural relaxed atmosphere
Great location very good food excellent service and a upbeat atmosphere
Mandarina Apartments has been a great place to live with it's super close proximity to my job at Sky Harbor International Airport
I may have been in a really good mood when I went here in November but I really liked this place
Overall a great place to get Thai food in Tempe
Once it gets later this place totally fills up and people dance drink and have a good time
Place is still a good place to go out to and drink since they have 2 for 1's but I think it'll take more than that if I'm going to spend the whole night there
The food was even better than the great atmosphere and staff
Definitely a great place to take the family and get well fed but don't expect a mouth changing experience
If you crave greasy but tasty breakfast with great service for a steal you have to try The Place
Still if you want some caffeine and you need it now here's the place to juice up right before making that visit to Good Samaritan Hospital down the block to see a hurting bro or sista
We came because we had an out of towner and thought this would be a good place to try something Arizonan ie
There's a good amount of buzz about this place and I think it shows promise
I was looking for a place to grab some good food and a couple beers before a concert so I checked out Yelp and it did not lead me astray
They also had a few good micro brews from places like Firestone and Rogue
We unanimously agreed this place was great and we had a laugh about some review around here that compared it to a Hot Pocket
So if you want a great place to have a healthy meal this is the place
They have a great web order system that I checked out as soon as I got home but parking is so unbelievably unavailable at the Tempe Marketplace that I'm not sure this run in and grab it approach will really be of much use at this location
I struggled with the rating for this place as the beer is really great as is the service
The locals seemed to be happy service was great and owner seemed genuinely interested in who was eating at his place and how we had discovered it
Places like Postino have executed them perfectly
It's a great place to go for breakfast lunch or dinner
The service is absolutely perfect - balancing that reserved resort restaurant demeanor with the upscale casual ambiance of the place
Anywho I went to Moira last night with some expectations mainly a place for good sushi to satisfy my sushi craving this week enjoy a martini or two and to have an amazing experience well amazing has only happened once and that was FEZ
Its a Bosian place and I am told the food is very good
Place on top of a Swiss Alp let me sing dance and exclaiming goodness oozing
Ok so I was teetering between a 3 star and a 4 star review but I decided for the restaurant week price or the sunday supper price this place is great
This place really does a good job taking care of people
Speaking of stars this place is really good
I think it can get pricey with non-happy hour menu items but it's a great place to check out
This is a good place to go if you have kids and need something more substantial than Peter Piper or McDonalds
The place caters to families the food is always good they have a full bar and this one also has an acceptable tap beer selection
The wine I had was pretty good but they didn't have the one on the menu that I wanted so suggested the wine they'd replaced it with
The restaurant had a great look although it's decorated like one of those inexpensive places without servers
This place is really relaxed and convenient location wise
Here's the warning though  it's not the place for that special romantic date
Not quite as centrally located as I'd like but that's just me but a great place with warm friendly & helpful people -- people who like people OOPS off topic song que -- interesting and tasty menu items [I almost wrote tasty menu but I go for enough cheap jokes around here without stooping that low]
The location is just a bit Northeast of where my mind wanders for a casual place
That being said this was a great place to do that
on a side note I was so happy to find a local place that has good boba / pearl tea drinks
The Farm at South Mountain is a great place to find respite from the hustle and bustle of the city - even for a short while
It is large has a great atmosphere friendly staff and an awesome patio
Place was cute yea yea the Miro mural is cliche but this is phoenix
The atmosphere is always great the service is generally quick and the food is amazing
Overall good service food atmosphere and price
Maybe my expectation was too high after checking all good reviews and reputation of this place on yelp and some magazines
ARRIVE HOME dump the goods onto the counter & place items delicately in appropriate shelves drawers & baskets - Ahhhhh
This is a great place for a date night and if you haven't been there
seen this place had nice reviews and close and we my wife and I liked a Vietnamese place near our old home so thought it would be good to check out
Great food love the atmosphere reminds me of my time in Mississippi that's not really a compliment just get that authentic southern hospitality feel
Outside the main restaurant they have a great view of the city on their huge patio with a great fireplace
In summary Ocean Club has a great atmosphere amazing food and outstanding service
Via Delosantos is one of the few places in Phoenix that a vegetarian can get a good Mexican meal
Really thought I'd like this place as it's a good location nice outdoor patio and looks like it could be a fun place to have dinner/drinks with friends
This place is great if you are planning a day full of shopping and want to hit just one location
Overall it's a fun place with great volleyball courts a pool table fire pits in the winter occasional live music and that beanbag game Cornhole or Cornholio as I like to call it think Beavis and Butthead
I didn't think the food was amazingly special worth a long drive but it was a decent romantic place with yes plenty of Asians and downtowners visiting
Had no idea that there were three different venues in one place so that was a good touch
Of course unless you get there at 8pm you will never find a parking spot but if you can then this is a great place to spend some of your evening
Usually when you go to a place there are one or two good things to eat on the menu
This place is a little strange but it was good
Coup Des Tartes is a particularly romantic place although I've never been here with someone I had even the most remote romantic thoughts about
Definitely a great place to go after work for some drinks for dinner or for a nighttime gathering
Be warned it does get busy as all good places do well in AZ some bad places also
On the flip side the food is awesome portions are good size atmosphere is nice it is a night place but good during the day also
Totally great place close to downtown
If you are looking for a cute place that's a tab pricey then this is it
We liked the atmosphere but the wine was not good after the third taste so we decided to take off
This brown bag sandwich salad and soup place is soooo good
I was taken aback by how good I thought this place was
I bought a used $2400 trencher for my company for only $600 because they sell their used rental equipment to replace it with new and you can always get a good deal on that stuff
ther food quality is good service is good and all around good place with their new pricing and menu options
Upon entering everything looks great the place is spacious and we were greeted and seated immediately
The crust was really good quality but I was somehow underwhelmed with the pizzas as a whole especially with all the hype surrounding this place
This place is a great restaurant for one of those beautiful Phoenix afternoons/evenings
Wine and food aside I can usually overlook shotty service if the atmosphere and food is good enough
very cute place surrounded by fields that I'm sure will be under new construction soon enough
I want places like this to stick around so bad I'm tempted to print out these reviews and mail them to them
I had the Sonoran Masa enchiladas comes with eggs on top and it was quite good reasonable portion size and priced consistent with other casual dining places
Cute casual Mexican place with good drinks
It is also a great place to study or do work
I don't know how anyone could say anything bad about this place
My boyfriend was very excited to try this place since we heard great things
Parking is not great particularly on a weekend morning and the place is not very large so sometimes the line goes out the door on weekends
so on the one hand i would go back there in a heartbeat quick service good food and for the most part decent prices kate would list it on a top ten places to avoid list
The service is so good the place could have been a shit hole and we woulld have been happy
The atmosphere is always packed but in a good way
I knew two and maybe three places had failed in this location before another not good sign
Unfortunately I've heard through the grapevine that Greasewood Flat is closing soon  It's too bad we waited this long to try it because I'm sure it would be a place we'd visit often
Now Vietnamese restaurants aren't known for their service but this place was amazingly bad
If you think I'm off my rocker do yourself a favor and visit one of theseKhai Hoan the best Da Vang really good and Cyclo kind of over rated but this place puts Dragonfly to shame
If you want a place to eat every week or more that's good filling inexpensive and convenient for meeting with people
TC is a great place for family and celebrations or just to enjoy a great weekend brunch
The service was good for a pregame crowd granted it was for a Diamondbacks game and they are 25 games out of first but the place was still busy and the staff delivered
The atmosphere is really good for working lunches and I would like to go again and try something other things on the menu
The atmosphere is great very comfortable and relaxed
If you're going to try to impress this would be a good place for a special date
I've had pizza in Italy Rome Tuscany Umbria etc and love it there; I'm always disappointed by the pizza here in the US and have only found a few places in the entire country that do what I consider to be a good crust; 'Sauce' manage to get it right
I think of this place as having good but not exciting or overly spectacular food
Good thing our friends came equipped with places to take us
Sure you can go to the original Binkley's down the street if you want a little more well to do atmosphere but for a casual meal and drink Cafe Bink is it
The Rice and Peas were the best thing about this place everything was was not good at all
If you were looking for a good place to start your First Friday I wouldn't pass up Switch
In any case- service was great we got there when the place opened there weren't that many people in there
The sides are too awesome in their taste and quality and i suggest the Lobster mash or the Maestros Mash potatoes neither of which will leave you hungry in their own right but often wanting more  Wine selection is great and the atmosphere is top notch but topping it with some of the best servers in town makes this one of my favorites for entertaining
and why aren't there any amazingly great chinese food places in north phoenix
I wish I remembered the name of the place I believe it was along the lines of Sweet Treats the helpings of ice cream are huge the man who helped us was great and it was the perfect ending to a day amongst such beauty
Good vibe crazy walls wicked wait for a burger place
They are one of the last places in Old Town that take reservations thank goodness
None of us had been here before so we thought it would be a great place for a birthday dinner
Fry's is a great place to shop at now great cheap organics and no miserable looser guy to bring the mood down
Other than a few issues which usually involve uninformed waitresses this place is a great place to watch a game
I looked up their nutritional value online and unfortunately at 700 calories per sub it wasn't looking too great as a healthy alternative to the surrounding fast food places
The lettuce and tomato salad that came on it seemed fresher than other places and the rice was good no beans for me
The brick patio is very cute with string lights and a laid-back ambience
I love Thai food and this place has the goods they even have different levels of how hot with spice your entree can be served
They've got it all at WCG-great food great drinks great desserts great atmosphere and great service
Such a great place did I say that already
It's kind of a small place but the ambience is great and the food was really good
I only got to try one seafood taco from one place and it tasted good but it was definitely a skimpy taco and not worth a ticket
Its a great place when its too hot out and you don't want to clean up a giant mess after having a bunch of kids over at your own pool
The service was great though I would have preferred if they replaced our silverware after the cinnamon roll and the meal was well paced
The place was packed they had music starting at 6 pm which was pretty good and service was very good and attentive
It's a very cute place decorated like an Italian villa
There are lots of tables and places to sit which is great if you want to spend some time enjoying your coffee while doing work studying or reading
I think I would come here if I was in the area and wanted a nice place to get some writing done but it would not be my first thought for a good espresso drink
I can't believe this place has good reviews
Most people already know that this is a great place but since it was my first time there I have to put my two-cents in
Like one of the other yelpers said it is not in a great neighborhood  right off Indian School and 51st Ave but the ballpark is very nice and true there are plenty of vendors and bathrooms at this place
A place that has good microbrew beer and lots of good non-bar food options
Great place to go hang with your friends in your flip flops and tees
It is a great little place especially when they open the doors and luckily a breeze blows in
This place has SERIOUSLY good food even if their business accounting practices are a little shady
The atmosphere is cool and the place is always busy day or night yet the service is good
Cool warm urban place big patio too hot to go out during the day though it's Phoenix baby and a great $5 happy hour
The midcentury modern decor really makes the ambience great
Finally I decided Hula's is an awesome place to get a great cocktail
This is a great place to grab a handmade sandwitch and snoop threw the store while you wait
Unfortunately the bad service terrible decor and cafeteria like setting made me dislike this place
Whether you want a casual bike or a high tech racing bike this place can supply anything you need
Also there is not a bad seat in the house I have sat pretty much in all areas of the field but I must say my favorite places to sit have to be by the bullpens and the 3rd baseline
Final thoughts this place is great and I cant wait to come back and try the other crepes

I've been coming to this place since college and I can tell you its definitely one of those an oldie but a goodie

I was out of ideas for good food so I asked my sister in law and she recommended this place so i rolled the dice and took her to Windsor it did not disappoint
There is a special place in my heart for good restaurants in Sunnyslope and Bombero's is right there
Each tasting develops it's own personality based on the attendees as the casual atmosphere encourages questions and  comments discussion
After discovering this place last week my boyfriend and I have been twice once to dine in and once to take out and both times we have had good service and great pho
Yes it's a cheap place to see good bands but I'll make sure to do my eating and drinking beforehand and bring a warm jacket
I really have nothing but good things to say about this place
The atmosphere was nice outside and the waitress was great
I love a good deli sandwich and this place seemed to hit the spot
There sauce actually had good flavor to it since other places I've had we're very bland
Worked up a great sweat and enjoyed the atmosphere
The clientele are all either in good shape my wife or working on it me but the mood of the place is pleasant and there is no muscle-head or aerobics-beauty vibe going on - people are here to exercise and have a little fun
The selection is decent sale racks can be great and regular pricing is on par with most other places too
To sum it all up this was a great place to have standard but good Thai-ish food and if you focus on some of the less fusion-y dishes like the curry rice and noodles you will have a good dining experience
Great place for lunch after walking the mall or to even make the trip solely to come here
Love this place whether for a casual lunch or would be a great date place too
I am going to start building my garden slowly and I'm thrilled to have such a great place to go to and hopefully I will be able to get some more help to keep my leafy babies thriving
Too bad the owner seems to be MIA - I can't see this place staying around too much longer
Ok we have been trying to find a good raspado Mexican snow cone place for a while
This is kind of what happened to this location they closed down and remodeled I would have to say that since the remodel this place has kind of cleaned up a bit and they do have some pretty good employees there is one fat girl that works there now that is a bit rude still like she hates life and everybody in it because she is overweight but for the most part the rest of the staff is pretty good
Overall I wouldn't expect anything special but if you're hungry for some sticky rice and teri sauce you're on your lunch and want something casual this place will fill you up
I know some other reviewers have complained about the atmosphere but I think the place is cute
Great decor and ambience; would be better minus the flat screens2
This place has potential but not well executed
And ultimately it is a great place to go on a nice day with your kids dogs or even on a date
It's one of those places where the food and drink menu are both sooooooo long that they kitchen and bar probably have a tough time turning out good stuff conssitently
This is a great place for grub but it may put you to sleep once you get back to the office
I loved the casual atmosphere and beautiful practice they provided
You can count on the DJ being good which adds to the all around great atmosphere
Some of the exhibits are not viewer friendly but all in all it is a good place to view the animals
As for  the sushi well the gaari was bitter  a good sign that the place is unauthentic and the slices of fish which I ordered tuna and salmon  were too thick  on the maki and in the rolls too skimpy
However this place is also great if you just want to have a drink too
We were in Scottsdale for 8 nights and ate at some great places Deseo Roaring Fork Pomo Pizzeria Napoletana Hiro Sushi Rehab Burger Therapy White Chocolate Grill
I really like sushi but it's hard to find a good place living in the desert and all
The next thing you know they brought up this place called the Good Apple Health Food store after telling them I was into alternative health and wellness as were they
The place is a little old and beat up but not to bad
50 I left the place quite full a pretty good value meal but if I had a list of Casa Grande buffets they would be at the bottom
In fact it's a great place to get some exercise
This is a great little place for hanging out with your friends while having a nice glass of wine or beer and taking in an independent or foreign film that has gone unnoticed by major chain theaters
The atmosphere of the bar is very casual with an Arabian theme and they have a live DJ in the evenings which was nice but the music was a bit too loud to allow for any conversation without having to yell at the person standing right next to you
Sounds like a good idea but the place is so small and the music was so loud that you felt like you were sitting on top of the sub
I don't go here for everyday lunches with the usual work crew but it is perfect for business lunches where you are looking for good atmosphere and somewhere you won't be rushed or catching up with old friends in an out-of-the-way area
Although this place was not great before it was as close as we're going to get to Indian food in Scottsdale
Well this place does have an appealing new space in a great location BUT YUCK
This is a great place to meet friends for lunch but you have to get there early or you will have to WAIT
The restaurant has an open and airy atmosphere and the menu has a greater selection than some of the other sandwich places in town
The atmosphere is a relaxed sophistication
The korma sauce was very thick and I liked it but it was much thicker than the usual korma sauce in most other places and although it was good and certainly quite different I think I prefer the usual consistency
This will guarantee that all those slippery little grilled mushroom and onion tidbits stay in place because they're seriously too good to get away
The sculpture garden was also great to stroll through and since it was a lovely day it was especially nice to walk outside
I do like the atmosphere and the great specials they run
A nice little walk from my apartment this place is a cute little restaurant off 1st street
However that said this place is not so bad
This is Sunnyslope and with the authentic delicious taco and burrito choices around here this place is only competing with the tacos across the street at Jack in the Box and I would probably eat those before I'd touch another one of these it was that bad for me
Decided to try this breakfast place that actually got good reviews
Overall a great place with great prices
It's definitely not going to win any awards for decor/atmosphere but if you want great mexican this is the place to go
This swanky place has great food drinks and atmosphere
In addition to those greats with it's prime location in Oldtown Kelly's has managed to create it's own style and atmosphere that I believe sets it apart from the typical Scottsdale scene
All ages and styles welcome- this place is GREAT
The duck was tender and not fatty like some places and the dumplings and wontons were really good with the sauces we had
I didn't want to skip kudos to a great place just becuase I was too slow in getting there
It is pricey but a good place to make your parents take you on your birthday or with your gal pals to share on a Saturday night
I've only dined in so I can't comment about their delivery but their dine in service is very good and the place is well decorated and clean
If you want a good place to socialize that's kinda crazy but not too crazy this is a great choice
Since we are constantly trying new places we will surely be trying other Filipino joints in the area but we will also be going back to CF for some good food to make us feel at home
This place is neither a good meal quick a value or even worth the plumbing in the building
I know my reviews of the Duce are all over the place but I am now starting to think my good experience was a fluke
I've had a good experience with the food and the drinks and I still think it is a cool hip space but I find the service issues so disruptive that the Duce has dropped to my in a pinch can't think of anyplace else to go with a group list which is a bummer because if this issue were corrected it could be a great hangout
hahavery casual place to go work out just to stay in shape not if you want to be mr
It's too bad because Phoenix could use a GOOD cheap Seafood place
Climb the stairs to enter a low key dim lit lounge atmosphere with great style seating and a very nice drink selection
This place is always busy and full of Asian people and not that many white people it's never a good sign when you see eight Asian people and one white dude at Chick-Fil-A know what I am sayin
The best thing about this place is the atmosphere - its a cute coffee shop and its perfect to put in long hours studying
With French folk music playing in the background and a completely relaxed Euro atmosphere we felt like we could spend the whole night there if we wanted to
Overall-- a good place to find a fit for the night grab some starbucks or get out of this blazing ass heat in the summer
The atmosphere of the restaurant is cute and homey with a fireplace that's looks a little strange next to the huge flat-screen TVs behind the bar
The server did a good job keeping up with the packed little place
Thank goodness for the free valet because the place was packed
The atmosphere is super cute typical city like restaurant where tables are close and its nice and loud and crowded
Also if you want a great $10 burger this place is one of the best
Good place for upscale bar food and a cold beer while watching a game
and fewer surprises on the menu would go a long way toward making this place great
This place isn't anything fancy but the food really is good
The patio is beautiful and is a great place to relax with friends and a cocktail
Straight up a very good place to eat with king flavor
The place has a good location but too similar to a strip mall front and parking is a pain in the butt
The walk up bar is the coolest part of the place and the happy hour isn't a bad bet at all but since the drinks were made from someone with Stevie Wonder's eyesight
The place is really neat and a great destination for families with children
I will recommend this place to everyone and it makes for a great night out
I checked out this place on Yelp for reviews and all of them were great
The only drawback which is also Matt's strength is that it is a small place good for only groups of 4 or so
This is a great place to take out-of-towners looking for a Old West experience
As others have said the atmosphere here is pretty casual but fun
Overall not bad not amazing but by far the best breakfast place within a couple blocks of Thomas and Central
Is also is nice to see powdered garlic on the tables this is a must that my NY pizza soul and it is great that I don't need to smuggle in my own garlic like I do at many other places
To sum it up if you have $200 to spare and want to throw it away on a decent but forgettable meal with great service - you found your place
The atmosphere is cool the menu is interesting and our waiter Drew was great
This is a good place to just chill out and relax in
ive heard about this place from my buddies and i came here and read the bad reviews
When I brought the car in Mark the shop tech decided to check to make sure the CC was bad before doing the replacement
The service is great-LOVE the atmosphere and patio-it's very close to North Mountain so it's a must when coming down from a Sunday morning hike-and it's pretty close to the canal-if you're feeling like a bike ride to brunch
I'll be back it's a nice place to meet up with a couple of people for some good burgers and beer
This is a really great place to sit down and work
I've tried many different places here in town desperately trying to recapture the memory of a good London curry house but each time I've left either disappointed or clutching my guts fearing what may come
This will make a nice alternative and then you'll be good on this place for another six months or so
This cute fun place is located in the Clarendon hotel in Phoenix off 3rd Ave and Indian School
It's really not a bad place to watch a game
I will still eat here as it is a great place to chill and get some grub but if your looking for Chicago zaaaa
All in all a good standard place to eat exremely nice servers and decent food
If you love all things furry cutesy quirky creepy and fun this is definitely THE place
This place is very good for the money; It's nice to be able to fill up for less than $12
The place is clean friendly quick and good
This place isn't much to look at just lot's of concrete and a large number of TVs but it does serve good beer at good prices and is a great place to watch sports
Now the bad this place is a horrible car wash
he'd been building this place up so I was expecting really good stuff
Prices are what you'd expect from a high-end resort restaurant with great food excellent service and wonderful atmosphere
I find this is a great place for groups since everyone can find something to like the atmosphere is wonderful especially in the cooler months and the food and drink is always good
This is a great place to introduce friends and family to the valley as well
Great place for a date or just sitting alone moaning in pleasure which is why they won't let me eat inside anymore
The Turf is one of those places that for me is not great but not bad either
Their food is good again not great but they have an interesting menu with some more traditional Irish fare so this is a good alternative to other Irish places that call themselves Irish because they serve Guinness and have Notre Dame banners on the wall much like Outback Steakhouse calls themself Australian because they have Foster's posters and Boomerangs on the wall
It is a great place for drinks and some munchies afterwork and the atmosphere makes it a great alternative to some of the other downtown watering holes
Usually there's Japanese posters Japanese bamboo art Japanese lanterns but this place didn't have all of that which isn't a bad thing it's just something I noticed
For the most part its a decent restaurant decent prices good atmosphere hot babes on the weekends etc etc
A great place to purchase high end purses at a fraction of the cost just like my lovely Balenciaga in nice condition for only $110
This is an unpretentious place that leaves a good impression that constantly reverberates
This is a great place for a sub sandwich
It definitely has a romantic atmosphere and the noshes are delicious
A large and always-busy location the Starbucks at Kierland has a reputation as the pickup Starbucks as in it's a great place to meet and perhaps find a spark with fellow coffee lovers
This is a great date night place or if you want to impress your parents or out of town guests but call ahead to make reservations
This place can definitely do pulled pork correctly it was a tiny bit dry but still great flavor and piled high
It never ceases to amaze me how people pass by great little mom and pop places like this to go to fast-food chain restaurants
If you like neighborhood spots with things in a little bit of disarray with great food served to you by your Italian Aunt this is the place for you
From my personal experience I thought it was a great place to have breakfast
If you want to get away from the mainstreams such as Denny's or the whole IHOP thing this place is great
I almost hate giving good reviews of places that I like for fear of their becoming over-run
A great restaurant with great decor and atmosphere
A ton of great beers on tap and fabulous ambiance this pub is a great place to spend a few hours
Also Cornish Pasty is a great place to take out-of-towners -- they love it
It's not a great place to spend time but since you'll be waiting FOREVER for food or drink refills anyway you'll also come to embrace the ugly uncomfortable furniture which is meant to compel you to leave
If you are good with it happy dining if you want something a bit more intimate you may want to consider off hours or another place
The lounge and bar are nicely appointed and really make for a great place to hang out when the temperatures are inhospitable
They have great live jazz music and it's a unique place to go for dinner drinks and dancing
Atmosphere is relaxed cafe-like and when we bring Chopin sheet music we find the piano is always in tune
We have heard nothing but good things about this place
the last place i expected to find great BBQ food would be in the desert
I would rank the burger places around mill as1 Smashburger for their delicious Arizona burger and the awesome smash fries2 Chuckbox for delicious char-grilled meat that actually tastes like meat3 In-n-out for great-tasting meat and some of my favorite fries4 Five Guys5 Fatburger seriously why the fuck does anyone eat at Fatburger
The music was great the ambiance was chill--all around wonderful place to eat lunch
This place is so good I literally dream about eating here and I can't stop thinking about it until I go

Give this place a try for a very romantic dinner with excellent food
The atmosphere was nice but still casual enough to feel comfortable in and the service was good
OVERALLThe place is nice but for the money the food is just not good enough
Definitely a place to check out for some good coffee or tea and FREE WI-FI
Their sushi is usually pretty good and they are by far the cheapest place around for it
alas R Bar is the kind of place you don't remember much about the service because it was so flawlessly executed
I have eaten here and had dinner to go it always takes forever and it is not cheap I expect cheaper if theres no atmosphere or really good food would make up for it
The place itself is cute and I've always liked places that have a homey feel
A great store with fantastic fashions and nice salespeople make it a place that I'll frequent for years to come
I would give this place 1 star but they did do a good job on the pedicure

I ordered a cappuccino my typical order at a new place and it was very good with a pretty heart design on top which made me smile
This place isn't bad but just isn't worth the $9 I spent on a small hamburger small fries and a small soda
Its a good place to watch the game and get a beer
=It's a small place but can house a pretty good amount of patrons
I totally recommend this place it's a very neat and quiet restaurant tucked in a good complex where you can also do grocery and shopping all in one stop

Like Black Bear in Gilbert this place is REALLY GOOD blowing away competitors such as Denny's & yet the prices are reasonable
Echo is a quaint local coffee shop that has some good pastries and a nice place to lounge and hangout
I've been back to Sens three or four times since my original review and I've got to say this place has risen above It's just good for Phoenix in my not-so-humble opinion
This is a good solid place for an american dinner
I certainly have no problem paying 200-300 for a meal but it better be good and honestly the sushi at Stingray Ra and Kyoto is better than this place
I have eaten at Postino between five and ten times honestly I don't really remember that's not a good thing because I had a client for a while that loved the place
The wine selection however  is good there should be no problem finding something you likeTo boil it down we have a decent meal with a good wine selection in a super trendy place to eat
The place is kind of a dive but the food is good
it is suppose to be a casual place with awesomely delicious comfort Chinese and Mexican food

It was pretty good tasting but it wasn't enough to make us come back to this place
The only reason I gave this place two stars is because I think their food is good

I don't mind standing but there wasn't even any good places to stand here we were always in the way
Needless to say there are much better places to go for a good brew
Vintage 95 in the Old Town Chandler area replaces what was an embarrassingly bad short lived asian restaurant
This place is great for a first date birthday or dinner with a small group of friends - Looooove it
The place has a very family-run feel to it for good reason and the food reflects that; eating there almost feels like you're having lunch at a friend's house
I had a great meal at this place and loved their o menu concept
I don't even know why I am bothering to review it though everyone and their mailman has already discovered how great this place is
Go for happy hour to this place and get some great deals

I really like the atmosphere here and the service has always been good
Things I like about The Vig- great outdoor patio with smoking section- great outdoor fireplace renders the patio warm & comfortable in the cooler months- consistently good service; attentive affording knowledgeable & friendly- hot bear DJ on Friday nites- bacci ball court on the side- Trivial Pursuit cards at the tablesTheir sweet potato fries with curry-mayo ROCK MY WORLD and the grilled chicken sandwich ain't bad either

Great place to dine on Mexican food with a twist and sip on yummy cocktails sangrita margarita is my fave while enjoying the ambiance and decor
The location at Tempe Market Place makes it a great place to grab drinks and dinner with friends before seeing a movie at the TMP and of course the shopping

Still dig this place - not as crowded and variety is good
*Location = thank goodness that there is at least one pretty good sushi place around Chandler area*Food = pretty good*Service = very good*Atmosphere = nice and hip*Price = expected for AZ sushi place = over $100/a couple
Great food great prices and great service even when the place is busy - no wonder this place is so popular
There are free peanuts good food and a fun atmosphere
Veering right into the driveway you're bound to think that you would be entering into the main building there's really no defined indication on navigating this place but Vincent's Market Bistro is actually a separate venue all together with it's own quaint casual identity
All in all Vincent's is a great place for Lunch where you can escape the brutal Phoenix sun and stay cool and relaxed in the French countryside for the afternoon
Pros-Not Starbucks-Great location in Old Town Scottsdale and surrounded by lots of fun shopping/browsing-Great atmosphere/interiorAnd thats about it
Walking by other nights we had noticed music that wasn't depressing at all being played by different performers though so maybe we just hit the place on a bad night

I can deal with a long wait if the food tastes great and the atmosphere is nice
I've eaten a lot of BAD Carne Asada in my life and I'm thrilled to finally find a place that makes it so well

The place was mostly dead which was good so we wouldn't have to fight a crowd for drinks and a place to sit
Lively environment with Wi-Fi internet makes this a great place for study groups
Only bad thing about this place is how small the parking lot is because most times it's full
The place is kept incredibly clean staff is friendly and Teharu fills a nice niche for a super casual quick sushi place
When it comes down to it I can't always afford to spend what that quantity of food would cost me at Yasu or any of the other great places in town - I like that I am not committing to a whole roll - I can sample from 5 or 6 different ones
I could go on with issues seen during previous recent visits but the bottom line is that there are too many good pizza places around to spend any more time with this one
Beyond that though this place is super clean unique in some of the design attributes and the food and service are quite good
I also enjoy shopping for presents here and if you ever had someone who was hard to shop for this place may have a good chance of solving your problem
It wasn't until my second visit here that I realized this place is not The Good Egg hahahaaaOk
Since I live in Tempe I attempt to find good places to grab quick noshes that are NOT chain or fast food joints

I have not a bad word to say about the place and I will keep coming back
In any event we arrived for a 10 minute wait or so friendly vibe clean atmosphere and people seem to be in good spirits leaving
If the place is busy which it usually is because the food is so good   you have to stand in a long line
If you do go check out the cute blurbs on the placemats
Overall the place is a good value and I have not been disappointed yet
cute little spot that is really close to my place
It's a great meal in a great atmosphere and honestly it's a great value
As I mentioned in my previous post it's where I have great memories met my husband and still I think it has a great romantic atmosphere

They are always super friendly here and the atmosphere is good for kids
The high end restaurant in the place can't remember name is good but VERY pricey and with strange decor I understand that is subjective some people are really into the Frank Loyd look
All in all a good place to stay just not much around there to do
If you are looking for good food solid service and a nice atmosphere then you probably want to avoid this strip mall hangout at all costs

I can see this place being a lot of fun at the right time and very romantic as well
Grimaldi's fills a nice niche in OTS of being an upscale yet casual and uncomplicated pizza place
12/7/08The place has a great feeling from the moment you walk up and see a grand piano on the front stage a full bar and flower centerpieces on the tables

With good drink deals $5 martinis $6 wines and good beer deals as well as $4 fondue for cheese or chocolate this really is a great first date place
I love a great sandwich but this place must clean up in profits
T Cook's is one of those rare places that can genuinely say everything is good when you ask for their recommendationsMaybe it's just me but the atmosphere ambiance service and food combine in subtle but effective ways to create a meal experience that you really don't find very often
It's not a super duper awesome place on my constant rotation but I like to stop by if I have time and it's a good place to unload my old stuff
This market was also great for soups their brand was my pick although they have a selection of major brands as well; it was also my go-to place for prepared healthful lunches perfect for work like the F&E pre-made burritos and pasta dishes
I was looking for chile rellenos and this place does a great job of making them just the way I like it

My room was great a King Bed Resort and had a lot of space about 500 square feet - bigger than my first San Francisco studio and included a balcony that looked out over a perfectly manicured garden courtyard
The atmosphere was warm and intimate the service was great and the chef/owner so hospitable
What's even better is that the mini desserts are really reasonably priced so if you are looking for a dessert for someone to celebrate a birthday anniversary whatever this is a great place to go
The only place I needed to be was away from your bad attitude
Ruth Chris why does your food have to be so average and underwhelmingThe restaurant is very nice inside and they have a great outdoor patio for drinks when it is nice outIf you go ask for Bruce he is the best server that I can remember having for any restaurant - was exceptional and I dine out at many high end placesHaving not been to a Ruth Chris in 4 or 5 years it was time to give it another shot i remembered the food being very average and being underwhelmed by the steak which was the case again - The steaks were cooked correctly I feel their steaks are bland especially compared to other chains like MasterosThe desserts were very good and the highlight for us both the sin cake very dark chocolatey and the bread pudding with raisensWon't be going back however the location and the service are fantastic so if you do enjoy Ruth Chris steaks you will be happy here - go see Bruce and he will make sure you have a fantasic time as we did even though the food wasn't up to our level of expectation
The atmosphere was GREAT live music and a friendly crowd
in fact when I walk into Jim's Coney Island it seems to be in black and white to me After my workout today I was looking for a good place to retox I hadn't been to Jim's in quite a while and this seemed to be a good time to get back to the lunch counter at Jim's Jim's throws the love at you
a lunch counter like this needs 4-5 great pies so I would have a place to go and have a cup of coffee and a piece of banana cream pie
It has a very pleasant cookout atmosphere and the staff are wonderful but the bottom-line for me is that the cue is not that good
Also the pizza is not bad the prices are fair the salads taste fresh and the place is bright and welcoming with comfy hotel room art and a steady flow of people getting their orders to-go perhaps to avoid my hero server
And for all the single ladies out there and coupled ladies that like to look this place surely didn't lack with some good looking men
Other than that I think this place is great
I had heard a lot of good things about this museum and thought it would be an awesome place to go on my birthday
It seems like it would be a great place for it
Now this is a small place cute and cottagy hence the name one waitress and one cook
I like this place and I think it does a great job staying on and off the radar due to its simplicity
At least this place had a full bar and we made up for it with great company/conversation as well as a few martinis which were just so-so my girlfriend had to add sugar to her lemon drop
I hate giving bad reviews but this place failed from beginning to end in the dining room
This will be a great place when it's 120 outside and we need a cool treat
This place is VERY CASUAL and is set up sort of like Panda Express
The prices were kind of high enough to keep us form going back any time soon but this is totally a good place to try
It's not a fancy place located in a strip mall across the street from Bookmans but they do a good job giving it a little more atmosphere by adding Middle Eastern style draperies
Not as good as other places I've had similar meals but very tasty
Only one bad thing to say about this place
Hey Gabi this would be a great place for an official Elite Event and they have an attached nightclub
The old place was quaint and the servers were great very personable
For some reason this chain has decided not to use the good ol' tried-and-true gyro meat roasting on a spit that is served by almost every other Greek-ish place I verified this with the server
Upon asking some locals about the really good sushi place downtown to which no one knew the name we were eventually led to Stingray
Anyhow the bowl didn't fit nearly as much food as other places I guess it's good I didn't over -stuff myself but the price was higher and that whole  meat product area was really bad
I wish I could be wittier here but I have no idea what sort of flaccid cardboard-flavored awful disgusting stuff the reviewers who like this place were eating before they thought that this was good pizza
If your downtown and looking for a cool relaxing place to go to with great food then the Paisley Violin is for you
But the it was really good and the prices are pretty low especially compared to the other places in the Waterfront/Fashion Square Mall area
The food was amazing the staff was sweet and KNOWLEDGEABLE they could answer any questions and helped me even if I was being a little indecisive and the atmosphere just added the cherry on top the energy and vibe in there was just great
i cant say enough good things about this place
Welcome to the funkiest place in Goodyear
Impeccable service the great atmosphere and above par noshes is what keeps me coming back
Good balance of dining room to bar area great DirecTV service for games playing and loved that the owner makes the rounds throughout the place to check on everything
Some of my favorites are- Dolmeh fresh warm stuffed grape leaves - a world away from the typical cold slimy canned ones many places offer- Falafel crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside - served with a tasty tahini sauce- Tabbouleh nice herb/tomato to bulgur ratio and good seasoningNote to the wise unless you're really really hungry or if you want leftovers stick to either a few apps to share or just to the entrees
In conclusion this place is great you should find lots of things to attend here
Thank goodness for places like this the robot animals and storm that happens every now and then really kept them entertained
The food wasn't amazing but it was good enough for a theme chain place
Overall I think it's a pretty good place and it's nice to have another option in the area
I can't say enough good things about this place and that includes all the staff
great place no wait because we were there early so that helped
So we went to Timo which is this cute little place that is largely hidden from the road by big trees
The service was great very attentive and the atmosphere was wonderful
I had passed this place many many times while attending ASU and I had never one stepped foot in to it but had always seen a great outdoor dining area always full of people that seemed to be enjoying what we now know is great cuisine
I recommend this place for great food and a nice relaxing night atmosphere
I'm sure I will pick this place again for a future romantic affair
Not sure I would go back which is a shame as the atmosphere was good
Great food super charming place very intimate
Pita Jungle on Apache is the kind of place I want to love art on the walls specials under $10 good location a hip vibe and an eclectic and healthy menu but due to poor service mediocre food and other better restaurants  in the vicinity I can't bring myself to recommend Pita Jungle on Apache whole heartedly if other options are available
This place does have the potential at being a good place
The atmosphere is great and the bar area has TV's with current sporting events playing
The atmosphere inside is very low-key and seems good for families
Love this place; best cafe I've been to in the greater Phoenix area no questions asked
The food's flavor and quality however are very good the place is always sqeaky clean
Good neighborhood place and we'll continue to visit
The place was already crowded with other guests which is great for them HOWEVER the manager never tried to accommodate all our guests which they knew we were coming
This is a good place to pick up some gyros to go or a relatively quick lunch
Service was good and the atmosphere is comfy
Great place a bit off the beaten path but still near old town
From the romantic candlelit interior jovial and often talkative servers to the detail placed on quality ingredients La Fontanella is memorable and instantly lovable
So I know that some of the reviews for this place aren't great but I had take out and it was pretty good
If you are looking for great food and great service this is the place to come its like finding an oasis in the middle of a desert
I really like this place and was surprised to find such good Italian food in Glendale AZ
The place is simply decorated with crab stuff on the wall so cute and shiny table tops with a Neds Subs design
Well when you first walk in it has a trendy but very casual atmosphere
I went there today and the sushi is great it's one of my favorite places to eat sushi in Phoenix although my favorite is Sushi Cho in Tucson
Besides the great company and great place ambiance wise the food doesn't worth the visit
I'll give this place a try someday soon with hopes that it was just a bad day because the setting and ambiance are really nice
The grilled chicken with hot wing sauce in place of your standard tomato sauce was very good and even better heated up the next day
I would recommend this place to anyone looking to relax have a great beer and good food
I've been to Haiku Grill many times and can definitely recommend it as a good place to eat
Their brown rice usually comes out really good not an easy task for most places and the chicken and veggies are tasty
Spicy tuna rolls is my favorite sushi but I've had bad sushi in the past and I'm always a little wary to try it at new places
The rolls were a good size other places I've gone to make them too large to easily fit in your mouth and had a good amount of fish in them
They have some really good places to check out and Mango's is one of them
Bar non best wine Bar in PhoenixWine Selection largest and some of the top picks ever to be corked Service very knowledgeable staff and Music wow the music these elements create the top spot Place is so great they make it hard to find on purpose who does that
To me this is a good sign so if you're looking to try this place out I'd say give it a shot
There is a great mix of all sorts of people here that you don't seem to see at most of the other places in the area
For a place that sees as much foot traffic as LGO and for as little space as they have in the market/counter area they do a great job of controlling the line and making it so you don't wait too long to order up
The place has a great decor but I can see where it is hit or miss
But this place makes more then good pizza
Many places could learn a lot by going in and experiencing this good customer service
I finally tried this place after hearing so many good things and I'm hooked
Everything was great loved the atmosphere
Seems like a great place for a date a girls night out a place you want to go to impress dress and de-stress
looking for places near Old Town I read about Carlsbad Tavern and since I have a new fondness to green chile we decided to come here
Francisco's is more of a casual quick order-at-the-counter type of place but with enough room to bring your family for dinner
And with great customer service amazing amenities and a super convenient location it's one of my favorite places to be
Food is not bad above average but the place is not clean enought
The ambience is awesome and if I lived near there their happy hour specials look great
The service is pleasant with a casual atmosphere - the decor is nothing to write home about but when the eats are good - who cares
Ambience- Pros- Modern clean Cons- dark and tables too close to each otherService-Pros- Attentive polite concern Cons- Food came out a bit too slowly maybe because of ARWFoodPros- flavorful food presented in simple yet appealing styleCons- nothing really stood outFirst course-1 meatballs with polenta - meatballs were moist and polenta had good flavoring and consistency2 prawns with beans- prawns good grill flavor seasoned well beans were also creamy and well cooked3 cheese artisinal board- good quality cheese with some fruit compoteSecond Course1 cioppino- good seafod flavor seafood- clams prawns and octopus were fresh and the tomato broth well seasoned  I add lime and chilli powder to give it a kick2 Wagu brisket- well cooked and seasoned favorite is the grilled cauliflower according to hubbyThird course dessert1 ricotta fritters- dry and boring after 1st bite average tasting 2 chocolate flan- nice presentation inside little jam jar
If you're new or if you're knocking the rust off this is a great place to get some grit in your chain
Overall a great place to frequent in the valley
So many places just shave the dogs down but Janice really takes the time to get to know what you want and takes good notes so when you come back she knows exactally what to do
They will then fire & glaze it ready to pick up your masterpeice in a few daysA great place to zen out and leave all your stress and worries at the door
Stinkweeds is a good place to go if you don't really know what kind of music you are looking for
Very good atmosphere never super croweded even on the weekends oh and my favorite part-They close at 1130pm
Please try this great place no matter what
Desserts are also good as you'd expect from a place that lists them first on the menu
Luckily my 2006 Matrix is running great and I've only needed in the past year brakes and a belt replaced about 5 months ago
My review may sound really bad but I don't want to knock the place because the food was good
This place has good food and if you're coming here for atmosphere you're not coming for the right reasons
Granted the place could be nicer but if you're in the mood for great food without the frills of a great looking place this is it
It's a great place for out of towners or killing time with the relatives
Seriously this place is huge and has everything you need to get over a bad day bitchy wife or mean husband
Not knowing exactly what to expect from a sushi bar called SakeBomber I diligently made my way down to Tempe to check this place out hoping to find another great sushi happy hour which runs Monday through Friday 5-7 p
a nice family owned place with good value and an excellent quality pizza
This is not my favorite place but it's pretty close to home and pretty good
The view and atmosphere is casual and lovely and the service was friendly
Great wine selections excellent nosh options must try the ricotta dates pistachio bruschetta and a fun atmosphere
The folks who manage the place have great taste in music as the playlist is always filled with juicy hipster indie hits
Postina is a fun place for friends to gather enjoy some drinks and take in a great hip atmosphere
This place proves my theory if you make it snooty enough everyone will think its good matter how bad the food is
The regulars didn't seem to mind our woo-hoo behavior either which makes this place as good as a biker bar gets
It is a great place for groups and dates alike
Great place for a large crowd to mingle or in our case a birthday party
It's always good to try the popular dish at the new place to see how they prepare it
Great fresh organic ingredients light fresh menu and great atmosphere
Very fresh colorful presentation great tea great service nice atmosphere
A little pricey for a hot dog fries and a drink but the quality is great service is good and the place is very clean
If you are looking for a delicious place to eat good Mexican food on a day where you wandered out in shorts and flip flops
I love some good Hawaiian BBQ and this place fits the bill
It is such a unique little place with not one bad thing on the menu
Overall a great place to get healthy yummy food
I could imagine myself lounging after a great meal and just soaking in the swanky atmosphere
Every time an out of town visitor asks for great Mexican food we also recommend this place
I had take out brought to me from this place today so I can't speak for the inside of the store but the food was very good
If you haven't been able to find good Hawaiian BBQ in Phoenix yet this may be the place for you
Let me tell you this place is about the butter it was all very good since they weren't skimping on the good stuff but if you are adverse to butter you may want to stear away
We both thought the service was great and liked the atmosphere of the place
I'm always looking for cute places to go to brunch
Great atmosphere for such a tiny tiny place and the staff is always pleasant  even when theyre slammed
I can't say enough good things about this place
It's a great place to hang out the service is excellent and what food I've tried is really good
I wouldn't dine here regularly but it is a good place to bring visitors
This place is middle of the road Mexican and you'll feel a little bloated after you eat there but still pretty good overall
Either or still a great place highly recommended
This place is great for a date or a place to kick it with friends
Even though the place was small it's pleasant and it's probably a good idea to make a reservation
I definitely think the place is good enough to try but when we are in the area - which is not often - we'll prob find another pho joint to try out
Even the ones that haven't been a fan of of the ones i tried when i have mixed and matched when getting to select I still would order over bruchetta at most places as they are still very good
Overall a good place to grab a different type of late night meal
The joint has a nice atmosphere and good beers on tap though and they have Sayuri sake
This place does close at 9 otherwise it would be a great place to hang out all night
Lots of good recommendations and reviews about this place and it didn't disappoint
It's a fun atmosphere and if you can snag a table outside it would be a great place to take out of town guests or someone really looking to enjoy the weather during breakfast
THe only reason I am not giving this place a 5 star rating is because the service wasn't that great
I am confounded that this place got any good reviews whatsoever
The bottom line is that FEZ is great place whose attention to quality and urban ambiance makes it one of the best dining destinations along the Central Corridor
This studio is really cute clean and just the place you need to go to get your natural glow back
This place has a great variety at reasonable prices
It's a great laid back informal place
In a word this place is as good as it gets
I'm not much of a tea person espresso snob signing in but my sister is and knowing she is quite exposed to the good stuff via her friend from Tibet I figured a place dedicated to just tea would be an ideal spot for gift-shopping
Pretty much everything about this place is good except that it is a Fox undertaking
It's good and I'll hand them that but it's not a 4-5 star place you should take a date
Even though they have tons of great perks it's still just a place to get stuffed on cheap food
We didn't have any place to be which was good but just keep in mind that your appointment may go longer than stated on the web site
Would definitely recommend for dining in as the restaurant food itself was still very good and if you're having a party or wedding this is the place to pick for catering
For a late night snack or grub this is the place to go the food was great the service was friendly and fast and the place has a nice vibe to it
Upside-Incredibly FRESH delicious and UNIQUE food and cuisines-Customer service is great they always seem like they are in a good mood and ready to help-Nice 'garden' selection flowers pumpkins etc
oh and did i mention i travel 15mins from goodyear for this place
Instead of drinks being made behind what was the bar before FnB is now where all the cooking takes place so there is no bar to casually sit at
A fine establishment with good atmosphere friendly and expedient service and most importantly some really delectable food
Overall though I keep going back to this place and have not had any bad experiences
Mostly it's just a great location good atmosphere and decent food that you can feel good about consuming
I wont' be returning  to this place anytime soon -- with some many other great choices i'm sorry my friedn chose this restaurant
I still gave this place 4 stars because of good food and good service
This place scores points for the  cute decor but that is about it
Definitely a great place to take visitors for some quirky old school Arizona history
Agree with Danica and Patrick about the feel good part of this place with proceeds going to the Hospice
A place truly stuck in a moment in time where it is required to showcase an all male wait staff decked out in white sport coats and pants a piano man that plays romantic songs to the bar crowed and an wise old African American gentleman attending the bathroom who is ready with a good joke
Great friendly atmosphere and definitely interesting to see an Asian guy with a French accent
It's a great place to go if you are in a hurry
I can't say that the place is horrible or that the service is bad I just personally don't like their food
I think that always makes me angry that the place is called Streets of New York and the pizza isn't even nearly as good as some slices I'd buy at some random place in the food court of the mall back upstate
That's the only bad thing i can say about this place
There's no fighting what looks like a small legion of wanna-be hipsters and pseudo romantics who can't get enough of this place or it's food
The place was a lot cuter and nicer inside than expected
Other than that it's a great place to chill out and study
Just not as fresh and good as a place like Houstons or Don&Charlies
If Dublin Dr Pepper sounds good to you this is the place to get it as well as a variety of Sorpanos-themed Italian sodas a gazillion different kinds of ginger beer real cola goddamn it's the best place in town
not too bad for a sushi lunch at a high rent place like this
The Italian was pretty good for being in a British place
It seemed initially we were on a path of places that aren't really known for good wines however interestingly enough the wines were fine and it was one of the best pairings I've ever seen in which the interaction of the wine and the food was drastically well done and clearly apparent
This place has huge potential for greatness if it keeps growing on a path of uncompromising quality and innovative servings that really accentuate the best in flavors of what is being served
Seems like a good place to impress a date or perhaps a nice get together someone over a glass of wine conversation and tapas
all kinds of good clean hippie fun So all in all The Farm has absolutely delectable fresh invigorating food that isn't all that pricey and even though you may have to wait a lil while for a table at peak brunch times it usually turns into a lovely stroll through the gardens and fun shops fairly painless in my point of view
A good place to take a break from the hustle and bustle of Tempe Marketplace
This is a great place to take a few friends and just enjoy some good drinks and good company
This is a great chill place with a lot of ambiance to hang out with friends for Happy Hour
in fact i've had several people i trust tell me how great this place was
This place is pretty good The company itself has been around for a few years now
I can't say anything bad about this place except I would like it to be closer to my house
My mom and her boyfriend were in town and I have heard good things about this place so we decided to check it out
Great Italian food and served in a super cute atmosphere
i would give this place a try if you are looking for a great Italian dinner
To be honest the only good thing I remember about this place was the hot waitress and the green tea
We tried this place out last night for dinner based on the great reviews it received on Yelp
I hear good things about this place especially for a chain so I decided to stop by for lunch
Great place to take my folks out of towners or anyone I think is worthy of the Feeney charm
The live bands they have in here are very good and not too loud so if you want to enjoy some live music and still be able to have a conversation this is a good place
Johnny did a great job of turning this space into a cool atmosphere with great knowledgeable wait staff and phenomenal food
Definitely a great place and I will be back again
I get some variation of that salad lots of places so I am a pretty good judge of it
It looks like a cute place with jersey's hanging high on the ceiling--good atmosphere for a beer
I think if you're looking for shoes or bags you may do better elsewhere but this place has great prices on clothes from mall brands to designer staples
Great place great finds great prices- I can't wait to make this a monthly stop
Stopped by this place today with some pretty bad aches and pains in my neck and shoulders - boy was I sure glad I did
Good place to hang out on a friday night lots of good looking girls and guys who dance to some funky home made mixes remixed with known popular music to give it a funky step in your foot
What happens when you take bad Mexican food and replace all the tortillas with delectable fry bread
I stopped in FBH after a long time hearing about how great this place is
I really think the atmosphere adapts to whichever purpose you're there for - either a casual meal with friends or an intimate romantic meal
I had a bite and felt bad that I picked this place
As a business owner my self I am emploring everyone who reads this to always put 5 stars if you even think a place is just pretty good just to help make up for the liars and exaggerators that give a business 1 star
The atmosphere is a bid old school in a good way
This place has a really great environment too - good for kids
I always get the griefo which is a veggie sandwhich and NO I am not a vegetarian the only complaint i have about beef is when it doesnt come out rare enough to moo at me thats just HOW good this place is
If good food makes you happy this is your happy place
My limit on steak is typical 6-8 ounces and I ate my entire meal making me think 1 This place really is THAT GOOD and 2 I doubt this is more than a 10 oz serving
Zaytoon is a great place for a quick lunch time meal that will set you back by about $10
This place a new local favorite of ours tried on a whim one night and have been back 3 times and so far my favorite is the chicken katsu and the tempura shrimp udon noodles boba's are great and reasonably priced
Yeah let's go shopping for cheap clothes and home goods made in a third world country by an eight year old child or let's eat a place that you can eat at anywhere in the USA and not taste a drop of seasoning
I highly recommend this place to anyone who is seeking flavors fun adventure and just that wow I found a new great place kind of experience
There are tons of great places to eat with everything from Gyros to Funnel Cakes
Nice relaxed atmosphere and friendly attentive waitstaff Carly's bistro is a little gem in the middle of downtown Phoenix
You have to know good to know bad so that to me is the essence of rating a place by comparing it to others
This is a great place for a glass of wine before going to dinner or after
It's been awhile since I've been here and I almost forgot how great of a place this is
lol  The atmosphere is just great I cannot stress this enough
The place is filled with comfy chairs and great new books
The place has a great ambiance with artwork all over the place
I have no idea why the place was jam-packed at 7 on a random Tuesday but good for them
I'm not one to go out of my way to write a bad review unless the place really deserves it and sadly this steakhouse certainly does due to the quality of food price and service
What a great value and the chair massage focused on my shoulders back and neck--just the places I was all knotted up at
Sure this place was a landmark in its day and WAS a great inexpensive treat but they have no doubt adopted a don't care attitude
The servings are quite good for the price and the atmosphere is excellent
This is a great place to kick back and catch up on some work or just sit and enjoy the time with your friends
My experience with this place started out as a good one fun atmosphere not too crowded plenty of activities even if you are the DD
The service is always good and the  atmosphere is pleasant
All in all not a bad place I just won't pick the Cuban next time
Great place to take my kids and lots of kitschy signs on the wall like  Your mouth isn't watering it's crying for Jimmy Johns
Despite that I still give this place all my stars because it has delicious food; I have never had a bad experience especially because of the awesome servers
Not a good place for a romantic meal but a good place to have fun with friends
they close at 9 during the week which sucks because i procrastinate til it gets dark and then trip out into study mode and have a hard time finding a good place to grab a bite cup of coffee and focus
I feel bad about giving this place two stars
It's not a wine and dine kind of place and honestly it's not that bad
If you want to get to one place in particular and don't want to pay more money for parking and/or anticipate heavy traffic congestion afterward the light rail is a great option
Nothing is better than finding  a great Thai place and boy have I been blessed in Phoenix
The thai tea totaly ruled the service was great  and other than the odd diner 60's diner feel and homeless folks at the nearby gasstation that might cause some to gasp in horror the place was great
This is a perfect hangout place with your friends a very good date place or a place you could just go for some low key relaxation
If it weren't for the great music that comes through this place it would be a total dive bar
I've always had a great time at Lucky Strike - the food is good the service is fantastic and the place is really cool and different
Baby wasn't lyin when he said this place was GOOD
This place was recommended to us by an Italian girl so we were thinking it has to be good if an Italian girl loves this place
Good food decent prices open and inviting atmosphere
The Farm Kitchen is a great place to step away from it all if only for a lunch hour
Cheba has an atmosphere of We're great at what we do and we're having fun doing it
There are several more restaurants or cafes in the area that are good places to go but MacAlpine's is the one that will keep bringing me back over and over
In addition to the great food the real draw is the atmosphere and ambience that you immediately get when you walk in the door
Never had the food parking is good as are attitude atmosphere and service
We all need a place like this a super-casual neighborhood bar which requires the least amount of effort from you
All in all this was a great place to start the evening
The music Good music probably the only good thing about this place - if you're a hip-hop fan
The service was good and the place was clean
Still on a Monday Morning this place does have a good amount of people
We go because its outside and has great atmosphere
Casey's is a great place to have a beer and talk for a while
great place to kill an afternoon reading a book
It seems like a great place to share several dishes between everyone
Truly a great place to spend a few hours at if you need to get something accomplished
Atmosphere is good its generally always busy and service is very friendly and quick
Bathrooms are clean and overall the place has a good atmosphere
Atmosphere is very simple and comfortable I could see myself stopping in here in just a t-shirt jeans and sneakers or on a romantic date in a cute outfit and heels
My other half just misses them because it's hard to find a good Gyro out near us so we had to check out this place
It's not five-star dining but if you're looking for a Gyro or related cuisine for a quick bite this is a great place
I say 5 stars for a great consistent Italian place that I first highly underestimated
The service is always great here and the atmosphere is really nice considering it is in a Safeway shopping center
I probably go here about once per month for my whole family it is a great place for authentic Italian food
This is a great place to eat except they are hit and miss with food quality and level of service
I had heard good things about this place and I brought the BF here one afternoon to give it a try
Overall the atmosphere was great and even the attendant in the woman's bathroom was nice
Char's is a little divey but a cozy place where the people are friendly for the most part stop that growling and the service is great
Always a great atmosphere and the service is tops and on the ball
I would say this is a great place for a date you want to impress
Nevertheless check this place out for a good drink and great atmosphere
Also a really great place to meet fellow loving dog owners
Zia's is a good hang out place in Phoenix Tempe etc
decided on a plain grilled dog which i preferred since i got to put what and how much of what i wanted really these are very very good hot dogs and the owner gave us each a free brioche the place is nice and clean and pretty decent prices
I'm not sure why it says it's not good for kids as the place was full of them and they have a kids menu
Ok I don't like to give places 5 stars often especially on my first time at a restaurant but Upper Deck/Blitz was great place to watch the UofA game
Excellent price with the help of Yelp and great atmosphere for a big game
What I care about is great food and this place definitely offers that
JD and I wanted a super casual place for lunch on Saturday after a workout and he suggested here and it was the perfect spot
Haha However since moving to Tempe and discovering a good dozen other sub places I usually would try something else these days huge Silver Mine Subs fan
Based on reviews of this place I foolishly expected it to be cute
on a good note there isn't a bad seat in the place you can see the field pretty well from all over the stadium
Somehow the place just doesn't fit but the food is good and inexpensive
Great place to bring out-of-towners who love pizza and want to check out old town
This place has really good and really bad aspects to it
For some reason I have let the place on Adams in downtown with national reviews as my local benchmark for pizza and I keep finding places just as good if not better and Humble pie makes my list
Yeah it's overpriced it's that kind of overpriced place for a good day to day burger drive through in and out
I always used to come for lunch and was never disappointed so thought it would be a good place to meet a friend for drinks and a little food after work
We saw the movie on a mid-week afternoon so the place wasn't overrun with tiny little disease carrying mis-guided missilesStill the there is just something about the place     - Screens are kind of small     - Theater itself smells like a school bus and not in a good way
But since the golf is such a great value and people will continue to flock to this place in droves I don't see them needing to hire people with personalities any time in the near future
My first impression was that it was a good place to watch sports
For us it is the best go to place in the Valley and I have lived here a long time and eaten a lot of great food
I'll probably still stick with Tokyo Lobby but this is a good place for non-sushi lovers aka people who only eat the cooked stuff
A great place for a few pints while crawling but may not work as your ultimate evening destination as it's very quaint and tends to fill up rather quickly
If you want great Italian do yourself a favor and head to Roma Garden
The coffee unlike a lot of other places was relatively good and we were seated asap - a plus but I just don't see going back
But it's also a great place for lunch take out dinner and Sunday breakfast/brunch
It was awkwardly placed in the middle of the room as in not against a wall and worse yet the outside door/entrance was behind the headboard bad feng shui if you're a believer
Would be a great place if adults didn't have to pay since they can't do anything anyway
To have a place make really good pizza AND good wings is a rare find
This is a great little place to go and spend a romantic evening
I am not saying this is a real bad place because a great thing about it is when I go to work @ 330am
Blackberry Yelp - restaurants nearby - helped me find this great little Thai place
Kazimierz = * Awesome ambiance and decor* Extensive wine it is HUGE and takes me forever to pick something*Comfortable seating I LOVE the couchesThis really is a great place when it isn't busy
Otherwise great place that is a must to check out
So I tried Los Taqitos for the first time today after seeing it on Diners Drive Ins and Dives like so many others and I'm always on the lookout for good Mexican places
My friend and her husband told me about this place since they know I1 love a good cup of joe 2 am a bit of a health nut arguably contradictory with #1 I know and 3 like to support local/family-owned businesses
Prices are decent; location is great; food quality is good with a nice twist; ambience is chic and trendy; completemary valet parking is a plus but don't forget the tips
There are many places that seemed to be well liked on here for NY style pizza but this one deserves a great rating
Bottom line great pizza with out the crazy waits or prices at other good pizza places in AZ
Smoothie was also surprisingly good for a coffee place
Great staff great decor and atmosphere very reasonable prices convenient and fast service
Realistically though it is still a great place to get some boba tea
Very warm and a great place to drink your Sunday away with an all-day happy hour
This place is great for everyone big groups a romantic dinner a place to eat while the kids run on the grass or a dinner with a client
Cutie waiters might be a good place to look
Really though great place sit on the patio if you can
If you want an intimate date night or a great place to relax on a best-kept secret of a patio with friends this is your place
I have a feeling that the same people that love Einstein's are the same people who think Applebees is amazing and Walmart is a great place to shop
One of life's greatest pleasures is revenge and I can't think of a better place to dish it up than at Defalco's
The inside of this place was very cute -- very funky coffeehouse
Otherwise to sound all west coasty this place has like GOOD ENERGY
my brat was tasty but the onion rings i was sorry i wasted my money on tney were sort of doughy and really didnt have that good fried up taste i usually adore onion rings but I just didnt think this place was any big deal
I think this is more of a guy's place since a guy would actually consider a good hot dog a real meal
The steamed veggies aren't soft but have a nice crunch to themGreat happy hour offers too - - if you can find a place in the bar area
Anyhoo whether you bring your own polish or not this place is great priced very reasonably conveniently located and has great service
The intimate dining room with exposed brick lends a casual and laid-back atmosphere
It's an adorable place- sleek and cute 60's mod bright and cheery
This place really has a great Scottsdale/Southwest/Sexy vibe
I have never let me stress NEVER taken the time to write a review on any place - good or bad - so as to prevent any of YOU curious lookey lous from wasting your time going there
It's a great place for someone like me who just wants to eat sit it a comfortable place and read and enjoy the free wifi
I'm sure they have started to notice how much I come in but I am not looking for that good ol' regular patronage relationship with the place and so far no one has tried to push it which is nice
That being said the place is really a unique jack-of-all-trades because it has something to offer everyone also the food is good or something
The atmosphere is neat and casual with outside seating
If you're a regular at chain restaurants you'll probably think this is a cute place call me a snob whatever
the place is cute enough would def seem like a fancy date night place if I were still in college
I've heard good things about this place from my sister's friends notice I didn't say my friends and I've always been curious
This place had all of the above and was in a good location so I was excited to get a pretty cheap rate through Egencia
There is a good wine list and overall it is a place that I like to sit with friends and hang out
The introduction promo is a good deal especially if you have never waxed before and don't want to fully commit until you have tried the place
The fitness part of this place is great machines are new and plentiful
Great bar area as well we really love this place
I will go back though because the chili was so good I would like to give this place another shot
This is just minutia and doesn't change anything the place is just that good
It's been really difficult for me to find cool places to drink at and dine at in north Phoenix if you know of somewhere cool please please please leave it in the comments for me but I had a good time at Blue Martini at CityNorth
We too rented the cellar last week - and what a great dimly-lit little nook that is with the Southwestern fireplace wine collection and all
I've heard of too many good Southwestern places in Phoenix to be in a big rush
People wise it's a great place to meet after work or to start a night out
A good place to go for an after dinner cocktail from Houstons
The food was great very fresh reasonably priced and it was a perfect atmosphere for families with kids or even a date
There were two reasons I did not rate it a 5 star;  1  the restaurant is clean and nice looking but a bit crammed with tables - in addition to the conversation I had with my family I got to enjoy the conversations of the people on the tables to the right and the left of me and  2  Although the prices are not bad - the place is not cheap $10 to $14 not including tip and tax or so for a meal including a glass of kool-aid and it sort of seems like the sort of food you should be bragging about how much food you got for the money
In Summary great food great kool-aid a decent atmosphere
the menus are placemats and could use a good soak in some bleach or something
An absolutely perfect place to enjoy a glass of wine with good company
She says she swears by the place and you really get a good amount of tasty food for your money
It's your typical fast casual Mexican joint and judging by all the chain stores/restaurants in the area this place is a good bet you'll get a good meal
Overall great food at an affordable price with a welcoming atmosphere
So besides the whiney man and semi-attentive server the food is absolutely delicious and the atmosphere is great
Sry if this sound snobby but hopefully this provides good frames of referenceI sat in the garden outdoors and got a grilled cheese and tomato soup $10 and a chocolate brownie with walnuts and strawberries $7
Searched for a place with good happy hour deals and food and this one was in more than a couple Best lists
If it weren't for the multiple bites we both got I think I would have rated this cute place a 5/5
watching a game and hanging out  good place
good atmosphere lots of tv's and big beers
Great place to sit at the bar and watch the roaring pizza oven on a cold Arizona winter night
This would be a good place to meet up with friends and share a pie and some good wine
First off It's a very relaxed atmosphere and the customer service is great
So it's a good place to hone the 21-playing skills without hurting yourself too bad
Good thing I'm getting too old for this place
Great place to eat a good pizza but there are some things that need to change
You'd never know there could be such good food in such an unassuming place
Good time because of the dude I was with otherwise this place is lame as all hell
Not the most friendly staff and the cost is kind of high for a place like this but its pretty dang good
To get a good sense of the place we started with the Tapas plate
No sick mayo mixture that other places use to cover up bad sushi
Went to this place based upon good reviews my wife read on Yelp
RrrrrrrrrrrrPositives is that this place is a magnet for cute girls which at least can take your mind to a happy place while waiting in purgatory
Happy Hour is a good time to come and it goes until 630 where a lot of places stop at 6
It's a very family style place so it's great for a family outing a quick date or even just a hang out
The atmosphere and staff are really great here
This is one of places ill always bring out of town guests who can't find good Mexican
I'm usually pretty forgiving but this place was not great
The atmosphere is relaxed and it's a bit brighter inside than I expected
Great atmosphere great employees great food
The food in this place is always pretty good
This is a cute little place with great orange mojitos
I just must add a note that this place was incredibly clean and organized goodness it was a dream They have two dollar lattes yes it is true
I know it's kind of lame but I still like CD's and this place isn't bad
Having an empty beer mug while laughter and casual chat take place can be frustrating to say the least
Great experience for my first time in Scottsdale where I expected every place to be impossibly snooty
Granted my expectations were very high considering several people told me how great this place was going to be
Luckily our friends saved us a place in line so it wasn't that bad
It came off a little crowded which means one of two things the food is really good or the place that is merely convenient and cheap
When it cools down here in AZ the large bay doors at the gilbert location will give this place even greater ambiance when they are opened
As a displaced Texan I'm still searching for a good meal
It's a small place where you can sit at the bar and watch all of the good eats in their beginnings
Too bad because I think there's potential for this place to be great
Bottom line Good sports bar and fun place not the best place to do business
I've Been here a few times before this places is pretty good I like the Jerk Chicken I also had The Curry Chicken and The Curry Goat was not a big fan of the Curry Dishes and I do like Curry
The only thing In my mind about this place that is a downer is the prices 12+ and I didn't get full other then that it's a good place to check out
Benihana wouldn't be my first choice for sushi or for going out at all really but if you have a special occasion for some friends it would be a good place to consider
Tried this place out recently and had a great experience partially because of the great service we received
I really feel that this place is given it's fair shake it's a great little Thai place no frills
I imagine it makes a good hangout place for a younger crowd
I don't think it's the place for hip people to hang out or maybe not great for a romantic date but it is perfect to bring your grandparents on your birthday or your dad on father's day
There are so many good places in the valley I just won't go back
Overall great place to go with friends to sit chat and catch up with life
Lets start out with the cute little log cabin feel this place is seriously rugged and worn but in the greatest old western town kinda way
While others feel it is a place for the good old boys it is none the less one of the absolute prize steakhouses of the world
So I love to come here and relax and enjoy the peaceful atmosphere with a good cup of joe
They have a good website and retail locations all over the place
I frequently shop at the great Lee Lee market and have often eyed this restaurant I thankfully had some time while waiting for some watch batteries to be replaced at the adjacent jewelers to eat lunch at Hop Kee
Good place to go when your in a hurry and don't want to go to the big box stores
Good place for a business lunch or casual dinner
It's got a great atmosphere and it's always consistent
-Looks like a fast-food tex-mex place but it is a casual sit-down full service restaurant
ConclusionNot quite as good as Paradise Bakery but better pricing and atmosphere
Either way Grimaldi's is a great place if your driving around Scottsdale Rd
Great place but my experience could have been alot better
Duma and Stan felt that Phoenix was a great place to set up shop because they saw an opportunity to share their food with a market that was craving a downhome Creole and Caribbean cuisine
They have diet RC on tap and unlike other places they have a good syrup to soda proportion instead of cheaping out so it tastes like soda should--not just like fizzy Phoenix tap water
Not a bad place - I am not knocking it but there's really nothing great about it
It is one of those places where the pub is a perfect setting for good friends to catch up and have a drink; they the staff don't try to entertain you that is left up to you which to me is a good thing
Then you can decide which place is good for your kid long term
I guess my issue was that yes it was a good pie and good atmosphere and I enjoyed it but it didn't blow my socks off or change my life
This little pizza place has great food for cheap
The W is a great place and they will accommodate you for whatever you want
The answer is yes i am going back to try some other stuff on their menu the service was quick and the waitresses were nice the food was good especially the juices and the atmosphere was whatever
The patio is great and my preferred place to sit
Fortunately our dinner was phenomenal   The setting was really romantic - we sat out on the patio right in front of the fireplace and the moon provided just enough light for the meal
I like the fire pits outside the lobby facing the golf course - great place to relax and sip a beverage
Pity I thought they had a good concept and atmosphere seemed a lot more casual then IPic
Overall I would go back here and maybe see this as a good place to take out of town guests with the exception of the long waits
The atmosphere is nice great friendly staff and good food
This buffet doesn't offer as many food choices as those of Pancho's or Camarones but the food the service & the price are all good & it's a comfortable place
Tasty food in a casual low-key atmosphere
Also a women working at the place next door greeted us as we passed on our way to enter Daily Dose it almost made me feel bad for not picking them or something
I was initially planning to take my lady to the highly recommended Quiessence in Phoenix but when a freak dust storm interfered with our plans we found ourselves detouring in Scottsdale and Yelping for a good dinner place
You can find some good deals on the place through group discount sites or sometimes just by calling the hotel
Great atmosphere great chips/salsa great 'bulk' food service
You'd never really guess that this place is so great
You know you're in a great place when it's located in the middle of retirementville and it's still hoppin' after 11pm
The atmosphere of the entire place is one of joy and good humor and mingles smoothly between contemporary and rat pack era
But what's atmosphere without good food
This place is large party friendly good for all ages and only parties into the night on Fridays and Saturdays
Didn't know much about this place initially but it was great
So if you are just looking for some good indian buffet with out service not a bad place
Overall a great meal my date thought it was one of the best places she had ever been to and I'm clearly going to have to pay more attention to Kristi's reviews
My absolute favorite sushi place in the world has a similar atmosphere or lack of atmosphere to be more accurate but the food at Hiro is just not that great
The place looks great and the staff is great I wouldn't dismiss it but Republic doesn't get a fervent recommendation either
This is a great place to eat breakfast lunch and dinner
The staff here is very good too they are super helpful if you aren't sure what you want get things out quickly if its not packed check in on you rare for a counter order place and they are just good all around
The place is not that great looking from the outside and never having been inside I can't comment on that -- but I would never get take-out from here again
Hula's has a great atmosphere that is both relaxing & enjoyable and it also plays consistently good music which adds to the fun
Whataburger is a good place to get a greasy burger
If you like heat and a great relaxed atmosphere you will like breadfruit
PIZZA toppings - the meatballs and sausage at Oregano's is great and they get mad respect from me often pizza places neglect making their own meatballs
The rooftop on the Clarendon is a great place to hang out no question
Great place to go with co-workers or to watch a PAC-10/Big 10 they have both sets of helmets at the bar  game
I recommend this place for anything from hanging out with friends or family to a romantic dinner
Maybe it's because I first tried this place on a day I got some GREAT news but I REALLY like Tea Light
I've experienced the greatness that is Tea Light twice now and I can honestly say this place hits the spot in my world
Fairly dim inside a good place to forget about the sun on a summer day
Good cuisine always places a huge focus on two things 1 using fresh high-quality ingredients; and 2 combining these ingredients in a simple thoughtful way that maximizes the individual flavors think the whole is greater than the sum of its parts
Sake Bomber probably isn't your best bet for sushi in Tempe and certainly not in all of the Phoenix Metro Area but its a good place to go when you want to mix it up in Tempe maybe you've been going to Sushi 101 every night or for big groups
I've been hoping for a place with a simple good BLT for a long time in this area and they've definately got it
Highly suggest the place great atmosphere several tvs so you can watch the game sit outside and enjoy the nice Phx weather coming our way or in the dining area
The recent addition of the sushi bar has been great too we never thought the place was lacking anything before they remodeled but they've gone from strength to strength
Great lunch specials during the week as well this place has it all
The place was packed the entire time we were there and you could tell that it was just a great place to be
There are now plenty of good places to eat in downtown Phoenix and I will now frequent them instead
The fun vintage atmosphere combined with an excellent wait staff good mix of cocktails and a great fairly diverse menu makes this place a 5 star in my books
it was a great lunch although I have heard this place gets elbow to elbow at night and on weekends
I hope this place holds up as it is in a great location and have a very big building
There is a festive garden party atmosphere and the setting was one great for that romantic spot that one can still hear a conversation over the house music and dinner guests
I wouldn't say the food here was super excellent this is Arizona after all and there are some great Mexican places but it was good and the prices were reasonable and the service was prompt and cheerful
The couches are comfortable and its a very relaxed atmosphere
This is a great place to catch a sporting event or bring larger groups
Even though not as flavorful as a Puka Dog this place does a great job even though I am looking for a Puka Dog I must divert and try not to use it as a reference any further
but this is about as good as a chinese-american take out place you could ask for
Good solid food good solid service fun and yes touristy atmosphere and some of the nicest people working there that you'll ever meet
None of the seats are bad and the place is a palace
This place is great to hangout on the late nights out
The staff was super friendly the service was quick and the place is very cute and clean
This is not good for the waistline but should know before you come that this isn't a place to stick to your diet
Overall though North is a cool place good food good service and if you order an Arnold Palmer you get the lemonade in a nice little carafe--stay classy North
Inside is a somewhat typical looking sushi place a little dated but with a nice enough wooden sushi bar and some cute japanese accents geisha prints sake bottles row of cute fortune cat figures
They are actually the only place where I sometimes ordered the day's flavored coffee; for some reason their flavored actually tastes good to me with a little half and half while most places taste like fake-flavored coffee overdone on the additive flavor
With most restaurants in the area being Mexican this is a good place to get quick Chinese
I was really excited when I saw that Big Daddy's would be opening up by Shea and 101 ever since Bad to the Bone at Scottsdale Promenade closed a couple months ago and Scottsdale was lacking a good BBQ place
But if that's my only gripe with the place then I think they're doing good
I would say stay away from this place unless someone else is buying or you have a coupon the burgers are good but the time and money expected at this place is not justified
That said my mouth and stomach convince me that this place is just too good to give up on
Service was very good too but with more servers in the place than patrons; it better be good   I'm still lost
The atmosphere is on the casual informal side which I like
It had coconut which I normally don't care for but it was a good compliment to the slaw to make it unique from other places
After seeing the decent ratings and the fact that my last two favorite sushi places have shut down I decided to get dressed really cute and my boyfriend and I left around 3 this afternoon to try out the happy hour
I've never really had a bad time at Boulders and it's becoming a go-to place to hang out with a large group of people
Great place for fresh salad and a nice variety of soups and other buffet foods
There is a small covered outdoor patio that we have yet to try but looks like it would be a great place to eat
In summary if vegetarian or Kosher pizza pasta and sub sandwiches are what you're after and the idea of fish meatballs sounds good to you then this is the place for you
I have found a great place to grab a great burger surf the web and watch sports
The place could use some updating but it is a great local sports bar
My wife and I had our first date at china doll on 7 ave and Osborne it is long gone and that place used to be packed with Asian folks and the food was not very good
Also while the Kobe beef was good other gourmet burger places have cheaper options which are superior
I came in a few times and was continually impressed with the friendly staff great coffee and overall great atmosphere
I was just in Thailand earlier this month and thought this would be a pleasant place to eat to remind me of the great food I had there
And if you're looking to save some cash Local dines has a great deal for this place
Four stars because The atmosphere was pretty nice attentive staff a little too much especially on trying to get me ordering food they brew their own beer my total check wasn't too bad
I guess my overall impression is that Loco Patron is a great place to meet some friends if you're broke on a Tuesday and you're hungry and want a beer or two
They are then placed on a bed of a lemon risotto that has the perfect balance of freshness from the lemon and comfort from the cheesy goodness
The only bad thing i have to say about the place is that it seems like most of the servers don't know much about the beers they are selling
ReviewPros-good quality grade SUSHI the truest I've tasted in all the valley-portion size-good variety in happy hour & reverse happy hour menu-good ambiance and social scene-good locationCons-poor replicas of some Asian dishes evident in the tonkatsu and Korean Kalbi-price vs valueIf you've heard that this place is expensive you heard right
I like it here because it's a great place to come with the family and have a beer
As it currently stands it is still a great place to enjoy a splendid meal and casually talk away an hour or two
awesome little place to taste the real korean food - cheap and good
Thank goodness this place is within walking distance because if I'm going to get my martini going I won't be drivin' anytime soon
Its a cute clean space and the man running the place greeted me warmly and inquired if it was my first visit
I am pretty reasonable and it it were my place I would accommodate customers more so if a person who prepaid it would make sense you accommodate them with a reservation however Binkleys stance is we have your cash now let's fill the place with people who are yet to pay and the idiots who prepay can wait till lastThis place may have great food but great management with a ficus on service and customers
I must say that this place was pretty darned good
The whole place was full upon the doors opening great sign
The staff were terrific the place was spotless the owner walked around and spoke with all diners it seemed like everyone was a local and the food was great
The prices have risen at least since their website has been in place but it's still a good deal the $5 Spot is now $5
A great place to grab a Big Breakfast in a nice atmosphere
I think the place delivered a great value on the meal a fantastic selection of nearly every Cajun delight you can think of although I have yet to spot the elusive Muffaletta on area restaurants' menus and a great dining experience
It was good but failed to make it into my top 5 which is a disappointment cause of the reviews I was thinking it was a sure placement
All right time to give Wildflower some props for good customer service - their founder contacted me apologized indicated that more high chairs had been placed at the location told me he spoke with management and addressed the issue and invited us to try again with a gift card
He found a bad connection in one of our outlets and replaced our GFCI outlet
- Clean decor - Tasty homemade food that's on display for visitors to see - A good family-style atmosphere that greets you the second you walk inside
Great meal overall they also have a really good happy hour I haven't taken part in but I uploaded a picture of the menu so everyone can see before they go any place that has BOAT LOAD OF WINGS on the menu deserves a visit in my book
The place looked like it was going to be great according to photos on the wall even Bobby Flay has met the owner I just hope he didn't taste the food
So this place is legit good service and good food
This place is very cute kind of up on a hill so you can have a great view if you are there around the time the sun sets
Thank goodness for the hooks lining the underside of the bar; this is the kind of place where you don't want your purse sitting on the ground
Not a bad place to watch a game but what's with all the Viking fans
Everything is great about this place great hangout with buddies watch the game and just need a good beer
My only complaints are the casualties of visiting an awesome place the wait for seating and for the bathroom
We had about a 20 minute wait before heading to our table which wasn't bad since the place is small and it was after 6 on a Sunday
Overall a good place with friendly service and a decent selection of sushi options
I love any place in Olde Town that looks great and has a great crowd but it doesn't take a strippers pay check to hang out
However do to the fact that they have great food waitresses great bathrooms and a pic of Jimi Hendrix at the bar this place easily gets 4 stars
Food was good Even if not overly memorable and the atmosphere felt a bit nicer than a normal sports bar even though most folks were wearing sports themed clothing and yelling at the TV
My dad and I decided to try Great Wall because he had heard many reviews about the place and everyone insisted that you had to come try the Dim Sum
Too bad because it must have been a hoppin place a few years back
It used to sadden me that I couldn't enjoy the great flavors LTC used to offer but I've since found a handful of other places that offer equivalent if not better dishes
The patio is also great in the evening when the place is lit up with christmas lights and you get the view of the beautiful water features and scuptures
But if you ever want to time travel this is a great place to start
I checked this place out originally based on the reviews that I had seen here on Yelp and I must agree that the food here is pretty good
Great food atmosphere and beer selection however a couple details are missing
Other than this great place and I will definitely be returning to play that strange washers game
All in all if you're looking for great Indian food this is the place to be
I'm SO happy to have a new breakfast place that is cheap with good portions and menu choices
The prices are very good too so if you need to feed a family on a budget this is a good place
I must say I am very picky when it comes to food and this place is great
But if you're looking for a clean decent VERY inexpensive Chinese restaurant with good food and friendly service this is the place
I'll be suggesting this place for it's great pizza good service and It's good accommodations for bigger parties
THE GOOD A great place to kill an afternoon or evening
I think that for such a casual place the prices are pretty steep
My girlfriend brought me here for lunch yesterday and talked about just how good this place was
The only thing that I can say that was good about this place is that they didn't use the same interior designer that Blu Burger does
Placed on top of the sushi it is very good definitely try it
So many places get stale so quickly with low turnover of stock NOT the case hereI also consign here and their terms are quite good
Great ambience for a drink but the pizzas pastas are not that great
I just had the water boiled fish and it reminded me of this great place that my dad takes me too and their Chung Spicy Shrimp is fried and spiced to perfection
Sportsman's is a great place to get your wine tequila scotch etc
I highly recommend this place it's a great regular spot for your Thai fix
Overall the service was friendly the food good and the atmosphere enjoyable
Picazzo's offers a casual yet sophisticated atmosphere upon entering their establishment
With the finest ingredients Picazzo's takes great care in delivering the best in atmosphere and dish
Overall this is a pleasant place for get togethers and have a good time with beer wings pizza and pizookie
It really is a great looking place open industrial hip
Great service fun atmosphere and the best bruschetta in town
Its a very chill and nostalgic place to hang with friends and have a great conversation
My stepmom was telling us about how there was this really great Vietnamese place that she knew of way back-- about 15 years ago-- and she wasn't even sure they were still open
To tell you the truth I was hesitant on trying this place again until I took a peek at some reviews and found people had lots of good things to say about the place
I'm all this place has to be good if the older crowd is here
This place was a good place to be seen if you get my drift but the food was just like everything else
This place is different the way the food tastes is different than most taco places but it wasn't bad
However the cuteness of the hidden door quickly wears off if you happen to be there on a packed night because it's placement causes a TON of traffic jams and pushing and shoving as people try to go back/forth from expansion to OG bar and try to make their way from back/front of OG bar and people trying to watch the band get sick of shuffling around the disaster
I am usually a little apprehensive to try a chicken salad at a place that I'm not familiar with but it just sounded so good zatar spice currants pine nuts arugula tomato and lemon vinaigrette
The top floor was still busy but not too bad a good place to perch and people watch the drunkards below trying to stay on that dang mechanical bull are quite entertaining
Good big TVs and plently of seating especially since the place was barely half full and a shuffle board table which I love
this is a tough bit I have shopped here with girls who literally will hide good finds in other places of the store so they can come back and get them later most of the time they are gone
For the guys this place is a pretty good place to go the deals on shoes are unreal nikes that are $100
All in all not a bad place to grab breakfast
Otherwise it's a great place to go for brunch or lunch has a full-fledged menu with tons of choices and you get a lot of food
At the same time the decor and the initial impression was like walking into a bar as good as any as one might find in New York City this place has cool atmosphere in spades and just for that it is worth a visit
I enjoyed the atmosphere and the beer was good
The only other place that I've had a peanut butter shake was at this diner in Carlsbad CA
They are much better than many other fast food places and well worth the few extra bucks you'll pay for a good burger and fries
I had a really good experience at this place
Phoenix has some of the best pizza in the country - this place isn't the best in town but it's another prime example of great Phoenix pizza joints
One think I really liked about this place was the fact we had such good service and a nice place to sit down and talk at
Saketini has great service wonderful chill atmosphere and a large food/drink menu
Great place and would love to try dinner here if I ever visit again
It's slow and a bad value and it only is useful if you're going to go from a place within a few blocks to a place within a few blocks
I'd just heard too many good things about the place to not at least give it a try
and Secondly because the Botanical Gardens Party last year was GREAT
Keeping it real there are so many good burger places and I'm glad fat people with no taste go here to save the good ones for me
If you want a cheap pie to couple with some cold beverages the this place is a good bet
We were looking for a breakfast spot close to our hotel and the reviews for this place looked good
Other than that the place has nice decorations and good bread with slaw
I love good ol Mexican food but this place has missed the mark
Bottom line  What started out as a fun birthday celebration was completely ruined by the unprofessional and bad judgment of the employees at a very average place with average food
With so many great places in the valley I wouldn't waste my time here
Overall I would need another try at this place without the Groupon deal and see if they can execute more flavorful food
The reviews on Yelp were good and I was told by a fellow steak lover that if I wanted a great not the best cut of steak at a reasonable price then Texaz is the place to go
I know and I guess this place knew that because there was plenty of the hot melty goodness all over the steak and plate
If you are looking for place with some good meat with good prices and excellent service then this is the place for you
Otherwise if you feel like splurging on good food this is the place to go
BTW it is great to find a place that welcomes kids without being a true kids restaurant
Great atmosphere AMAZING food and a highly textured and blended femininity and masculinity decor
The atmosphere is great food tastes good and the servers are very attentive
Maybe it's just me but I've tried lots of other gelato in the valley and elsewhere and can't find anything that tastes as good as this place except Italy of course
So I read about this Texaz place having great Chicken fried steak
Does it have good food for a good price quick friendly service and a good casual atmosphere
A great neighborhood place to hang out but you can also drive through
We found this great place thanks to yelp and decided to give it a shot
I really don't understand how this place is as bad is it is
The place looked promising and has a cute patio area but we won't be back - someone's not watching the store
Would like to see a little more variety on the taps but other than that Dukes is a great place to catch a game
I am quite surprised because I usually do a good job of being informed of great places and I've probably eaten at 5-6 other Italian places all within 5 miles of that place
All told a great neighborhood place to eat if you live or work in the neighborhood
This is a fantastic place mostly to get takeout or delivery from rather than eating at the ambiance is lacking a little but you can't have everything but the food is always great
They didn't have a good selection of draft beer at all weird for a place that calls itself a sports bar
Great place I guess if you don't expect much and have traditional dress shirts
Best of all the prices are great with a Ninos menu too and a nice atmosphere with the music alive and an occasional Fotbol game on the TV
The staff were quick with recommendations and never left us hanging and the atmosphere made for a great dining experience
Love their patio area with the tvs--it's a great place to watch football
Very cute place that you just don't expect to be here in a commercial complex
It was a Friday night April 6th Mom was in town for the weekend and wanted to take her to a good Mexican place I had been to many time in the past
This location is near the barn where my daughter leases a horse and takes her riding lessons - it's a great place to hang out while I'm waiting for her
Great food nice friendly people pleasant atmosphere
Prices also are good and actually cheap compared to other sushi places I've been to
I expected great things about this place and was disappointed - maybe because we came for lunch instead of breakfast
The service was ok - nothing great - we had a table of 6 and it was the tail end of lunch so the place wasn't busy
Walked in and was impressed this place was very nice looking on the inside very clean and some nice Chicago memorabilia giving me some good memories of my time there
I'm glad to finally have a good middle eastern place in the area
- Hunan cuisine is quire rare in the valley and while I won't say that Szechuan Garden is great Hunan cuisine it's certainly quite good definitely different
Not sure if anyone working there was actually Greek but it makes for a good show and adds some to the atmosphere of the place
One day sooner than later I'll venture back and dine in even if it's a bit crowded and take in the atmosphere and a great meal
Not really authentic but probably a good place to go when you wanna watch and ASU game and crave nachos
Being that this hotel is part of the Marriott family you would think it would be a good place to stay in for 7 weeks
On the weekends the line does get long but it's a great place to sit on the patio and if you smoke which I don't however there's the back patio where you can still do that
The patio is incredibly cool and a great place for a date inside is no less cool and is awesome in decor
Considering how crowded the place was service was not too bad and certainly could have been a lot worse
BWW is one of those places where you have to know what they are good at and focus on that
I can't say one bad thing about this place but also there isn't anything spectacular about it either
Good for lunch or early dinner since this place closes early
The pizza is really good but there is only a hair's difference between this pie and other great places around Phoenix
I cannot say enough great things about this place
I've been to plenty of dive places and had a great dining experience and considered it more the fun for it Lolo's original location in Phoenix comes to mind as it has a certain fun and well-managed charm inside but this was dark dingy and unpleasant
One night I saw the owner cleaning the place without gloves and she was nice enough to give us a to-go parcel without cleaning her hands great example to the servers
But nothing against the place itself because they had great service and were genuinely friendly
Goodyear gives the fans great places to watch the game
I know this restaurant can make pretty good New Mexican food but something has changed at this store - either the manager is cutting corners by saving money on spices or she is just incompetent because this place is capable of better service and better food I just haven't seen it in a long time
I will definitely be back and I'm so happy I finally found a great place to go for routine waxing
The good Great service nice decor in the seating area very colorful n peppy place okay food
All in all good place to catch a few drinks and appetizers but not so much for a tasty hearty meal
Greetings placement balloon for kid all happy time to drinks good
I went in here around 5 pm on a weekday there was no one in the place that should have been my first hint that it was not going to be a good experience
The service is great and the atmosphere is quiet a bit dark so no one should be sitting at the table with sunglasses because that would just be creepy
This is a great place to watch Sunday football
We live in the Arcadia area and this is a great indoor play place
Also a great place to go if you have multiple age children because you can see the entire play area from the numerous sitting areas including a small cafu00e9 that has wifi and you can bring in outside coffee yay
Also this is a bad place for first dates because it takes a really really remarkable person to tear your attention away from the food
00 and your paying something for the incredible glass that it comes in and a really great space and atmosphere
The music is great and the overall atmosphere and vibe is stunning in a low-key kind of way
The service is awesome and it's a great place to chill among good friends and good drinks
I heard Windsor and Churn were opening up and I always love to check out a new place especially when it is owned by someone with a good track record
This place is beautiful the staff is happy always a good sign
Oh yum this place as the other reviewers have raved is great
Over all good place and we always go here before a show
Enjoy the dark cellar dimly lit by the fireplace with The Cure Coldplay and other great bands rotating on the cd player
I have a fantasy that this place turns into a great joint to bring clients for lunch and a solid place for food and ice cream
I want this to be a great place but I would settle for a good place
I hope that one day it is that place but it will take some time for the bad taste in my mouth to go away
That being said this place would be perfect to start your night out in Old Town with a few drinks and food that is not bad
This place would be a good starting point for the night nothing more
I went back because the food is good most times and the atmosphere is great but I have lost my patience now and not going back
It's very large place with a lot of great foods available
The place here also has a really great little cafe upstairs and staff are located everywhere and seem to be friendly and helpful
I did not expect we could find such a good place for hanging out with friends
This is a great place for someone like me with a big appetite
I practically shut the place down but all good things must come to an end so I reluctantly headed home
bumped into this place while we were trying to leave the mall in search of something good
We were in the area and i had heard great things about this place from my boy Nader A so I decided to check it out
The place is a great little deli with great service and awesome food
It's a great place to meet casually over breakfast
I live 5 minutes away from Ah-So and love having a good sushi place so close to home
But when your looking to go on a nice date or double date this place provides the perfect atmosphere great wine selection and bruschetta your whole table will be raving about all night
I will give the place another shot perhaps it was just a bad day
I want be returning and I'm disappointed that all of you think it's so great the place doesn't even have atmosphere to like
I must say I love me some good sweet potato fries and this place did not disappoint
I can see why Guy Fieri gave this place such a great review on Diners Drive-in and Dives
I really just can't say enough good things about this place
reading on here that some kitchen reality show had stopped by and saved this place would be great
Wow this place has gotten a LOT of bad reviews
Lucky for the rest of us these other places also try to have good service
A friend told us about how great this place was and we decided to give it a try
Aside from the kitschy tropical decor the place has a comfortable feel and the Mexican standards are executed as well as any abuela
But back to the review in my mind I go to a place to eat good food and this was not what I had in mind
Simply put though I love this place because it is consistently good
From the BBQ Pork Plate to the Ahi Tun Sandwich to the BBQ Pizza there are a ton of great options that you would never expect at a Burger place
The used games are often pretty good and when they aren't they're easy to return and receive a replacement or refund for
so yeah not a family gathering kind of place no romantic cells no classy not trendy upscale
You will find great pieces and items are amongst this whole place with lots and lots of choices and options and the prices are really reasonable
They have some good combination burritos that aren't significantly more expensive like the ones you might try to get at other places
While it is very good I can think of two places off the top of my head that are better neither is located here in AZ
Good pie and place overall but not up to the hype
First of all it's a great place with great food and great BEER
I think this would be a great place for a drink or dessert out on the patio but that's it
I think people are intimidated because it doesn't look like RA on the outside or other flashy type of Asian   places here in AZ -  If this place was in LA or SF or NYC I guarantee there would be a line out the door every hour - because of the good food at good prices
I also like that the dim sum is made to order and good -  Plus they just added noodle soup and it's as good as any place I've ever eaten at in LA or SF
We will continue to eat here once a week because of how nice the family is that owns the place  the good prices and the good food
It's a great place to go for a romantic getaway OR to have your wedding
It's truly a great place and definitely worth a stop by
Good place to start the night if you are going to hang out in old town
I'm very happy to have found a nice clean place to tan with good pricing that's convenient to get to as well
This place gets busy at lunch as the business people around know where to eat when it's good
I've heard a few of my cop buddies say how good it is too and they weed out all the bad places pretty quick
I've always found the coffee really great and the vibe of the place is very cool
While it was St Patrick's Day it's not like this place was packed out with annoying patrons so I'm not sure what put her in such a bad place
I loved the atmosphere the service was good and this is just a really nice alternative to all the chains restaurants around
The atmosphere is chill with seating outside the decor is quite modern and cheery and with froyo priced at only 35 cents per ounce this is a great place to hang with friends family and/or your pet they have water bowls outside
How about stopping all of your investment and hard work on the Australian theme and going with a good food and comfortable atmosphere theme
We really liked it the place the food the ambiance was great
if you do have to wait sit at the bar or by the fireplace; you can't complain once you have a drink in hand and the scent of the fire mixed with hot food and good energy
But the atmosphere is great I've never been to a Potbelly's anywhere in Illinois and I've been to many that did not have the kindest and most reliable customer service
YC's is a great place to hit up if you have a hunger gap that is bigger then a normal restaurant can fill
other than that this place is a hit for good Italian
Bartenders are always friendly just a good place to chill with friends
The ambiance is really cool and comfortable and looks like a great place to sit and chill
$5This place doesn't have much seating so it can fill up quickly and you can end up waiting for awhile so it's always a good idea to have a back up plan
We checked out the website and menu and it looked like a great place for a quite meal for our small group
I guess out of the choices available nearby it is not a bad place in comparison
Great find as I would never have tried this place without Yelp
Definitely a great little intimate place to hear live music and up and coming bands
The ambience was great the people were great the bar keeps are super cool the wait staff is very friendly and on par and the food was really really good
This place was so good I had to ask twice to verify that it really is a chain
Bonus  They offer black napkins I think a lot of places over look thisFactoid  Great place for big parties and they have oddly perfectly set tables
Well I want free wifi I want a place to sit and eat good food I want all of the latest bestsellers the classics and maybe listen in on an ongoing presentation toward the back of the store
Oregano's your food is still pretty decent and the lively atmosphere is great but you won't catch us dining here anymore
where the pizza isn't very good either but they earn 4-Stars from Yelpies anyway with their super friendly & appreciative staff plus so much other good food out that you don't have to think much of the pizza to love the place anyway
As a fairly new connoisseur of Greek food this place is pretty good
The ambiance service and food make it a great place for a fun lunch with girl friends or a lunch meeting
But if your looking for good BBQ you should definetly try this place
I had recently replaced the tubes carefully with the help of a professional the buzz dd not improve so having heard good reviews Ziggie's was my next resort
After a debauched weekend I thought this might be a good place to get back on track and eat a healthy nice vegetarian meal
The food was still reasonably priced authentic tasty and in a nice relaxed atmosphere
It has to be one of my favorite places to eat & have a good time
If you are looking for good food & good brewskies you gotta try this place
Ok so this place has amazing service even better food a great wine and beer selection and has a perfect ambiance
Service is great though but be creative with your menu because there are like 100 places that show football around here and most have specials that make the joint worth going to at least
Huzzah for good times in a time long long ago at a place not very far away
A good friend let me in on this place as it is kind of hidden in a strip mall
Brown is great about letting you try a sample before you place your order
Until then this is a good place that with a few tweaks could be great
The dark quiet atmosphere and great service of the place is a big plus to me too so I say eat-in if you can
This place is great for breakfast lunch and dinner
This place is truly about fresh natural good-for-you ingredients
Noy only because the hair experience was bad but because the front desk gal made a bad impession of the place even worse with her nastiness
So overall a good place to watch the fight as the crowd is into it
+ A great happy hour+ Great atmosphereUnfortunately these great plusses are often overshadowed by these annoying minuses- Long wait for a table even when several tables are empty- Rude/clueless hostesses- Rude/clueless manager- Crazy overzealous water misters that soak your table outdoors- Most uncomfortable outdoor seating
Fuchsia is a great place and I am so happy with the service we've gotten
For a traditional chinese delivery place I think this is about as good as it gets in Phoenix
I'd recommend getting the combo platter that comes with fried rice and an egg roll I substitute and get a spring roll in its place - they're really good
So we didn't have a good experience the first time we tried to go but we really wanted to give this place a second shot
Its a good place that is semi close to downtown if you need to get your sushi kick for lunch
This is a great place to take anyone over 50
I have been to this Landis a few times over the last 10 years or so and it's a pretty good place to get some help and they have a good selection of brands to choose from
but is it really good date food to chew on crispy crunchy bread loaded with crap that falls off all over the place
The only reason it gets 3 stars is I never seem to crave ZTejas; it is simply my go to place at the mall that has good food and a great happy hour
Large place indoors and out cool artwork on the walls free wi-fi ask for the password slip when you order and good background music
I like everything about this place especially the rotation of the menu and I believe thier concept is a great one
The staff is great to chat with the atmosphere is great also - it's always busy with college kids and families and I love it because they're open so late on the weekends
Groupon ALWAYS has a great deal for this place $5/per ticked plus a free drink I think the usual price is $12
But overall a very friendly inviting place; service was lovely and attentive and everything was great
Erin a prior reviewer said she didn't go to a place called Sportsmans - the image of a sports bar kept me out of here for 7 years after I moved into the area - until I was searching for a good place for Spatlese the 1st Thanksgiving I was cooking for my new family
There are a couple of TVS for sporting events and whatnot but this is meant more for background sites than to be that place you go to hear the commentators during a game I don't get the impression this place is meant to be the hangout during the game but a great after game spot
It will also be a great place to go with girlfriends before lunch in Old Town
This is a place that you must bring an out of town guest to and if you really want to be creative with how to propose marriage this would be a good place to heck it's good for any occasions other than break-ups and affair confessions
Their's a soda bar and booths and tables and chairs and it's a great family friendly atmosphere
This location is right next to another great place Lucky Lou's and the service was quick and friendly
I love a place where I can check good for everything
The cook came from the back to say hi and tell us what's good everything- I don't think he was lying the guy in front was excited to tell us about the family that owned the place and the type of food they serve
Great service and a fun atmosphere due to the musc played
Maybe its not the best place to put something this good online but if you have a chance to check out the hush hush fight club type drinking lounge with 10 rules outside of Citizen Public I highly advise
With so many other good places nearby she still chose Coco's and I think we were the only customers under 65
I can see that this place would be a good family restaurant but I also didn't think the prices were all that great in relation to the quality of the food
One good thing I do have to say about the place is that the decor and ambiance was really nice and the rest of the wait staff were friendly
This place isn't bad nice alternative to BK and Mcdonalds not to mention Fillibertos
Also not a good place for people as there is only one bench and very very minimal shade
It's hardly a crummy place on the inside - the decor is cute and colorful
The drinks were pretty weak but the food was pretty good and the atmosphere is fun
Plus there is a lot of great places in walking distance
Good atmosphere great food friendly service
It's too bad this place is so far away from me
Ate here yesterday for lunch and despite all the bad reviews of this place I went anyways and my experience was actually pretty good
All in all Fair Trade deserves its place as being synonymous with the Downtown Phoenix young professional scene and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who wants a laugh great brew and relaxing ambiance served up together
This place is so cute and yet still manages to be trendy
If i had a special occasion i'd prolly visit here again but when i'm needing a thai-fix there are other places around town that have equally great food without the upcharge
All the guests said we picked a great place and a couple of my friends are having their weddings there
If you're looking for a casual place that is consistently good head over to U
Mesa- immigrants pawn shops & used car lots-boring & redneckyGilbert- great place to if your Mormon or into another cult
Walking in seeing the pretty lights everywhere thinking to myself hmm this is gorgeous maybe it won't be so bad this place is hip and cool
the ambience is great- zen like and calming
i will be returning and thanks to my fellow yelpers on recommending another great place
This place could be great if not for the owner
The atmosphere was good as usual and we had a great time with friends but come on Kaz we expect better
RnR strikes me as a casual urban place to meet up for drinks and a bite to eat
This is a great place to visit any time of day but I'm excited about having a new good place I can frequent after or during a night out
First time in the place had to leave to go buy wine as we didn't know there was no alcohol but still ended up having a really good meal until the end
The music was good but the atmosphere was missing something
The place was lively and had a great buzz
I hope if you try this place you get good service and the $16
I am an ice cream freak and this place is FREAKIN GREAT
The atmosphere is great the waitress was amusingly surly
All of the pizza is great and the place has a great vibe
The chicken in Black bean sauce from this place is bordering on sublime and they do a really good job with fresh live seafood vegetarian dishes and various types of Chinese barbecue like Char-Su and Spare-ribs
Great place for lunch or casual supper a welcome alternative to all the chains in the AZ strip malls
I've eaten here several times all on business trips read expense account and overall it's a good place to entertain clients
Not an everyday lunch place in my opinion because of price but a great treat
This place has potential and service is still great
We just need some good company in this place
Bad for your cholesterol but good for that happy place in your belly
Pros Good place to WATCH sports lots of TVs           Friendly serversCons Food and beer
Every time I go in this place it's always a great experience
The bar area is a great place to have a meal and watch a game
I remembered thinking that this place was not very good flavor wise compared to Cafe Lalibela so I have been going there instead
00Service was very good the place is modern and very clean
Besides the great restaurants here that everyone knows about the Ranch Market is a great place to find anything that you can't find at Safeway or what you can find at Safeway but don't want to pay an obnoxious price for
So for AZ standards this place is not bad
Guys if you want to wooo your wife and have one of the best romantic nights even for just visiting one night this is the place
If you're a girly girl like myself and love cute things or if you're looking for a place to get great gifts for a reasonable price stop by Charming Charlie
Overall I think this is a great place for a date night or a quiet dinner with old friends
a great little date place if you want someplace unique to share an intimate drink
It could have been a little warmer thoughOverall great place
Good but not great food great desserts great atmosphere great for medium sized groups of friends who want to have a night out to catch up with each other's lives
We always wanted to go this place due to the fact that many other Hong Kong Chinese restaurants are really good and it seem like it was like a great authentic Chinese food place to go to
I will make this my NEW place to get good Asian Fusion at a great price
After finding some great reviews of this place on yelp I decided to give it a try   and I must say it was just as I had heard; the young female hairdressers do their own thing while the older male hairdressers have their side of the shop funny
When I moved to Scottsdale and had to actually drive to the place the parking did kinda suck but it's not as bad as everyone else makes it out to be--there is a small lot behind 4Peaks
This place used to be a great place to just hang and spend the morning on a weekend or weekday
My company sends people here for training I am going to tell all my co workers to pass the place up or just don't tip the horrible waitress Jessica with the bad red hair
The atmosphere is cute and low key fits in perfectly nestled in between LGO & MJ Bread/Tammie Coe Cakes
Being a FOX restaurant the design of the place was great
this is pretty much a good place if you are into new Current Indie Vinyl
Our service was what I expect from a breakfast dinner or The Waffle House the waitress was FAR to casual for a place like this i
I had a great time getting takeout from this place
I liked the place and the food was good but it lacked personality and sometimes took quite a while
I live right down the street so I thought of Perc UpThe new owner Jackie greeted me as I walked up to the restaurant and seeing my confusion at the dueling signage for Perc Up and Wy-Knot right next to each other explained that Perc Up was no more but reassured me that I was still in the right place if I was looking for some good breakfast
If you're looking for a romantic place for next Valentine's Day or to propose to your sweetie or whatever and you're not afraid to spend some extra bucks for the experience I highly recommend this Morton's Steakhouse
I had the great opportunity to be placed on the far side of the property where it looked pretty sketchy at night
I've heard great things about this place and eating here did not disappoint
Ahwatukee might not be on most peoples list of places to visit while in Phoenix but after tasting the great thin pizzas here at Florencia's
You can go and wait hours at those hip pizzarias that cater to the $$$ but if you just want a great place to chill have a beer or a glass of vino and amazing pizza
the only thing I can say good about this place is that the cheesecake is made fresh in house and is very good I got a strawberry cheesecake and hubby got the oreo which he and  I both lovedthe strawberry actually has strawberries in the mix its not on top like most others
Even the kids menu has been good my kid has tried the cheeseburger and the chicken nuggets they all come with drink and dessertIf you want to go to a nice restaurant to have an excellent time and great food I recommend you this place is superb and the service is always friendly
The patio is great and the restaurant is open air with breakaway doors/walls which adds to the relaxing atmosphere
My only criticisms  based on just this one experience are that the AC was underpowered and there was an odd choice of heavy drum-beating dance/lounge music playing overhead very un-French and not suited to the romantic small bistro general atmosphere of the restaurant
Meanwhile there are all of these other tables just sitting empty all over the place and we are trying to have a romantic dinner with people constantly walking in and out of the door right next to my chair
It is a great place to just sit with friends have a drink and talk
I wish there was an option for negative starts because this place was THAT bad
Not to say there isn't amazing ceviche in other places or even great ceviches at trendier spots
When it's 115 outside getting a lovely air conditioned place to sit drink a beer eat great food
My only complaints really minor- Good yet Cheap Eats Only place to eat at the hotel without driving somewhere was the hotel restaurant
If you want real Mexican food at a great price this is the place to go
Not a horrible place for lunch - their food is good - but their recent price increase and changes have pushed them over the edge of a place that's worth going to
Its a great place for lunch but only if you aren't in a hurry
While the selections of jeans sweaters shoes and purses are OK I think this is a great place to come for dresses
Have to say as much as I liked this place before they definitely took all the good parts and expanded on it
An overall good place but a few bad experiences here
I had a rather bad experience with this place couple of weeks ago
Middle of the Road  nothing really the elements of this place are either very good see above or rather bad see below
The drinks are served in mason jars and the whole place feels and looks like you're in someone's home having a great meal
If you happen to be in the area this is a great place for cheap booze
You can see from anywhere in the place and the sound is good
It is too bad because wouldn't it be wonderful to have a place in our city that gives excellence in both the experience and the education
Yes the decor is good yes the inventory is gigantic but there is nothing like poor service to turn me off to a place
Reliably good food and reasonably priced considering location atmosphere and quality of food
I do not think a place with such great service can be so lacking in their actual product
All the good places in the food court have closed along w/ most of the autonomous units for mid-mall snacking have closed or become some lesser version of what they were
We found this shop while lookin for funky places that have great one of a kind home decor
The food and coffee was good and my most prestigious critics my kids said it was better than their favorite place back home
Good breakfast great service and nice neighborhood eatery atmosphere
Now I wouldn't normally go into a place like this it looks a little tired but man do they do a GREAT job
If your one of those that have to have the cute little waitress hanging on your every word this is not the place for you
But if you like a little place where the service is good drinks are strong food is great and the atmosphere is spot on then this is a great place to hang
It's the realization that sometimes the best things in life are pretty simple cold beer good food and good friends in a slightly off kilter atmosphere
We all have those iconic food moments in our lives and one of mine was in a small noodle shop off the Hibaya subway line in Tokyo where they made noodles by hand scraping noddles off a huge block of dough with a pastry scraper into a large wok of boiling water with huge clouds of steam rising up into the cooking area they also made one hell of a pan fried Gyoza that I still dream about and I've spent the last two years thinking how great to have a place like it in Phoenix
I appreciate the classy casual atmosphere of this place
What a great space with a great menu staff and atmosphere
My only comment about the place which is not really negative was that our server as great as she was would be better at a stuffy restaurant
Like I said its not the most glamorous place but it does represent good Thai food
Truth be told I've never even been there for dinner because I'm always hitting it up for lunch I don't even take advantage of any specials I just think it has a great lunch atmosphere
Since the other breakfast place they had was only a cafe that served baked goods I decided to come here to have a proper breakfast
Most of the restaurants were chains or mediocre places that weren't offering any good food
It's really a place to find just about that strange gift for that one friend who has everything or likes a good comical joke gift
This place wrote the book on bad costumer service
This is s great little place off Central in Phoenix
It is a great place to swing by after work for a quick drink and convo or dinner
This is a great place and much needed in this area
I wrote a less than stellar review about this place some time ago and decided that my prior awful experience might have been a fluke and as I love great BBQ decided to give them another go
Many a U of A/ Arizona games are played to wild crowds of alumni that frequent here and it is always a good place to catch a Suns game
Nice atmosphere - classy casual just enough energy
This place is really really good but I didn't ooh and ahh after my first bite
The drinks are good and so is the atmosphere
Great place the staff are all warm and I am greeted by everyone even the valet guys
The common area of Kierland Commons is a great place to sit and rest your weary feet and enjoy the water features going on around you
All in all this is a great place to come relax or go exploring and have a great family outing or a 1st date
I only wish Phoenicians could experience a great donut which will never come from places like Bosa Krispy Kreme or Dunkin Donuts
The bottom line if your looking for a chic little place that always has a a great vibe
Whether you're on the go or you want a mellow atmosphere to read talk drink coffee make friends eat good food D'Lish is your new hang out
If you're looking for a huge chain style place like Brio where the food isn't bad with decent but sterile service and a room big enough to seat hundreds this isn't it
The good thing about Majerle's is that minus the service food and cost it is a great place to watch sports
This place is SO GOOD and I'm not a huge fan of all off Fox Restaurants concepts
The kitty was quite the chair hog for such a small furball but that cat owns the place and is damn cute
What it is a store for lazy people or people who are super busy a good place to stop for either a quick prepared mal to heat up at home or all the fixings to make your own
What it isn't a place to get great produce local food or high end stuff
Great hotdogs exactly like you remember them Italian beefs that could possibly rival places in Chicago
Wasn't so bad but next time I will bring a book so I won't look so alone LOL  Great place for a good lunch
We had bough a groupon for this place and wow it was such a great buy
I went with my husband and we were both amazed at the food atmosphere and great service
He was very knowledgeable and created a laid back atmosphere to enjoy a romantic evening out
all in all a great time was had by all at culinary dropout i really wish i could give this place 3 and a half stars but i will definitely be back next time i'm in scottsdale
this place is great in theory but i honestly only ever come to buy a gift for a girl friend
BUT if you are there to watch some sort of sporting event on tv and yell at the top of your lungs for a good solid hour or so this is your place
This place is pretty good ~ I like my tacos American please
This place was a Papa Johns back in my prime days at ASU but they did a great job of redecorating to make the place seem less greasy
I have been fortunate lately because most places that I've taken the time to eat at have been very good
the atmosphere is versatile as well good for a quick bite or a nice date
The question for this place is how far from bad is it
First off atmosphere was great dim light but not too dark interesting but delightful music selection eclectic but themed art selections hanging
Between 1998-2004 Chase Field was a reasonably priced and reasonably full place to enjoy great and in the case of 2004 far from great baseball
Overall my impression of this place is good and it is definitely tucked away inside a non-descript strip mall across the hospital keep your eyes peeled if you're coming here
This place also has a full service bar which is a good thing for some place like this to have
Just had dinner at this Outback Steakhouse what a great place I love their food and the service is just great
The drink came out tasting great and was not ridiculously over-sweetened like most places do
I've eaten at many korean restaurants around the country and this is a really great place
I'll admit--I tried this place solely because the reviews were overall very good and the fact they were closing added a sense of urgency
My friends and I don't venture out to this part of town too often but we were craving Mexican food and a quick search of Yelp on my phone brought up this place nearby with a generous amount of good reviews so we figured we'd give it a shot as well
Healthy but great tasting food excellent customer service and great atmosphere
To be honest it is not going to be awarded stars for ambience or an ultra-romantic setting
Good food and a welcoming atmosphere at reasonable pricing that can appeal to a wide range of palates
In a place this small it is impossible to have bad service
The place is very casual with some personality too
My husband and I agreed that this place could be really good as a concert venue that sells food and drink as it was a good place to see the show last night
I love City Scape but if you're in the mood for a great place with good beers and drinks either go to Tilted Kilt or Arrogant Butcher
Friday's Front Row is family friendly and a great place to take the kids
It wasn't busy the ambiance was relaxed and the overall atmosphere was very comfortable
Bottom line this is a great place for a date a friendly get together or even lunch
And the service was pretty good for an order-at-the-counter type place
The BF liked the cucumber rolls I didn't try them The gyoza were clearly generic gyoza but at least this place had good sauce and they were crispy which was pleasant
Overall this place was great and I will most definitely be back with as many people as I can introduce to this great place
The atmosphere is hip and ultra-modern yet remains relaxed and comfortable
- Kobalt is not a wild crazy party place most of the time but it is one of my favorite places to sit down and have a great cocktail or martini
The atmosphere is great because it has WINDOWS
Great place to day drink because you can enjoy the fact that there is daylight and you're not just sitting in some dank dark windowless cave
I hate saying that because I really don't want to say anything bad about the place but there's not much to see or do but chat with the friendly bartenders if you're there by yourself
And thank you if you made it to the end of this Kobalt is a great place to go with friends or make new ones I find most people that go there are receptive and friendly except for the snotty 20-something's that think they're hot but they only show up on Friday nights
Keep up the good work and thanks for making your place feel welcoming and warm
Place has a nice ambience but can be rather claustrophobic service is good somtimes and absolutley terrible on other occasions
If I weren't married I imagine it'd be a good place for a date remember ladies 13 y/o
After listening about this place so much finally I found a good occasion to visit it
I've only ever been able to actually PLAY bocce once at the Vig and that goes for both locations but it's hard to hold that against the place when the people watching is so good
Like other places in town the food is American Bistro with good deals spendier items and always solid savory flavors
I feel like this place caters to out of towners that have no idea what good mexican food should taste like
Great place to have beer and watch a movie with your significant other
I can't say enough good things about this place
The place wasn't too crowded yet which was good because that's another reason for all the attention
The service and atmosphere were very good
Rustler's Rooste is one of my favorite casual dining places
I haven't been here in awhile but I went to the Costco in the complex and it reminded me of how great this place is
I would love to give this place 4 stars the atmosphere and service was very good
5 star place - maybe even 5 star on good nights
This is not a place you can go and drink beers and margaritas or even get fresh guac but they serve some DAMN good tacos with amazing flavors
Taking that into account if  you love plants the weirder the better here is a good place to see plants you've never seen before
This place is plenty large enough for you to have some great craft brews and seasonal stuff worked in there to keep your regular crowd coming in and still feel like they can get something new from time to time
The atmosphere was great we went on a thursday night and had a great time got seated fairly quick and the place was crowded and upbeat
Overall this place is charming not too pricey casual but nice atmosphere
We ended up at Ticoz last saturday night with some friends what can I say the atmosphere is great
The atmosphere is casual and just noisy enough to give you a sense of privacy
If you want a cute place to bring a date and to impress by shelling a lot of money for a little payback afterwards this is the place for you
Not the best place to catch a game but the bar wouldn't be that bad of a place to sit and watch a game
The service was good even though we had a 2 year old eating rice and miso with his bare hands thus throwing rice grains all over the place
Overall great place for whatever you are in the mood for
The service is unusually good in a place like this and  the food comes out fast and delicious
and this place is just as good as anything I had there
I used to say Pho Ao Sen was my favorite and don't get me wrong it's good but this place is REAL GOOD
That place is run with precision and the owner is not only very knowledgeable about their fresh good food he's one of the nicest guys I have ever met
Is the quality the greatest no its not but when you consider the concept for this place its a place for many people to be introduced to sushi to make it quick and make it affordable I think the quality lives up to anyone with reasonable expectations and for my meal to be $9 with a coke it was pretty reasonable also get the combo not just a soda soda is $1
The service is great and the atmosphere is outstanding
The place is cute service welcoming and attentive but not pushy and food was impressive as well
Very casual and modest place all they care for is giving us good food
Our waitress Nicole was EXCELLENT some of the best service I've had in a long time and the atmosphere at night is great in the Phoenix Center
- Italian Beef Sandwich Could use some Improvement - Maxwell Street Polish Dog Not Approved- French Fries As good as they get- Burgers  Have yet to try but they look like the one thing that this place does rightChicago Style Italian Beef sandwiches don't seem to have much competition in this town
The place was a cute converted home on 7th street
That's always a good sign of a place to eat
Somehow the Scottsdale park workers keep this place pristine despite the tremendous amount of use the park getsGreat combination of walkers bikers fishermen kids and dogs
The service is really good they are good about giving you good portions without charging you for each and every sauce you ask for like some places
Their tzatziki is the best around many places in the valley don't do as good a job
Is it a reliable place for a good meal well-served
Great deep dish Chicago-style pizza wonderful fresh salads and a great atmosphere make Nello's a local staple pizzeria
Great atmosphere friendly servers classic family owned diner decor and amazing food
This would be a great place to take a girl on a date
Always a great place to hit up when in Old Town
The servers were a quick and cheerful lot and the bar looked like a good place for singles
It's also a great place to take out-of-state guests who just blew into town from one of those cold climates
This is a great place to go when you want to do something different/special
I'm a very indecisive person so this place isn't good for me- I dont know what the hell I want in a roll so I just ordered a Philly it was on par with the rolls you can grab at the grocery store deli
I would love to go back tho this place the ambiance and the service were great and the food was amazing in my opinion
This place is for those of us who fell in love with Pat's Steaks and can't afford to fly to Philly when we get that urge for a giant slab of yummy goodness
As a new place it's important to generate positive buzz with quality food/drink great service and pleasant atmosphere
Great money saving tip is that you can take a very short walk to Pinnacle Peak Patio for Happy Hour food and local brews in a great fun atmosphere
Overall if you are in the mood for gelato this place wont let you down unless you are a snob and there is a good chance of that given the usual crowd in oldtown ;
One of those cute independent places that I wanted to give a great review to but ended up having a couple of issues
Accredited beautician license laid back diverse atmosphere cheap martini specials great music list that night AND a simple manicure repairing my desert dry cuticles
If you want good food and atmosphere go to Cornish Pasty Company or even Fibber Magee's both just a few miles west
A good place to relax with a beer and watch some sports
The place is tiny and quaint too and as always it's great to support a local independent business
The problem was that was about all that was great about the place
It's a good place to get over the top wasted if you have a ride home of course because the super loud music lends itself to booty shakin and obnoxious behavior
It's a little fancier I'd say compared to other sports places but still casual
Waitresses in tiny outfits serve you beer and food and pics of sexy bodies women in sports gear or holding a football let you know this is a great place for dudes
But honestly if you love watching a game good beer and drink specials and want to nibble on some buffalo chicken dip this is your place
I give this place 5 stars because I don't know of any other places with good Philly cheese steak sammiches
You need to make sure they are clean obviously pressed and in good shape or they won't take them but I find they tend to take more stuff than someplace like Buffalo Exchange
It goes to a good cause- an animal rescue place and you get a tax donation receipt make sure to ask for it though
I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for high end good quality stuff at good prices compared to what you would pay at department stores or boutiques or looking to clean out their closet
This was a great place to visit -- excellent class
Green is also a great place to people watch
Even with a good coupon this place was not worth it
As the name suggests this is a great place to drink eat and have a great time among friends
If you like good customer service regardless fo what you are driving again don't bother with this place
The food isn't good enough to venture the annoyances of dealing with this place
It was a good thing we had directions because this place is kind of hard to find its not very well marked or visible from the road tucked into a slightly residential area in downtown its location is an old phoenix house
I'm in Phoenix for work right now and of course I looked to Yelp for a good place to eat
But it was recommended as a good place for a group and I had 20 business people to feed
Ladies don't try to be cute up in this place
We ordered our pizza and drinks; the pizza was good but there were still flies all over the place
a lovely place to have a quaint romantic meal
I spent a great deal of time looking for places myself and my girlfriends would enjoy for our winter escape to Phoenix from Minnesota
Enjoyed the eclectic atmosphere and the great adjectives my server used to describe the wine
This would be a great place for a quick appetizer type of start
In fact the only good thing about this place so far is that it was cheap
This is a great place to find a consumable gift and the shopping bags and packaging make for free gift wrapping
They also had a great coupon for the place from the Desert Ridge Back-to-school flyer they received in the mail; Buy one entree get the second free
We left to go shopping and returned over two hours later to find this place still empty but we sat down after the great reviews and my over-powering love for Russian and Middle Eastern food
I actually placed my order before I even sat down with the cute young bartender
I already know how we're celebrating Valentine's Day -I thought the place was a bit small but cozy and a little romantic
I love their outdoor seating out front - it makes a great atmosphere
They also serve a very good root beer on tap the mac and cheese was some of the best I have had and I liked the atmosphere
Yes it is in a run down strip mall but most of the great burger places in America are in dives
This place seemed to good to be true so just to make sure ive gone back several times
I love this place it's no-frills but the food is great and the staff are totally and I mean totally unpretentious
we arrived early which was a GREAT thing because around 1030 am the place was packed with the elderly and overweight soccer moms ingnoring screaming and ill-behaved kids
I have read great reviews on this place and the night we were there it was filled with guests - not an open table
I don't see any other place around using Calpico & infused Sho-chu quite as extensively as Geisha and the results are actually really good
If you are in the mall and want a burger this is a good place to go
As an out of towner I would compare this place a little better than IHOP or Dennys but not as good as Lumes
So overall this place was really good and I will definitely be back to try other menu items in the future
The front desk clerk was swift and efficient the tech that did the work was courteous and seemed to know what he was doing and the replacement glass looks great
Very charming and intimate lots of nice regulars me included tables and a cute fireplace outdoors smoking-friendly patio another private upstairs patio too
The prices are good for the quality ingredients atmosphere and service
The atmosphere and service were great but the food was just not exciting
Fast Eddie's is one of those places that you forget how good it is until you go back
And i saw lots of asain peeps eating there as well so it's probably a good place
This is an excellent place to go and have a feast of great dishes
The staff was very friendly and upbeat great atmosphere
Then just get your cocktails downstairs at the marvelous Citizen Public House because they're just as good the money goes to the same place and you can have a discussion with companions without shouting
Nobody had any complaints as far as the food went the service was good and the atmosphere was nice
This place is great and I would recommend them to most
Other staff members were excellent as well making us feel like good friends who were welcome instead of out of place visitors
The atmosphere was pleasant and the food was pretty good for the price but there was nothing that really jumped out at me
There are a few tweaks to be made to make this place right and I think the location concept and space build-out are all good
This is a great place to come for Happy Hour
This is a great place to take the family and friends
It's a fun place to eat the service is real good and their food is not bad
The cutest filling station yes I said filling station cuz that's how old this place is turned coffee house in the oh so trendy hood along 7th Ave

I had a Groupon that was expiring and thought this would be a great place to start our day
The beer's ok priced no more or less than other places and it's usually a good time
The salt broth was pretty good but there wasn't too much else in it like the other places I've been
This place was pretty good so I'd recommend it if you were to come with a regular sized group
Service is friendly and the atmosphere is casual
It's just such a fun place and I've never had a bad time when I've gone- it's kind of impossible I think
I honestly don't understand why this place gets such good reviews
All in all a great place to grab some sushi
To be fair I do avoid this place on Fri and Sat nights most of the other nights though it is a great fun place to hang out
It's a great place to watch any game as they have two levels filled with TV's and plenty of seats
Definitely a great place to stop after hiking North Mountain
Pinnacle Peak is my top choice for a beautiful place to experience see & admire the great beauty of the Sonoran desert
It's weird that so many of the tables were 'Reserved' even though this place was pretty dead but they gave us a great small table in some comfortable chairs in a corner
A great place for very reasonable prices
I recommend the place to anyone who has great style and love great service
Great atmosphere but being on the vertically challenged side I didn't really like sitting on a high stool and the table was a little low for the stool
Shrimp Tempura roll good like most of other place Tuna Sashimi we can taste the freshness yum
Hands down this place is popular and busy but I've just never had that great of an experience at any of the locations
ProsBusy and lively atmosphereHuge portions hopefully to take homeWell pricedGreat for familiesConsAlways a waitFeel like watching 'The Biggest Loser' afterwards
We didn't have a very hard time finding the place which seems to be a common complaint and stumbled upon a cute little converted house with a group of five sipping beers outside as they waited for a table
After entering the restaurant and approaching the hostess I was startled by the number of empty tables in the place and pleased that we'd soon have some saucy ricey goodness to sate our hunger
Dim lit antique chandeliers wood flooring and Victorian-style wallpaper make a perfect atmosphere for indulging in ice-cold draft craft brews or a great glass of wine
This is not the place for you if you're out for a rambunctious night out with a large group but if your looking for a chill and inspiring atmosphere and conversation with a few friends over some great drinks
The atmosphere is quiet and space inside is small but rarely crowded with great patio seats for enjoying the cooler months
I have neutral feelings about BBQ but this place was great
The crab cake- VERY good the spinach dip- also good but similar to most places and the seafood sampler- oysters and shrimp were good but the crab was obviously frozen and tasted horrible
A little lighter in my pockets- this place is pricy but Overall a great night
I had seen good reviews on this place I was hoping for a new Mexican hole in the wall but this is not it
If you're young single and want the downtown experience this place is great
Buca is a great place to host a large group of people
All around a great place to go; and I have since 2001
All in all a solid ball park that is a good place to take in a game
The outdoor kiosks to buy your tickets are great if there's a long line but honestly this place is always so well staffed that even when there's a crowd there are plenty of kids working the booth and no real wait
I fell in love with the resort years ago after visiting the grounds at night - gorgeous lighting lush greens and great atmosphere
Once you get in it is a pretty decent arena - not the greatest that I've been to but it has a bit of character the seats are good nice view from most places in the arena for hockey and the acoustics were also excellent for the concert we saw the night before
The atmosphere was comfortable and casual
If she doesn't wear herself out staying up all night making that Pho I think she'll do a great job of refining the place listening to the patrons and modifying things to get it right
The place offers a wide variety of blonds ales stouts and everything in-between as well as specialty beers you don't usually find in most bars 3 Philosophers never heard of it before so good and all the Rogues
The cute atmosphere is sprinkled with artwork and dimly light
At first the place seems to melt into the other cute houses around it but the people outside smoking music and lights coming from inside separate this place from the other houses
Being a divier place I decided to be one of the guys and have a Bud Light like the good old days I don't remember it being that gross before
The atmosphere was great for playing I spy
Summary great place to go for drinks and atmosphere sit at the bar but make your dining plans elsewhere
The food is always good the service is always a little lackluster but without blame as those guys and gals bust their backends considering how busy the place is always and the prices are really fair especially considering portion sizes and happy hour specials
Sadako the owner has a place that is not only serves great sushi and rolls but does so at a fair price

Like I said before I love Fox Concepts and I usually dont rate places very bad but this place was not good and not what I was expecting
When I saw this place pop up along the everyday path home I had such great hopes
And since they don't rush you out of there too much it's a great place to wait for your sugar daddy to show up and take you shopping
Good atmosphereVery well lit with tasteful decorCheap foodVegetarian friendlyWe had the veggie burrito which had potato beans grilled veggies and maybe cheese
But any place that makes me drive a pretty good distance and wait in line just for breakfast
The ew Lux is a great space once you think you've found a quiet place to crawl into and observe the crowd you'll discover that the building just continues and continues

However all the good things about this place were wiped out for me because of the actions of one of the employees
-not related to the restaurant but in a great area Old Town Scottsdale nice place to walk around in the evening
They have a fantastic selection of cheese and it's a great place to try boutique cheeses

In terms of both cuisine and ambience Quiessence is about as good as it gets in Phoenix
I don't have the budget to have the luxury of eating out often but when I'm wanting to treat myself to something good and used to like a place like this I can't see paying big bucks for what amounts to 25-cents worth of rice noodles and four shrimp
I lived in Thailand for several years and I USED to like Thai Rama simply because they did a great job making meals that reminded me of why I fell in love with Thai food in the first place
The place is trendy and chic and you can get away with dressing up; however like just about any place in Arizona - casual works too
Awesome place so many good looking female servers and they had the one with the biggest chest cleaning the tables
I would go to this place again for the great hot view and the burgers
I heard that there are only two good Breakfast places in phoenix Over Easy and Matts Big Breakfast
And while it still retains a wonderful atmosphere and good service I do have to agree with many recent reviewers that the prices are now out-of-line with the quality of the food
This place is still absolutely delicious with a great atmosphere and charming decor
Liberty Market is my favorite place to go for good coffee good food good people

With no shortage of good Mexican food how does a new place stand out

All around it's a great marketplace for Arizona
It is cute that desserts are placed at the top of the menu in the beginning but they should put the dessert at the top of the bill too
The place is dark loud but good people watching place
The bar regulars are a dashing group and it's a great place to go if you find yourself wanting a drink and happen to be on your own -- not weird at all to show up at the D&C's bar alone and Shelley will serve you dinner with all the white linen and formal touches you'd expect right there at the bar
I know it's a great breakfast/sandwich/diner type place but had never thought of it as a burger destination until the Yelp mobile results
Great hotel in Central Phoenix for a stay-cation but not necessarily a place to stay out of town and without a car
The atmosphere is great the produce prices are very reasonable and the civiche is excellent
This is a good place to come and read your paper and sip coffee
When I try a new restaurant I pick a dish that I can get at almost any restaurant of that type eggplant parmesan at Italian places pastrami on rye at delis and so on since it's usually a good litmus test for the restaurant itself
This place is full of integrity and good food too
As expected the new place is cool decorated wonderfully and is a great spot to visit with friends or swing by to pick up a quick order after work
Let me start by saying this place isn't BAD
This place isn't consistently fast or consistently good - and on multiple occasions they've even been out of key ingredients early in the day
Still the tortas are good and they aren't so much over-priced as other torta places are under-priced
The prices are not small but the quality is good and the place is local
The place is VERY tiny and outdoor dining should be taken advantage of in good weather
The food is great slow cooked atmosphere is awesome in the old brick house with art on the walls
The stadium is VERY handicap-friendly and the shopping/restaurant area around the stadium is a great place for pre and post game activities

It is not the place for a romantic dinner but to grab a bite of quick not-so-spicy Indian food
We stopped at a great breakfast place on the way very close to the park Cracker and Co
Service was fair to good atmosphere was just OK
I really didn't think this place was all that great
Pros - Gorgeous hotel very close to the Old Town area friendly staffCons - Because it is next to a new club there is a VERY loud thumping bass sound until 2 am and then the ensuing sounds of bottles clanging at 3 am during cleanupOverall it's a great place to stay if you can get a room that's not on the club side of the hotel but the night I stayed I was sandwiched between the club and a battle of the bands on the other side
If you're looking for an intimate place for you and your loved one to enjoy imaginative and well executed meals
I don't really care how good the service is or how fun the atmosphere is if a restaurant doesn't have good food most other categories don't matter
Ugly tasteless interiorBad music and music systemTired staffThis place needs to either have a complete redo or it needs to close
Then again there might be enough people around these parts with really bad taste to keep the place going

What else is there to say beside Chipotle is the most consistent flavorful quality clean good service best place ever to eat a quick meal

The food is great and the prices at that place just can't be beat

However this is a great destination for the dreaded contingency of entertaining out-of-town guests to the semi-urban desert if one enjoys- Seeing more varieties of cactus agave and yucca that one ever thought possible- Realizing that the desolation of the desert is relatively quite well-populated- Getting a more educational sunburn than would be acquired by lounging by the pool- Seducing a Passport Unlimited cardholder for card privileges for B1G1 admission- Enjoying the heartwarming story of triumph of the herb garden with portions of cast both familiar and unfamiliar succeeding in growth against all climate-related odds- Thanking the spiritual guide of choice that we brought bottles of initially frozen waterFor $15/head the value proposition unless it settles the blood pressure raising so what do you want to do
Place is clean selection of bagels is great although I wish there was a wholegrain
The place looks great and is in a great location so you are thinkin' you are in for an amazing meal

So if you are looking for a relaxed place to have a drink with some locals this is your joint

5 hours for a pie Cibo is the place to be and almost as good
The food was good and our waiter was nice but I'd rather spend a chunk of change and go all out at The Olive Garden
In short Great food amazing portion size for the price 50's atmosphere CHORIZO GRAVY
The decor is fabulous and the place is uber cute but the bizarre seating patterns the ridiculous pricing for things like lemonade and 2 inedible FUCKING tomatoes and the overzealous garnishments of inedible chopped parsley and dry rub were too just much
How can places like Saigon Nites and Cyclo not make them as good as me

I'm a pretty big fan of live music and whoever is booking shows at this place is doing a great job
It's a medium sized venue and they do a pretty good job of finding bands that will fill the place but that generally won't sell out in 10 minutes
But if you are looking for a decent deal and to have a drink and good enough sushi this is the place
from the cups which are made from corn and totally compostable to the friendly down to earth staff that makes the place a truly great coffee spot

The concierge is definitely helpful as they recommended a good breakfast place though there are others and helped us get a tee time at a discounted rate at a nice course nearby

Fantastic massage  great atmosphere  and I felt very comfortable
There was no place for the staff to hide and compare notes on bad tippers or to avoid refilling your water
The food is always great the atmosphere is comfortable and the staff is incredibly friendly
This place is great for drinking with friends
It is well documented that the food is great match that with attentive crisp knowledgible service and hip yet comfortable dining room and this place rocks
The atmosphere was nice laid back and stylish but the food was not good
good atmosphere with nice people sitting about outside on the picnic tables
I had heard a lot of great things about Trader Vic's happy hour and I've always wanted to stop in when visiting the folks but it seems like something always comes up or someone always suggests someplace else when I'm in town
I am so excited that I found a great affordable place to get some regular pedicures while I'm here
Also it should be duly noted that the place is incredibly hip and beautiful and drink prices reasonable two great Four Peaks beers on-tap
And if there is someone in your group nervous about eating sushi this is a great place to take them as they have so many different options

The outdoor seating is nice good ambience
All around a great place to enjoy some laidback Mexican food with family and friends
However if I'm ever in the area again I know you really can't miss with this place with it's great atmosphere excellent service and solid food selections
They only bad things about this place are that it can be a little pricey and they don't offer garlic as a burger topping
One good thing about large chains is they make you really appreaciate a place like this
Overall had a very nice last night in Scottsdale and I would recommend this place for a nice romantic elegant evening out
I can't hate totally though because being a younger guy it can be a really good networking place so I'll go back
The place itself is VERY casual but who cares
They have a fabulous happy hour and offer great specials on the weekends if you're looking for a place to chill on the patio and drink/eat the day away
I enjoyed the baconburger I ordered - quite a stack with crispy bacon two patties plus the condiments I ordered lettuce tomato pickles ketchup mustard and the fries were great - thicker than at most places adequately salted and a nice balance of softness and slight crispiness
Cute little place inside people are always friendly and the food is delicious
I was so excited to see a hip Vietnamese place open no MORE dirty tables and bad service when I feel like Vietnamese food
You know only good cheap food comes out of those places
The expensive fancy kind with the perfect cozy atmosphere the cute China and classy menu
The front patio is surrounded by a hedge under a large pine tree which is a nice place to be seated if the weather is good
The service was as good as the food and atmosphere
I think this place would be suitable for a date celebration or when you just want good thai food
Great atmosphere great service great food love the Howie burger and awesome drinks
I know Stingray is a trendy place catering to good looking singles during happy hour but thank you for being so accommodating to this family
It was all delicious and a good atmosphere
Don't think i'll be going to a Hooters again for a while For an overpriced beer and hot girls I prefer going to a place like Tilted Kilt where at least the food is good
Not only is it a great place with a lot of options but it is inexpensive
It's a very casual place so don't expect anything fancy
Yes the tortas are good and the quesadillas and the chilindrinas are too but I LOVE the ice cream at this place
Atmosphere pretty inviting a little romantic even
They also have a nice atmosphere cool patio with great misters friendly staff and a big plush couch
Great hole-in-the-wall coffee shop with good atmosphere even if it's in a strip mall
Well I guess I don't reall have anything good to say about this place but not anything bad either
Cool place with a good menu and fair prices
Great place to solo dine or share a meal with your part time lover and full time friend
First off if you are looking for a good cup of coffee then you should definitely give this place a try
All in all it's a great place to get some very tasty coffee
Warning--this is not the place to have a romantic date deep conversation or even a relaxing meal; the music was quite loud plus we were seated right next to the kitchen and continually heard orders being shouted
My hubby & I love It's All Goodz our fav place to go piece shopping
The Lost Leaf is not Scottsdale or Mill in fact that is just the start of the great things about this place
It is a casual grungy down-to-earth place with rotating art local indie bands and one of the best beer selections in town
If you have an open mind and you want truly beautiful people a good atmosphere good music and great beer
tokyo house got a bunch of great reviews and everyone mentioned a cool old man behind the counter so i just had to check this place out
This place is great - IF YOU LIKE TO BE IN A SNOBBY ENVIRONMENT
I thought the atmosphere was great the food was very good and I actually liked the BYOB
It is still a great little place though to meet for wine and great food
All in all the place is good not great
The only reasons this place gets two stars areThe waitress - She was greatThe decor - Great retro styling - probably authentic since the place opened in 1966* The so-called NY strip was thin as a pancake and riddled with gristle* The ribs were not fall off the bone
Overall this place is great for when you want a spendy but good tasting cake
I went to dinner here for the first time because I heard great things about this place
The only reason it doesn't receive two stars is the service was great and the ambience was nice
Is it bad that I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place
Here's my take on the placeI dont think this place is bad
The place is reasonably clean busy but not messy and the service is good
The decor is great I love the colors and the relaxing atmosphere
I don't have kids so this isn't a place I'd come to a lot but it seems like a good place for a night out with the family if you have one
I grew up in New Haven CT with great pizza and have heard about this place for quite some time
And finally if you want to play some bar games this place has tons and they are all in good condition
There wasn't anything exceptionally bad about this place but mediocre is an overstatement
A great place to have a quick lunch that will not have you waiting and keep you satisfied throughout the day
Maxim and Da Vang are great Vietnamese places on 19th ave
The Cultural Center has a few great places esp Golden Buddha
IMHO yoshi's has better teriyaki but this place is a good choice for the area
A good after work place to grab a drink or watch the game with friends but do yourself a favor and grab some authentic mexican that us Phoenicians are blessed with when it comes time to eat
I had to shlep over to the new post office just north of McDowell and had read good reviews about this place so I thought I would give a try
The atmosphere and decor are great and you immediately smell the slow cooking meat as you enter the door
They used Asadero cheese on top which is super good not many places use it anymore
I really like this place  great pizza and atmosphere
Beware of the Manager at this place because if he condons this type of sales strategy then he is guilty of customer abuse and bad sales tactics and the employees are just following his lead
I mean this place is the closest I've come to discovering a small cool and relaxed bar in Scottsdale
Getting there was quick n easy considering its downtown walked in to a 20 min wait place was packed so we had a couple drinks from the bar bloody mary is what did me right so good i had 2
Maybe I'm spoiled by most of these old tiki places that mostly serve bad Chinese food but I was hoping for a little more in the food department
The food was pretty good scallop app was delicious but the overall atmosphere ruined the meal
We arrived at lunch to find the place packed and had a bit of a wait which despite the run-down lackluster interior we viewed the popularity as a positive sign that we were in for some great food
While the atmosphere is lovely and the service was very good the food was a huge disappointment
The steak was very good and the service was also good but I have had better and more helpful in other places
It's a good place for watching football/UFC/etc
Overall it's a nice clean place with good service
I don't know if it is just the first week excitement or if this is how it will always be but the welcoming demeanor of this place I have seen so far on top of good food at good prices will definitely keep me coming back
I don't like talking about people places or things in a dim light but I feel it is my duty to report bad apartment living when I have endured it myself
Their menu listed gourmet hot chocolate and since this place looked like a cute little cafe I was expecting something at least on-par with Starbucks mediocre version
Great place for sushi and non-sushi lovers
Just moved to a new location that is a bit out of the way but worth the journeyOne of the finds close to the Arcadia area that is a good Friday work lunch and a place to introduce your friends to
It wouldn't be a bad place to watch a game either as they have tv's at every angle all over the restaurant
A good place to meet and hangout without any of the hype or expensive drinks you'll find at some of the surrounding Mill late night stops
Second the atmosphere and service are great
This is another one of those places that I patronize on a fairly regular basis but keep forgetting to review and that's too bad since this is a great place
Good consistent modern Italian almost a neighborhood place and not as corporate as Starbucks
This was the last place I would have expected to find a veggie burger much less a really really good one
Still a good date place and a good ladies who lunch type of place
If we have another bad experience that will be the end of this place for us
A really nice and friendly place to relax and enjoy affordable good Korean food
They do a good job and it's nice that I can get my car washed/detailed gas tank filled and an oil change all in one place and I even got a 10cent/gallon discount
The location is cute and the place delivers wholesome foods made with fresh organic ingredients
A quick lunch with a friend and this place wasn't bad
If you are looking for traditional but yummy food then this is a good place to try
Overall a great place to eat talk and drink
I still love the food the wine is great and the atmosphere is swanky
Good menu choices with some innovative choices nice atmosphere consistently good wait staff in my experience and fair prices
I would HIGHLY recommend this place-great spot for anyone and especially out of towners looking for something unique
There are too many other places with great food and equally great service
I eat it often when I find a good place but if this is the best that AZ has to offer I'll eat something else
This place has a ton of options and is in a great location inside a cool shopping area
First you have to know that this place is CASUAL
The food and service will take care of that for you because it's as casual as the atmosphere
The customer service is really great here and I haven't had a bad experience here *knock on wood* I just came here again to buy some things for an upcoming house warming party and I just can't wait until I can fully furnish my place with Crate and Barrel
I actually only had food at this place so can't comment on the drinks but I split their bbq burger with the BF and I thought it was really good
This bar has a very relaxed atmosphere and the waiter didn't try to hurry us out even when the drinking had slowed down
Fresh fast service atmosphere is great even the bathroom are cool
Besides feeling completely out of place in our Halloween costumes we had a great time;- It's a pretty low key place and it sits towards the back of this shopping complex so unless you know where you're going you would never find it
I haven't had one before so I went ahead and decided to try it at a place that had good pizza and the spaghetti calzone was a great compliment to the entrees
The closest we've found around here is Mickey's in Mesa a small hot dog place with great street tacos
All in all I'm just happy to have an actual good mexican food place to go to in Tempe now
The interior is nice but this place did not give a very good first impression
Another place with friendly service amusing barfly regulars and good food
Its a good place for girlfriends to go together or to take a special lady to
The inside to this place is really spacious and they do a great job at making things really comfortable
It's a great place to hang out read a book smell incense chat with other book lovers and just chill
It's a great place for breakfast lunch or a quick dinner
I love the atmosphere I love the people I love how relaxed it is at this location and I love love love the food and wine
I have not met a bad server at this place and I just adore the atmosphere
The Asian tapas idea is new to me having dined at some great Tapas places from Chicago to Vegas  but alas never an Asian tapas joint
just don't go before sunset if you'll wiltPrice  GreatAtmosphere  GreatService GreatTaste Like no pizza ever beforeThis is not just the best pizza you've had it doesn't compare to the greasy saucy pies we all love
Yes those places both make good pies but it's not the same
Since it's already a well-established point that this place has delicious food at an excellent value I'll simply provide a few bulleted remarksGreat Original PaintingsSweet & fresh faced Guadalajaran transplant at counterAmazing Strawberry Salsa WTF -- who knew
It's a great place to swing by for breakfast to not only jump start your day with some protein but to jump start your day with fun
The good news for us is that place was essentially empty from the time we showed up at 1230 on a pleasant Saturday afternoon until we left so we had a waiter all to ourselves even if his attention was split between us and his potential hook-up
I originally went to Breakfast Joynt when I moved to the neighborhood and I am always looking for a good breakfast place
Also the atmosphere is great and very casual my kids also love this place since there are games for them to play and the decor has so much going on that it is very kid inviting
This place is good for large groups and it worth a visit if you're in the area
The atmosphere is not bad pretty much expected for a wine bar
The service at this place is just so so Bad
If they would have been willing to work with me on the delivery I *might* have given them 3 stars but for the bad attitude this place seems to constantly have they only get 2
It looks like we'll be making the trek to a different sushi place Ra or Sapporos neither of which is as good as Celsius in terms of sushi but way better when it comes to customer service
I've also tried several sandwiches here which were also good but I figure if I'm eating at a Greek place I should have Greek
Teakwoods is the place to go when you want something cold on tap peanuts on the floor some good wings and an hour or two just hanging out with good friends
In summation Unlimited has really good gelato and is totally a place to check out if your standards for decor/furnishings aren't too high
K'Os is a great place to go for happy hour
It's a good place to chill out and people watch while sippin' on a few drinks
The prices are not badthere are cheaper places but they are not as clean
The place is actually pretty good believe it or not
Its a small intimate kind of place that serves and sells some great breads along with a few sandwiches to eat in house or carry out
If your in the area and would like a really cute independant place to eat at stop by and grab a bite to eat
I always walk by and think this place is cute well marketed and just a great idea
The word on the street was this is the place to get great food
We ate there had some soups sandwiches and I thought Wow Sedona's gotten pretty corporate since I was last here but at least they have this good indie soup/salad/sandwich place that I'll have to come back and eat at again
All in all for a casual soup & sandwich place I'd say this joint is doing just fine
It's a shame too because the place is gorgeous one of the nicest spots in Old Town and pretty good eye candy
The Arizona Biltmore used to be such a great place
This is a great place to spend a weeknight with some friends or shoot pool on a Saturday night definitely include Q and Brew on your bar hopping list
I travel to PHX a few times a year and have been looking for good places to eat
The very next day at 840am hubby and I drove 30 minutes to get to this place thinking it must be good to be featured in the Food Network show as if
I am a fan of primarily sashimi not rolls but have heard good things about this place
my own bad memory of that smell that got placed onto this place
I'm a semi-regular like once a week that's over fifty times per year and I still cannot give them any praise except that's it's cheap sometimes when they're not over charging/over ringing and it's a good place to hideout for a while and replay some old music no else has
That may not be saying that much as I don't eat pasta often and if I do it's usually Buca di Beppo or Olive Garden but this was some seriously good food
Having not had Chinese food in a while in a state that lacks any real great Chinese food we decided to give Wong's Place a shot
Anytime you find a pizza joint that also serves real Italian dinners and the owners actually operate the place you are in for great food
Craig PS - it's a great place for kids too they have etcha-sketch boards and play tables and both my kids love their bagels donuts and muffins
It 's a  great place to begin an outdoor activity
I went there with my mom right after moving in because it is the closest restaurant to my place and we had heard some good things from my real estate agent
the only reason i'm giving it four instead of five stars is because i had to go to the bathroom really badly and i couldn't use it because someone was in it for a good 20 minutes while i was waiting and i had to wait even longer and use it at the next place because i was scared to go in at that point
Everyone likes good Italian food but not everyone likes pretentious places like Carraba's or even that horrid Olive Garden
I thought the pasta was delicious and the whole vibe of the place is great for having dinner or just drinks
One of those places you typically drive by and wonder wonder if that's any good
My take on this paritcular Kona Grill locationFantastic for happy hour - if you just want to relax and not eat anything too filling and have a few drinks it's a great place
Place is small looks modern low light but due to their service it looks more like fancy burger joint than upscale or romantic place
Everything here from the service to the food to the ambience is great
Someone once told me that getting plain cheese pizza is the best way to judge whether or not a place actually has good pizza
It seemed to me that the place could be a great hang out
I should also note we were placed in a great spot in the corner where you could observe the busy room or simply enjoy your company as if we were in a room to ourselves
All in all we had a wonderful evening in a great atmosphere with great service and good food
This isn't the greatest place but the food service and drinks are decent
it just worries me that if this is this nations next great generation that will be entering the workplace in a few years that can't even say thank you or have a nice day when they thrust an overpriced quarter pounder and fries through the window what do my fellow generation YX er's have to look forward to in the coming years
The atmosphere is great and the location is good
another great thing about this place is the speedy service
Drinkwater's  I know it's Mastro's now but old habits are hard to break is good place for a simple steak and salad
This place is flushed with great imported foods and fresh made desserts to order up from their market
And they've got a great this is what you'd get if you drove through a small town in New Mexico on a Friday night and were looking for a place to eat and mingle with the locals kind of ambiance
All I can say is I really hope this place was having a bad day
I was really hoping this place would be good
The atmosphere is pretty cute it's in a little house-like restaurant in a small shopping center tucked away on Camelback
The atmosphere is casual but a bit on the quiet side sad to say it was probably because the restaurant was about 1/2 full on a Saturday night
Because its family owned it can be a bit pricey at about $10 for a regular plate and drink but the pleasant service great food and casual laid back atmosphere make up for it
This place is GREAT and looking forward to eating a real meal here in their actual dining room
After hearing good things about this place I finally made it here for lunch
This was a fast casual placeyou order at the counter but they'll bring food out to you
I liked the casual atmosphere and the energy was good
If you want great food for a great price this is the place to go
In summary not a bad lunchtime Chinese place
Great for kids because they have activities for them and in the spring the butterfly garden is teeming with life
The place has a laid back lounge feel and is very casual
It made it a great atmosphere to enjoy my food
It's a shame that our President hasn't had the joy of experiencing decent burgers because this place is not good
Great place to grab a bagel and a coffee on a Saturday or Sunday Morning
Overall I really dug the atmosphere but the food left a good bit of room for improvement
If you are just going to have a few beers with friends this is a great place but if you're wanting an awesome meal I suggest you go elsewhere
There was a good amount of beef it in and the dish wasn't too salty as most places would serve
their motto is a great place to day drink
The place was fun and the food was great but those dining here need to know the wait is a bit excessive
So next time you are stuck in the PHX negotiating over mineral rights and need a nice place for a long casual lunch this is a great spot
amazing amazing place especially when the weather's good and you can sit outside
I have had better Mongolian beef but this place had great pork
Its a little pricier than say Green or Veggie House but a great place for a late lunch/ early dinner
The atmosphere is nice the service was really great but there wasn't anything on the menu you won't find anywhere else nor was it prepared nor presented any better
A great place to drop into to have a great meal and leave happy
But a good place to bring a non-vegan if they're trepidatious  about trying veggie food
It's not a big place ok it's a dive but a great dive and their parking gets really full at lunch time
It's finding places like this that remind me why it is great to be a yelper
The place is dimly lit and it has a very casual but a nicer atmosphere
Presentation 4 stars - Cute little place very family owned kinda vibe very welcoming and homey
Place is great for take out food if you're looking to pick something up
Also a great place to take a group of people so that you can all try something a little different
Pretty good salsa at this place too but I agree that the weird carafe style bottles they're served in are inconvenient though if you know a habitual double dipper this is the place to bring them
While visiting in Phoenix we stumbled upon this place and the lady who must have been the owner was great and even e-mailed up websites to check out being vegan
* At first glance it would seem a great place to dance because the floor is made of wood
It felt like it would be a good place known for drinking like casey moores but features a menu that reads like it's a restaurant
This is a cute place to grab some breakfast with the family
Overall it is a good place to go for a reasonable breakfast just don't expect anything amazing
The atmosphere is decent though I always find it to be a little warmer and louder inside than I'd prefer but that's just my opinion it's not too bad at all
I don't see how people think this place is any good
Great ambience terrific service warm rich dark decor that makes you feel good when you walk in on a cool winter night excellent drinks
Cook's for the best place in Phoenix for a romantic dinner with your sweetie
This place oozes Old World/Spanish Colonial charm in a good way
What a great place for a milestone birthday or anniversary celebration
This is a little cute place in middle of Tempe Marketplace
On a weekend even with a reservation you're likely in for a wait with no good place to wait
In Short Good food and beer at a reasonable price and a quirky atmosphere
Overall a great place to have beer and pasties I will visit again to try out their more curious concoctions
I found the place to be really unique and really something new for downtown there is nothing else downtown that has the feel of Hanny's it's really a great place
Keep up the friendly staff and great atmosphere and I will be a life long patron
Had not stayed at Homewood before   Great value and an amazing place
This is not a great restaurant but I am fond of this place
Nice relaxing place to chill and the service is good
Honestly if this place was so bad why give it two stars instead of one
My first impression was that the place was cute and I liked what they did with the space
This hallway of an establishment is a good place for you and one 1  friend--but not more than one given the space constraints--to come and brood
I suppose the charm of the place is that well it is what it is its a good eats in downtown phoenix that does not try to be anything else
Great little place located off of Bethany just west of I 17
Little family type place where they have a good Chef that is popular with the Spanish TV channel
Once they were a little slow to bring the check but we didn't look like we were in a hurry hadn't asked for it and it's not like you really want a place to rush you out the door so I don't think of that as so bad
Considering how many great places there are to eat in the area I would not chose to eat here again
Great place for the family to go and eat
So we come from California where there is a lot of sushi to choose from and it is my favorite food so I have been searching for good sushi here this is not the place
While I can't remember what I had always happens to me in asian food places I know that it was great and I wanted more
The other great thing about this place is they are conveniently located just off the light rail route so it's very easy to hop off on Central and Thomas and take a nice stroll down for breakfast
So to sum up the place is nice the service is good and the food is kinda bland
So NOTE TO SUNS FANS This could be a very good place to watch a game while enjoying traditional bar food and a brewski or several
If you are missing some good Island food this is the best place we have found to get our fix
The only reason this place get's three stars is because the hummus and chicken platter is really good
Very nice feeling in this place from the moment you walk in perfect for a special evening or if you are just looking for GREAT seafood in AZ
anyway the place isn't fancy but it is fresh and clean family owned and serves up some really good food
definitely a friendly and casual atmosphere very appealing for lunch
A great place to take a date whether it be your first or 100th this place will never disappoint
Thats the only good thing about this place
I am going to say this is not a bad place at all
Parking for this place is tough this time of year but I am sure that other times not too bad
Great place for a date or catching up with old friends or for groups
And it is not loud usually so I am assuming it'd be a great alternative to places like Cartel and stuff for students to study
If you have a sweet tooth want a relaxed environment; Chill is the place to go
This super-nice new Safeway is a great addition to the South Phoenix/Laveen area and provides a nice alternative to the great--but limited--shopping experience at Fresh & Easy located on 19th Ave and Baseline and the overwhelming and not that fresh or gourmet offerings at the massive Fry's Marketplace across the road
I took a friend to this place to try out Shabu Shabu the only restaurant in arizona to serve this style food for the first time and the server went through great lengths to give us the best experience
The staff did feel bad but the place was COMPLETELY EMPTY
The food is consistently good the prices are fair and people who run the place are very nice Gloria Lupe and Richard
I think I am able to overlook the fact that its really not an attractive room--the energy from the kitchen and the close tables add noise and excitement to the room but the art and lighting is ugly and now that its starting to look run down as well--there are too many new beautiful places in the city with equally good food and equally as pricey that are not in strip mall
Great place not cheap by any means but I won't have to buy fresh flowers that only last a week
If you are looking for a new church or just a peaceful place to think about life the Franciscan Renewal Center is a great place to visit
The bartenders are one of the greatest things about this place
The lounge next door is apparently under the same ownership and is a great place to enjoy a glass of wine and some anti pasta before dinner
A great idea built that was built at the wrong place at the wrong time
Great burger place I will be back many times I know it
Great atmosphere though it can get a little noisy at times + great food + great wine + friendly servers = a nice evening out any day of the week
Easy on the ears and provided a great and cozy atmosphere to our evening out
I've gone to this place a couple of times over the last month or so and unfortunately it wasn't as good of an experience as it should have been
I especially enjoy going to Luci's because the place has a good down-to-earth atmosphere and their staff is friendly
Not a place to go for a ice dinner but great for lunch
While eating our meal we placed an order for the Benighs as they are cooked to order they are great
So I had been told by a couple of my employees that this was the place to go in Phoenix for truly great Ice Cream
The two women running the place pleasant and the service was good
and I went here for lunch and the food was good and the place was nice
I would definitely recommend this place to those of you wanting to try something new and the price point makes it a great special occasion restaurant
I'm surprised this place go such bad reviews
I really wish I could give this place a better review since I see it has many raving reviews but I just didn't have that great of an experience
I love trying new places and I especially love a good sandwich so I purchased a Groupon for lunch and decided since it was close by I'd check it out
Went to this place based on Yelp's great reviews
Drinks They have a great selection of beers on tap with a few I haven't seen at other places including orange blossom and their own house beer
Fortunately the place doesn't look like it has changed since We are the World was tearing up the pop charts and the food hasn't either in a good way
The place is great for kids families or anyone looking to cool off
With less people in the place it also makes for a more romantic setting
The only thing that must keep this place alive is a great outdoor patio and good location
Over the years I have worked out in more gyms than I can count including Gold's gym - Ahwatukee {one of the worst I've been a member of} I have to say in all aspects of what makes a good gym - this is the place
This place is a great little gem in Old Town
All in all it is a great place for date night and dinner out with friends or family
I've given this place so many fair shots because they have a great happy hour and seem like they have potential
I would definitely recommend this place for good service quality food and cheap eats
The atmosphere is very romantic outside with light trees and live music
The exterior of the ballpark is nothing to brag about but once inside its a great place to catch a game
This is the most comfortable place to have a glass of wine relax and enjoy some great food
Pricing moderate atmosphere casual and quiet
And it has a great patio as well as a great open-air room that isn't really a patio but isn't really inside -- basically this is a great place to come with your friends for a drink after work or on a lazy Sunday
-They need to 'clean' the place up a bit -The food at the restaurant isn't that good-The a/c is not good
If you want to come to Pink Taco for a few drinks and an app before hitting the bars then this is a great place to check out hot guys and girls
Yard House seems to be a good place to meet a group of people because of their huge menu beer selection and atmosphere conducive to talking
Quite good but the food doesn't stand out too much from other pho places
Overall this was a great restaurant w/ wonderful atmosphere
I see this place as A-OK which is still a good thing but it's totally a lunch spot not a dinner spot in my opinion
I would NOT recommend this place if you value good customer service
After spending a fun day at the nearby Phoenix Zoo I Yelped to find  a good nearby place to eat and up popped the Sonora Mesquite Grill
The location seems to be in a former residence with a casual garden surrounding diners eating al fresco
I can go to this place and scarf down a whole bunch of pretty good tasting frozen yogurt for 160 some-odd calories
I hope this place cleans up their act in the kitchen because they cook some good food
We know the family that runs the place and everyone gives great service except for the owner who is unfriendly
In a pinch CVS was a great place to stop for some ice cold drinks and sunscreen to avoid a search all over a larger store like Safeway
Not only have I found yet another breakfast on a weekday spot which I am going to frequently drag my coworkers to but this should be a great place to chill if I ever have that awkward amount of time in between appointments and want a spot to get some work done and chill
This place is kind of a cross between casual and fine dining I was kind of at a loss for what to wear or what to feel comfortable in here
It is ranked as one of the top first date places and the ambience is very romantic
Good thing I bought I a groupon because this place is a bit high pricing for burgers
This is just a fun place to go and a great family restaurant
Pleasant atmosphere and definitely more relaxed
This place has ok food and great wines but the chairs are extremely uncomfortable
The guitar player/singer was actually really good but they had a full amp and speaker system even though it is a pretty small place and so this made it very difficult to carry on a conversation with the other couple we were with
I was in Phoenix for work and my friend Peter took me here on a Thursday night for a drink and the atmosphere was so laidback the bartender was cute and friendly and the drinks were fantastic and not overpriced
This area is still home to a wide variety of individuals who need a fun place with great eats that's not too far away
When we got to our seats on the patio we all thought what a great night beautiful weather fun exciting place and we know the food is good at CB so it should be great here
Great trendy place with knock out burgers pizzas salads and sweet potato fries
Also location is great perfect for those who commute via light rail and love that FEZ has reverse happy hourHH all week unlike other places who only offer reverse HH on weeknights and discontinue on weekends
One last note - it's a big place and a good portion of it is pretty much outdoors some covered but not air conditioned so if you go during the summer months I recommend going early before it gets too hot - they open at 10am 7 days a week
To find out for yourself just how good this place is walk in ask to be seated at the bar and ask your Itamae sushi chef Omakase onegaishimasu
this is a great place to go either for lunch or dinner
Used sporting goods stores are generally not the place you walk into to find something specific yet on my visit Chad & Sarah had exactly what I needed a stand golf bag for walking at the price I was hoping for
No corking fee and a friendly staff makes for a good kick back place in the hot afternoon
Great atmosphere it'd be fun to go back and do dinner and then have a cleansing ale as my dad likes to call it by the fire pit on the back patio of the hotel
Everything just seemed overpriced and there's nothing great about the atmosphere
I know they are all super-emo-cool but come on there are lots of places to eat and the economy is bad
Would not recommend this place  to anyone seeking good seafood
The coffee was good the bagel-and-egg sandwich was good the place was clean Margie was a friendly soul and her husband who was there helping her in the early morning before going on to his job was interesting to talk to
But they are open late so it is a good place to stop for a late dinner or drink
All in all a great place to grab a excellent burger and cold beer
I met a friend for lunch and she immediately commented that it's a very cute place
If you want the real deal and to support a great group of people make this your go to place
I had driven past the place many times and thought it was abandoned but after looking on Google and seeing some good reviews on Yelp I decided to give the place a try
This place is such a great find and so close to my house I can take side streets all the way home
For children 4 and under this place is great
The service is pretty good and its a kid friendly atmosphere
There are other sports bar/happy hour places close by but they are definitely in a league to themselves and not in a good way
It's not terrible but if you enjoy good quality and non pureed fish in your rolls then this is not the place for you
It's a fairly upscale place but one can also go in casual
It's a great place to take a date or group of friends before you head out to the bars and clubs in Scottsdale
It may have been me or just the mood I was in but I really felt relaxed there and in spite of the fact that we closed the place for the afternoon we didn't feel rushed or in the way
Anyway it's a good casual place for dinner
Good place - just a bit too far for most to go there often
This place is just as good if not a bit better
D&B is a great place for the family to go have some fun in doors playing video games bowling and shooting pool
Atmosphere was excellent food was good service was sub par
I think there are so many great local place in downtown Phoenix but I needed to add something new to the rotation and this was perfect
This place has it all good food great service local feel and charm and amazing prices
I hope the good word spreads for this great new place
I topped it off with a huge glass of iced tea and I was full for two days afterwards -If you're looking for a really good deli this is the place
I discovered this place one day after walking out of AJ's across the where I bought a sandwich moments prior when I saw this place with a big banner that read delicatessen I was immediately pissed that I didn't know it was there and bought a sandwich at AJ's not that AJ's sandwiches are bad but I crave a more authentic deli style sandwich
This place seems like a nice little neighborhood bar My buddy lives down the street and goes here a lot they didn't seem to have a lot for a beer selection compaired to some other Tavern's in the area but the appetizers and food are good
Heard great things about this place so decided to check it out
This place offers great spa services at really great prices
This place could probably be really romantic on the right night but I haven't gotten lucky there yet
Cute little place in an old victorian house on E
The place is adorable - even the bathroom are super cutely decorated
This family-run place is bustling w/ foodies and pulls off consistently great meals using fresh local ingredients + service w/ pride & love
It's such a cute little place and rings true to the style of so many restaurants I visited while living in France
I love the casual atmosphere of this place and I love the outside patio when the weather is cooperating
This is a fun place for a date - it has the potential to be quite romantic just be sure that the person you're bringing along is worth the time effort and money
The place was clean had a great bar with nice seating which all made me feel very comfortable
The place had great little table-tents that informed of their happy hour munchies
I had high hopes for this place after seeing it on the food network and hearing good reviews from coworkers
They have a pretty good happy hour the back room the Aztec room I believe is a good place to start
I was so eager to go to this place after reading many good reviews here in Yelp and local restaurant guides
One good thing -- The place has a very wide variety of Japanese food not just sushi
I went to this place cause I was just looking for something good to eat because my favorite pho spot was closed
I love the fun tiki atmosphere at Hula's and the fact that it's great for brunch lunch happy hour dinner or a night out
Kind of a hike to get here and a little hidden but a pretty adorable place with some great finds
Either way down or up its a great place all around and the drinks are always perfect and the people are always nice
The place is great for families couples or buddies hanging out trying to relive the good ole days
As for the place it is very new and I like the ikea dim light setting and the loud vietnamese songs that they are playing which is good so you don't have to listen to what the other table is talking about
I'm not sure where all these good reviews are coming for this place but I have had way better BBQ than this and the 8 other people with me agreed we aint goin back
Again I'm not sure where these good reviews are coming from but if I were you I would stay away and try another BBQ joint I'm not going to give any suggestions because then people would think I'm an owner of that other  joint I'm just going to suggest that there are way better place then here
The lack of high quality creative yet reasonably priced sandwiches in a casual atmosphere is blatant to any transplants especially former Californians
I'm awarding one star in addition to the minimum one-star rating because I got to drink cheap beer by the pool in 90 degree weather for 10 days and there are a few good places to eat and two dollar stores very nearby
I'm talking about the friendliness of the staff the good selection of stuff in the store and the general good vibe of the place
Good dark and elegant place for a date or affair Tottie and you could make a great meal from just the appetizers
I think this place would be great for lunch especially for the quality of the food and the price
It's a good breakfast place where you might just meet your neighbors
Great real gourmet Mexican food great atmosphere good service
The counter area is a good place to sit as you get to see the food prepared right in front of you and experience the hustle of the cafe
Overall the place is good but I would only go back if I am really craving Venezuelan food and don't feel like cooking it myself
I do enjoy the food and think they have a good beer selection love the Sex Panther but again this place feels cold and unaccommodating
This place has some apparently good eats baked goods some of which are vegan
He came to check and make sure we were happy and ended up carrying a great conversation about their food and other Mexican places around the valley
For one Scottsdale has needed a good tapas place
The weather cooperated and we were able to enjoy outside dining in the relaxed atmosphere and watch the wildlife on the golf course and the mountains in the background
This place makes good burgers at very reasonable prices and their somewhat spicy sauce was good and gave me a change from my usual drown it in mustard strategy
A perfect place for a romantic dinner or even an intimate party
If you're hungover or just feel like throwing health out the window Red Robin is a great place to do it at
Great place to take a break on a different take on new Mexican cuisine instead of the constant sonoran style Mexican food were used to here in the valley
This place is really good for large groups and the crowd is very diverse in age which I enjoy
I wanted to go to the place you all visited badly
Great store good staff and it's awesome to have a place to go when you wanna shop but don't have a lot of dough to do it with
But could be ;I fell in love with this place very casual hands on and yummylicious
This place is great they make you feel welcomed and at ease as soon as you come in
If you want a similarly good restaurant go to Sorranos prices are about the same and it's a sit down place they also give you unlimited chips salsa and bean dip
it would be a great place for couples and special evenings or because of the view a great place to bring a business acquaintance where you want to impress them with some wonderful views of the Valley of the Sun
I think this is a kind of place that is great to go to once for the show or maybe if you're taking someone that's never been before but after that I don't see any reason to pay the price they expect for the food
Everything that is bad about a breakfast place in one spot
So I'm giving this place 4 stars for the following reasons  Love the concept and anywhere that deals with independent type of films and docuemntaries is A-ok in my book; I liked the bar - it was cool kind of trendy but in a good way
One good thing about this place was the guy behind the ordering counter
Great neighborhood atmosphere the food was fresh and prepared to perfection and the service was spot on
That's a pretty great savings considering it's not a cheap place to get a massage
I loved everything about this place -- from the local papers about Indian reservation events to the chit chat with the guy behind the counter about which Navajo tribe managed the restaurant -- and I recommend it to anyone visiting the greater Phoenix area
Super friendly staff consistently good food and great atmosphere are reasons I go back
a great place and i know we'll be back here
Pho Avina is a lovely casual little place for excellent Vietnamese food
Most places I goto that have a smaller menu I figure that it's due to them keeping it simple and as a result having really good food
Ok ok sitting out by the pool was great although I attribute that more to the gorgeous Phoenix weather than the pool the surface was peeling in a bunch of places and the walls around the pool were literally covered in moss which looked to be due to neglect and not a stylistic choice but the $3
I suspect it's a great place to be when hungover
I would love this place even if it was housed in an old VFW building for the food alone, but luckily this place has a fun, relaxing, yet upbeat atmosphere, making it a  great place for dates, dinners out with friends, introducing kids to sushi, and large groups of people
Whether you're stopping in for some coffee or there to borrow the wifi, this is a great local place
I'd give this place 5 stars because the actual set up is great but NO ONE SHOULD PAY $9-$12 PER DRINK IN PHOENIX
Really nice ambiance to the place service is great- friendly
I work on Mill and appreciate a place to eat that's consistently good and has staying power
I know alot of people don't like menudo but it's a great place to start day drinking
With a cute little Mexican place like that they deserve another try
This place is also about as good as you can get for a date - just not a first one
If a great breakfast place opened up anywhere from 51st Ave to 83rd ave and Bell Rd they would make a KILLING
The ambience was great; it's literally a house with rooms as the dining area
This place is just cute good old fashioned fun
The food is consistently good the service and atmosphere are top notch and it's in a great location but I can't seem to give them five stars
Not a bad place to go to before going to a game or show
Above all great atmosphere great food great service - HIGHLY recommend if you're in the mood for a lil southern cookin
From appearance it doesn't look like that kind of place can put out such good food - but they do
Frankly the place is a bit small for that but they accommodated us cheerfully and took very good care of us
Haven't been here nearly as often as I would like to have been in the past few months but this place is still churning out great quality burgers
I would put this on my list of places to return for the good eats since I was so happy the first time around
Cute place nice and bright with lots of seating inside and out
We found this place by chance thank goodness
They do tone the spice levels down quite a bit though - which might be a good or bad thing depending on how spicy you like your food to be -I love this place and take all my non-Indian friends here whenever they crave Indian food
The music is rather not good they played madonna and the place is just kind of
it's a great place to get cosmetics too as they carry all the Alba Avalon Burts Toms etc
So if you have a four legged family member this is a nice chill place with very good service
Overall I love this place this is a great family restaurant and you wont break the bank
It's pretty darned good for a fast food Japanese place in a mall
They make you feel reasonably special and their membership is a good deal especially if you live in a place where massages can be ridiculously expensive Arizona DC
While massage enthusiasts will no doubt decry Massage Envy like hamburger enthusiasts do for Mickey D's and I don't blame them Massage Envy is a great place for someone who has never had a massage before and wants to try it or isn't interested in dishing out the dough for a luxury experience at a huge spa
There are too many other great Pho places to eat at unless they improved their product increase value & lower their prices I will never go back
Also whoever said KFC has chicken as good and it's cheaper well keep going back to KFC and stay outta places like this cause you don't belong
Overall I do like that they have shakes like any good burger shack should but I don't factor that in because to me when a place has the word burger in the title that's all that matters
This is a very nice reasonably-priced Italian place with excellent food and great ambiance
Truthfully they are so good I have yet to eat anything else at this place and have been going for years
This is a great place to hang out and catch a game
Doesn't matter if you come with a group or roll here solo this place serves up quality food at great prices
this is not a place your wife can just go into for a minute You are stuck for at least and hour if you are lucky Don't get me wrong its an amazing store if you are a woman but don't go there expecting to get out quickly if you are a man This place has any and every kind of decoration possible - prices are good
The food comes out lightning quick here so it would be a great place to get things to-go for lunch
Overall a great place to meet hip 20 to 40 somethings after work
I love Thai food coming from San Diego I am used to great Thai food but this place just didn't have it
All the residents I talked to said their place was just as bad
Citizen is versatile -- the perfect place for a romantic date a small gathering or for just meeting a buddy for a drink
The formula is really pretty simple -- offer high quality stuff equip the place with great staff and don't go overboard with prices
The atmosphere is cute and charming the servers generally seem to be a higher caliber and I love the variety of flavors on their breakfast menu
This is a great place to go for specialty items
I should have paid  heed to my friend's incessant complaints about this place but I'm the type of girl that has to go through a bad experience to learn from it
As great as the food was giving this place even four stars is a stretch
Don & Charlie's really is a place I can go on and on about but at the end of the day I'd pretty much just be reiterating how great it is so I'll just stop here  If you like BBQ steaks & fish
Not sure if I'd come here often as it's not so good on the waistline but I believe in balance and this place will definitely fit onto my 'cheat days' list
I've been to other places that were good but didn't make the cut
things I hadn't seen since I was last at that great Smorgasbord place back in Portland that I can't remember the name of
We have just returned home from brunch today  now mind you we have been going to switch for years  one of our favorite places to eat  now we live in far north Phoenix and drive down for a good meal  not today
It's a drive but Chandler and Mesa have some real great places for traditional Vietnamese food
you'd think by all the hype about this place it would be good
Ill probably be back though because that was probably a one time thing  great place to go for a special occasion
Think of it this way I find it a great place to bring a date especially a first date for a late dinner and drinks
If only they brought in some recipes and/or cooks from any number of divey but great tasting places nearby it could be so much better
16th Street Sports Bar should be a great place to have a drink
I felt relaxed and welcome from the moment I walked into this place
He has great hours the place is well decorated and has an original feel to it
Chevy's is the place to go for great Mexican food at a great price
This place is really good for a small hole in the wall less crowded lunch
The atmosphere is comfortable big and airy and a great place to enjoy a meal or just a cocktail
This is a great place for a quiet romantic night
Things in their place and still the good pricing
I've always enjoyed their variety of menu options and find it a good place to take people for a quick and easy breakfast/lunch option
This place has a good thing going but just needs a better system to simplify the service and make sure everyone is taken care of
Oh and you can also run the stairs of the amphitheater if you're looking for a great place to do leg work
This place has such a simple concept great organization and consistency in their products and service
I think this small comfortable casual place has potential so give them a try maybe they are still working things out
That's the great thing about this place though
Let's review-Intimate place-Conducive to good conversation-Great beer list also have a good wine list including sake-No $30k millionaires4
The place was packed and the vibe was good
Yes but the few duds are heavily outweighed by other good places and certainly by great places like this
You go to this place when you want a nice value dinner that includes a great ambiance  a nice staff and a fun location for activities afterward
On top of that the LARGE size would be a small at other more casual Pho place
It's a relaxed atmosphere where you order the food from a counter and it is brought to your table when it is ready
I have to admit Sauce was a bit over hyped but still the food is good and I really like the relaxed atmosphere
Cheers and keep up the good work at the place
I grapple with comparing this place to Postino because they are so similar but where Postino succeeds in great service Bomberos food was just flat out better
Went here 2years ago in May Great ambiance and atmosphere if you don't mind the testing of lighting and waiters stumbling around and starring at you
I have eaten at most of the Mexican places in the valley during my life and while there are equals and many wanna be's Carolina's is one of the greats
I love sprouts this one doesn't have as good of a meat department so it isn't my first choice but more of a   go to  place cuz it's close
If you like little joints where the owner will remember your order this place is great
I am not much of a wrap person but I have never had a bad wrap from this place
Rebecca J's review mentions the relaxed atmosphere
I have driven by this place for years and everyone I have talk to said its great
I thought it sounded good and I love trying new places so we went
So the inside of this place is really cute with the wood paneling and all
Overall I'd say the place was good but not great
What else can I say but this place has some good food
The place itself is kind of small and run down but Asain restaurants aren't known for their perfect establishmentsThe chicken was good it cut into really big chunks though
I was very wrong this place was so so sooooo good
I recommend this place for those who love great service and UNFORGETTABLE pho
I really don't understand why all the great reviews about this place
Its cozy and a great place to have a cup of coffee and a sweet snack
This place is pretty casual and is great for happy hour drinks
Atmosphere  The place has character good music and for some reason my fiance and I always end up chatting with other patrons and/or servers
Anyway this place is rockin'To sum it up the wait was great and the dish was delish
The atmosphere is very lively if that's what you're looking forNow to the food - good and reasonably priced
Toyama is great  for a smaller place to have dinner with friends
I find it strange to hear how many other reviews mention the number of Asian people they see eating here and somehow manage to draw the conclusion from that fact that this is a great place
I have heard great news about this place so I decided to go there one day
Great atmosphere great drinks great food great servers great owners what more can you ask for
Quick easy good looking nails - done For a quick but still high quality mani / pedi this is the place to go
Some other good aspects of Olive & Ivy are the outdoor patio great place to sip my Mojito and people watch sea bass or seared ahi tuna dishes I'll usual order one or the other and the service their wait staff is on top of their tables
It was a great place for lunch with some friends
the fries were good though so this place gets 2 stars for that and the sweet interior
The place has such a great feel with the fire pits animals and live music
Anyway a great place with great staff and service and my favorite neighborhood bar for a beer at the end of the day
Subway is usually a great place to go for a relatively healthy meal on the go
Great place and always willing to help with any questions and general advice
Whats really great about this place is that it is self serve
The menu tends towards middle eastern with nothing on the menu exceeding $8 this place is a steal for good cooking in a nice atmosphere and great service
The atmosphere was great - there's a certain cacophony in big dim sum halls that I really enjoy
Okay let me give the rundownFood  awesomeService  first rate nice warm feels like homeAtmosphere  busy with people excited to be eating good foodWould I go again  I might go tomorrow
Ok so there really isnt any good new york style pizza around where we live so we gave this place a couple second chances
if you wanna try legit mexican food that you cant find anywhere this is your place and if your friends dont want mex they still have the great bbq ribs
Great indie bookstore warm atmosphere great collection of books and wonderful display
I've been wanting to try this place for awhile after hearing good things about it and reading the menu
Delux is a great place to go on a Sunday night at midnight since it really is the only place open in the area
$14 is a lot for a burger and there are places in the valley that I think it is worth it - Deluxe burgers and Lush burgers being good examples
All in all my guess is that this is a great place to have a drink and get some cheese or bruscetta- but beyond that it goes downhill fast
Cute 50's atmosphere but it interested me how many security cameras are mounted throughout the place
It's too bad though because the courtyard is a lovely place to hang out for the evening
The temps drop the company is good and it is a great place to run into people
Great location right at the Marriott in Scottsdale and is convenient to get to from most places
Overall I really loved the place with the great food service and ambiance
Shoes - very bad they are in awful shape they are used seriously this is like a thrifty store with some brand names and I am even sure that goodwill at least clean and wash the merchandise this place NOT
I have never walked out of here empty handed and it's a great place to purchase a gift for any female
If you are looking for more of a Lounge hang out with good drinks and live music -with even a small dance floor --check this place out
This is a great place for lunch and the portions are just above medium size
CR turns into a great nightclub with great music and atmosphere
Finally this is a great place for happy hour and groups
It's got a cozy atmosphere along with an excellent beer list and a small but good menu
The vaulted ceilings in the main room and calm lighting lend to a relaxed airy vibe to the place
I can accept the very casual atmosphere here
But if you have any sense of what good food is you'll love this place anyway
They use great quality ingredients and they dont skimp out on them and thats what makes this place so great
The atmosphere was very relaxed and in tune with the restaurant's laid-back theme
If you want a great place with a fabulous atmosphere awesome beers they have Drifter on tap and amazing food go to Hula's
We just moved to Scottsdale AZ from California and had not yet found a good sushi place
I am so happy to have found a great sushi place at Toyama
I have to say I'm pretty shocked by the negative reviews because this place is so good and the line out the door and typical 45 minute wait on weekend nights pretty much sum it up
I've finally found a good mexican place in Arizona
If anyone knows of a good place to get a burrito PLEASE send me a message
Yes they make great pizza but like another reviewer mentioned i can think of at least 5 places in Phoenix that offer better pizza
Looked this place up and saw the great reviews I thought I had to try it
Oh goodness does this place ROCK with their coffees and drinks
Wildflower is good stuff but I have to say when it comes to fancy sandwich places I think Paradise Bakery does it better
We mainly come here for karaoke but the sushi I've had is not that badThe karaoke is average the machine could be a bit better and they placed it weirdly outside the room so you have to point it awkwardly till the number spits out
Shane's is usually our go-to bbq place because the food is pretty good it comes out pretty quickly and the service is always friendly
Overall Shane's is a really great place to bring the whole family for some good food
A good place with some pretty decent lunch and daily deals
This is the place to go if you are looking for a great view and nice ambiance
This place has good food but all of the sauces taste the same
That said the atmosphere is fun and the service was good
That is not normally a bad thing but you need to know their atmosphere is more laid back in style -- sort of old Arizona-ish
The place is actually named for Barney's son Fred also apparently long departed like Barney for the great cocktail lounge in the skyBut I'm still here and while I am I will take every opportunity I get to soak up the cocktails food ambiance service and convivial chatter at Fred'sFred's is as pleasant a place to dine as anyplace I've found in Scottsdale
he can talk about anything and he's got that great NYC personality-Even more than the cocktails the atmosphere is stylish and sophisticated
This is reminiscent of my other hype induced bad service nightmare at another pizza place
Something you should know about meI love a good hot dog and this place has em
It's a nice place because I feel like its relaxed enough to enjoy a nice meal with a friend here yet not to barish or uptight that you can't relax and have a decent meal
prices are awesome food is great and the place is not typical pretentious Scottsdale
not my favorite taste for machaca anyway but great chips and salsa and the kids seem to love their food lots of options for kids  Everyone else in the group said the place was a solid 3 stars and that they would come back
Parking was a hassle and an annoyance-valet parking is probably the only bad thing that the owners of this place inflict on the customers here and at the other stores they own
SMoCA is an awesome place to spend some time see some great art without feeling overwhelmed
There's a full-fledged beer garden outdoors on the side of the restaurant where a band was set up playing traditional polka which goes great with beers
I did taste it before I sent it back and it was good but when the Optimator showed up all was right with the world I kind of get excited when I walk into a place and there's beers on tap that I haven't tried and even more so when they turn out to be amazing
The chicken strips are awesome the salads are good and never wilted or over dressed the fish and chips are on par the fries are always good; you can't beat anything for the price and the atmosphere
The atmosphere is good and its usually not that busy
and my other friend ordered the mish mash his review of the place is more generious then mine but he's only been there once and said it wasn't so bad
i so badly want to like this place cause it's close and Matt's is always packed
can i please get a breakfast place in the roosevelt area that is large enough to seat more then 20 people and serves good breakfast
Theres a good amount of parking we never had any problem finding someplace close to the main entrance especially given how busy it was
Thank God we were only at this place for two nights but good grief
Place a good amount in the bowl and press it down with the papers at the end of the bar
It shows that this place is family owned the food was great the salsa fresh and interesting the service friendly
Z's Greek is a great place for lunch or dinner when you're craving Grecian cuisine
It is with great reticence that I post this review as selfishly I would like to keep this place a secret
I totally should have went for thai hot seeing as i asked for some sriracha on the side and dumped it all over my food The place was very cute modern and was not loud so i was actually able to hold a great conversation on my date
And given the great places we have reviewed that is saying a lot
This place really does make you feel like a tourist though whether that is a good thing or bad thing is your choice
All in all good place when you are in the mountains but if you hate tourist run away
If you are not familiar with Middle Eastern cooking you will find this place good and charming
All of those things aside this particular CVS location has been a great go-to place for pharmacy toiletries snacks magazines etc
If you don't want frills and don't need a lot with your workout this is a good place to go
If I don't want to wait in a line there are many other breakfast places that offer good consistent food without a wait
This was my first time here and was shocked at how cute the place was
Really great place to relax but if you are on a budget this place can be a bank buster
Windsor is one of the best spots in Phoenix if you are looking for amazing food great drinks awesome atmosphere and possibly the best staff there is
Coming from San Francisco where there are a lot of good pizza places I thought that the pizza was good but I wasn't impressed
There aren't a lot of places in the area that sell really good coffee
I had heard great things about Pizzeria Bianco and had been to LUX the coffee shop next door so I was excited at the chance to get to try this place
I love this place I love supporting these great owners so much that every time I'm in there I buy fortune plants they have on display / for sale
Overall the place has a very hip/chic vibe  but still casual
My boyfriend and I stayed for one night at this resort for a stay-cation and mostly picked this place because a friend had told us it was fun and nice plus we found a good living social deal
I feel bad for anyone who actually takes this place seriously and drives here to have dinner
Their wings are good and their happy hour is amazing otherwise I'm giving this place one star
The atmosphere is pretty casual so this isn't exactly a great spot to bring a fancy date or hold an important business meeting but the layout decor and ambiance is great for a night out with friends or family
The place isn't huge but it's not small and it's good for most groups
The prices aren't particularly low but they're not bad - about average for this kind of place
If you have friends or family in town from a place without a big Mexican food presence Los Dos Molinos is a good option for showing them some of the great traditional cuisine we are so lucky to have in the Valley of the Sun
Great service better atmosphere but still not stepping away from the geriatrics but overall I was happy to give El Chorro another shot
Not like this place is still a secret which is a good thing because hopefully that means it's not going anywhere
Im new to Korean food but this place seems to make people happy sorry for all those hater reviews when you this famous that seems to attract bad attitudes
I come here on occasion with co-workers and I've never had a bad experience with the place
If you want good food and drinks this is a good place to go just be sure to sit far far away from the bar
This is a quiet place usually not too busy the gentleman who runs the front is a great multi-tasker and extremely nice
They had a good selection of wines and some you don't normally find on wine lists at every other place in town
Please hurry up and go get some sweet sweet cupcakes from this great place
It's a great dance spot and a great place to hang out with friends
This is a great place to do some easy walking/hiking
If you're in North Central Phoenix this is a great place to see a film
It's definately a cool environment they have a couple couches and its a great place to dine in and bring your friends
The wine was good and we both liked the service and atmosphere
It's great if you don't like to cook or know how to cook-- I am thinking this place was made for the single man with finer tastes in food instead of going to the fast food drive thru
The street may not have the frills of some of the other places but the quirky atmosphere and the great quality of the boba makes up for that
So if you want true New Mexican food this is the place price wise it is great you get alot of food for pretty cheap
He made up for it by suggesting items on the menu and being diligent the rest of the night and the atmosphere was a little more relaxed than I remember
The good news for Tiny's is that they have changed the model all the previous occupants were basically fast food hamburger type places
But the atmosphere the clientele and the karaoke host  were absolutely bad ass
From fall through spring the Greenbelt is the best place for a bike ride jog rollerblade Frisbee golf or just some good old people watching
And great with directions the place is huge you need directions
Don't let the dumpy exterior fool you this place is clean service great and you will come back for mas
If you enjoy breakfast and you enjoy cute little restaurants you will like this place
I decided to google this place only to find out that Chef Beau Macmillan acclaimed a the kalamata sandwich from there as his bad boy favorite
OK so first off the service was good and the place was clean except for the area in front of the soda machine
Now I understand that this is just a take out place that is very similar to say a taco bell or Del taco but the food is bad at these places as well
Sorry but the only person crazy here is me for thinking this place was going to be good
The place is small clean and cute We were able to be seated immediately but we ended up waiting an hour for our food
Overall it's just a great place to go for any occasion
We're back in Phoenix this weekend ready for some good food and after seeing this place on Man vs
We happened upon this great place while in town
Ok so wanted to try this place out since I heard they were really good so I did and man I should have gotten the whole scoop on how long there wings take
Even though it's a typical breakfast chain it's a great alternative to other fast food places like McD's or BK
The place was very clean with a great server who was very attentive and offered great suggestions
I kept hearing good things about the place and they're popping up all over Phoenix so I decided to give it a try
They were reasonably fresh-tasting but not good burger place fresh
My friend refers to this place as Hitler's Bunker but I choose to see the romantic side of Kazimierz
Getz Better is a great place to heal both your body and mind
For the first time in weeks my wife got to have dinner without the kids and decided to got out for on of our favorites Thai and try a new place -- Bad Idea
This place was so good that I went there two days in a row last week
The atmosphere is great on the patio I have yet to dine indoors there as it's usually gorgeous outside so why pass up the chance to enjoy the weather
If I were a person who ate out more House of Tricks would definitely be on my 'Visit Often' list as they have a small but variety-packed menu that constantly changes fantastic service and a great atmosphere especially for a warm summer night or a nice spring afternoon
Maybe a good alternative to Four Peaks since they're perpetually packed although some people may be scared off by the atmosphere here
They have a great variety of wings which are all really good and they have some good beer on top plus they show pretty much every college or professional sporting game taking place around the nation on their dozens of plasma TVs
this place would be really great to take a date
So if you're just generally in a shopping mood or a browsing mood you're in a good state of mind for this place
It's a great place for dates business lunches or just some great take-out
One day I'll learn how to write a review that's short and sweet but I kept thinking of good things to say about this place
Very good place to eat with a date if you are in the area
If you want a good new taste and amazing food Chino is a good new place to try
5 starsATMOSPHERE --- 4 starsPARKING --- 1 starOregano's isn't bad nor terribly good --- but it falls in the middle as an average lunch or dinner option
Dark atmosphere good food good variety of wine
The atmosphere is always friendly and casual and to be honest a hell of a lot like the atmosphere you get at a great German beer hall like Hofbrauhaus
A great place to take mom granny or your favorite tranny
Our party arrived on a Friday night--we were in the area a little lost for a good place to go
I remembered this place as a good hangout spot on a weekday night which it definitely is
So this is a great place for breakfast even for us late risers
Finally I found a good pho place around town
If you want good cheap food here's a place to go
I've paid double or more to eat at some other Indian restaurants around tempe and I can honestly say that this was just as good if not better than those places plus the variety of a buffet is nice
I love going to new grocery stores and just wandering and checking out the things they have and this place has really good stuff
The last time I was there they had one female barber so I know they do female cuts and they are a great place for kids too with the TV as a distraction
I was a little nervous since sometimes when people stress about how great a place is then it never lives up to your expectations
This is a fun experience and the desert is a great place to ride
This is a casual place that has a better menu and drinks than a red robin or a chili's
A good place to meet up with friends or sit in the bar and take in a game
Party rock is to have a good time but this place left me losing my mind
Overall a good place when trying to meet someone downtown
When I walked inside I really liked the old house feel but the place could have seriously used a good scrubbing
Went to this place in hopes of finding some great com tam
This is a great place to get consistent asian food
If you're looking for a great italian deli/grocer etc you gotta try this place
It's casual and definitely a local spot but you never feel out of place
I am a Southern California native I KNOW good sushi and this is by far the best place in Tempe to go
The mall is not always the best place to find good food but Wildflower is a hidden gem in the Chandler Fashion Mall serving up fresh good food that's moderately priced
I ordered the house burger w/mac & cheese - it was good but I've certainly had better at several places
Positives  decent beer/wine selection I liked the atmosphere open air bar & grill type of placeNegatives  bad service mediocre food pricey dinner entrees kind of a boring menuWill I go there again
i won't come here for their korean bbq as its good but there are 2 other places i know that does better
We had heard great things about this place from friends we trust so we decided to check it out
Its the kind of warm cute fuzzy place that makes me want to puke
I do not buy artwork to match the color of my couch and I do not need to eat a a place that tries way too hard to be cute and safe and makes me want to hurl
First off I feel bad giving this place just three stars
There are lots of candles and can be romantic place
Foothills Park is a great place for anyone in the NW valley looking for a place to take their dog
I find it difficult loving places that are in strip centers with grocery stores next door - just doesn't really scream fine dining - but it is a comfortable laid back environment and I would easily recommend it for grabbing a casual sushi/japanese dinner
The whole place was relaxed not too crowded and although there definitely was a hint of Phoenix 'Of course I know where all the cool spots in the valley are
I have no idea how this place gets such good reviews
The best ones are always in the last place you'd expect to find a sushi spot let alone a good one
I noticed small firepits scattered throughout the patio area which looked like a great place for happy hour
My sister had been talking about how great this place is but it's a little out of the way for me so I didn't get a chance to check it out until recently
After being to Zinburger last week and having tested out a lot of great places in the area we will for sure keep this place on our list of fun burger joints and are excited to returnOh and happy hour is 330-630 so half off appetizers and we got some great beer specials
Wonderful food excellent service great atmosphere
To sum up Good place to dine-in or take-out best dogs in Arizona and possibly the best sliders anywhere
LOVE THEM- the food is great and unique - you probably haven't had anything like it and you need to change that- I don't know what a beaver has to do with anything but he's cute so who cares- Don't let the weird plaza scare you the place is great and you should definitely eat in to get the full experience crazy how good the food is becoming in this weird plaza - Ted's Papaya wow
I asked what kind of cuisine is it she said you'll see and I was thinking great one of those trendy little uptown places that are popular because of their local art bland food and pathetically small portions I was still pouting see
Did I catch Pancho's at a good time or are my standards just different that those of the other people who have been to this place
If your goals are to put in a good solid hour of no bullsh**t working out then this place is not for you
Cartel Coffee Labs is a great place with a fantastic product
The food is great the restaurant has a very cool atmosphere the wait staff is extremely friendly and they offer great daily specials
It was really good I like the mixed greens in place of the usual romaine and although I didn't taste much cilantro it had great flavor
Probably not a bad place to visit if its not crowded which should not be a problem
Also we had vouchers for replacement slings on our original set that we never used because the slings always looked as good as the day we bought them and they'd expired but because we were buying the glider and wanted matching fabric they honored the vouchers
Hey it's Phoenix; you need to escape the 100 plus degree scorching weather in a casual place
Devil's is a fun place to get stupid and have a good time in a casual setting
This place is good and the sushi is cheap
Beautiful place great rooms amazing service delicious food relaxing spa and a ton of cool activities
there sandwiches are very good and different than what you will find at the other places
I have found that there is a serious lack of good restaurant places especially non-chain restaurants
I am happy to say that Riga Tony's is a lunch place that frequent and always have a great experience at
I have found that there is a serious lack of good restaurant places especially non-chain restaurants
I am happy to say that Riga Tony's is a lunch place that frequent and always have a great experience at
Staff is friendly and quick and the place has a great clean homey vibe
I just love this place and haven't had a bad meal or bad service here
I had a good review for this place out of some misguided sense of loyalty because I live around the corner from it
It has so much potential and is in such a great location but Alice has just gotten so lazy complacent and uncreative about it that it's no longer worth associating my good name to it
I absolutely loved this place and have now gone back 3 more times to take every person who visits me and wants great Mexican food
Prices seem reasonable as well so it looks like I have found a good go to breakfast place
Bang for the Buck 2/5- I believe there are better places in Phx that have more creative dishes just as high quality food and good service
Not sure how people call this place romantic
This place has great lunch specials  My total bill with drink included came to $11
I had a vanilla black tea which was so good and my bf had a white mocha which was way better than most places
There are many places out here that are really not that great but because growing up these poor bastards had no good food are way over-rated at this point
I would recommend this place to anyone who wants great ice cream
It seemed like a great place to enjoy dinner and drinks on a beautiful evening
it IS a great place to meet with people -- much more room to chat than most starbucks or other chains and you can spend a few bucks on a beverage instead of going to a restaurant and feeling like you need to scurry away when you're done eating
This is a place that seems to have truly captured the bistro essence - a perfect blend of high-end food and service in a very cool casual environment
I just wasted $20 that I could have spent at many other great places like The Golden Buddha and I probably would've ate more food over there since I wouldn't have gotten sick
After all this is Phoenix there has to be a good place right by me
I will continue to come back when I go out to eat with friends because it is hard to find places with good vegan options where you KNOW that it is vegan and not cooked in butter
IN SUMMARY long wait times employees standing around not helping customers like the other reviews bad traffic flow disrespectful employeesTHE ONLY GOOD THING GOING for this place was the bagel was decent
If you're in Scottsdale then this is a great place to stay
Jason's Deli is a great place to go before a movie at Shea 14
They have a ton of delicious options so it's a great place to go with a group
I never paid any attention to this place cause it's in a strip mall next to a circle k but upon closer inspection I fount that it has a nice little patio with tiki torches and the inside has a great atmosphere very inviting kind of a dark tiki lounge feel
Bandaids indeed; this place hurts and not in a good way
I had already decided what to have - I'm a creature of habit when it comes to sushi so I placed the order sat back and relaxed to enjoy reading my book
Fun atmosphere great music nice staff standard-priced drinks
I did like the chips and salsa and the atmosphere inside wasn't too bad for a casual mexican fast food joint
As far as I'm concerned this is the only place to go in the Valley for good looking comfortable shoes at a fair price when you have hard to fit feet
If you're looking for a great place to take a date or just a nice place to have a GREAT meal visit Roy's
I have eaten a fair amount of Caribbean food and I while I thought this place was good for Phoenix I was not all that impressed
This place does a nice job accommodating people on NFL Sundays and the service is good considering the packed house
D&E has decent food and a very good burger combo but the place does toy with the menu a lot
great place to impress a chick that night but thats it
Scale of 1-10 single visit5 Food5 *Drinks*6 Service8 Atmosphere6 ValueI'll go back because it had a quirky-factor that I liked and b/c I need to try a burger to really gauge the food but there were no drink specials sorry cheap domestics doesn't cut it and my overpriced Frito Chili Pie wasn't good
A little pricey but if you love yourself a good Chicago-style italian beef hot dog or polish then Luke's is the place for you
I don't even think they are the greatest but for some reason they have been better than most places I've tried
There are too many great places I can eat in this area that I don't need to deal with swooshing flies off of my food every three seconds
The service is also excellent -- the checkout person I talked to today kept going on and on about what a great place Sprouts is and how good it is to work there
I mean this place is never that busy even though there is usually a pretty good crowd in here on any given night but unless you have boobs or hang out at this place on a regular you pretty much get ignored I go here probably at least once or twice a month with friends and it is the same every time
I like that this location is close to my office and I was headed to Culver's before I came here but that place smelled so bad inside I had to walk out
I also like the atmosphere here it is a nice clean casual looking place and comfortable to enjoy a quick lunch
I don't know about you but gelato always puts me in a good mood and this place is no exception
This place is great for football - they have plenty of screens and give you a TV layout of which games are on which TV
Great food good atmosphere and just an all around fun dining experience give Don and Charlie's five stars
The ambience is very cool and is great for a special occasion or business dinner

This place delivers quality food with great service
it is pricey but if you are with a group celebrating or with your loved one it is a great place to go

It has a great atmosphere good drinks and good food
I liked the atmosphere and the beer list was really great
If you are looking for good BBQ this is the place
I have been to this place 3 times and each time it has been just great
my parents use this as their mini-vacation place for the pools and great room rates
Now you are becoming a has-been a place that if it weren't for the good brew you would be just another forgettable restaurant
Good place to walk around on a date as well
this is a great place to watch football and get a few beers
Pro Nice ambience/ good menu selection / good serviceCon the Viet
I really have mixed feelings about this place because the food is quite good but really overpriced for the portion size
They have a pretty good garden burger and their buffalo chips french fry-ish things are really good
I noticed this place getting good reviews on Yelp and decided to try them out yesterday for lunch
I will be honest in saying that I haven't been to this place in quite sometime but I still like to remember the good ol' days on the water log rides and on the small lil coaster my mom would allow me to ride
If going to an Old Town dance factory is an inescapable 'must' then this place isn't so bad you'll be wishfully glancing at your watch for the world to end
It didn't blow me away but for lunch it's a good standard place to pick
I thought I'd have a good shot at finding a decent place since I moved to the heart of an Asian community that is saturated with nail salons
I went to this place based on reviews and either I have really good taste buds or the other reviews were written by people who haven't experienced great food before
For vegans vegetarians or meat-eaters this is definitely the place to go if you want hearty food a good cider or beer and a hip place to eat
NoRTH is a great place to go for lunch or happy hour if your near Kierland
Strangely enough though the crust was crunchy in the right places and the fennel gave the sausage a great kick it was the onions that did it
The Ho's restaurant/lounge Cafe Zuzu is great to enjoy high-end American food and at night is a cool/chic place to lounge and have a drink
It's a very cute place with great customer service
My margaritas and I had several different types definitely tasted different than any of the many margaritas I've had all over the place not bad but maybe just weak and lacking tequila with certainly a different kind of flavor than I've ever had before
I can't say enough good things about this place
Lots of food and fairly quick for a sit down restaurant this place had great service and is a treat on road trips
Maybe I ate at a different restaurant than the other people or once they got through the soft opening  they gave up because this place was not good
For those of us that work in the downtown area this is a good place to stop for a drink after a long day in the office
They used to have really good tea but nowadays they use some sort of syrup thingy that a lot of other places are converting to instead of brewing which sucks
It is a safe place to live close to great shopping & restaurants and the grounds are always beautifully maintained
First off I must assume that the good reviews for this place are due to the fact that most people in Arizona aren't familiar with authentic Pub Grub
Always been a good casual and fun atmosphere every time I've gone
It was a good place but there is no meat so if that what you are looking for you should go elsewhere
Wasn't my favorite place but it wasn't bad
People are going to get stuck going here to see local bands they like but just know the place is not a good venue so don't expect much
What great service they come out to your residence or place of business to repair or replace your windshield
I love the atmosphere of sitting up at the bar the guys behind the counter are hysterical and great to talk to while you wait for sushi
The sound has always been pretty good at this place which is perhaps one of the saving graces
The Village Roastery in the same plaza is a great place to enjoy some coffee while waiting for a table at Butters
Otherwise I generally try to avoid this place like the plague while there are usually a few cute girls here they're usually a bunch of vapid retards whose admittance into ANY college leaves me totally amazed
I have to admit that after living in Chicago for 30 years I never found a place there that's still open that makes a bagel as good as these are
I would say that if you enjoy a good bagel you don't want to miss this place
It's also a good place to come if your internet at home is down because they offer free wi-fi
I have been back to Cartel many many times now and this is one place that truly is as good as it gets
Good atmosphere with some aesthetic appeal
Since a good portion of the conversation I heard taking place was in Chinese I was hopeful that that this would be an experience similar to what I'd get in Seattle's international district
It is lacking in atmosphere but I'll give that up for consistently good food
I can't say enough good things about this place or the owners
The sandwich was great the service was awesome the place was clean and comfortable
I honestly cannot tell you how bad I hate this place
Great Job on the new place and my compliments to the whole team
This is also the place that a man actually said to me Your legs would make a great scarf
The only bad thing I have to say about this place is it is quite large
I'd expect to pay that at a club at night but it's not a place I'd stop by again during the day for a casual bev with friends
The place is staffed with cute girls in nurse costumes
I can't think of one bad thing to say about this place
This place is great for eating family-style  and trying out new things and the owner/chef Esther was incredibly gracious and welcoming
Not a romantic date place for sure and not so much fun for the family with kids either unless one takes a bunch of boys here to celebrate their bar mitzvahs
Also there's plenty of nice places to eat and a really good internet cafe nearby
It's a great place to socialize and kick back with a cold glass of Framboise try it if you're in the mood for something fruity
Atmosphere music contemporary and service all good
This place just needs a good general cleaning and a little training for the staff
The area has a classy yet relaxed and fun atmosphere
So after a movie or some easy shopping Kabuki is a good place to go to have a couple of sake bombs and a few light apps
Though I prefer to stay closer to home when I go out for NFL Sundays I wish I could come here more often as it seems to be the official home away from home for all displaced Browns fans in the greater Phoenix area so that's a big plus
I wanted to give this place at least 3 stars but the bad service completely overshadowed my experience at this restaurant
Overall a very solid place with great service that will provide a very pleasant night
This place gets packed and sometimes when it gets all hot sweaty and crowded I get panicky like I need a good slap in the face to calm down
Perfect example of a great restaurant that lives in a crappy place
This place is not to be confused with PATSY Grimaldi's which is in SCOTTSDALE but also quite good
The atmosphere is a little trying to be trendy but it's a chill relaxed place nonetheless
There was quite the crowd Saturday night which made it loud but it had a very fun atmosphere and is definitely a good place to go for wine with friends
The food here is great but I'm inspired to review the place because of the service
This is a good place to go if you wanna save money but not so much if you don't feel like smelling your neighbor
There is only one bad thing about this place the staff is all 70lb teenage girls which can be annoying because they seem to be in quite the hurry to turn tables oh
There is boat rentals dry storage wet storage and even a great place to eat
Fun atmosphere good food and large portions
So sweet to the kids great Iced tea my only wish is that this place was bigger
The noise level is pretty high but it is a great place to start your day
98 South under the old ownership was a good place to go for solid American food
The food is good the atmosphere is nice
My only reason for not giving this place the 4 stars it earned with its great food is due to the service
This place has great service most of the time
Atmosphere- VERY relaxed and some could argue too relaxed if you like a little structureOther- plenty of room to dance between the booths jenga decent music but best of all $1 Donkey Punch shots all the time
customer service was great it's a family owned local joint so it's def a place to respectably spend your moolah
This is a perfect place for a nice romantic dinner on the patio
This place is good for any type of meal and is even open for drinks late at night No
It is exactly the type of place that belongs tucked away downtown under a nondescript purple awning across the street from a pretty rad record store and one that can always promise an excellent meal for a good price
Guess what guys there is a great place you can take your laptop and 30 textbooks and study in peace and quiet
Downfall is the lack of good places I felt safe parking my bike
It's a great place to stop for lunch or if you don't feel like making dinner
Suede atmosphere is casual but still trendy which is what I enjoy more then other places
I had nothing bad to say about this place except for I don't think people know much about it since it's tucked into a stripmall next to I think a dry cleaner or some other inane business
We just got the cheese for our first time because if a place has good CHEESE pizza all of the rest of their pizza will be good
Fair warnings about this place the service is to good and if you do not like that type of thing with 10 people fawning all over you you might not like it here
They are VERY good at the details which I've had other nail places take little notice of
We wanted a good meal for our last night and were encouraged to read some of the reviews of this place
The energy in this little place is incredibly positive and the techs are all good
And you know this place is great when two really really fat people walk in
as we parked i noticed a very large garden area with dozens of raised beds and the chef perusing the goods for the meals
Flos is a great place for Chinese AJs is an award winner grocery store and Chipotle is Chipotle
This is a great place to go spend your day
There were only about 5 other people in the place which is good because I like to have my choice of seat and don't like to wait for drinks and service
It stuffs the best bits of the garden into a mozzarella marinara and Parmesan wrapped envelope of goodness that has to be tasted to be appreciated
Prices are reasonable and I just can't say enough about how good this place is for lunch especially in this area
Anyway I have not been the biggest fan of the AZ Center in the past but this place totally did the job and set a good tone for the night
The beer was good though but thankfully you can get that at a dozen other places throughout the valley
An out-of-the-way joint with good food good atmosphere and good services without the Scottsdale attitude
We were seated outside on the cute retro-inspired patio on couches in front of a pretty fireplace
The place has vintage clothes for sale which is unique and appropriate for a crowd that loves both good coffee and raiding thrift stores
It used to be a friendly happy family atmosphere with good food awesome service and bubbly fizzy soda
All in all good eats in a great atmosphere with a very friendly and knowledgeable staff
In search of a good place open on July 4th I stopped in with a friend already craving that delicious sandwich
The place was pretty empty so I don't really know why service was so bad
Ingredients are fresh service great and atmosphere really kinda special but once again the pizza isnt that out of this world
I just wish the rice was better quality but it's still a great place to get good Szechwan food
We had heard about this place being good so we were exited that we just happened to be near it that day
The service is great everyone is very friendly and the atmosphere is awesome
It's right by my house and I really like trying new places and cuisine so I'm always thinking of somewhere new to go but it's great just to have an old standby that's consistently a good time
This is my go to place for work and casual clothing
It sucks that a place could be so good that they have back lash from hipster hating self loathing wanna be hipsters in denial
Great place to have a party or family get together
So it's not a bad place to go but you can get the same quality for cheaper elsewhere
Probably a great place for families as it seemed like a safe place for kids to gather in the courtyard and play in the pool
It was a great place for my cousins and I to sit around the firepit and get caught up on all the family gossip
The atmosphere is a little upscale but still casual and quite relaxing
It's a great little fast food place with pretty good portions
I wanted very badly to LOVE this place but was very underwhelmed with the choices we made for dinner
If you are looking for a quiet romantic sort of place keep looking because once this place fills up it starts rockin
so Sam's Cafe is probably one of my favorite lunch places to go in Phoenix I would go alone just for the fresh made chips and salsa they bring to your table the menu items here are quite unique and to say the least are good for the most part
The place is like a fancy sports bar inside with great classic rock music playing
First the good prices are very reasonable wait-staff and servers are very friendly the place is immaculately clean lots of interesting salads sandwiches and panini
But if you're looking for a low-key spa with friendly attendants clean facilities and a great deal then you should check this out this place
No one had brought us a cocktail menu even though the place is known for great cocktails so we asked for one
And the music was pretty good and there was a place to actually dance if you wanted to
This is virtually identical to any Hyatt placefairly modern a good size room with a separate living room free wi-fi complimentary spartan brekkie
I'm glad that there is a good pizza place close by to my new home
I think this is good for a family style place
They have plenty of TV's set up around the place but you don't have a good view of all of them so Zipps isn't really the kind of sports bar you'd want to go to see all the games
This is a great place to try some traditional Mexican dishes that don't commonly show up on the menu at other Mexican places in the Valley
Sure the food is pretty good service is fairly quick and the people seem nice enough but I have no idea how this place can function as a restaurant
I mean any place that decides to name themselves after a reference in SNL's Olympia Cafe sketch should be good right
For some coffee places it's too much to ask for great coffee AND great pastries but this place offers both and more
the Rokerij is  a great date place but only plan on bringing someone you are really into otherwise later when you break up you may have an embarrassing encounter there and perfect for the holidays
The food is excellent the prices are rich and it's a great place to loiter
It was a very good experience and I would recommend this place highly to anyone
Admittedly Someburros is a chain restaurant and it isn't like many of the great sit down/server mexican places we have around Phoenix metro but for what it is I thought it was great
My husbands pizza was also delicious according to him If you want a place you don't have to wait at fight for seating and get great lunch specials
All in all a great place and I'm looking forward to going back
This is about as good a place I've found in a while
The line on a Wednesday was 4 or 5 people in  which first made me think it must be a great place
Coco's is a great little diner/cafe/restaurant around to corner from Grams place and I will tell you I was definitely the youngest gal in the join staff not included
I think this place has great potential it's just getting the form and function to align be consistent in your advertising message with the product you give to your consumer
The fish tasted like it had been soaked in grease and had no flavor the soup tasted like someone just threw tomatoes in the blender and there was just nothing good about the place
Go in when they first open to get them fresh out of the oven This place has the most exciting assortment of baked goods compared to other coffee shops that only offer sad overcooked cookies stale scones etc
Good luck finding a seat during happy hour especially Thurs and Friday this place gets packed
In fact this place was the first bistro that I learned to appreciate great wine
Obviously the rest of Tempe knows just how great this place is
It would definitely be great place to take a date just not a first date where you have to actually act interested in what they are saying
I was walking down the street back to the crappy motel feeling frustrated and I saw this place was still open which was cool since it was after 10pm I thought they kept good hours
I don't mean that in a bad way I just mean they don't stand out compared to other places in town
After being here for over 2 years I'm either finding some good places or my taste-buds have lost their touch
Woodlands is not the best place ever but the dosa was good enough to make me want to come back to try the other types of dosa
I've noticed a lot of ppl critiquing the decor but heck it looks like a lot of the great places in Artesia the little India area located in L
It's a great community place to be outside enjoy our co-residents of the Valley and support local businesses
I read a lot of good reviews about this place mostly that it was clean and cheap so on my trip to Phoenix I thought I'd check it out
I've eaten at almost all their eating places the Smoke House - GREAT burgers and fries the Beer/Wine has great selection the salad bar always has a variety of salad toppings - organic too
Still it's a great place that's rarely crowded the enclosed patio is nice and the food's wild
Ever been to a place where you can say damn I've never had a bad meal there
If you are looking to catch a college football game and get the big stadium experience Sun Devil Stadium is a pretty good place to start
That felt good to get out of my system and keep this in mind the next time you decided to try and visit this place
Overall this place great for a mid day lunch of evening meal
It was fun and a great place to socialize and drink some expensive beer
If you like home made pasta flavorful sauces great wine and all the other elements that make a great Italian place - this is it
Other than that definitely  a great place for to grab so Pho
I have been looking for one thai place that just jumps out and hits all the right taste buds and reminds me of the great thai I would find in the Pacific Northwest
The chicken satay was great and the peanut sauce was perfect and not just peanut butter with chilli paste like most places
Whether you're new to golf or a veteran like me who just likes to have fun Shalimar is a great place to play
That being said I think this is a good place to take families and kids
The food is the greatest the service is always great and there's just something about the place that makes it feel like you're at a family friend's
Despite it being a hangout for the 20's crowd this isn't a bad place to bring your kids
I have been wanting to try this place for awhile now since I have been hearing and reading great things through yelp
As a rule if you go to places that get 4 or more on Yelp then you're typically safe and very good
Kazimierz is a great place to catch up with friends or take a date it's cozy unique and provides a nice atmosphere for conversation
The staff is friendly the place is clean and the food is good
Great place to go to enjoy some good food bar foods and drinks
It was cute too as much as a school lunch-line type place can be
But don't get me wrong the atmosphere is great
Not your average run of the mill Mexican food place so don't expect the usual boring fare expect A LOT of awesome tasting food at great prices and they have kid friendly choices to boot
I'd recommend this place to everybody visiting East Valley or Greater Phoenix in general
Yet somehow Gallo Blanco located within the Clarendon Hotel in Central Phoenix manages to pull off all of these things with an inviting atmosphere great food for a very fair price a great lunch for $10 and a recurring local customer base i
This place just opened and is located behind Gangplank where I work a lot and Yoli's brought in some breakfast samples for us to try out - good stuff btw
Would definitely be a great place to take a date or to impress family or business clients
Everyone gave this place the best reviews and well although I may be raving about it this place is really good
Extremely knowledgable baristas high quality coffee excellent atmosphere great location
So this place barely satisfies my criteria for a gym - all the weights I need decent locker room good price thanks to Costco and more important than anything it's convenient thereby minimizing any excuse I have to wimp out and miss a workout day
The only negative is that sometimes it gets a bit loud w/kids running everywhere but overall a very pleasant casual place for any occasion
Beyond that waiters will even snap your picture and place it for you in a cute Roy's themed frame
This place can be romantic if you want it to be but you could also enjoy a group of friends here
This place is so strange looking but the food was great
I wanted so badly to like this place and in a way I really did
And then I discovered that while this is a great little place to eat don't expect to hold a conversation with your friend or date - it gets LOUD inside
This place isnt bad and its a great alternative to Chompies
Seriously this place is spotless and more organized than the alphabetized labels facing out canned goods in my kitchen cupboard
Overall I would say this is still a great place to stay and although it is a big resort and so spread out it is good for you to walk
It is a great place to go when you want high end food without the high end hassle
When we first entered there was a pretty bad smell to the place
Overall the food is good but the atmosphere is lacking
This is a great place for lunch and groups just be aware that they are closed on Tuesdays I learned that lesson the hard way and ended up consoling myself at Elmer's Tacos
I dont know the place is not terrible in my opinion but there are too many good restaurants around here to spend $25 a head to eat average tacos and chips and salsa
If you are out and about in this area this is a pretty good place to stop and try
It's a great place to go for league bowling and kids birthday parties
The atmosphere was very relaxing service was outstanding and price for portions were great
If you are looking for a trendy place with a great variety of food this is the place to eat
This place is clean and all the groomers seem super nice and the dogs seem to be in good spirits
The service is incredibly attentive the atmosphere is rustic/casual-chic and the food is both delicious and reasonably priced
i gave this place 5 stars even though my mojito was really not good at all despite their status by the new york times
I would highly recommend this place for some good Cantonese cooking
I don't have much bad to say about Boulder's but since there isn't an ability to give a fractional star this place gets 5
I was curious to try this place since it received a good review from Howard Seftel in the AZ Republic
The ambiance was nice somewhat more modern than what I like but it was warm and cozy and I thought it would be a great place to come back to when the nights are cooler and they have their doors open
This patio might not have the beach but it has everything else to the equation including pitchers of margaritas and a great atmosphere for a weekend meal of decent Mexican food
However I had been looking for a place with good crepes in AZ and had yet to find one - so I figured eh I'll try it out
I am smiling as I walk in and walk out  so you know this has got to be a good place
-pBut seriously Lux is a great place to go for that cup of coffee you're craving but consider yourself warned as others have mentioned; Lux is almost ALWAYS busy so seating and even waiting for your order can be rather inconvenient think Grand Central Station busy on weekends
This seems like it might be a good place for a Happy Hour too although that isn't when I visited
Place is cute I recommend carrying out and parking is kinda tight
Definitely a cute spot and not a half bad place
that was in Tempe Royal Coffee is a great little place to get away from the mainstream scene to enjoy a great espresso
This was a great place for Phoenix OpenCoffee to meet and I hope we return again
Right up my alley as far as places on the nicer end if I had to categorize establishments - upper end of casual I suppose
That's a fair and true statement and given that the food is very good factoring in everything quality of food service atmosphere you get what you pay for but I'm going to give extra credit because this place keeps it real and doesn't try too hard unlike other places
Overall the food was yummy and the atmosphere and service very good
If you are going to get a cleaning great place
I kept hearing about this place from some good friends of mine
Defalco's is a great place for a quick bite or even an intimate evening for a couple who doesn't want the hassle of a restaurant
This place has always been great but it's even extra super cool now that the light rail passes right next to it
Pretty bad when the gal at the counter knows my order  We have yet to be let down by this place
The decor is super cute - you can tell they put a lot of time and effort into the atmosphere
I was worried about the traffic on 7th street being so loud but it wasn't even an issue- the patio had such a great atmosphere with the lights and the warmers
Great place if you are on a budget and starving however if you want quality sushi and willing to pay for it I would look elsewhere
This is a great place to practice your French as there are people who show up who speak French as well as the owners
If you are in the mood for a good juicy burger exactly the way you like it- Cheeburger Cheeburger is the place for you
The salads soups entree's and pizza are consistently good and the atmosphere is lovely
Great place to eat when shopping at Scottsdale Fashion Square
For me a place has to have good music and a nice look about it
The atmosphere is very relaxed and the restaurant has been incredible clean every time I have been there
This is a great place and I recommend everyone try it
Not a bad place to stop at just don't leave your food attended
Finding this place was the closest thing I could get to good home cooked Jewish food
If you're looking for a classy place with great dinner dishes then this place is highly recommended just please dress accordingly and don't try wearing a hat not allowed
I've tried this place twice and both times it was pretty bad
Great atmosphere and it's outside so it's a different feel than most other bars
Dos has a great mix of music and doesn't just place the dance club hits
It is a higher end burger place but casual
A great place to watch a game shoot some pool and have a bite to eat
its a cute place definitely wasnt crowded at all
there breakfast menu looked good so i would say that this place is prob best for breakfast
The place is big and comfy and well over 100 food choices Everything i tried here was very good
Great interior decorating and a comfortable atmosphere
I LOOOOOOOVE the sweet potato fries =Overall great place to eat for Mexican food but not the best Mexican food around
They're pricey too but since they do have some unique dishes a great location and a nice atmosphere in general I wouldn't pass this place up
The prices looked good the sandwich choices looked more creative than Subway which I found out is a block from this place and there were people in there enjoying their sandwiches
If you want a good deal I recommend hitting up one of the many other all you can eat places as you get more options for about the same price
I was so surprised because of the great reviews this place has gotten and the overall environment
We had brunch here for the first time last weekend and it is SUCH a cute little place
Now perhaps it is one of those places that proudly does NOT encourage children in fact there is actually a sign on the back porch that says unattended children will be given espresso and a kitten which is good natured but still pointed   Anyhow it was a nice spot very picturesque with yummy food and coffee and we will likely go back - perhaps with out of town guests  and when we can leave our peanut with sitters so that we won't have to stress about seating for him
Maybe I don't get this place and why it has such great reviews
My first impression was that it was cute little place and yes it is a bit small but cute for a burger place
There is another good Mexican place nearby called Caroline but that's mostly a take out place that u want to order and pick up
This place is more of a sit down restaurant with great service and good food
Great place to try but I will not be returning
Both were good but again  both common plates you can get a lot of places
Not a very expensive meal good place to stop in and enjoy some drinks and apps
Cute outside space games and places for dogs
The service is always really good except for the other Saturday night but my dh talked to the mgr because we love Daves and we didn't want others to be disapointed and not come back because of they're experience if they got a waiter/waitress in training but the mgr of course made it right away and I'm sure all other guests of Daves that night had a great time  We will keep coming back unless of course I can find better bbq elsewhere  I doubt it but this place is so good I really don't want to try anywhere else for bbq especially ribs
Great place for lunch and near a great historic neighborhood to go walking around when finished to make up for all the tasty goodness in your belly
I normally don't write a bad review but I read somewhere that someone compared this place to Pizzeria Bianco so I had to try it since I live out near Verado
The atmosphere is awesome small nice decor nice music and great customer service
As with Roka Akor this place had great style in the decor but the food just was not very good
It is a quaint place  good for taking grandma out for an old fashioned sundae kids out for ice cream after eighth grade graduation  or stopping for a treat with your kids
Great food authentic country atmosphere homey-friendly service - it doesn't get any better than this in the Metro Phoenix area
First of all I thought the atmosphere was great
But I do think this is a great fun place to come for dinner with good food and great drinks
I'll keep this one simple great food and awesome atmosphere that's chill not pretentious but still super cool keeps me coming back to The Vig Uptown
Other good things nice patio area that's really indoors for hot PHX days fireplace area a bocce ball court the fact that it's in a repurposed 1950s bank building with a retro feel and the Vig Rig on weekends they will pick up/drive home if you want to drink a bit
Reasons to like Tempe Marketplace A They have a great selection of stores here
Not sure why all breakfast places can't make a good cuppa' joe but that should be a given
I give this place 4 stars because I haven't tried much of their food but I'm sure it's good and it tends to be super busy every time I stop by which slows the service
Minus the retard at the front door this is a great place to see a show
Their sweet tea was also great and I especially liked how it wasn't as cloyingly sweet as I've had at other places
The man referred to by other reviewers who runs the place was very courteous and not only did he help us get seated he also checked on us during our meal and made a point to say goodbye when we left
Great food good value a really nice place to kick back eat and relax
This place is on a very short list of one when it comes to ordering special event baked goods and its just around the block from me so Tammie Coe *is* my local bakery which entitles me to say in the words of Nelson Muntz HA ha
I also had a Green Corn Tamale A LACarte because that is one of my staple foods and I could get that I thought was a good barometer on a place by ordering this
Totally not a bad place but my experience was a bit tainted by one of the staff
Quiet but not to quiet great atmosphere but not too loud where it doesn't interrupt your conversation and of course the feeling where you know you are trying to impress or be impressed
I didn't see the bathrooms and couldn't comment on that but the food was all  good; first place in a long time the hamburger didn't taste like it had been frozen and microwaved my daughter said it was like at home the Reuben was the size I expected except the herb rye made it better than usual the salad was fresh and they actually had French dressing and the club sandwich was huge it will be dinner later
Located within walking distance of Bank One Ballpark MLB's Diamondbacks and US Airways Center NBA's Phoenix Suns Majerle's owned by three-time NBA all-star and local icon Dan Majerle is a great place to go before and after a game
And while the food is typical of most sports grills burgers sandwiches and fried appetizers for example it's a great place to unwind or to escape the Phoenix heat
The spontaneity of patrons singing duets with the bartender or serenading their dates to late-'80s pop ballads makes for a great party-like atmosphere
This place is very nicely decorated and the servers all seem to be very good and up to speed on serving
Great relaxed atmosphere full bar service the Margaritas looked fantastic
There are very few places to eat near the Capitol but La Canasta not only provides a place for a bite to eat but some good food as well
This place is definitely worth a try great ambiance for dates and good food
Sweets are one thing but a good 'ol greasy savory thing of meat is definitely more appealing to me in the first place
It's a great place to spend part of a day especially when the weather is nice
I would definitely recommend Corbin's as it's a great place to relax to have a couple drinks and/or dinner
I will give this place a try again -- it's on the way home from work it has a good feel plus they offer the Vesper did I mention that
Wasn't that bad but could've at least been placed closer to the middle
I don't ever think I have been to this place when it does not have a good group of people hanging out
The bar itself is typically quiet mellow and a great place for the evenings or weekend afternoons
I can't find anything bad about this place
I'd recommend this place for take-out casual meal or an intimate date
Despite being a nicer place as Asian food goes the prices are quite reasonable and it is really a great value
service was good and I loved the atmosphere outside
That IS a good sign of a good sushi place
No annoying fast food atmosphereno having to talk to waiters if you're not in the moodjust good quality pizza from a well run establishment
This place is wonderful -- great drink and food menu
So it can ONLY be a good sign when you walk into a place and see a giant wheel of Parmigiano-Reggiano right
Headed straight for a comfy couch and sat down completely relaxed by the atmosphere
Although most of these places offer Chicken Tikki Masala & Tandoori Chicken these two dishes here were just amazingly good
So if you're in the mood for a great burger or some quality wings check this place out
For me I like to know these things when I'm in a lounge type place I normally go for the dirty martini's or specialty drinks so it was nice to know not to order them as they wouldn't be that good
I'm probably a green rookie when it comes to good curry chicken having only experienced a few places' offerings
The place is cute and clean and the conveyor is just fun
The service is friendly and the beer is cheap overall it's a great place even for those like me who are not totally enamored of sushi
All in all this is a solid restaurant with a good atmosphere and good service
The atmosphere is relaxed the staff and patrons are friendly and we ran into a few people we knew
From what I could tell there are pieces to make this a great place but some work could be used on the food
The Chop an Chick is a great place to start a hearty pork chop that has been marinating in some sort of love most of the breakfasts are served with your choice of gold potatoes with rosemary and onions or hashbrowns eggs and toast from Tammy Co
This place is a great spot for tacos burritos and enchiladas
But if you want a quiet atmosphere with family ran business and some good Thai food
the pizza is just as good salads and desserts are better atmosphere is better and the longest I've ever waited there was an hour
This place is really good for breakfast decent but not great for lunch/dinner
The Botanical Garden was quickly becoming a great cultural institution for it's well planned and designed events its great variety of performers and entertainment and its ties to the arts community in the valley
Everyone is friendly and there's a casual atmosphere that makes you feel right at home
This is a great place to go for lunch or dinner if your in the area
Maybe it's because I've been to more really good sushi places since then but something just isn't working for me
So in short bad food bad service unappealing atmosphere and to top it all off an expensive price for a tasteless burger
This is my new favorite close Vietnamese place maybe soon I will try the pho since it seems to get pretty good reviews
I read a review on this place by Arizona Republic food critic Howard Seftel and it sounded so good I had to check it out for myself
Not bad but not filling and not as good as some other places I can name off the top of my head
We sat on the patio and the open atmosphere was great
The service was good and the atmosphere tries to re-enact modern hip fine dining
This place is to Greek food what Rubio's is to Mexican; not bad but leaves you craving the real stuff
Ice cream always sounds good on a hot Phoenix day but usually I leave unsatisfied after a trip to the self-serve froyo shops or places like Baskin Robbins
The wine flights are good but the pours are inconsistent and not as hearty as in some places
Another place I had heard great things about
The place had a great atmosphere adn was full of young folks and the young at heart
Great music walking into this place is a blast and if seeing lots-o-candy gets you buzzing then you're in the right place
The last time I came to this place was over 5 years ago and they had good food and good service
it's a great place for a date or a group
If you are looking for a nice place to get a burger and chill this is a good spot to check out
Cherry Blossom is a quaint place where you can watch the chef's at work and always good for a tasty meal
My only complaint with the place is the tables are a little close together but it's great if you want to hear all about why Facebook and Twitter are going to be the downfall of our society because of all the psychopaths using them or who did what with who the night before even though you don't know them or them
I can not say enough great things about this place
I would normally not review a local mom and pop type place badly but I was walking by and there was a jogger passing this place and the people at Conspire made fun of him yelled at him teased him  and laughed and him as he ran by
Very cozy casual just a great place to grab a bite a drink and unwind
I wish this place had some great view overlooking the city instead of the grocery store parking lot
The hot tea fresh food and a relaxing atmosphere were a great way to finish what was a long day at the office earlier
It was also a great place to catch the fight
If I'm back in the area I'd probably go check out some other places first but it was a good place that suited our needs
The place is clean the food is good the prices are reasonable specials appear to be a daily thing here and the service is pleasant and quick
For the price and experience- this is a great place
I live really close to Cafe Wasabi and I had heard good things about the restaurant from friends so I was hoping CW could be my go-to neighborhood sushi place
This place got an overhaul and looks great
I'm new to Phoenix and had just about given up on trying to find a place to go and sit and work around creative people AND get good coffee while I'm there
The place is nicely decorated and it is great for a first date
I chose this place because I was walking by to go to the salon next door which is a great salon by the way
The great combination of awesome food with a friendly attentive staff makes this a go to place
Indoor and outdoor seating in a sort of log cabin/ farm house setting cooked to order condiment bar very relaxed atmosphere
I checked out Yelp and found that this place was in walking distance from my home and the reviews were great
Bottom line is this place is in an area you would expect to find some good cheap authentic tacos but what you get is some beautiful delicious food and great ambiance
- the salsa that came with the chips tasted generic and canned- the menudo was a quarter chunk of a potato half of a carrot cut in two and some blobs of flavorless beef- the mexican pizza was soggy and chewy no not in a good way- the green corn tamale covered in chilli sauce is the only thing that made me think the kitchen can be betterLa Fonda Del Sol is a place that I pass by a lot
I have nothing but good things to say about this place
I think Chinese food comes down to what you like and what you order but I think this place is great
It's a cute little place with plenty of places to sit outside in the great AZ weather
this starbucks is a great place to sit outside and chill and chat up the regulars
At one time it was Great Wall vs C-Fu in Chandler and now with the emergence of more Asian power centres as well as an influx of Asians into the city there are more dim sum places like Phoenix Palace by Lee Lee Golden Buddha in the Cofco Center China King in Chandler and China Chan up north
This place in my opinion is pretty good and cheap
I'm partial to this place because my family has developed a good relationship with the servers at this place
All in all just really great food and a  unique atmosphere
All-in-all a good place and worth your time if you like a thinner floppy pizza with high quality toppings
I have been to places like this in Manhattan where they think they can survive on great food and reputation forever and that people will tolerate any attitude and disrespect for the sake of it
A perfect amount to share a great way to get to try a variety of different things and I didn't feel like I was going to have to roll myself out of the place
Still it is unique and a great place to take friends who are visiting from out of town
Service is usually pretty good although the last time I went and brought friends our waitress was all over the place and we waited a long time for our food
Things you might not know about ZuZu- most ingredients sourced locally- much of the produce is organic and bought seasonally from local farms- 95% of everything made from scratch in the kitchen including their awesome dinner rolls- pei mussels flown in fresh 3 times a weekSeriously seriously good place
The outside seating area is the perfect place to get a great view of Phoenix
Overall a nice white tablecloth wine good first date kind of place to go
This place could be great but needs a little improvement especially on the weekends
This place gives Cartel a run for their money with good drip as well as espresso drinks
Seems like a hip casual fun place to have happy hour/lunch/dinner
I think this place is great and has mass appeal
It would be a good place to start the evening and maybe impress some people visiting from out of town
That being said this place has a great outdoor seating area that allows patrons to sit at the bar outside
it works out pretty well except for the fact that we hadn't found a great chinese food place yet
I will never go back here and recommend staying away from this place despite the great reviews
I know the description says this place is not good for kids but I see kids in here all the time
Rustler's Rooste is a fun place to go for the ambiance it is however not a place to go if you are interested in a good steak
The only reason this place gets three stars from me is because the food is pretty darn good
Overall the food was good the staff was friendly the place was very clean and locals must like it too because there was a steady stream of people picking up orders
I'm giving it 4 stars because while quite good it wasn't the best I've ever had and the atmosphere was lacking a little
Being at a trendy place doesn't make you super cool so just chilax and have a good time or go home
The bar is great and the dining room is really well done the ambience is better than at the Capital Grille at the Biltmore
There are some good spots to set up with your laptop but I do wish there were more places to plug in
All in all it's a great public library and I'm glad that I can walk there from my place

It is a great place to go hang out and have a beer with friends but I would skip it for dinner
Great atmosphere great value for your buck and overall perfect place for a weekend lunch
I really don't want to drive very far to get my planting needs yet I have driven even farther and gone to great lengths to try to replace my relationship with Baker Nursery and I always come back - simply they have the best plants in the city the plants and shrubs are priced fairly the staff is friendly and knowledgeable and they don't mind my questions
An outside mall in Tempe unlike any other this place is pretty good
They have a good selection of places to eat and a pretty decent selection of the most popular retailers AE Victoria's Secret Hottie Oakley etc and even a Harkins
What this place does not have is good transportation within the different and spread out areas like a trolley or golf carts etc
Well I have this soft spot for the FOX restaurant group because they totally nail it when it comes to atmosphere decor and a great staff
I can get GREAT pizza and pasta at some other places in the valley and they may even be cheaper there
Too many other great places who want me to keep coming back
If they would get it right then this would be a great place
We went there a few times when it was the Tequila Grill and it was pretty decent then so we thought we would give this place a try some good reviews on Yelp but apparently for the club part of the equation
There are so many good places to get Greek food in Phoenix
Spicy but not too spicy and they both have great flavor not a flat chile flavor like some places
Not many Indian choices in Goodyear but lucky for them they have India Garden
The rolls are average nothing to write home about by home I mean Seattle so I guess I could be a bit bias  Overall this place is pretty good for the area but it is a bit on the high-price side
If you want a quick manicure that looks good then this place does the job
Quite frankly there is no other place I feel more relaxed welcomed and appreciated as a patron - and that says a lot for an establishment that specializes in cuisine I don't even consume
If you are looking for extra tasty popcorn to snack on or you want a nice little treat for someone this is a great place to go
If you are a middle aged person who has a family skip this place even though the food is good
However it's a very nice atmosphere with casual vibe and good music
Great atmosphere and design; we had a chance to sit upstairs which was unique
4 stars for good relaxing atmosphere great service good tropical drinks and good food
modified is still a great place to book/play/see a show though
It's a great place for lunch and I know I'll really enjoy my meal there
I really enjoyed the coffee house/market vibe of this place especially for such a casual meal
I hate even giving this place one star and only reason to justify it is because MY food was not horribly  bad
Overall bad food bad atmosphere unless you're 4-8 years old way too many crying 1-3 year olds when the lightening and thunder starts up and rude manager
And I wonder how long it's been since this place has gotten a good scrub or at least a dusting
If you're into the dive bar feel this is a great place to go
Overall - I mean it's a solid place for a good meal
You're not going to get AMAZING anything but it is a good place to head after HH
All in all I would recommend this place if you are going for sushi and having a good time in a cool atmosphere
This place has great quality groceries and produce and low low prices
Some things are just better when done outside this includes dining on the great patio at Chelsea's KitchenDuring my visit I did not see Chelsea if she is even real  however I did see the kitchen and most importantly I sat on the vine covered patio complete with a fireplace
As you begin migrating out to the patios with the cooler weather be sure to stop by Hula's-- it's patio complete with fire pit is a great place to hang out over a cocktail or two or even more  given its proximately to the light rail
Not my normal stop I usually go for fattening and strong flavors  Great place to have some pasta pizza and wings
Zoe's is a great place to go to when you dont want to cook dinner and you need something healthy
Not a bad place but a bit up and down sometimes really good others just SO SO
Their selection and price for a build your own omelette is really good and they DO NOT charge extra for egg whites only like other breakfast places
It is a normal breakfast place with a lot of good choices for breakfast and cheap for the amount of food you get
Zipps is also a great place for happy hour
is a self-delusional ploy at convincing yourself that your canned/frozen goods are better than other places' fresh goods
They also said my front 2 tires were bad and needed to be replaced which was true I knew that for a while
The Desert Botanical Garden is hands down the greatest place to get away in the city
The Garden brings in great musicians at night under the stars in the cool Phoenix air
Great place to drink anytime of the week or weekend
The manager that runs the place provides great service
My friend went with the southwest chicken clubIt came on sourdough and wasn't a subThey don't serve beer it isn't a pubJust a good place that makes good grub
It was a great night sleep a great refreshing stay and a place to get away from it all
If you are looking for a place to sit with your laptop that also has good coffee check out Copper Star down the street
Los Olivos is an absolute fun place to eat some good Mexican food yummy salsa and well prepared Margaritas
Open and FREEThis place has no culture like Cen Pho but it can be a good time
It's just a chill place to hang out with a great beer selection
The best place to get custard used to be Nielson's however the original owner sold the business and the custard is not the same so it was great to find Culver's that is pretty close to how Nielson's custard used to be
Its a great place with phenomenal artists
You know a place is good when you can barely find a spot to sit at and that's how Miracle Mile always is
However the pizza is still great as well as affordable and the atmosphere at this place is even better at night especailly on an amazing night like last Friday
This is the cutest little restaurant; it looks like an old house complete with real wood floors a fireplace and large windows making it light and airy
Bumping this place up to five stars since I have been here a couple more times and both times it was a great night
This place has an awesome vibe to it great food and wine and good service
The comfy couches and relaxed atmosphere make it a great place to just hang out with friends for hours
It's like a casual funky cafe dining place with gourmet nice restaurant prices
Anyway a good place to remember on North Central
reading etc and heaters or fireplaces for when it's cold or misters and fountains for when it's hot and a good relaxed yet lively ambiance around you
We wanted to go eat someplace that wasn't the usual Denny's/Ihop/Good Egg
Great place to go if you don't plan on talking
I come here too often to write a unbiased review   It is good food great service 80 percent of the time and just a great place to bring friends family and out of town folks to
It's got a chill outside seating area and it's just an all-around good place to grab some decent coffee and read a book
Atmosphere very cozy great for family or groups but they have a small seating area
My only complaint with the restaurant was that we were hoping for a relatively quiet romantic atmosphere
and if its to expensive go eat somewhere else thats in your budget and stop ranking on a place that serves good fresh quality food
The serving staff is always friendly and it's a really great place to go for a quick lunch that will break up the sandwich monotony of everyday life

I seem to always have a good time here so I can't say anything bad about this place
Obviously I'm not going to expect fine cuisine and classy dining at a place called Dos Gringos but being a fan of dives and being one with my fellow man it sounded like a good place to experience
Beer football on a mild evening in a place full of 56 pieces of tacky Mexican flair and a waitress with a great smile and I can't complain
Good place to shop-best Macysfor its fancy vintage& trendy menswear section and Dillards in town for wide selection
But a good place for those younger out of town friends who want to kill time hanging around and spotting Arizona girls
This place can get pretty loud if there is a band or music but overall this place is great and I highly recommend going for a bottle of wine post dinner
The prices are moderate and the service is great since the place is always deserted
It's a shame to see this once great place be turned into an average quality bakery
Nestled in the bad Xerox copy of Kierland Commons aka City North Press Coffee happens to be an original and pretty great place to get a quick morning breakfast or panini lunch at a reasonable price
They weren't huge but everything tasted great and when compared to a chain bagel place I felt I was getting a great value for the price
Overall I would say that Press Coffee is a great alternative to your typical chain bagel or coffee places
We just moved to phoenix from the  bay area of ca where we have  been eating great authenic chinese food from a great mom and pop chinese place for the last 5 years

I've been to all the hyped places; Z'Tejas Chevy's Gardunos Macayos Tia Rosas Carlsbad Tavern Blue Adobe Arribas Salty Senoria horrible Pink Taco deplorable
This is not to say this wasn't a good place it's just that I might not have the best view of what it's supposedly known for
The place is small so if you happen to go there on a hot summer day during a lunch rush you may not have the best experience however we sat outside on the patio and enjoyed a great lunch

It was a 50/50 shot I went to this place again instead of going to Firehouse Subs in the same plaza which I knew would be good
Liberty market has one of the greatest atmospheres
A casual place with about 15 or so tables inside a quaint market that you can peruse while you food is being made  I saw some past reviewers complain about how long it took to get your food while yes there is a wait it is because your meal is being made on the spot when you order it anyway walking through the market is a great way to spend that wait
I genuinely like this place for a few reasons and I keep coming back despite some small shortcomings so it must be pretty good
The service is great considering it looks like a simple order and sit-down kind of place where there are small extras that they provide like people coming around and asking if they can fill your drink or offering to clear your table etc
So great place to come if you want breakfast or a French Press cup of coffee
This is probably a bad place to be a vegan
This place is good for a sports bar around here but with the concrete floor and no sound absorbing surfaces anywhere it gets very loud and you often can barely here the people you are trying to talk to across the table
I like to scope out all the good pet places on yelp

It is not the cutest place - it lacks any real decor which is a shame at least it's not pretentious but what it lacks in atmosphere it makes up for with the food
Nice beer list friendly and attentive staff good food cool vibe everything about this place is great
the only thing i didn't like about this place was the price of their lattu00e9 it was the same price as starbucks or some other place and it didn't even taste that good
I thought the pricing was on par with every good sushi place that I have been too
Fun-looking place and good service but it is about the food after all
Great place to hang out and spend several hours
Don't let the shack-like appearance of this place fool you - it's damn good mexican food
The place is called The While Chocolate Grill so the dessert has to be good
So I research like a madwoman and call around to seven different places trying to find a place to submit my expedited app and low-and-behold this lovely post office is the only place in the greater Phoenix area that has an appointment within the next two weeks
Since the ingredients were really fresh the wait wasn't as bad as anticipated PB and the bar have a cute cozy atmosphere and the service was good I'd be willing to give it another try
It's not a fancy resort but it's  a great place to get a nice relaxing massage

Not for the faint of pocketbook as it was very spendy but great place and nice addition to Scottsdale dining

Strong tall drinks a kickass juke and great ambience rounds of the reasons it gets full billings
I am so thankful for yelp or I never would have found this place  We went on a Sunday Morning/afternoon and were seated fairly quickly the menu is huge and it all looked great I was very pleased I ordered the french toast yum
This is a very nice place with fresh homemade food including salads pizzas and yummy baked goods
Once you rise over this point you are at an area that is shaded for much of the afternoon and into the night due to the shadow of the sheer rock face next to the trail so it is a good place to stop for a while and grab a drink of water
I'm really surprised that this place doesn't have that many good reviews
If I lived around here it would be an easy go to place for happy hour w/great beer wine selection and cheap burgers for the carnies-it has a no nonsense charm that I can't seem to replicate in colour scheme except you could take a hipster and your dad here-and that is pretty rare around Phoenix
Please go here ONLY for the food and for the fact that I don't want this gem to close down from the lack of knowledge about this place's goodness before I have a chance to get back there
Too bad this place does not have a drive through
I had a Dollar bill in my wallet & left it on the table so that I'm not the bad guy here but screw this place

With that said Kokomo is a great place and they've set the bar pretty high for FroYo
But there is some good food inside the place
When i left this place i was stuffed and everything i ate was good
Overall the service was good and the place is really clean
This is a place that demonstrates the Alice Waters mentality that a dish is only as good as the ingredients
Another sign of a great place when they don't automatically steer you towards the most expensive item or recommend you buy things you don't need
In Mesa/Gilbert/Chandler area this place is as good as it gets for dimsum
It's a great place for an outing or a casual event and just sipping tea we ordered the Chrysanthemum Tea with flowers
At way less than other places charge it's a great deal and the friendly efficient service makes me always want to go back
The worst part about coming here for lunch is the parking if you come at noon it's quite hard to find a spot because of the two other great lunch places in the plaza
Great people watching place as you have students professionals artist all ages all ethnicities come together in this hipster joint
3 solid stars not bad not extraordinary not worth rushing back toTo me the Tempe Market place along with this restaurant are very very touristy
Overall great place to eat some authentic Venezuelan food
Even after all the years that have gone by since I moved the place is still great still busy as ever and still knows how to produce great food

2 mi away from a terribly overpriced trendy sushi only place that I found had terrible service and sushi that was not nearly as good as Shogun
That is too bad because the place is just screaming to be a success
First off let me say this place is so freaking cute on the inside
The Street is a great place full of personal expression with a wide range of delicious boba flavors - I love it
It's equally a great place for the date of a lifetime or an upscale hangout with friends there is a loungy area by the bar with live music
This is the place where waiters replace dropped forks before you've reached to grab it where they are talkative but make the best recommendations ever and where you will stop talking because the food is just too good to slow down for conversation
This all makes for a wonderful atmosphere charming during the day and romantic at night
My inability to muster clever language at 6 am aside this place really is great
I'm always on the lookout for good vegetarian places and this one was no disappointment
But if you have some time to sit down and enjoy and great lunch or dinner Fresh Mint is THE place
There needs to be a grip-load more places like this one around the valley where they make you feel like whatever dogfood they deliver to you on your plate you're gonna gladly pay the fee with a toothy smile on your face and say 'thank-you good sir' and 'yes i will kindly see a dessert menu'
Sure the place has atmosphere and a good drink menu but I prioritize the eats
It is a good deal and happening place on weekends
This place came highly recommended by the other couple we went with and to be honest we had such a damn good time with them that I hardly remember the food which does not say much for the food since I just ate dinner there last night
I only know that after two bad experiences with Danny's they seem to be a place that tries to make a quick buck on the first visit and has no interest in building a long term relationship with their customers
I was going to call this place a bad rip off of Richardson's and chastize it for being so until the owner told me she used to work for him and proudly stole some of his concepts
Great place to go on a nice sunny Phoenix day
Normally I feel bad about negatively reviewing a place but after experiencing negative customer service more than 5 times at that location i'd say it's safe to let it all out
We thought it would be a good starting place since it was more a lounge then a lounge/nightclub and somewhere new
This place was awesome - get past the fact that it is a Gas Station I say that a little tongue in cheek because to call this place a gas station is like calling Disneyland a Carnival because once you go inside it has a great dining area

The place was mostly empty but they still couldn't be bothered to have good service
The atmosphere is very nice and is good for a relaxing meal

As for the food itself the brisket had a great smokey flavor but it was dry in places and had large hunks of fat
The service was great and everyone was very nice but man was this place busy
It's crowded loud and there has never been a place for us to sit down but it has great beer and the atmosphere is just awesome
Another great reason to go is that it's not filled with morons or those typical rude people that love to frequent most places I enjoy
Cracker Jax would make a great date or place to bring the little ones
Not a place for breakfast cocktails though so don't anticipate a good bloody mary
All that said it is going to be a great place after they work out a few things and the service is fantastic
What's great about this place is they don't pre cut a bunch of filets and sell them
I really did want to like this place more-the ambiance is great and if you just want to meet up with friends for some nachos and drinks then you will be fine

One of the only local pizza places I know that offers Green Olives as a topping option although once when I had it delivered I think they subbed Kalamata Olives and it was definitely not great - I would have appreciated some sort of warning

It's a great place to go with a group of people too and they will likely be what you remember about the dinner rather than the food service or atmosphere

It is a very casual atmosphere no need to dress up here
Sure it was not a private party but we arrived early good tip so you have the place for your group until more people arrive late
In a time of pretentious breakfast joints yeah I'm talking about you Breakfast Club I love when I find a laidback place to have a great cup of coffee and one of the best breaky sandwiches in town the Dolly - a huge bonus if they will still have one of their delicious homemade cinnamon rolls available
The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because when I want to have a very nice meal with conversation and great food atmosphere I would want a more quiet fine dining restaurant
The area next to the fireplace looks like a great place to hang out and have drinks
I was amazingly surprised at how good this place was
Great place for a special occasion or a nice night out when you don't want to cook
This place was a great surprise for us

I have gone to this restaurant many times and the atmosphere is laid back casual and down to the basics
Some great things about Hana* A nicely put together sushi bar that has all the markings of become a big favorite amongst Phoenicians without being scene-y or plasticky trendoid like several other sushi places in Phoenix and Scottsdale
I'm bracing for the onslaught once AZ Central and the New Times get a hold of this place because it really is too good to pass up and the hype will eventually get there

Yes it's just a small breakfast/lunch place but if you're in Kierland Commons and need something quick and good I don't think you could do better than Chloe's Corner
Newly opened in Oregano's old flagship location in Old Town Scottsdale this place was great
I'm having my wedding here so I thought it would be a good idea to check the place out beforehand by staying at the hotel
Defnitely a good place to stay if you can get a deal on the room
the lobby bar is a great hangout and the outdoor area that has a fireplace and some tables and couches is great for chilly desert nights
I would love to try this place again since the food and view were great

I've never had dinner here but it is a great place to go for happy hour and a night out
Absolutely romantic place for a special occasion or a date
The guy and girl who were working on the morning I decided to give this place another shot were better than the other baristas I had encountered before but they were so chatty with each other and with my friend I waited a good 4 or 5 mins just to tell them what I wanted to drink
It's not my go-to spot but is a great little place with friendly employees and a good location
Now this is not say the atmosphere is not good
Quaint places with young hip owners offering high quality food and goods make us feel positively about living in an often maligned part of town
I highly recommend this place good food good drinks and an all around great time
Service wine atmosphere- all great and the food
I am not usually big fan of shrimp cocktail at buffet place but theirs were really good and cooked perfect
Cute place filled with Hawaii type memorabilia
The booths at this place are huge great for happy hour 1/2 off Apps and $2 off drinks We sat at the tables by the bar but the patio looked fun and I'll have to feel that space out next time
Its a casual dining place you can tell its been around for a long time and that's whats good about it
This is a good place if you like loud music so loud that the cashier can't hear you and you can't hear them
Great place to take friends for a once experience not great for eating there often or for large groups
The pita's didn't hold a cancle to hand-made ones from Haji Baba or other middle eastern places but they were good and fresh
This is a great place for dinner and drinks with friends inside and for a date patio area
Who knows if it would have been different with a loss on the field but I think the place got good remarks all around
I would never have found this place if someone at Modified Arts hadn't told me how great it was

It's a great place to meet after work or just to have a bite during the week
So many places come and go but it's great that Ted's has been at the same location for years
It's a place that I'd like to come for happy hour post-work - but I just never feel good about suggesting it with the experiences we've had
I am torn between rating this place a 3 or a 4--We spent 65 dollars plus tip and could have easily spent 20 more for just the 2 of us we went away not really full but the food quality and taste and service was great--then again the seating was cramped and outside would have been more tolerable with just an oscillating fan
The food is amazing the coffee is great and the atmosphere is everything you are looking for
Luci's is a nice little place the employees are very friendly and the coffee sans grounds was actually pretty good
This is still a great place to hear music and sit with friends
This is a great place to eat every so often since if you eat there enough it wont be long before you kind of have eaten everything a few times
its too bad that the other yelpers who rated this place had a bad time
I know this will make the line longer at the new place but it would be unfair not to share the good news especially when I learned about the original from here
A place you can actually count on for a good evening
The fun stuff to put in Pho was barely there the condiments were so so the ambiance was tempered with shitty classic rock choices there was an unhappy preppy couple seated against the wall with no window way across the place for no good reason
My first impressions were good the place is open and spacious and we were greeted with a smile which is always a plus
the atmosphere was great and they have a great private room area as well for larger groups
This place has become really BAD since the owners changed recently
The dirty place and rude waitresses were tolerable because of the good food
I'd say the prices are slightly high and the girls that work the front counter can act 'too cool' but its great place to watch awkward first dates men in sleeveless shirts and girls in lululemon riding fixies
I had heard from several folks that this was a good place to eat and we had heard that the wings were out of this world
Otherwise it wasn't bad for this kind of place
with a name like Oink I expected a cute place full of piggies bacon infused items and smokehouse smells
It's not that this is a bad place but value for money for pseudo Japanese cooking is not to be found
Having said that  $9 bento box with katsu is pretty good value though the miso that comes with it doesn't  stand up alongside a premium packet of miso from Lee lees Was quiet  230 on a Sat afternoon  It's just not worth the premium in relation to the good places a couple of miles away
The food is good like a typical Thai place but their prices can be in the high side
So if your in need of a good burger and fries and an experience to go with it this is the place to go
Good atmosphere great decor amazing food sociable staff loose seating coucheschairscoffee tableetc
Anyway the place is cute nothing fancy but not trying to be super cool makes it pretty cool to me
To sum it up Chase Field is a good ballpark taking into consideration the geography and population of the surrounding area but it a GREAT place for the loyal D'Back fans to root for their team roof and all
Service was excellent place was clean except the pepper shaker the owners are great people and love a little conversation
There is absolutely nothing bad that can be said about this place because they are the bar in my opinion
With a great new menu and fantastic happy hour deals Fibber Magee's has become our new favorite place to enjoy food and cocktails
My husband purchased a groupon for this place the groupon was good for 5 wine tasting and an appetizer
One other good thing about this place is that they bottle their own wine and also you can having a bottling party yourself
Really can't say anything bad about the place
The vegetable soup is pretty good but I prefer it with the little chunks of tofu in addition to the veggies that most of the other thai places I frequent have
But all the same a place that does a great cup of coffee and breakfast gets high marks in my portfolio
If you're looking for a caffeine fix some good food and a cool cozy atmosphere you won't be sorry
I think this place does a great job of representing the non chain side of Phx
ProsEasy to get to park enterGood SoundDecent Stage Sight LinesConsThey do not do a good job cleaning the place twice now the balcony bathrooms have been nasty
Staff was nice and good atmosphere some decent music but food was just moderate
Prices are moderate for a dinner for two atmosphere is casual enough to be a great first date place attention cheesy guys and they are rarely busy so cosy dates can become sweet and innocent
The family atmosphere really made the hustle and bustle not so bad
It's usually decent and occasionally great but as one yelper noted this place is inconsistent
The ambiance in the place is really romantic at night with dim lighting nice music and delicate plating
By far the best part about this place is its proximity to Pane Bianco a great place for lunch right next door
The service was pretty fast and friendly and the atmosphere is so cute and feels like you're back in the 1950's
So if there are any guys out there looking for a good proposal spot this is probably a pretty solid place to do it
If you're looking for a great place to take out of towners for some refined Latin style cooking and a taste of Old Town Scottsdale this restaurant really can't be beat

Overall a great place to pick up groceries
Not necessarily the kind of place you will take your date unless she's blind and hungry but man oh man is the food ever good
When I used to frequent this place it had a great craft/local beer selection awesome specials and the food was stellar
We were told that this was a good place to go with our 2 kids
It's not a posh place and more old school than upscale but they do a good job
It's too bad that the service is so bad because this place has the potential of being one of the best in town
The service was good considering our large party size and it was an enjoyable place to have a large party
Great place to impress a date or just have a bite with a friend I have done both I know
Ok so I have to admit there are plenty of good and bad reviews for this place but I am a sandwich junkie so I had to try it
Anyway I thought I would try it as I work in Tempe and I am always on the lookout for good sandwich places
One thing I have noticed now days sandwiches are expensive and its nearly impossible to find a place that gives a good amount of food at a reasonable price
Two stars for the great atmosphere & service
It's good to know this place is still here even the Garcia's that used to be in the same plaza has been replaced
Thought this place would have a great view on the patio but no the view is obstructed by  a fence and a wall
pricier than most places UNLESS you get the $4 Drive-Thru that is a great deal
I looked through a large menu and decided to stick with my routine of going to the baby back ribs as a meter of how good a BBQ place is

Still a good place  to watch a movie and dine at the same time
It can be a fun cozy romantic place to go
Overall this place has a great idea but for such a trendy idea I was a little surprised at the decor of the place
The place has a great look outside upon arriving and inside was just as pleasant
Too many good Thai places close by with better food for less money
* a great place to hang out with friends around a table lounge on the couch or even grab a laptop and meet with someone
*anyway*  For a small place they have a great deal of variety lots of fun dog and cat toys
Their food is pretty good but I wouldn't really classify this as a dining destination - this place is about the beer
Its hard to find good asian food in general in Phoenix especially vietnamese so I was elated to be introduced to this place
This place has a lounge area with a good sized bar and couch area
Once again good ole' Yelp pointed us in the right direction and when I saw that Gabbi had been there three times and recommended them with 5 stars I was confident the place would be professional and above average and they were

Situated on the golf course of the The Westin Kierland Resort & Spa this place is a great location to enjoy a lazy in a good way lunch with family and friends
There is plenty of seating so it's a good place to hang out after work and have some drinks
A very cute place the decor and ambiance seems built very much upon the words serenity and harmony which is great but as you might tell with the tone of this post comes off a little corny
I don't know if I'll come back but I would say for lunch this place is not a bad place to introduce somebody to Vietnamese food
Paradise Bakery is one of those places that you can count on for always having something good when your driving around wanting more than a burger and not a sit down meal with a waiter
Paradise Bakery does also have a great breakfast should you want a nice place to go after a nice hike or just want to treat yourself and a friend to great place to visit
Definitely pizza place looking for sure and crowded so we assumed it would be good
This place looks like it could be a great neighborhood pizza joint

THE GOODThe boba and tea here tastes sooo much better than other places
THE BADIt is much more expensive than the other boba places in the area
AtmosphereWe were lucky enough to score a poolside table which started off as very romantic but over the course of the evening became quite the place for people watching
Ok to start off with I'd like to say that the beer and food were both good but I have to give this place 1 star because the service was absolutely abysmal
Given that there are lots of good Asian restaurants nearby to chose from I hope to see them do some innovating from a service and experience perspective as other local Pho places are progressing in that direction
Great place to go when your not on a budget
And because of your unwillingness to accept my order as placed I paid you for additional pumps of syrup whip cream and God knows what other goodies you put on top of a gingerbread latte
I love our stay in Yuma and the quality of this place made the trip great
Rolls were good but the rice was a bit on the dry sideService was excellent but the sushi did take awhile I assume this is because of the new-ness of the placeI did LOVE the fact that they had fresh wasabi extra charge and it was pureedI did LOVE that they had Vietnamesse iced coffee and sweet green tea
this is such a romantic place definitely enjoy your dining experience because everything is done to personalize the experience for each guest
For some reason I wanted to try this place to see how bad it was and for some reason it is not bad at all

Friday night and Im wanting to go somewhere with a cool atmosphere and some good drinks and mabey some good food
Prime location great atmosphere just lacking in the food department
Im not sure if all the good reviews are from people that got sidetracked from the atmosphere or if they dont know food and thought they were eating something special or if they had to many drinks before the food
Nor did it turn out could I get one at any of the 6 other places I called/walked into based on my handy Yelp App telling me the goods in my immediate area
I am not the best sushi critic being that I am vegetarian but I think they have pretty good veggie rolls and edamame  I mostly enjoy the atmosphere and the drinks here
It is also a good place for large parties although I think Grimaldi's is a bit more convenient
I love the atmosphere of this place the building is fantastic and the acoustics are great
Great if you're pre-menstrual and all you want is as much food as possible---ambience be damned
Great place just to walk around and find crazy things
Other places make this but none are as full of chunky goodness as their variety
What a spotAtmosphere memorabilia so much sports history and signatures the place could open up as a museum  the walls are just covered in photos and great sports items
Great place for a big party for those special occasions
Overall good place to eat if you're hungry and in the downtown area but I wouldn't go out of my way to get here

Overall this place never disappoints and is great for a unique twist on typical brunch foods
Its is a great place with great people so far
This is definitely a good place to grab a quick lunch with limited time fast affordable and tasty
I like to hangout here for an hour every week or so good people watching the pretentious guy behind the counter is good to listen to if you want to hear people getting so-so advice that they didn't ask for and my professors come here so it is a good place to catch them not in work mode
and to be honest I'm a connoisseur of Mexican food I'd like to think and for a place like this their refried beans and tortillas are pretty good  i get the basic eggs and hashbrowns with a side of tortillas and beans and it's soooo good
Too bad my first review has to be a negative one but I feel I owe it to all of you who so faithfully warn me to stay away from places like this although you may have let me down on this one
I wish I had because the place was full of cute guys
carlsbad tavern  is a combination Mexican market and hole in the wall take out place which also happens to have 3 small 2-person tables at the back
The GoodThe atmosphere is bright lively and hipster-Toms wearers-modern-organic bitchin' open kitchen-tastic
VerdictFor people who don't know how to eat well on their own this is a great place to start
This place is great for happy hour or for a relaxing meal
Ack I almost want to give this place 1 star for the lack of good service and disgusting bathroom
All in all the meal was delicious and the atmosphere was good too
This place always offers fresh options daily and I never find myself looking at the same menu whenever I come here which is great
The place was PACKED which is always a good sign in an area chock full of food within walking distance
The ambience is casual spacious and pub-style but the music on Saturday night was too loud we felt that we had to scream at each cross the table
its not a bad place and if you get here early the sushi is pretty good but they dont seem to take the old hours old stuff down
The huge room was classy yet the atmosphere felt casual
muffins scones baked goods-addictivemusic-amazingatmosphere-cooli can sit here all day have cup after cup of coffee and feed on their homemade goodies
This place is overrated but its too bad I wish it was a little more laxed on the sales and I could find a happy medium when I buy stuff here whether I buy all new intimates or when I just come in quick for their sucralose filled lip gloss and some chemical perfume
Other than that it is a great place to grab a beer or a perfect lunch spot
I was at the counter and service was pretty good a touch cocky which fit the atmosphere
This place is really great if you have a small dog or a cat
Love this place worth the extra dollar if you want a great Persian treat for yourself
I remember seeing them in the airport then in Scottsdale Fashion Square and recently after looking for some good Mexican food near Scottsdale Shea Healthcare to take my girl to lunch I noticed a Yelp Deal for this place and thought it was finally worth a shot
Their restaurant atmosphere is very cheesy and funIt exudes cute pizzeria characteristics that are nicely done
Flat screen for watching the D'backs and some good beers on tap along with Happy Hour specials makes this a great place
Good but I don't think I'll cross the Rubicon for this place
All-in-all a great experience and a great place to see a show

I was a little scared to try this place but I'm a sucker for a good crepe
This place was a bit out of my way but the recent good reviews on Yelp made me want to make the journey
Good thing this place wasn't busy when we arrived 4ish because by the time all 7 of us would've sampled filled then contemplated our toppings and paid them we would've pissed off and driven away everyone behind us
They got a nice cute little garden area deep inside the restaurant for outside seating to remind you of Paris
I am going to try to keep this short because I could easily go on and on about how good this place is
This place is definitely more authentic tasting than the ones listed above as well although it's still not the real deal but to be honest real Mexico Mexican food is not that good anyway Menudo anyone
Its limited so if the place is busy good luck figuring out where the heck to park
She loved the food liked that they didn't hesitate when she special ordered her Rigatoni with a different sauce she liked the atmosphere the mixed drink was potent my lasagna was very good and we loved the side of meatballs we both ordered

The atmosphere was ethnic contemporary with lots of dark woods comfortable seating and very hip casual music
Good place for kids ages 2-9The 9-10 crowd has limited things to do
What is great about this place is that the spices don't overpower the dish and you can taste many different flavors with each bite
Tuesday night all rolls and apps are 1/2 offThe inside of this place is great btw

I've been to several good Chicago-type places like this and this one just didn't make the grade for me
The only thing great about this place is the lit up dance floor which make your shoes feel like dancing but as mentioned before as soon as the play-list starts the strip mall sidewalk calls you out to smoke

Luckily I found out about this place in a recent Food & Wine magazine because I would've missed out on some great food
I have no idea why the reviews for this place weren't that great because I really enjoyed the food

Unusual for a Vietnamese restaurant I hold this place to the same standard of cleanliness I expect from a Chinese restaurant if it tastes good and doesn't make me sick it's a-okay
It being one of my favorite foods I've been to a great many restaurants for pho and have tried to find a place that can fill that big beef noodle soup void in my heart
I'm always afraid to be the first to try and review a place like this because the awful coffee outweighs the good coffee the world around; I'm blessed with not having to write a bad review for a brand new place
I'm feeling bad about giving this place just an A-OK because of the many positive reviews
Over all the atmosphere was pretty good but judging on food it was a little better than okay and kind of interesting

Only this place doesn't really serve up the goods
I never thought a gelato place would have good pizza
The only complaint I had about the place is that the fairways really weren't in great shape for a $50 course

There is nothing super special about this place but the food is reliably good so I like that
But if you are looking for some good fresh chinese seafood and more traditional dishes this place is pretty good
Also why do people decide to open places like this without great simple food
This atmosphere at Zinc is strangely casual for what many would consider an expensive upscale restaurant
For a TownePlace Suites this is about as good as it gets

Although this wasn't our first choice for breakfast everyone enjoyed their meal and it's a good place to keep in mind if we're in the area
First of all the location of this place is great
It's a lot like Trader Joe's in that it is designed as  a quick get-in-get-out- kind of place which is great if you say need a few tomatoes and don't feel like wading through a giant Safeway
Overall just a great place to eat and have a chance to try the wide menu with all the specials
There is a great buzz in this place lots of people thinking working and talking all fueled by caffeine

The atmosphere is really pleasant Stax has a full bar so I can get a marti with my sliders they have totz there's room to sit down comfortably and the people watching is as always great
The atmosphere was exactly what you'd expect - casual clean with the owner's family there enjoying their dinner and one young girl giving an inspired yet subdued solo concert to herself in a corner of the restaurant
So if you're looking for a good pizza and a nice restaurant Grimaldis is a place to try
This place is great if your looking to grab some drinks during a weeknight and don't want to be in a bar by yourself
She paid very good attention to the 4 people that were in the entire place at lunchtime
So many bad pizza places but now and then you find a good one
When I try a new pizza place I always order the same pizza so I get great comparisons
Not a bad place if you are just craving breakfast
Anyone who says this place isn't worth the wait obviously doesn't know good pizza
Oh well the drinks and food were good service was good atmosphere was good and the value of our dollar for what we received was great
This is the type of place where you want people to meet you because it is simply beautiful and your friends will think you have great taste
I'm a fan of this place because- their staff does their job they are nice greet you and keep the place in tip-top cleanliness state and all machines are operational meaning they up-keep well- their classes vary and they have a convenient schedule of different types of classes- it is a modern clean facility; has an indoor running track and plenty of new machines that have their own TVs with cable; also have a lot of machines and a great selection of free weights for those of us that prefer free weights over cable machines
the service is great the location and ambience are nice too but the food is just terrible
It was too undercooked and i like my seafood undercooked and I don't believe the squid was good quality in the first place
Not bad at all but when you ask for a pastis at a supposedly French place and the waiter does not know what you're talking about that's a very bad sign
Their bourbon selection was good but for a fancy place like this could have been much better
All in all it was a nice place to stay with beautiful ground and great service- I'll probably go check out another hotel the next time I'm in town but if I find an incredible deal to the AZ Biltmore I wouldn't hesitate to take advantage

Although the food wine and atmosphere are all good sadly I must say I have been let down
I went there last night with the guys had a really nice time the music was very chill not the usual all metal crap it was a good mix from rise against to atmosphere to 50 cent
The second time I insisted my boyfriend and I go there when were downtown buying records at Revolver another good place to go
Dimly lit at night and full of natural light during the day; Fez's good food and pleasing atmosphere shouldn't seem to disappoint someone looking for some well made in-between gourmet in the heart of Phx that available till midnight
The key to this restaurant is atmosphere and good drinks
The only dim sum restaurant I have experienced out here is C FU Gourmet their selection is greater but their downfall is the food is usually cool to warm and the place has been steadily getting worse
The toppings are great but pretty typical for this type of place
We assumed it was going to be more relaxed and mature since it was located north and away from its Old Town counterpart The place was entirely full of guys
It's so good to know that there is a great deli place not far from where I live and where I can treat myself to or bring visiting friends for a great New York style deli experience
If you get the soup and salad the Olive Garden is a good place for a cheap lunch
This is the second time I've stayed at a Hyatt Place and my experience was just as good as the first time
Funny considering that I am a guy who eats out a lot and am not afraid to spend a lot of money in a place when the food and service is good

The service was excellent even though it was really crowded and the ambience is lovely the music was great

The atmosphere is great restaurant is nice and clean service great
All in all it's a solid place for some good ramen

But this is a great place to watch a  game and have some munchies

I have heard a lot of great things from coworkers and friends about this small little place in Arcadia Phoenix area
That doesn't make it a good place - it actually means it's LESS tempting
Greatest thing about Chicago Hamburger is that it is always good food in your typical small place
Although the food was not good I would typically give any place a second chance
Lucille is great for grabbing dinner if you're already at Tempe Marketplace or if it's after 9pm when so many places outside the mall are actually closed
It is a nice relaxed atmosphere if you go during a weekday for dinner plus you can find parking easily
Excellent breakfast place with good service
The movie theater itself is very nice and new and it does house The Cine Capri which is a great place to see any movie you have been looking forward to
Every time I go good food great service and its a cool and clean place
This place is manned by two babers Sean and Polo that have a good customer base
It's a great place to meet if you are heading to the Herberger for a show or if you find yourself in the heart of downtwon PHX either hungry or thirsty
I was visiting from SF a place of bright lights great food and so much diversity that I have to say I was ready for this place to be somewhat mediocre
This is a great place for groups or a couple to dine
It's great place to stop after coming from Cosmos Dog Park just down the street
Regardless of that though it's a good place to have a nice dim-lit dinner with reasonably priced bottles of wine
I highly suggest this place for a relaxed lunch or HH
the atmosphere is casual especially with the sun city crowd they usually have live music a few nights a week
The atmosphere in this remodeled historic home is great and the grounds outside are the perfect place to waste a couple hours talking listening to the live music and imbibing in the poison of your choice whether that be coffee or mimosas
The meal was really good friendly staff and just a fun place to chill and have a good meal and a beer
This place really does have such a relaxed atmosphere

SERVICEJoe and Ashley mostly Ashley took great care of our mostly ESL pack of drinkers which must have been quite a challenge as Ashley gets quite a bit of attention from male patrons due to the combination of the attire all the girls wear at this place and the particulars of her physique
You can't go wrong with the Tepanyaki anything and it's a great place to go if you're doing a protein diet
We don't have any other good Chinese places close by so this would be a go-to spot for us
If you ever feel like a drive or are in the area this place is great if it were in Scottsdale it would rival any Fox Concept Restaurant and is just generally awesome
Good service reasonable price and nice atmosphere
This place used to be really good but it just is not the same
they kept coming over and gave us cute places to go too
This can be a pretty good date place when you go with a pretty good date
Too bad the food doesn't match the atmosphere
The bottom line is this place is very good and continues to prove it by staying aroound through 3 recessions and continuing to grow
This is my dilemma it's not that I hated it or thought it was bad in any way However the food was ok definitely a place I would order pizza from and pick it up and take it home
I really miss a lot of fruit choices being in AZ but this place takes me home a bit with fresh CA white peaches Haas avocados kiwis and good tasty cherries unlike the ones that taste like water from Fry's
I honestly think this place is good for people who think they know Korean food who really don't because their friend's friend was Korean or something but most Korean loving hungry souls will go straight to Takamatsu
My sister went to a different beauty school but since she was busy on my days off I decided to take a chance and visit a different school since she always did such a good job and the school atmosphere was relaxed and felt safe
I've been here on Friday/Saturdays and the atmosphere is great
The beer was good the atmosphere was exactly what an Irish bar should be the band was REALLY good
A great place to relax with a book or take advantage of their free wi-fi
If we had stopped after the meeting in the 111 degree heat after I was all sweaty and relaxed having kicked meeting ass and I'd ordered a really good Margarita it's entirely possible I would be singing this place up and down the 202
I've had so much fun at 12 W Main and it's an awesome place to go for some great music and fun
It's a casual place where you order at the counter and then can dine in or get take out
Expect great flavors fresh ingredients good service and a place to buy in bulk many of the components of the meal you order there
pretty good place to get some holiday tamales
the view was kinda cute and the place was small and trendy but still soft in a way
In short for a three day romantic getaway there is no place I'd rather be than the Royal Palms
We had a great red sauce pizza and I would recommend this place to anyone
It is definitely a good place to go with friends or on a date
Overall this is a great Asian place that offers a lot of options to choose from for a good price
It is a great place to find great deals and I'm hooked
I went here last night for a girls night and it is a very cute little place with patio seating
thank goodness there more ice cream places to chose from here in AZ rather than Cold Stone
Best of all kind of like Casey Moore's in Tempe the bar is starting to act as a great place to see the diversity of folks who live in the Coronado and Roosevelt neighborhoods
Overall it was a good dark cool divey place for a pit stop with a good drink selection
It's also a great place to hang out and catch up before the movie or discuss the film afterward and the bar is fully stocked with everything from beer and wine to mimosas and martinis
An overall great atmosphere good portions and a friendly staff will definitely bring me back to Nick's again
Even thou it's a good size market it does not compare to the asian markets in Garden GroveCA
The place was decorated nicely and a lady playing the piano made for great ambiance
It's amazing how a place with great food decor and ambiance can mess it all up by crappy waiter service
Every good review about this place has to do with gyros which is American Cuisine
If you are looking for a fun place to have a beer this would be a good place to go but dinner or lunch I would not recommend at Murphy's Haus
Relaxed cool people good atmosphere and tasty food
Humble Pie a nice place to relax and unwind with good drinks and food
This place pushes out some delicious food Red chile burro with rice and beans is better than any I've had and their Nachos are soooo freaking cheesey and good you'll want to order both for one sitting
But of all things to remember make sure you bring cash the place can't afford a card processing machine which is a good thing other wise I'd be there too often and a fat face looks weird on me
This place is so so good they are busy all the time and it is a really fun place to check out
Frankly the place wasn't that busy and he had a lot of people on the garage floor so I'm not sure exactly why the customer service was so bad
All in all a great place to enjoy time with all the members of your family
This place is one of my favorites it is so good
The atmosphere is chill the ambiance is classy and the piano-playing topped off the great atmosphere
so in honor of tanked's unbeatable happy hour sweet atmosphere and splendid sushi i shall say my final words and wave goodbye solemnly as yet another incredible phoenix restaurant goes under the table due to poor economic conditions caused by politicians running amuck and unchecked in washington
The smell of the gardens are great but the last time I was there sitting outside was a mistake because of the garbage smell coming from the dumpster
As a token of good faith - the waiter offered up a second desert for free in lieu of my birthday email offer - let's see - a $5 desert in place of a $25 meal - nice try - FAIL
Brooke and I were looking for a good breakfast place while we vacationed in Arizona and the pictures of Orange Table's food looked mouthwatering

Also if you want political gossip La Canasta is a great place because you can see the whos-who in politics at lunch and possibly overhear some good tidbits
Overall if you are looking for a nice unique special dinner this place is really a great place to go
This really is a great bar and was the first cool place I found when I moved to Phoenix
The place is small they had cute plates a little bar that seems as if it will grow if the people come
00 2 items off the cheaper appetizer snack menu alsoThey ahve what is probably over 50 beers on tap if your a beer drinkers this place would be a good stop
I love this place have been eating here for years anything I have tasted from my dinner companions plate as well as my own has been very very good

A 4 star Mexican place with very few bad reviews seemed like a safe bet
But there are so many other great places I feel sorry for anyone who might call this their only Mexican stop when they have a craving
I was born and raised in Lake/Porter Co in IN so my curiosity got the better of me when I found a breakfast place called Hoosier  I'm glad it's as good as I hoped
The atmosphere is pretty basic service was friendly and the food was pretty good and reasonable
If you are looking for a good place to eat breakfast in Phoenix Matt's Big Breakfast is definitely the place to go
*Atmosphere - Nice not really cafu00e9 style a little fancier than that but still would be considered a casual place
It can get busy and bustling but any place that has great food and our saviour
Great place if you have a dining partner who needs gluten-free but other than that it's just o
Nice atmosphere good baked wings decent beer selection
It is the perfect place to go for a chill fast casual meal
A lot of the tour is outside or in hotter buildings with little air venting but hey a small price to pay to see this place of a great minded man
This cute little place is located right near my home so i am there for breakfast alot
Hence I found the place did not smell very good at all
the only bad thing about this place is that it closes at 3
For a good sampling get a bunch of appetizers to split vegetarian combo platter is a good place to start and for the entree the Byblos Mixed grill offers lamb chicken and keufta ground and spiced meat kabobs
healthy fresh food great prices great service creative atmosphere
It is a very loud place and that makes it a great place to bring the kids;-
it's a hole in the wall place but most good and REAL vietnamese places are
That being said if you don't need the latest styles this is a good place to go and for basics like workout shirts and shorts
Read reviews and was told by coworkers how good this place was
The place smelled great even before entering but the food didn't really meet up to the promise
By the time I got there the rain had subsided to a drizzle and it made for the absolute perfect atmosphere as I walked up the wooden planks into the cave-like atmosphere of Carlsbad Tavern
This place has it all including some great hiking trails and a convenient location to all of the great Scottsdale spots
If you're looking for great coffee in downtown Tempe this is the place
Regardless I would definitely recommend checking this place out Great sushi laid back atmosphere great service and great prices

Prior to that happening I was looking around for a place that would take good care of my old vehicle
Not to mention no kitchenLike most comments on here great place and location but was not hoppin' at all

This place was busy so we knew it would be good
Very good place for a comfort-sort of soup and sandwiches
The place seemed great at first but when you go there as frequently as I do the little flaws start to reveal themselves
A great coffee place with exceptional service and awesome coffee
Overall it isn't a bad place to eat and drink and the late night hours make it especially appealing if you can't stomach mozzarella sticks at the neighborhood Applebees
ALMOST everything about this place was good
Steve and Andi Rosenstein have put the time into this place to make it great
One thing that my date noticed was that at the bar they have hooks underneath the bar in front of each stool which we guessed was for hanging your purse or bag which is a great idea and I think would be cool if more places had them
I noticed the place is not very clean and in general they seemed to have allot of staff on hand we had a good server but there were allot of employees standing around being worthless for the most part
I went to Central Car Car for the first time today to get an oil change and this place is GREAT
Very good beer nice atmosphere and nice employees
Overall I'm glad to see a new place in Old Town that has some character and some great food
The atmosphere is great and service is attentive
They are a little tougher than some places think they were more St Lous style as opposed to our preferred baby backs but that's our preference which wasn't great but certainly not bad
Now the badThis place tries waaaaay too hard to be some sort of L
The dark atmosphere the live music the wine the finger foods the great service these all add up to a fantastic evening
It's on a lake cute but it's not a place I will go back to
A great size of restaurant - not too big not too small - and the atmosphere really does make you feel welcome & like one of the regulars right off the bat
It was definitely good but I've eaten at places that were better and less expensive
passable I guess but it cost $15 and wasn't even close to being as good as the Singapore Chow Fun I've had at Chinese take-out places in New York and it cost over twice as much
British pubs aren't my favorite places to eat since I am a vegetarian who eats fish occasionally but this place was pretty good
This looks like a great place to drink hang out and even watch the game
But once you get settled - this is a good place to visit
Hopefully they will take care of the kinks because the place is very nice and the music was great
This could be such a great place to hang out with friends and chit chat without loosing your voice
We have always heard how great this place is and have always wanted to try it out
Great so I asked if they sold Roast Duck which they did and had asked how early I should place my order since I wasn't sure if they would run out
Now with all that being said it is still a great place to go and see a game
To sum up good food great service in a casual atmosphere
This is a great little family owned place that has been there for 34 years
Besides the tremendous brown bag lunch special which consists of any dog or sausage with chips and a soda for $5 Schreiner's is a great place to buy loaf meat weiners and sausages
After reading other reviews of this place I already had a feeling it was going to be good
And with follow up games only 50 cents a pop it seems like inflation hasn't hit this place as bad as everywhere else
I guess if you've never had the real deal before this place is good
A huge beer and a warm pasty the casual atmosphere and aroma of the mouth watering red wine gravy all blend into a wonderful dining experience
Pascucci is a great place for a bite brew or something sweet
But a friend talked me into meeting him here by saying it was his favorite new place and had great fried chicken
It IS a great place to go for creative Japanese-style appetizers at an incredible happy hour price everything half price if I'm remembering properly
Went there tonight after an unexplained hiatus of a few months I was on hiatus not Corbin's and I realized that dinner was good the previous lunches and dinners were good service was good atmosphere is good
My pet name for places like Los Cerritos is 'El Divo' pronounced with a loooong 'i' and one of the things you can usually count on from little dives is great food
I had a feeling this place was going to be good but became ever more excited when our Mexican friend started getting excited at the authenticity of the menu compared to the food she enjoys when in Mexico
Nothing fancy just a casual sit down place with good traditional American cafe/diner food with very friendly service
When my roomie and I first moved in this place was great
But since the Biltmore is turning into a giant epic fail as the businesses that had people coming back over and over are replaced with bad chains
It was great to see a brand new place doing so well already and Tim's will likely end up in our regular rotation of favorites
Whatever combination of goodness it is that is then placed on top of the chips is amazing
Good place when you have a mixed group of Sushi and non-Sushi eaters
We all share a good laugh over silly mixups place the order and pay nearly $300 for it
A very good sign that the place is authentic
Try it it's good and a definite repeat kind of place
Ultimately we all go out for good food atmosphere people watching and to socialize
Over all good place but I wouldn't venture back unless it was very convenient to my location and I was in the mood for some heart burn and breathing fire
Everything is always good and this place really has soul
ProGood for large groupsChips and salsa barCatering is great for parties at homeLarge patioConToo much dark meat in chicken entreesDinner prices are too expensive for what you getThe signs posted by management that hang all over the place telling customers what to doObnoxious paint colors
I think my judgement is a little messed up i'm totaly hammered right now and this place is great --last night
/// Today--- until I figured out this place was a meat market and all the guys started the hunt witch alright great for them but most of the people there were hammered as well it was getting towards the end of the night and guys were starting to get desprite It's funny to see guys act like fools over women
Khai Hoan is also great because it is one of the few pho places that I know of that serve veggie pho not in the pho section of the menu but the veg section and it is loaded with delicious vegetables
I feel that bu00fan is way overlooked at Vietnamese places but it's a great if you're not feeling soup; get it with the egg rolls on top
It's a casual place to go in the middle of a weekday which is when I went with a friend for lunch
I always am on the look out for some great Mexican food and honestly I dont find many places that would wow me
It's a great place to dine and try something new
As another reviewer noted it's certainly a good place to people watch
Yes I know it's a coffee garden but when they have dueling pianos it would also be great to have some cocktail servers offering drink service downstairs in addition to upstairs
Just a nice quaint place to sit outside and have a good lunch
Great places with excellent food & ambiance should be hard to find
However all that aside if I worked in this area it would be a great place to grab a quick cup of coffee and it's always great to support smaller businesses like this
Finally a neighborhood restaurant that is just a great place to get a simple meal that is good and gives good value
Great  place for sushi rolls noodles teriyaki and tempura
This location has a good sized garden center
The waitress was good but I can see her being overwhelmed if the place was packed
The variety and price make this a great place to hit up when you want some savory food but aren't sure exactly what you want
Atmosphere - The definition of casual dining
It is a good place to shop for quick fresh food
After our afternoon activities in the sun a frozen treat sounded so good and man did this place hit the spot
Definitely my favorite dim sum place in the valley and I've been to  cfu china king phoenix palace golden buddha and great wall
Thought it's worthy to mention for those who are worried about bad greasy Chinese food - this place isn't one of those
Sauce is a good place if you want lunch while you are out shopping but don't want typical mall food court options
It's a great place to have a girls weekend
If you are looking for all around good food good service with a pleasant atmosphere this is a great spot
Atmosphere very nice with outside seating way to hot out for my East coast blood and the crowd is very mixed which is great
This place has character food is good not wow but good and service was good
Even better; It turns out this place is one of those great family owned strip mall restaurants that valley residents should be more aware of
Overall this is a great place for date night or a casual get together with friends but leave the kids at home
I'd definitely like this place more if they just used fresh ingredients didn't cover everything in nastiness and just stuck to making good burgers fries and shakes
In my opinion this place is as good or better than both delux and the grind when you consider price
It's a great place to meet up with a friend sit and chat
A good date place with a small but expertly prepared menu but easily a $60 night for two if you each have a meal and two drinks
However this flashy atmosphere didn't have the great food I would expect from the setting
Super friendly people good variety and just for fun I checked in via FB and there were like 1200 people who had checked in this 8 table place wtf
Overall the food was pretty good and it was nice to eat some Greek food on a trip rather than the usual Mexican places
I would give this place negative 1000 stars and pray that it gets struck by lightning it sucks so bad
I went back to the courts for another referral this place was so bad
My buddies and I golf a lot in the east valley so it's a good place to get a bite to eat after playing 18 holes
So we ran into the local fry's for something - probably wine - and when we got to the checkout counter we asked if there was a great place for sandwiches around and the lady was like scratching her head and like o
I'm the type of person who feels it's romantic calming and enjoyable to walk through gardens conservatories and parks
We did have to wait about 30 mintues on a Sunday morning to be seated but that is on par with all the other good breakfast places in the area
People say this place is good but my experience was bad on all fronts - food service and management
She was sorry I had a bad experience and offered a replacement sandwich or desert to go
Three good things I can say about this place - the kugel was excellent the knishes were pretty decent and they serve Dr
I thoroughly recommend this place it's a great all-round location if you want reasonably healthy macrobiotic stuff in a funky kind of atmosphere long as you don't mind some of the saddest tattoos you'll probably ever see
stickers that are inexplicably given to other places such as Mr Goodcents
The decor was really cute and the atmosphere was really nice
I dont know if its the quality of the food the atmosphere or the great selection of beer here but Dean and the rest of the people over at the Cornish Pasty Co
If my dessert is good later on they may redeem themselves a bit but for now I'm really disliking this place  Bill comes and theyve double-charged me for the dessert
After living here for seven years I'm *finally* finding the authentic mom-n-pop places with good food yay
That's too bad this place has such low reviews
This is a great place for a good cheap breakfast if you are in the area
If you would like miserable crankiness and horrifyingly bad service I invite you to go to this place anytime and chat up the charming owner
There were screens all around friendly people good atmosphere
It's a very relaxed environment which is  cool and unlike some other dance places I've gone
If you are looking for a good mexican food place without having to worry about what you look like Armando's is the place to go
HH ~ this is a great place to go for Happy Hour
I'd heard about this place and the reviews here seem to be good so let's give it a try
We decided to try this place out after reading several good reviews
The casual atmosphere is right up my alley for a weekend breakfast and my yogi omelette / protein pancake orders have stayed consistent too
Great atmosphere patio is non smoking and dog friendly
It's an order seat yourself type place which is great
I was always getting terrible haircuts at places like Great Clips and Hair Cuttery when I lived in Virginia Beach and I just assumed it was because I naturally had jacked-up hair
this place with it's casual morning after atmosphere and large menu is just what any hangover would order
I haven't written a review in ages but this place is SO GOOD that I'd be ashamed of myself if I didn't review it
I go here with my pals from my Camaro Car Club when we're at the Pavilions and its a great place to grab some grub and chow down
Tables are clean the place is well lit and it doesn't feel crowdedSERVICEAlways good and patient even if you somehow manage to forget what you were about to order
I've always liked the atmosphere at the other Los Dos better I mean come on the red chili plate is aka chile colorado at any other Mexican restaurant but at least the food used to be good
Definitely a great place for breakfast or lunch
So if you want good burgers then this is a good place for that
Sure they can do all of the fun rolls but this is a great place to really enjoy sashimi and nigiri
Over the years I have only had one poor experience during lunch with some work colleagues it has never been repeated and I am very happy to have this establishment as one of my go to places for good traditional sushi when I am on the west side
Sad that people do this to such a great place
Great atmosphere love both the patios good service and good food
I am actually angry about this place getting good reviews
Great spot on a Friday after work to grab a drink with friends or co workers this place is Light Rail Friendly which means if you want to do a little bar hoping after a few drinks then you don't need to drive to the next bar
I just love the ambiance of this place and how great it is for groups of any size

This place is great for vegetarians because they can substitute grilled tofu for meat at no charge
I enjoyed this place when it was Chinese Gourmet Buffet but for the last few years it was had been overdue for a remodel so when the fancy new Lin's Buffet opened nearby in December '10 they vacuumed away too much of the business from this one for it to keep going successfully even though the food was good
This lead me to believe that a greater premium was placed on accuracy rather than length and the less skilled player would be more inclined to play from the Black Tees
So this place was really good it was convenient generous and looked cute inside

The service was great and the atmosphere was fun
This place is a great place to cool off and people watch
Although not very diverse in the makeup of the crowd we were the only Latinos in the place it had a great vibe and a very friendly atmosphere

I've never eaten at the Haus but I'm pretty up front as to not being a food reviewer and more of a booze reviewer thus I feel completely confident that I can say Haus Murphy's is likely one of the great places in the PHX area to refresh yourself with a disgustingly large beverage
The cupcakes are absurdly good especially for being from a regular grocery store instead of a boutique cupcake place with very soft moist fluffy cake and huge amounts of frosting
Overall a great place and definitely worth a second visit

This place is saved more for the after-bar; after I've had a good meal and nice service after I've had a drink or two and when we're not quite ready to go home yet

Although he flavors may be good and the location convenient for those of us living in Scottsdale this place is a rip off and the management is down right rude
I can't say much else good about the place
The loud ambiance and the bright lights killed most of the romantic atmosphere
Too many other good places in DPHX to go to get quality Mexican food
Now I know nothing about Korean food and its authenticity but given how many Koreans were in the place I think it cannot be all that bad
BreakdownAmbiance and Atmosphere - 5 StarsFood - 3 StarsFood vis-u00e0-vis Price - 2 StarsOn the Balance - 3 StarsOld Town Tortilla Factory isn't as bad as some of the reviewers on here make it out to be
The architecture is reminiscent of older architecture in the area and this place can accommodate anything from small romantic dinners for two to huge banquets and anything in between
It wasn't as good as some of the more authentic Mexican places in town and you can easily find more flavorful complex and spicy traditional food
I kind of don't understand all the Trashing reviews this place has been here since the 80s and compared to most of the Chinese crap in this town Gourmet really is quite good
Just because it is in a bad location I mean half of the obscure places that are Yelp cool are in crappy parts of town
The food is pretty darn good - which worked great for me as I used to work in the area and we'd often take over a section of the place on a semi-regular basis

Okay and now for the hitsThis is a  good  place for pulled pork or BBQ chicken sandwich
my husband and i recently purged a lot of our old books and this was a great place to take them
I give this place only 3 stars because it's not in the greatest neighborhood hence security measures and you have to be ready for a bunch of kids running around and well being kids
As I walked back to the car and admired the beautiful view and landscaping of the Camelback Inn I noted to myself that this would be a great place to take my Mom the next time she is in town

HOWEVER if the owners read this and take it to heart not as a criticism but rather as constructive advice on how to fix this then this place could be great
The atmosphere was great and Ralph was friendly and sweet
Pros The store is a great place to get your groceries and reasonably priced organic produce
Mill is a great place to go get something to eat
We live in the area an wanted this to to a good go to place but poorly executed and way over priced
Also for a place that does pizza mostly their chicken wings are darn good as well
If you like deep dish pizzas this is one good place to get one
All in all the experience and food was very good and this is a place that I might frequent after work
They'll be so impressed that you picked such a cute and beautiful place
Great atmosphere - small restaurant with great local art on the walls that constantly changes

But this place surprised me because the food was not bad
It gets a bit busy on the weekend evenings but that is primarily a testament to the fact that this place is really good
I did rate this place with four stars though so while the pasta was not good and the fish portions were smallish I did really like the place and can't wait to try one of their famous burgers
The place has a great vibe and now that I know not to order the pasta I look forward to my next visit
This is the type of place you want to keep coming back and trying other Pasties this has only been the second time I've been but will go back the first time I had the Cajun Chicken it was great this time I had the Rosemary Chicken and it was just ok not enough flavor and a little dry but it still was good and it didn't turn me of from this place at all
This was a great place to showcase the history of music
I've read that this place does most of it's business for wedding cakes and specialty cakes however they do have a case of fresh goodies to choose from a la carte
Simple and fresh atmosphere great background music and DELICIOUS unique food
Definitely a good place to frequent for vegetarians or omnivores
The toppings are great the yogurt is great but what really sells the place to me are the employees
Either way it's still a great place to go for a fun night out whether you're gay straight or in between
My only bad comment is nobody got our food placement right
She should get a job at a place that serves good food
Seems like a great place for happy hour so I'll definitely be coming back for that
On a good note the coffee was very flavorful for a place that doesn't specialize in coffee and the waiter was kind enough to give us some of the flavored cremes
This place carries a selection of high-end brands like Oakley which are great but not even partially covered by insurance so for a simple single vision prescript they wanted over $400
Rokjeri is the type of place you go when you want a good meal great atmosphere and feel like you are in a different place in the world
Persian Garden Cafe ain't cheap but the ambiance is warm and pleasant not to mention great for groups the food is fresh homemade and delicious and you can get dairy free cheesecake that's better than regular cheesecake
Great place to visit on the weekend grab your friends together and experience this unique treasure
A good place to visit every once in a while to find that classic out of print item or  to experience something new from the B&N and Borders
what had to be done was done and that's it--no high-touch no check-in a day later to see if everything was OK no offer to replace stolen goods we need to hear back from our insurance company
The wait staff at Frank & Alberts was great but the maitre d's were pretty clueless--one night they didn't want to seat us in the garden because they had just seated 50 people
It's not the atmosphere that makes this place great although it is not terrible actually pretty nice if you compare it to any other fast food joint
This place is as good as it gets and the prices are more than reasonable
My mom and I went to Saigon Kitchen for lunch and this place is very good
This place is great and I will definitely come back for more

I'd heard great things about this place so my husband and I finally gave it a try this weekend
You go in these old places and there are people who have worked there forever and just are in their workplace having a great time
The vegetables seem fresher here  and maybe they use more organic veggies because they seem to have more taste too then at other salad bars and they definitely have more of a selection then most places so if your not a green freak about veggies and stuff they have a good mix of soups baked potatoes pizza and other such dishes to choose from
The staff is really good here and this place is very clean and everyone does a great job in making sure you are getting everything you need
So I stopped by for a late lunch and was the only one in the place which made for some nice time to chat with the owner and her mother who was the one whipping up the great food in the kitchen
Regarding the salon itself it's a cute little place that's clean and pleasant
I love salad and find most places don't know how to make a decent salad the one at Charleston's was so good with fresh tomato and egg and the creamy garlic dressing
If you haven't tried this place go - despite the few bad reviews
There are other places but this is the closest and never had anything bad
so we will make the 30 minute trip to try it again and because I do business in the area - it is a good place to take clients but Brah - Mai Tais need to be mo bettah
Great prices and a good reward program to earn free parkingI LOVE THIS PLACE
Now this is not a cheap place to eat but I've rarely found a good French restaurant that's easy on the wallet
This was a really good meal and I never knew this place existed even though we live 5 miles away
Can't say anything bad about this place and strangely enough I haven't much good to say either
I really like all three of these courses and after several years of playing all over the place I have decided that I can play mostly these three courses for a reasonable price and a great golf experience
This place is trying for great things and I appreciate the enthusiasm of the chef who makes himself available and is passionate about his food however it's clear he's pretty green still and there is lots of room for improvement as far as food goes
The little Mexican food place attached to Charlie's serves really good food late night but now I understand why they can't sell water or soda through the inside window to Charlie's customers
After the shower was over I began getting text messages about how cute the place was and how much my friends can't wait to go back
it's really one of those hole in the wall places and everyone knows that's where teh good food really are
Its a cute little place with lots of little rooms
it was a good meal and it looks like there are some other interesting items on the very small-ish menu but I really don't understand all the fuss about this place
Great place for families and they can accommodate large parties maybe not 25 but 8-15 definitely
This is a great place to take a Geology buff
Always a great place to stop by in the mall
The breaksfasts here are always think consistently very good and I can't think of a visit to this place where the food hasn't been wonderful
Looking for a place to dine with friends from California that was not overly expensive but good food was easy
The reviews of this place were great and when we did arrive a couple at another table were cleaning their plates to the last drop
And the great thing is Andrews is exactly the way a BBQ place should be
Despite this potentially stiff crowd the place was lively and everyone seemed to be having a perfectly good time
My overall exp' with this place was great
It's a good place to grab a meal hit up happy hour or before a spring training game
some cute stuff but overpriced and I cannot allow myself to spend too much money at a place where I don't feel so welcome
Had a great person who did awesome designs on nails & toes but moved to a different shop so I had to venture out and find me a new place
Seems like a great place for all levels of fitness
Great sandwiches beers all reasonably priced; a small but worthwhile selection on tap bigger selection in bottles and cans great dog-friendly patio great ambience inside and out small selection of starters and salads
I don't even usually eat beans at other places but they were SO good here
The cute couple that run this place is super nice and inviting
*flushes* Too bad I don't live in Phoenix because this would be my new favorite place
I think it is deliberate on their end to create a relaxed atmosphere however turning tables slowly added to the high rent district they are in has a cost that has to be applied to the food
I mean the other reviews made this place sound great
My sister Cher T and I came here because I was wanting Thai food and She heard that this place had good reviews
Appetizers are good they could have a little better selection but its a pizza/sports bar kinda place the pizza is yummy especially the Boce' Ball its other worldly
It wasn't the 'pee my pants' kinda goodness I'd hoped for from a place that is basically guaranteed business being inside a corporate center
Elephant Thai is a good thai place with a varied menu freshly made food and nice atmosphere
I'm surprised this place has not gotten more reviews and good ones at that
With just a bit more care this place could be good they have many specials and a decent menu but the kitchen and or service hurts the overall experience
It was a great place to go on a sunday night to meet an old friend out for drinks
and grab a table because this place does a good thing to breakfast foods
I'd consider going back but I think I'd save this place for a casual dinner so my pocketbook handle it
For some reason I wasn't expecting this place to be any good
I am still giving 4 starts because the place is super cute the atmosphere hip and the food - wonderful
Overall if your not in a hurry and have some good company try this place
There's a great mix of every style but my favorite thing about this place is seeing old furniture just like you used to use back in the day
What they lack in some areas they make up for in others and overall not a half bad place
First off to be fair to other so called Cajun places in the valley while you are quite good nothing compare to true Louisiana Cajun and boy that's what this is
If you want a good home cooked meal with southern hospitality this place is for you
I can't imagine a cuter lunch place if I tried and I'd come here again and again just for the sweet atmosphere
It was good for a hot dog my mind wasn't blown but its still a great place to check out when you are in Phoenix
I haven't been to this place in a while-- I was contracting at Intel and this was a nice spot to hit for lunch so I went several times over the course of 3 months and from a convenience standpoint it certainly had a great taste-to-distance ratio
I have to admit that I had a great experience seeing a film in theater #2 at this place this weekend
There is no other great fried chicken place on this side of the valley
I do have a logical reason to give this place a bad review
I will say that the atmosphere is cozy comfortable and affords you privacy to enjoy a romantic meal with your significant other
But if I feel like splurging a hundred bucks on a romantic meal with someone I just don't understand why anyone would do so at this national chain wannabe-slash-poser restaurant instead of a truly nice unique authentic place elsewhere in the Valley
I have been to many of the valley's fine steakhouses and loved the casual atmosphere unlike the stuffy Capital Grille
We like to try different places and while we were shopping at Tempe Market Place we thought that this might be a decent little place for some good ol' fashion rolls
But both are great and just as good as other soups I've had at places like Benihana's
It has a really neat and classy atmosphere and both waitresses and the chef I've had were friendly fun and provided great service
To me what makes a pho place good is the broth
The service is always good and so is the atmosphere
This place has all the elements of a great neighborhood hangout
This place is just a great little pet shop
I was on yelp looking for a good pizza joint in my new area and found something so much better The Parlor My boyfriend had mentioned this place before and I said something snarky like The Parlor of what
The atmosphere is comfortable and casual there were all ages and kinds dining
And their specialty rolls are cute not as much variety as other places but I do love the addition of sprouts in the roll
This is a great place if you have a dog and want to hike with your dog
I really want to like this place because the food is pretty good and they have vintage soda brands but they make it pretty tough
If your looking for a wowing taste of mexican this isn't it but if you need a quick lunch or dinner and want a burrito or some gumbo it's not a bad place
There are some great places here and even a couple of nice places to sip wine but the feel of Postino is totally different
This place is great for locals to hang because it's a beautiful hotel so you feel like you're on vacation but you don't have to pay for the room
I feel badly because this place has such a good atmosphere and great staff but I just don't care for the food
if you are looking for good food in a casual environment then this place is for you
I would highly recommend this place for someone seeking an out-of-the-box experience in a quaint casual setting
All in all this place is great Great service Great machines great pricing Ooh the pricing very affordable compared to the surrounding salons and being next to a gym makes it an easy evening and little driving
A nice place to spend a few hours and pick up some great products
The atmosphere was good with the car show going on
I think customer service is what really makes this place great
When I return to Scotsdale this will be the place I stop for good quality coffee and accommodating atmosphere
The service was good and the place was clean
This is a large sports bar and a great place to hang out during the week or for happy hour -- grab some pub grub play trivia or maybe golden tee
It is a casual yet kind of industrial/trendy place
I guess one good thing came out of this - we found a better place with better crawfish
I have a Croatian friend who has an addiction to good bread and he is completely hooked on this place
The staff is very friendly the store is very inviting and an overall great place to shop
Maybe a good place to take a date to see how they would react to such a funny thing
I have been told that this place is good and always found it to be way too salty
It's a good place for off the leash running with the dog
This is also a great place to go bird watching as many birds especially wading ones are frequently seen along the route
Add the atmosphere awesome sauces low country may go down as my favorite and great staff I think they have a winning combo
I would have preferred a darker more intimate atmosphere but it was not bad
The atmosphere reminded me of Delux Burger a little too loud for me but not too bad
This is my go-to place when I have guests in town for an all around great dining experience
Compared to other popular gourmet burger places I would say that for the money that it is a good buy but if you don't mind spending the extra for better quality suggest going elsewhere
I can't say that I've had a bad time ANYTIME I've been to one but the atmosphere at The Big Bang might have been my least favorite out of the ones I've been to
Trust me when I say that Asian Grill is a great place for lunch on a weekday
You can tell that the place is well kept and the staff is great
The only bad thing I can say about this place is that the Vietnamese singing on the TV can get annoying after awhile but this hardly changes how good the food is
The ambiance is nice and upscale and it would make a great place for second date with someone you are trying to impress
The anticipation was great as the build up came from the surroundings of such a modern restaurant with a very balanced darkness which completed the experience with atmosphere lighting
The have great happy hour specials; a good place to go after work for a beer and some food
Our server Kai was great and I think on a Fri or Sat night this would be a good place to grab some drinks or dinner
This is my type of placeFirst and foremost Tasty Kabob has good well-executed food
95 to drink and it was commented to me that it wasn't very good in comparison to other places
But for now this place is great and I can't wait to see it grow
Overall it's a good place to explore but once is good enough for me
The biggest challenge is that it's a pretty good place surrounded by some really great places
As an aside this place is always good for people-watching
Very good place and will go back next time I am in Scottsdale
I read a lot of good reviews so maybe I hit this place on a really bad day of holiday travel
Not a new place but their house wines by the glass are great quality for the price $5 and their premiere beers on tap are 32 ounces and only $3
because the place is pretty classy and has good food and decent drinks
Would be a great place for a large group or special occassion
would come to the forefront of my brain when I think of places to go out to for the night but it's good for what it is and I could see it being a decent enough joint to catch a game or two
This place is not good over priced and located in the back of the biltmore for a good reason
On the other hand this is only because the place is so good and people are starting to figure it out
The food at this place was very good that's the most positive thing I can say
Pretty basic stuff but great if you have a craving for any of those and easy to suit many palates in one place
Great atmosphere friendly service and excellent food for very cheap
This is a stylish good-sized place & it was already almost full of lively diners at 1145
This place is a great place to throw a small party or have a romantic night
The place looks a little run down but they do great work the prices on full details are great
The beef caldareta was very good with shreds of meat soaking in the sauce which I scooped up and placed on my rice
Nice cozy place to have a good filling meal
This place is always clean and really has good food
ATMOSPHERESort of bare bones wine bar atmosphere BUT always stocked with great art
Noble Beast is a good replacement for O&A and I'm glad there is another wonderful local pet store
I will admit I'm puzzled by what the recording says when I walk in/out and by what some of the stuff says as I have no understanding of how to read ideograms but great place nonetheless
Great BBQ place excellent food and good value
I love non-chain restaurants to begin with and this place exemplifies the attention to detail and wholly pulled-together ambiance that a great one-off place could be
For those in college a great place to move away from cheap beer pictures into a classier bar experience rignt next to all those crazy college bars
It was a great experience loved the atmosphere and felt very welcomed
I'm all for trying new places and I thought this might be pretty good
This place is a great place to come to and watch a game or two
Or in our case a great place to come to after watching out team win or lose the game
It has a great vibe and the music is actually better than most places
Keep up the good work nice to see a place stepping it up for a change
Great food pretty good service and a nice upscale atmosphere
Overall a good place to catch some late night fast food
For those of you who'll notice don't feel too bad about the withered eggplant outside the side entrance where the garden is they'll come back after the nasty Arizona summer passes
I thought it was a pretty yummy place for lunch and the enormous patio was great for big groups
I'm telling you this place is seriously really great
In fact I wish that the place up north was more casual like this one
This is a great locally owned breakfast place to try out
My hubby and I were in the area and saw this place had good reviews so we gave it a go
This is a great little place I will be back every time I come to town
Not quite sure that this place would be able to pull off good drinks and excellent food I let my eyes wander around the space that was created
There was a lovely fireplace good intimate lighting defined areas of conversation and what appeared to be very attentive service
If I was big into sports though this would be a great place to hang out during happy hour or something
Ra definitely serves up a trendy atmosphere and great service but those factors alone are not enough to mask their below par food
It is a great place to study quietly or to just chill
The place has a great wood smoked smell inside and it's a bit dark inside which I kind of like and provides a nice atmosphere
During the winter the bar inside is great as it has a huge fireplace and an inviting atmosphere to partake in some cocktails
The outdoor patio also has a fireplace and a great place to sit when it's not too hot
The service is always great and everyone in this place is super friendly
Not a place you would expect when going into a strip mall but we are finding more and more restaurants that have great food in these strip mall locations
the atmosphere is relaxed and they usually have some good music playing
It is very peaceful and quiet and just a great place to enjoy a cup of coffee from their cafe and talk to a friend
Overall this is a great date place nothing gets a emo funky artsy girl hotter than an Andy Warhol original or a Jackson Pollack
A truly quirky place with a great little Craft Beer Selection & Bread Bowl Soups to die for
Normally I'm a big fan of Macaroni Grill--the food is pretty good and I like the atmosphere but the service at this location is usually lacking unless you can get the one server in the place that seems to know what's going on
The key to this place is the meat is cooked over fire which only a few taco shop type places in greater Phoenix bother to do and it imparts a different flavor to the meat
We miss this place no that we are in Austin and have many good memories here
It has a casual fun sporty atmosphere and the wait staff does their best to be accommodating as well
Maybe after the corrections to the menu and items offered this will be a great place to eat
They reopened the doors in October 2011 and the place looks great
Average lunch is about $10-12 a plate which isn't cheap but with the good food cool inside atmosphere and adorable patio I will gladly pay a few bucks extra to support a great local business
This place was always great in the past but my recent visit there sucked
This place is fun and lively and has a really great patio
The food in this place is outrageously good and authentic
Here's the knock and most likely why this place isn't burning busy with customers - the service is bad - consistently bad
I ended up getting the fresh fish of the day it was some weird random fish from New Zealand I really liked it especially with the lemon sauce on top  I don't really have much to say about this place though it was good food but I am still heartbroken at the fact they don't have any whiskey that isn't disgusting
Definitely try this place out if you're in a mood for a good sandwich oh and I guess the real meat ones are supposed to be good too ha
What a great new place to have in Old Town Scottsdale
Whatever type of person you are this is a great place to go if you are the type who can make your own fun
I am always reminded that this place can fit any occasion from a romantic dinner to a night out with friends
This is the only Taiwanese place there so I hope they iron out the kinks and have a great run
But now I kinda wanna slew-foot Guy Fieri just that little bit more for telling me that this place was so good
the couches are cozy for conversation inside and there is a great patio out back complete with a a fireplace
OK so writing a bad review for this place is almost like a high school kid kicking a defenceless baby  it just does not make any sense
I would give this place a half star if I could because the only thing good about this place is the fact that they are cheap enough for the people who are crazy enough to think the stuff they sell here is food
I wouldn't expect that sort of risk at a chain restaurant in Phoenix of all places but it's good to know that such options are available
I have lived in the valley my whole life and I have yet to find a place similar to Kaz it truly is great especially in a sea of not so great places in Oldtown Scottsdale
been there done that and there's not much else I can say about it but for the sport of people-watching this a great place to hang out in the corner and just take it all in
By the way there were no screaming kids in the place--maybe because it's a bar/restaurant  Thank goodness
They did a good job of packing the sandwich and actually cooking the Bacon instead of some disgusting boiled flab of fat that you see at fast food places
It has the feel of a casual slightly upscale gathering place for couples friends and families alike
I'm glad we tried Chelsea's Kitchen and I'll be back many more times for their great food at reasonable prices all with friendly service and in a cool atmosphere
The atmosphere is nice laid back with good music the people check in with you but not so much that it's annoying so points there too
It was great he had fun and I got to out for dinner at a place that does not have a kiddy meal
I really can't justify a 5 star rating for a McDonalds but I will give it 4 stars considering it's a great place to drive through for a dollar drink from time to time
the sweet tea is great - not TOO sweet like at most places
The atmosphere is comfortable romantic and warm
I'll start by saying I added one star because it really is just a lovely place it's too bad the food is so average and that's being generous
I was meeting my friend's parents who were in town on vacation and thought it would be a nice casual place with hopefully great wine and food
The clientele was mostly of the older generation great place to read the paper and shoot the bull with strong coffee in hand
Nevertheless the service was good atmosphere was nice and parking was abundant =
The place has  a great family atmosphere and the food is delectable
And like I said the coffee was good but I think any gelato place in the cenpho/arcadia regions can make it better
I can't say that ATS has the best carne asada I've had in Phoenix but the atmosphere and the patio make for a great evening
I don't think I'll be returning because the kitchen has difficulty managing to push out food which is too bad because I really wanted to become a regular at this place; the menu looks awesome if only they could get the food out to you in under two hours
The atmosphere is kinda awkward but their food is great
I was happy when I saw it was roomy had a great place to sit and eat outside and there were actual servers that would bring you your food
Good place for kids but can get insanely busy on Friday nights or during key games
If you aren't a Cubs fan you probably won't find this place to be all that great but it is somewhere that any baseball fan should check out at least once
Ambience is good - a bunch of tables and the speakers seem to be alwaysblasting indie/alternative tunes
However if you are willing to brave the atmosphere the food is darn good
Yeah I have to agree this place is consistently bad
The place is dark and sexy and a great place if you want to continue a date and get all sorts of romantical
This place is a great sit back drink your sorrows away and feel better about yourself by people watching kind of place
I will say that sometimes you feel slightly rushed but for the most part it is still a great place to dine
This place is good to go to if you're hungry and stumbling drunk at 2 am
I still consider this a good place and most items are priced low
That sounded like a good idea to me and I thought I should try a chicken and waffles place here in Phoenix and compare
Sadly I will never know if this place is good or not
I have been looking for a good barbeque place for quite some time and I have finally found it
I will definitely be returning to this place for some great food and customer service
For dates it is great the dining room has a classy quiet atmosphere
We fell on this place which got great reviews and seemed like it would be fun and delicious
If all of my other dishes were as good as this one I'd be raving about this place
It's a great place to stop for a bite before or after the free Art Walk on Thursday nights in Old Town
I love Port of Subs and continually brave the slow service at this place because the subs are so damn good
It's a fairly unpretentious place with good beer and a friendly staff
Staff is always friendly and speedy and the atmosphere is trendy/casual/relaxed/come as you are
This place is super popular with the veggie/vegan set and for good reason there are lots of options for those wanting their grub sans animalia
Hard to criticize a place that combines great food great value and great fun
Though I've lived within a few miles of AJs for several years I just recently discovered how much I like this place - this is a great place for groceries as well as for a nice lunch over your noon hour at work
My vegan friend suggested this place to me and my other friend we were skeptical that vegan food could taste good
I liked the ambiance here great place to grab a bite with friends and chill
This is an upgraded Irish pub/bar with a great beer selection yummy yummy yummy crab cakes and a cozy atmosphere
LGO has a fun atmosphere and a cute store to wander around in while you wait
The setting is excellent the ambience is relaxed and plentiful
What a great intimate place for a date night or dinner with a few friends
We've tried some pretty good burger places in the Valley and other major US cities and Blu Burger holds it own compared to the competition
Good place to grab a burger and a beer but doesn't go the extra mile IMO
I highly recommend this place for some great mariscos
This place is really good for a quick breakfast
Loved the vibe of the place - great mix of people art furniture
This place has so many good reviews that I will most likely give it another shot get it
I guess what it comes down to is that I can't knock the place for being bad because it certainly wasn't but there are at least three other Asian restaurants and an Oregano's in the same tiny strip mall and I kind of wish I chose any of them instead
This Island's is one of my favorite places to go for casual fun food
Fellow Yelpers Brian S and Donald SDined here with me on several platesAnd an appetizerThe service was strongThe atmosphere was niceThe food was very goodNothing broke but the rice
i can't wait to go back and hit this place up again it was a fun atmosphere with an incredible menu and great servers
They were quite good certainly not enough volume to replace an entree
If you're ever up in the area and looking for a nice atmosphere with good food then give El Encanto a try
Still a good place to visit but mainly for those who can't hear the echoes of the crowds that used to inhabit it
This place is on the cusp of greatness but is held back with weak supporting dishes
Pros- Calm/Quiet atmosphere- Clean- Amenities are good *Hot tub outdoors and inside large steam room & sauna
It's not a bad thing to opt for the outside seating here like it is at other places
Not that my reviews are the end all be all but I do like to give props to places that really are top to bottom great restaurants
+++ There was not anyone else in the front dining room so I got to chat with the man a bit he said they have been there 2 years I came at a slow time late afternoon after lunch rush which was great we had the whole place to ourselves
I highly reccommend this location as good place for groups
It is a great place for fast small hike without having to travel out of town
It's a great place to escape the heat and spend some time outdoors without a lot of exertion
They have consistently good service here on Dysart and the place is always immaculate
The pizza was good and in any other place I would be overly impressed but I think the years of hype stole away some of the pizza's thunder
Places that charge a little more are definitely worth it considering I will likely have to get my nails redone because they are so bad
It is so open and had great space for the stage the buffet set up and other little fun attractions set up around the place
Definitely a fun place to stop by for a good meal a good drink or if you want to have a full on fiesta with you and 50 of your closest friends
It's a nice place for a casual dinner that is good and not too expensive
Overall I think this place is somewhere between 3 and 4 stars but I rounded up because the employees were friendly and they have a good variety of stuff on their menu
It's definitely a cute venue although I don't understand the distinctions about being a great date night place because it is quite small and privacy is limited
Call for reservations but keep in mind that the bar is a great place to have your meal as well
I wanted to love this place because I had heard great things from friends but unfortunately my husband and I were disappointed in our experience
I went here craving fish and chips as well as the well-worn comfortable atmosphere that one expects from a good Irish pub
I have no problem paying for good food but this place is more style than substance
So good I almost have to go back and lower the ratings of 5 star restaurants just to emphasize that this place isn't playing around
I will try this place again - good value and not far from the airport another plus
I think this place has a real chance of becoming something great
Yes beautiful ambiance and a great place for a romantic dinner
I was in desperate need of a mani/pedi and I had bookmarked this place after I read the great reviews from Sara and Halley
I couldn't believe my great luck in finding this place
So basically I would give them 5 stars for their espresso baked goods  and atmosphere
It's intimate so I can actually talk to my friends and not over the music has great wine and liquor list priced reasonably relative to other places great service and knowledgeable staff
If you're ever in Central Phoenix near 7th Avenue and Thomas and need a bite for breakfast or lunch 5th Avenue Cafe may really surprise you with their homey atmosphere friendly service good food and low prices
Goodness gracious alive do I ever love this place
This place has a great selection of awesome natural food and treats
Overall food and  atmosphere were great but the service was exceptional
I have been told by many that Flo's is the PLACE to go for GREAT Chinese food
The design of the place is awesome so trendy great tunes at the perfect volume
The service was good thankfully; and they offered to replace my meal with something else
Still Carlsbad Tavern wasn't the type of place from which I expected to receive a sub-par meal
As the only hot pot place around that we could find at least Tien Wong is really good
The place is dim so it's a little bit romantic but each table is well-lit so you can see if your food is properly cooked
Hot pot should be pretty inexpensive and the places I usually go to give you good portions for pretty cheap prices
If you like Kung Pao like a lot of good food for little price this is the chinese food place to go
It's almost as good as my favorite place back home
The Spicy Tuna Roll is made much different than you would normally get at a sushi place but it was surprisingly very good  and spicy
Good bread fresh meat that isn't slimy and questionable like at some places and lots of ingredients
This is a good asian place if you know what to expect
We visited Santa Fe and our relatives took us out to a couple of places for good New Mexico food
The atmosphere is great and fun but the food should be their number one concern
This is an appropriate place to go if you want to feel good about yourself
-I saw several people coming in the store with arm loads of clothing from their closet so this must be a pretty good place for your unwanted duds
Just a good place to hang out and relax with friends
After getting to Tutti Santi cute quaint family owned place I was excited to sit down and eat
Great service fun atmosphere and I will definitely be back to enjoy another one of their delicious meals
This is a great place to get a beer and appetizers
The bar staff is great and it's important to note this place does everything Good
The atmosphere is great and well worth visiting
every time its a great burger out of that place and a great deal
I love this place  yup local owned with a sense of mom and pop goodness
Cyprus Grill looked promising considering the owners are Greek and the place got good reviews
I've found a few places in Phoenix to get a good gyros sandwich
the bad things about the place are the fact that there is no beer on tap which always drives me crazy
I don't think this place is any better or worse than other places like it but It's convenient to me and it was pretty good
This is obviously a great place to find trendy of-the-moment pieces for fabulous prices
If you are looking for a happy hour with great drink specials and free chips and salsa then this is your place
The restaurant always has great ambience and is visually stimulating as well
The inside decor isn't much but I'll take good food at a place rather than nice decor/surroundings and bad food
This place has a great atmosphere perfect for dates groups and girl's night
Dad had the ribs/chicken combo and thought the ribs were surprisingly good for a non-barbeque place
Even on off nights Sapporo is a great place to people watch
I know it isn't bad but no one customer should incur the penalty of the baristas not having shaken the product properly in the first place
It's really good for a date if you want to impress him or her and a day with the girls always warrants a neat little place like this
Finally a great place in the Arrowhead area for fish n chips
Aside from the loud environment and my very minor quibbles with some of the food preparation it's definitely a place to go for a great seafood meal
Irish coffee cupcake was a bit disappointing in terms of how high I regard this place but was good for what it was if that makes sense
A great place to grab a casual quick lunch in Old Town
The restaurant itself is nice good atmosphere and the service has always been good
5 -3 but the place is cute and homey and I guess that is what makes it so quaint
While first and foremost an art  gallery -- and it's diversity of interior and exterior spaces make it a great place for large scale installation work as well as more intimate showings -- it is also a unique space for all sorts of events from indie rock concerts to corporate fundraisers and would make an AMAZING place for a wedding ceremony and reception
The atmosphere was good drinks were reasonably priced and the food decent
Google maps doesn't give you a very good location with this business just like most places in Anthem
pretty good food especially the green chiliusually but I can't eat in a dirty place and the floor had food everywhere the last few times we were there
The thing is that this is a great place to be
Teavana is a great place to learn about tea health benefits proper storage etc
The Arizona Biltmore used to be such a great place
I'd heard great things and it's the type of place that is typically right up my alley so I was very disappointed with my recent experience
The place is super cute has a bike rack and has tons of seating BUT I wish the coffee was a bit stronger
fantastic place Mario and Peter owners are awesomeFinally adding this review to my yelpI went there last night this isnt really last night it is few months ago - it is still excellent not too and it was excellent - The beer list they have is fantastic and Mario who is a part owner was behind the bar and it was good talking to himArrived just at the end of happy hour they have $1 off draft beers for happy hour and half priced glasses of wine and there was a certain amount off well drinks but i don't recall what that isThey are going to be working on their mixed drink menu they wont have that ready to go for another week or twoStarted out with Schneider Aventinus Doppel Weizen BockGermany 8
2% which could be my new favorite beer it is a unfiltered wheat bock amazingOne of the nice touches is that they have the proper beer glass to go with each beer they have on tap in the appropriate sizes and the largest karmeliet glass i have ever seen and they have a lot of imports on the list so they are doing great in the strong ale category - which is my favorite type of beerAs i was looking at the menu I asked if they had foie gras because i saw a picture on their facebook page and Mario told me they always have that as an off the item menu and it could be prepared however I would like it - which sounded great to meFoie Gras torchon with toast points honey comb apples cherries - also had a lemon tuille and some micro greens as wellThe honeycomb was a very nice touch because it got the sweetness however the bonus was the nice texture it added to the overall My friend ordered Heirloom Tomatoes and Gioia Burrata and i got a taste of that it was a great salad and had small bread sticks and fresh pesto on it as well very light and refreshing - just the thing after foie gras for my main i ordered the crispy half duck it was confit duck style the skin was very crispy and it was a huge portion - the duck was very good the crispy duck skin fat had lots of flavor with it - and i was happy to have confit again since i still dream of the chez dumonet duck i had in Paris this summer - my only change i would have made was the side items it was served with i would have liked dauphine potatoes - with that said it was the best duck i have had in AZ and i was happy it was not just seared duck breast My friends ordered the spinach Gnochi Black Tagliolini Mediterranean Sea BassI tried the Sea Bass which was was very good with the skin on crispy and crab on top the pasta dishes all looked amazing although i didnt get to try them i will certainly be trying them on my next visitrubee while i was there quite a few people ordered the crispy ribs - they looked great and everyone said they were deliciousSeems like there will be specials each day as well based on what looks good in the market everything coming out of the kitchen looked great - finally a place with an awesome beer list and delicious food - looking forward to seeing what they do with their cocktail list will certainly be back and it is nice they have parking
Management is obviously taking good care of the place so I'll definitely be back
It's the perfect spot for a romantic date but it's also a great place to throw back some wine with a group of friends
We were really hungry after work and couldn't decide on a place but since we drive down Central and see this place everyday we figured now was as good a time as ever to give it a shot
I think at the beginning of my trip I would have given the Saguaro 2-stars but like a really bad first blind date sometimes you can't judge a place by first impressions and you've got to give it a second chance to really see what it's made of
So when we were organizing a double-date night our foursome all from Chicago decided that this was a great place to visit
Overall the food was good and the atmosphere was nice
This is still a good restaurant but it is not the stellar place it once was
All in all great place to attend or host an event
It's hard to keep a great place like this a secret for too long
We did have great service and a really nice time but to rate this place anything under a 5 - just for the quality of the culinary experience would be unfair
The bottom line at Fuego Bistro - although service was very good and the place is really cool - is the food
2 stars for the torta dessert - not that goodAmbience and service are great
Two Hippies is a great little no brainer kind of placed to eat
I love that during nice weather they can open the place up and the patio is great
I've been a member at this location for about a year and a half now and it's always been a great place for my husband and I to go and work out
It'd be a cute Sunday evening/afternoon date place
The place itself is a typical chain restaurant so you're going to get that casual relaxed vibe
This place is great for a couple of reasons
The family vibe of Gourmet Wok is great I love seeing places like this survive hard times
The atmosphere was *great* it was 101 degrees outside still but they have those misting hoses around the patio area and the inside is a beautiful bar and my date was great
Overall sushi was good and the atmosphere was nice for a date night
Great place to look for a party dress
Looking for a great street-style taco this is the place to go
And that's what's great about this place
The San Tan is a great place to grab a good beer and some good food
Atmosphere is great and  there is lounge vibe all around with fun music they have a dj
We were just there for funsies but it looked like a few celebrations were going on so it seems like a good place for groups
Let me start  by saying this place is GREAT
I told her I was looking for a place to get some great prices on frames and she said You have found the place
but we ordered a TON of food and a TON of drinks well they did not me Its a great first date or special occasion type of place a little pricey for an every day dinner kind of night
First if you are here for work it's a great place to kill some time
They are BAD I hate those damn places where the cute little puppies are in little boxes with fecies all over and they look sad
All in all it's a good place to get fit in a reasonable amount of time on decent equipment
After a great cocktail at the bar LOVE the atmosphere including the open kitchen -- very warm space with high energy we sat and enjoyed the mussel app
Overall I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the food was good; I wouldn't hesitate to go here for a business dinner or accept an invitation to go but I won't be picking it in the near future
I have to say that everyone who worked at the place is great
It is however a great place to take your kids
I haven't tried it yet because every time I go to this place I get full from eating all of the other goodies
Let me start off by saying that the ambiance is great excellent lighting decor place settings etc
If you're downtown and looking for great food I would highly recommend this place
I've had Roscoe's in LA so I was a bit skeptical of a chicken and waffle house in Scottsdale of all places - however they do a great job
Visited Phoenix for business and wanted to find a nice place for a good burrito
This place also has a great brunch with some good bloody Mary's
I passed up three other nearby shoe places and drove a little further to this one after reading all the great Yelp reviews
Great ambience friendly quick service and fantastic food
The food is decent so it gets an extra star for that but with service this bad when the place is slow I can't imagine what it is like when a football or hockey game is going on
One of the most important things in life is a great breakfast place
If you are looking for a good tastey sandwhich this is a great place to check out
Historic home turned bar The Roosevelt is dark romantic and the perfect place to spend hours drinking wine by the glass or bottle or beer from their fairly extensive beer menu while getting to know that special someone
The sweet potato fries were really good but not the best I've had but that might be because I have a favorite place for that
We brought our two young kids which immediately felt inappropriate because the place has a very dim romantic vibe
Now that I've tried a good chunk of it my heart has drifted from the illusion that a swanky atmosphere and a menu dotted with gfs and vs will always be indicative of sheer healthy brilliance
I have been addicted to this place here lately and I can't get enough what can you ask for in a good nosh spot
If you are the type that is in a huge rush this may be a good place for you
Great food and lots of it friendly staff who are happy to explain anything on the menu and one of the few places where 2 different atmospheres are offered
But among the pluses are a great atmosphere otherwise a patio good iced tea solid baked goods if they have blondies when you go you have to get one and the attached art gallery which is sometimes open at lunch time and serves as a great diversion from work
My friends have told me a lot of good things about this place but honestly I just don't see why
Good Japanese noodle houses are hard to come by but this is definitely a great place
Its tough for me and my wife to Love this place due to the Gilty feeling of bad eating we get after visiting this establishment
I had heard this was a great little place long before it was visited by the Food Network's Diners and Dives but I think perhaps the publicity while perhaps has brought in more business has done a number to the food quality and especially the service
This particular Apple store is great; not only does it sell amazing products but I've never had a problem getting a faulty device replaced
Things I learned last nightI love unpretentious yet quality service in a relaxed atmosphere
Dylan and Michelle have a great place
They have a little cafe on the first floor but I would leave that for emergencies like your blood sugar dropping or a toddler who must have a cookie All in all great place to spend the day
The place is good for sports fans I guess and people in a hurry - or who have money to intimidate but if you're looking for a great meal and an enjoyable time save your money and dignity
Service is always pretty good even if the place is packed
BUT over all it is a good place with a great vibe
You can see and hear from anywhere in the place and the grassy risers were such a good idea
So I heard on the DL that this was a great place to go for some hip-hop on Thursday nights for The Blunt Club
makes a good burger but also makes you want to immediately change your clothes - no going out after you walk into this place
I get in atmosphere is pleasantsurroundings are cute  seafoam green and white colors are charming
Place is always  pretty clean too thank goodness for that
Good coffee great homemade pastries and food desks to study comfy chairs to relax in open and airy atmosphere friendly employees clean bathrooms indoor and outdoor seating spacious parking lot great music playing and a huge tv with sports
Ps it's a great place for a first date
Good atmosphere very breakfasty which is what you would expect
This little place is really creepy looking but really good
The place is never too busy *see the store front for why* but that's not necessarily a bad thing
The busiest parking lot and a great place to people watch as well is the entrance from 48th street to the east
Another great note is the space of this place
it's super cute and modern but what's so great about this place is the staff
It's a good place to drop in and grab a quick bite
Overall - a great lunch place with wonderful margaritas
The Mission is a great place to come for a fancier Mexican meal
The atmosphere is trendy and fun there are a ton of drink options and the food is quite good
The place was still pretty packed and for good reason the pizza is delicious
Filet Mignon 9 oz - You can hear this bad boy sizzle as they place it front of you and it lies there just dripping with sweats of taste
i have said it before it is all about the patio in AZ an they have the best one in old town great wrap around bar with  a cozy fireplace tucked in the back the menu is wonderful something for everyone making it great to go with friends or could even be a nice date spot
I love feeling like I'm in a place where I could easily get into a bit of trouble the good kind and Sidebar gives delivers every time
Great place to relax with friends throw back a couple drinks and chat
This is a wonderful place to eat with good food a good atmosphere good service and great desserts
Can't believe how bad this place is as far as order accuracy and priority
If anyone knows of another place with a salsa bar even half as good as La Condesa's please let me know
I felt ignored and rushed which was not all bad cuz I didn't really want to talk to any of the standard Phoenix phonies that were in the place
I don't mind paying $30 for a good hair cut but this place is not worth the risk
Delux is a trendy place but the food is pretty good
I think it is a great place for a happy hour or to meet up with a few friends but not the best place for nice dinner since it is so crowded and has funky tables
This place always smells so good walking by
Atmosphere is great only downfall is I feel as though if I was going to meet a friend for coffee I couldn't go here-it's a pretty quiet place where people like to work on projects/homework/cruise the internet in silence
This is definitely one of the best places to catch live music because it attracts such great talent
It's a breakfast place a few steps above The Good Egg
The atmosphere is very casual and there are always kids there
If you need a place to go to fill up a bunch of hungry kids who are happy with just having a big selection rather than a few great items - this could be the place for you
Located in the center of Downtown this place is a good place for some happy hour or good lunch
Inside is a bit different and overall I'd say this place is a bit too pricey but it's a nice time and the food is quite good
I read all the great reviews on here and in the 'Phoenix's 23 of the Valleys best new places to chow down' and was excited - both my sister and I love street tacos
Overall it wasn't horrible - it just wasn't good - definately not 25 dollars worth -  this is not a place I would return to nor would I recommend it to anyone elseIf you want good street tacos see my reviews
think I'll slip on to the Rustler's RoosteOh I got friends in great places
I guess I was right this place I belongand yes I will return cause everythings alright and scenic I might addand I can't say goodnight and I'll show myself to the dance floor live band awesome
It's got kind of a rustic upscale look about it and a nice ambience a good mix of people from young couples through to families
This place combines Great service with Good prices and personable people
Having never visited any other locations but this one I can't tell you whether their customer service is across-the-line good but every time I walk into this place no matter how damned busy they are I always get a happy and nice greeting and am always helped within the first few minutes of stepping in
Ambience relaxed sophisticated modernMenu definitely not traditional
We've heard good things about this place that's why we tried it
The atmosphere is nice and dark with exposed brick walls and good art from local artists
I had heard this place had a great reputation and they definitely lived up to it
Also good points;-Huge beer selection over 100 micro brews and domestics-Over 15 wines-SAKE-Muli types of organic wine and  beer-Live music-Monthly rotating art-work for first Friday all money goes to artist if paid with cashThis is a great place to take out-of-towners
Overall the food was great and atmosphere was comfortable but just a little loud
What an awesome locally owned customer friendly restaurant with a laid back atmosphere and great food & drinks
After all you are captive at the resort which is a great place overall so look the other way on a couple of meals
She only had the ambience of which she thought wasn't great and the arrogance of our server to go on; I knew of Chef Matt Carter's reputation as well as Chef Beau MacMillan's endorsement of the best French onion soup at Zinc Bistro he's ever tasted on Food Network's episode of Best Thing I Ever Ate Cheesy
The decor and atmosphere is great as is the live DJ
It's a great place to go with friends and just hang for a bit
Brio is a loud restaurant - not a good place for conversation but even with all the bustle and noise we still ended up having a great time
For this place being an asian restaurant service was actually not bad
This could be a really cool place if the owner paid a little attention to his business lowered the prices a bit it's on the high side for a beer and burgers place and greatly improved their service
Great service decent Irish grub that makes you want to drink more Guinness authentic pub atmosphere and live music certain nights
This is a good place to hang out over a couple of pints while the food comes second
This is one of the best places to see a concert not a bad seat in the house
The service and atmosphere were great as per all the Joe's establishments
As other reviewers have said this is a great place for last minute gift ideas
For an old school burger and shake this place is great
Anyways great place for a greasy burger and fries
Delux is good atmosphere is cool service is great and if you sit at the long high top'd table you will make friends with the people sitting next to you
When we were dating we went to a few places in the east valley and were looking for some good pho and we think we found our place in the NW valley
Whether you make happy hour or not the food and drinks are great the prices are reasonable and - unlikely too many other Scottsdale places - it doesn't take itself too seriously
There is only one place in AZ where i'm a regular dim-sum-er and that's Great Wal
The only place that beat out their dim sum is a place in San Francisco- that tells you how great Great Wall is
Lots of TVs good atmosphere good food never overly busy to accomodate a group
Oregano's use to be my favorite place  but the last few times I have been there food  service is not very good I think oregano's need to focus on good customer service and food quality control
This place is intimate great for date night with the boy
I'm sure there's lots of other things that are good about this place but the poor customer service in dealing with the main reason I came here stained the experience
It's a great place to go for a break cause I can only take so much Modern Burger lol
But it is a great place to relax and grab a nice meal and drink especially by the waterfall late at night
Cute place to drop by when you're in the area and just want to kick back
A good combo and better than many other places I've tried
Great the same number that told me I had to go into the store to get it replaced
Overall the prices here really aren't bad and the ambience is generally friendly
It's also pretty quiet which makes it a good place to sit and study
It's a great place to find fun knick-knack toys and it has lots of fun candy to choose from
This place looks really cute and inviting but once you walk in the door that all changes
Very disappointing because the place has great potential
One star for great atmosphere and ambience
This place is not the third one yet but was on our way mostly to Goodyear
Take a good look at the pictures it helps when you are searching for this place
Overall this is a good little place with some really fresh tasty creative menu items
I feel kinda bad giving this place two stars with all the glowing reviews below me
Thanking my lucky stars for such a great place to lodge out of town guests
The friendly family that owns this place are from southern Italy and they def know how to cook and run a great restaurant
I was with coworkers this time and we got to try a few different things though-Fire roasted feta was pretty good and surprisingly spicy normally its not  in other places- Tzatziki was good but not amazing
Nice fireplace/fountain feature good for taking a date or significant other
I had a bad lumpia experience at this place
Atmosphere is nice seems like would be a great place to meet and hang out with friends for a visit and meal
We walk in nice place kind of surprising how cute it is inside
Summed it up best with saying it's Good for a standard breakfast because it really is nothing special picture that Grease Spoon place that your dad always used to take you to and take out the flies ugly staff and shady location
The place was small inside and lacked much ambiance but made for a great delivery/ to-go restaurant
It's a great place and doesn't make me want to go all SB-1070
It's a great place with a date or with a group
So far Aunt Chiladas has the best Margaritas I've had in the valley and we've been to quite a few places including Tee Pee where the food is good but the Margaritas suck
Overall a great place to enjoy sushi and unwind with family and friends
Can't say we ate here in HI but we do go to L&Ls in SoCal and this place is just as good
The service here has been great every visit with a staff of girls all in their twenties that are hip but not in an asinine way that some of these other types of places can be
Yep Moto is a great place as long as you don't order the sushi
The green curry was the same overproteined with not enough veggies especially bamboo but its flavor also wasn't quite as good as some other Thai places I've been to Swaddees & Yupha
A bad location strip mall in the middle of Glendale and an unimaginative atmosphere don't quite give people the spark to make the trek over
I wasn't quite sure what kind of place it was at first -- I figured they sold antiques but I did know if it would be a treasurer trove of junk or a hidden treasure of great finds
You know for what it is- this place is pretty good
Theres so many great areas of this park and they all have different character and atmosphere you cant go wrong
Good place for Mexican comparatively speaking
If you're looking for a good Mexican place and a meal price of around $30 Macayo's is it
So my recommendation is that the place is good enough however if you pressed for time don't go here
Haha- I love this I've heard good things about this place from my sister's friends notice I didn't say my friends
It is a pretty small place so it can definitely be a little crowded but it's a cute little place with good sushi
The atmosphere is so relaxed that I think you would be hard pressed to find a more caasual environment
The atmosphere is more like a fast food or cafeteria but the food is good
I would recommend this place to anyone that wants to get a good cheesesteak but it will not be the same as the Great ones
Conclusion this place has great potential
I like this grocery its cute and Phoenix needs this place
I'm looking for a place that has good chimichuri sauce if anyone knows please let me know
The last time I had great South american food was a place called Inferno in La Jolla CA but they are now a new restaurant
This place was pretty good but parking was always a pain even before they made Tempe Town Lake
I will be back as its the only place around there with good food that's open late at night
The decor in the place isn't that bad for me
Not only did he answer all their questions but he also gave me a great recommendation for a donut place next time I'm in Austin
The place is very cute small but in a cozy way
Normally I don't try a place more than twice if I have a bad experience but since I recall Bill Johnson's with such fondness I gave them more opportunities than I probably should have
I had never heard of it and there were not many people there but seriously this place was great
Ace is a great place to go when you are working on little projects aound the house
I loved the atmosphere the pizza was delicious nice crispy crust with a wood fired flavor premium toppings and service was great
Hooray another good Indian place opened up in the SW Valley to replace the late lamented Sutra
My wife and I stop there because it is a convenient place to meet always has parking and they do a great job with the coffee I get Iced Coffee; she gets Tea or water and an even better job on the sandwiches
I recommend this place to anyone who likes well-made light lunches with a good cold coffee drink
Thai House is a great place to grab some reliably delicious Thai food at great prices
EwwwwwAre people just giving this place good reviews bc they want to pretend like they're super cool and are totally down with hole in the wall places in the hood
All in all a great vegan spot to get something comforting but can be a little pricey for a quick service style place
It is also next door to Trader Joe's and walking distance from a bunch of cute sandwich places
Great atmosphere authentic Mexican toucans everywhere
I was surprised and I'll just say what a great place'
Also the music was good at first but then got switched to a bunch of covers of songs all by the same people and I didn't see a live band but it may as well have been so it got a little old and annoying and it's not a great place to dance
Although it has been maybe a year or so since I have been I do recall that the service was great but the place wasn't very busy which may have been a factor
It is a nice casual atmosphere and service was prompt
If you are looking for a good Thai place in the Chandler area head on over
I didn't say the best pizza anywhere I'm from NY so I know there are great places there but for east valley Arizona grub this is really really good
It's definitely the kind of course where there are good and very bad places to miss shots
Great service well Zoyo is a self serve place
This place has the potential for a great date spot and a great spot to go with a few friends
Definitely a great place for a celebration or special night out
I really didn't think I'd find a place that makes Hooters' food seem good
They gave us each a bag with some goodies which was great to carry all the cards and brochures from the cupcake places
Maybe it's the casual family owned atmosphere
My morning/afternoon started off great I thoroughly enjoyed the laid back yet classy atmosphere most importantly my body felt good and my belly was satisfied
There was a pretty good crowd in the place so they must be doing something right
The lighting is dim giving the place an alluring vibe and the cocktails are really great
I haven't had the food so I can't attest to that but if you're looking for a romantic spot to come on a date this place is perfect
Here is the scoop -- both places are good; Da Vang is better
In summary this restaurant has a lot of potential with the food being reasonably good in a nice place
The atmosphere was very nice and the staff was great
We heard great things about this place so we thought we'd try it
The drinks & guac/chips which were good arrive 15 mins after we placed the order & our dinner which was fair arrived 2 mins after that
This place is definitely casual and low-key
Great place to hang with your friends and be able to converse with them without shouting
The service was fast and the place was full a good sign
Not a good move on their part we would have had 3 more people in our party if we could have made a reservation later or had been told they never fill the place up nowadays because of the economy
GOOD DATE NIGHT PLACE or place to meet up with friends and hang
This is a great place for kids or to just do a quick stop to pick up part of your grocery list
I had a great weekend visiting wonderful places while in Arizona and this is one of them
A lot of places are putting desserts in jars its fun but I think the vessel led to the idea of deconstructing this conventional dessert which brought attention to each component which could have been good but didn't work out that way
Thank goodness almighty I've found the place for me
So what sets this apart from other burger places besides the GREAT service
Onto the foodChipsThinking back on all my Mexican food experiences I've had a bad chip experience once or twice at every place excluding this one
This place is great for out of the ordinary food items and they have a good selection of wine
The food came out fast and that was a great plus to this place which is why it has 3 stars
The service is great and so is the atmosphere but i'd eat in a cardboard box if i had to just to eat the food
I don't even think I can say a bad word about this place
People must have to convince themselves that this place is good because it's the trendy thing to do
The atmosphere is great and the staff friendly
I think that this place could be pretty good and I just had an off experience
YC's is still a good choice for Mongolian BBQ although it is not one the fanciest Mongolian place I have been to
This is a good local place that fills a gaping hole for good takeout in the area with some dishes that are very hit or miss
The atmosphere is great here with 2 beautiful patio areas and the bar inside has what looks like is about 100 draft beer selections several flat screen TVs throughout
The booths and table are very comfortable and the whole place has a nice dark warm feeling great date place for dinner then grab a movie or show nearby
We went out of our way to eat here for a reason it is consistently great food great service & great atmosphere
Just being in this place makes you feel great
I finally found a place that does great pedicures and manicures
Those who've never tried dim sum in their life before will say this place is good but actually it is NOT good at all
There are 3 good dim sum places in Phoenix area Golden Buddha Great Wall Phoenix Palace on Ray not the one on Warner
I think that the store had a great atmosphere when I walked in
Just got back from The Vig on a Wednesday night and I must admit it was a damn good place
I sat outside on the patio which was a great atmosphere with lots of people gathered around their tables or sitting on the couches in the lounge area just having a good time with those they were with
Check out this place for the ambiance and great Italian food
I've gotten food poisoning at Wendy's in my home town so when i tried this place in Phoenix it was pretty good and didn't make me sick
I love a good burger and while nothing really competes with the Fez Burger this place will be making a run for the top spot
On Saturday night we were looking for late night bite - There was an hour wait for a table at 10pm but the atmosphere is great and we were into the music
We finally got our table and here's where the 3 stars come in - the service was not good its the kind of place where the servers seem put out by you and it was very
LOVED THE cute in this place- Went here on a date
The room was clean and pretty big plenty of parking and good access to places to eat and in a safe area
I read a lot of reviews of this place on Google last night and almost didn't go because the reviews were pretty bad
Overall I thought this place was pretty good
Sorry but this place was just not good and I will not be back
There is way too many places in Phoenix and the surrounding towns that offer great food at great prices without the wait
So hopefully you'll take the time to stop in Halo do some shopping and help out a really great organization- it's a fantastic and worthy place to spend your money
Both my husband and I have used this place and had a great experience each time
Overall not a bad place to get a fresh salad for lunch
Hula's has a great patio/bar atmosphere
The wait staff was super friendly and the atmosphere was great
The menu is typical of wine bars serving salads sandwiches and burgers but the detail and flavor they place on thier entrees is great
Good place though and this is from someone who isn't a sandwich girl
We didn't eat and the place was pretty crowded as expected but it was a good time and the Guinness was perfect
Maybe it wasn't the brightest idea to choose some place with a live band and drunk people to catch up since it was hard to hear each other talk but oh well we had a great time anyway
I was hoping that the food would be as great as the vibe this place offers but in the end I was less than pleased
Overall I was very disappointed with the food which is sad because I really wanted this place to serve great food
This was a great place for a simple weekend breakfast but not any more
If you want to go to a Piano Bar this is a pretty good place
Over all place was very good and if you are looking into eating healthier
Suzie's a great place for their lunch specials they have good posole and beef tacos and I remember they only cost like 6-7 bucks for lunch throw in a 1 penny beer and you are ready to go back to the office a happy man
Great place to shop the bakery and coffee area is cheaper than a Starbucks and the pastries are much better
Prices are good and the atmosphere is great
This place was really great and we will definitely be back
Being from Los Angeles and being spoiled by some great spots - this place is so wonderful and always have such a nice vibe
The guy has a gem of a ruby of a place here just don't expect a great interactive learning experience

I for one am happy that there is another place to meet up with a middle class crowd of good people looking to enjoy  the fruits of their labour
This is a great place to stuff your face get a nice buzz and watch the game
The atmosphere is a great place for a date and the DJ they have in the evenings isn't too loud or intrusive upon your dining experience
A relaxing place to have wine and talk with the very knowledgable what is the difference between cab franc and Carmu00e9nu00e8re great service waitress came on time and performed pourings properly and sexy well at least the waitress staff
Overall this place has very good food but a little too pricey especially for the location
It's not the best place you will go to ever but it's solid and consistently good
The fearless flyer the seasonal products the whimsical packaging and the typical TJ's sense of ease and humor always put me in a good place after a long day at work
When the husband starts to make some dietary changes go gluten-free and veggie-rich we have found TJ's a good place to start because healthy food here doesn't taste gruesome and overly wholesome
I had really hoped this place would be better since the location was great right in the middle of Old Scottsdale and the inside looked nice but that was about as far as it went
It wasn't as good as the other places I've eaten before
Somehow with the disgusting 2-stall girls' restroom no parking high bar prices no good waitresses and pint-only beer options this place maintains it's hipster popularity as the place to be in downtown Tempe
The staff is super friendly and the place has a casual vibe to it
We drove all the way from Cali to try this place well OK that's not entirely true but while on vacation in Scottsdale we stopped by after reading so many great reviews on yelp
So I've been looking for a good place to smoke hookah since I moved out here from California
When I first went to Hob Nobs I was kind of sad to see the old place change but they did such a great job with the renovation that it's hard to complain
This is a good place to enjoy lunch and have a view of the light rail
The good- HUGE variety of all things candy- bulk & individual sale available- sugar free available - awesome place if you need party favors suppliesThe bad- Sis says Smeeks has more vintage brand candies
Frankly I think this place would do better in a different location than a strip mall parking isn't great and they changed the name
Peppersauce could be a great place but it seems like they are cutting corners
I think this more a place to hang out with friends unwind from a tough day at work or at the pool and just chill-Im ALL about delicious food that keeps you coming back not a social environment so I'll take a pass If your hungry and want to get some food take-away that might not be a bad idea
This is probably one of the best options for Dim Dum in the valley though the place on 35th Ave and Camelback is pretty good too - but I'm not giving either of them rave reviews
Bad food strange atmosphere for dinner unfriendly server
Also a nice rotating wine list pretty good for a pizza place
I still think Elements is a great place but my husband and I were a bit let down that it wasn't as phenomenal as last year when we went for dinner
If you're in the Peoria/Glendale area It's A Grind is a great place to pick up your morning fuel for the daily grind
for the record parking and traffic sucks real bad at this restaurant location in the tempe market place
The atmosphere is perfect - a charming old house and great patio
I work pretty close by and it has been a great place to pick up lunch
Cool place good choice for happy hour but yowza be prepared to drop some cash if you stay for dinner
This sounds like a bad review but really the place is pretty nice
I will try this place again as it's in a good location and I like their lunch menu
The enviroment and feel in this place was so modern but relaxed
I love beer I love places that have good beer I love places with beer people and I love making lists
The service is top notch -- friendly informative great for recommending beers and places to get them and if you are nice and become a regular they may even play the movie of your choice
This would be a great place to come before a game downtown if you want to chill out but still want to be a part of culture since it's in the historic Coronado district
Oh one thing - seems like the website could use a redesign to more accurately reflect the casual vibe of the place
Southwest Chicken Egg Rolls - self-explanatoryThis place is great and I don't usually say that about franchise/chain outfits
This place is such a disappointment when we started eating there it was great well priced good service good quality
Great place to grab a pint or bottle of beer
Outdoor seating in the winter is a great place to be since it overlooks Scottsdale road--instant entertainment
Overall this place was great & if they had one in California where I'm from I would definitely make it a regular place
Stopped into this good-sized place for lunch today with Mike C
I used to be a big fan of the Aunt but I can confidently say I will never ever give this place another try it was really that bad
Being in Scottsdale this is of course not as casual or as relaxed place as the other
Wow this place deserves the great reviews I'm from out of town and was visiting this week
I wish we had a place as great as this where I live I'd eat there weekly
If the weather is nice it's a great place to eat outdoors
More than likely though this place just isn't what I or any other self respecting lover of Mexican food would consider a good place to eat
Little less crowded and great place to people watch from the balcony
I would recommend this place for a good place for someone looking for a nice place to grab a drink and converse
Good coffee and a nice place to just take your time and read the paper since they were not busy at all
I can't say this was the best meal I've had but it was pretty good and we will definitely be back simply because all the other breakfast places we like just have such a long wait on the weekends
I love bookstores where the fiction section has large tables filled with great suggestions - I don't think you can leave this place without buying something
I highly recommend this place for the great food now and the low price booze
It's a low-key place to study for your Bio exam or kick back with a good book
Soooo good it made me sign up & open a Yelp account just so I can give this place a high five
It was good enough in fact that since it was a Friday night I was telling my husband about the place and we went their for dinner
The view is amazing and this is a great place to take out of towners for a tour of the desert landscape in the area
The only reason I gave it an extra star than one because the service was good of course there were only one other group in the place at the time
This is a good night walk place with your other and the fact that it's at night away from the 110 degree day temperature - got me sold
Pizzas which I find to usually be terrible at these places wasn't bad
The only reason for not giving the place a 5 star is just the lack of alternative meats as in prevalent here in Phoenix such as adobada machaca barbacoa carnitas etc
I love the atmosphere Great food and great folks
needs a Sugar Daddy or a Voodoo Dr cuz there is some major bad MoJo going on at that place
My favorite class was just replaced in a couple instances by bodypump which is ok but not as good as 24SET
In search of a good breakfast place I came upon The Good Egg
The place had a great vibe and I will definitely keep them in mind next time I want a burrito
Chelsea's continually delivers a great meal with a great atmosphere
Would recommend this place as a good lunch spot
its an ok place with ok prices and ok foodI would have given it 2 stars  ehhh I've had better but I have yet to find a really good breakfast dive in the area and MATTS BIG BREAKFAST is just too far to go
I tried this place out all because of Shane's ROTD and yep it lived up to its greatness
When I first moved into my place in Tempe I took a good look around the neighborhood and I saw a Thai place a coffee shop of death A decent taquieria Ted's Hot Dogs and SakeBomber Sushi & Grill
I say hey check the place out the atmosphere's GREAT and the staff sure does try but if you like your coffee drinks sweet be forewarned they may not taste sweet enough
It had a great ambience sort of celebrating a love of movies not just a theater for viewership
I enjoyed my time and I think it's a great place to hit up if you're wanting to see an artsy flick and a total no-brainer in one fell swoop
All in all this is a good place to go but I would just trim nails beforehand if you do not like short and possibly painfully trimmed nails
Back in my hood pho places are just as numerous as Starbuck's and a good place is hard to find
At this time this place pretty much sucks - that is unless you like to wait in line hang around with the type of people that would party at a country/rock nightclub located in a strip mall deal with bad service and have no place to sit
The service was good - but that's got to have everything to do with the fact that the place was pretty empty
If you are into cool weird unique collectibles like the Gay Empire Line of pink Star Wars Storm Troopers and Japanese animation style stuff this is a great place to check out it's next too Stinkweeds records which is also a plus
The only good things about this place are their fried cheese curds and some promising concrete flavors
All in all a great place to sit savor dinner and talk
The wood fired grill makes the whole place smell good and gives it the cozy vibe
What a great place although I did feel a lil' guilty watchin' the people in the room next to us breaking a good sweat doin' a circuit-training class
The menu is somewhat extensive for a small place like this but nothing fancy - sandwiches and a few salads; but there are some nice selections - turkey avocado roast beef with horseradish and a good veggies one too
After hearing that this was one of the best sushi places in Scottsdale I expected something great
However I did notice the cute and rustic vibe at this place right away
All in all great place to go to grab a glass of wine and some good food especially after hours as they are open from 5pm to 2am
* is from the SF Bay Area like myself so he gave me the lowdown for good Asian food in Phoenix for dimsum he recommended Golden Buddha first Great Wall second C-Fu third - then for Vietnamese he recommended some place on 19th Ave between Indian School & Camelback
But people say that place is good and fancy and has an electric piano
I have lived near this place for a few years and I have not had food this good since I lived in Germany
I don't consider downstairs as part of the restaurant it's more casual and an atmosphere I prefer
There is a certain underground flair at this place it's dark romantic cool and lounge-tastic
Anyway for all the love I throw at this place I do have a couple of complaintsPrices are high roughly $4/game; $4/shoes but if you're not going during peak evening hours there's always great coupon/bundle deals you can take advantage of so this is only a half-complaint
I liked how the place was decorated with rock n roll stuff and playing great music
dinner here and found this place on yelp reviews were good so gave it a shot
Definitely a great place and a chill atmosphere not to mention their staff is knowledgeable D
Great atmosphere decore and food is out of this world
If you enjoy a good rock concert this IS the place to go
My one complaint about this great place is cleanliness
drinks were good food was mediocre but the atmosphere is what made the event
If you are looking for real Korean goods this is a great place to go there is next to no produce but they dry goods kimchi and banchan are well worth the trip
The atmosphere is relaxed and homey but it can get loud in there; just like any good local bar
The W has a very nice decor and a great selection of alcohol and food but again the management of the place is not up to par for the prices you are paying
The atmosphere is casual and perfect for large groups
It's perfect for a casual but ambiance-filled date night perfect if you have young children and need a place that allows noise and perfect for any sized group
Tucked away in corner of Scottsdale and Shea it is a great place to have a relaxing drink or worldy glass of wine
Good food great service accomodating hours and steller energy and atmosphere
This place has a great business model going on and they're doing everything right when it comes to customer interaction customer service and reaching out to other local businesses
my good ol' standby is too far and my shellac girl has gone missing  The place was very clean the staff was friendly and the decor wasn't obnoxious or cheesy
Service was good place was cute food was decent
If you want good food in a noisy cheerful atmosphere like a bunch of friends or after work this fits the bill
As for the decor yeah it's horrible but what great Thai place doesn't have some out of place decor
Juan's is the kind of place that ethnically Mexican people actually go to eat WOW SHOCKING because a it's authentic both in feel and flavor; and b it's darn good
It's the place to go for the genuine article quintessential Mexican goodness
I've been here a couple of times and this place is consistently good
This place gets really high marks for both in fact the crust is just darn good and chewy
While I am a huge sushi fan the price of the rolls were a wee bit more expensive than some GOOD sushi places I went to
We got there at about 1030 and waited about 10 minutes for a table for 3 so that was pretty good considering how small the place is
rrDefinitely a great place to start off your Saturday morning
Cute place yummy food fun day out with the teenager
As good as this place is and it is very good I prefer to go to another Thai restaurant for dinner
In summation I would highly recommend staying here- the location was great too not too far out in the boonies like some of the nicer places in AZ
Surprise Stadium does have a beautiful field the food is great and is nice place to come watch a game
Really wanted this place to be a hit since I live nearby and love my Mex and it didn't bother me about the atmosphere or self seating - good for kids just not your taste buds
Like the atmosphere with good lighting and an all around good feel to the place
Bottom line is that this place has great potential if only they could take the plastic covers off the upholstery and let their Thai Flag fly
All in all this is a great little place with good atmosphere and a fun menu
If you go on a good waiter day and sit outside in the spring this place can make your evening
The partner I used to work for DC was coming into town and I wanted to take him some place great by which I mean I wanted him to take me some place great
I wanted a very Phoenix place and a place with great food
A great value for a clean car; this is a no frills place
Maybe I caught them on a bad day because the place looked authentic and the reviews seemed favorable
I cannot say enough good things about this place and I cannot wait to go back
I think this place has good if not great intentions - but just doesn't have the purchasing power to keep the store fully stocked/ or interesting
It's located in the Bally's strip mall and like Jake said it's similar to Pizza Heaven which is great because i really enjoy that place
This is the standard bearer for a great place to watch UFC or boxing
Best of all In the fall and wintertime the patio is the perfect place to kick back and fire up a couple of good cigars
We saw Squeeze last night great show and were really happy at how intimate the place was
Hip atmosphere great food good portion sizes and fantastic service
No place in town compares to the atmosphere and the food is very good
It has a great atmosphere good food good drinks and reasonable prices
Even if the food weren't good I'd recommend people to come here just for the atmosphere
This is a great place for reasonably priced Thai and Japanese food but if nothing else stop by for a Bubble Tea Latte to go
The sandwiches are very good as well it is a laid back atmosphere and has a very modern trendy artsy feel to it on the inside
Not a bad place to catch a game even when it's standing room only tons of space for that but the proximity to the rest of the Valley and Mill Avenue free shuttle vans to Mill after the game and view of Papago are the real bonus here
If you live in the South Phoenix or Laveen area this is a great place to take your pets
Not sure of the wifi situation but a good book on a rainy afternoon and this place would suit you well
RnR is another great place within walking distance from my salon and I am looking forward to trying everything on their menu
Great place for thin-crust wood-fired pizza artistry featuring fresh local ingredients
I would have never found this place if it hadn't been for good 'ol Yelp
The service is great everyone is always really nice and the atmosphere is quiet and relaxed
Definitely a great place to have dinner/lunch with friends
If you're like me - a senior with time on his hands; this is a great place to hang out read the paper surf the net or just visit with friends
Disgusting food and shitty service ambience is great if you like to dine in a hot cellar engulfed in stagnated air
All in all great place; maybe not quite as indie as Copper Star but way more space
you get to chose from any sandwich turkey and avocado is always great on the menu and the soup special or a garden salad or Cesar salad
If you are a Non-Indian and you want to try Indian food for the first time this would be a good place to start
The bottom line is that if you are an Indian person or a person who is used to eating quality Indian food and you want honest to goodness quality INDIAN not Pakastani food avoid this place
If you are a non-Indian person wanting to check out Indian/Pakastani food and just want to have a good time this place is for you
You want good food at a good price and this place gives it to you
The atmosphere was great and the people that were there to eat  and the people that worked there were fantastic
Great place to eat especially if your in a hurrybut I usually take my time with breakfast
This is a very family friendly place to take the kiddies I saw children from infant and up having a great time
The designers of this place had a clear vision of what they wanted in mind and they executed it with complete meticulous precision
Sometimes hubby and I just drive over to spend a couple hours nosing around all the great stuff here--like roses garden ornaments [not just plants] herbs and lots of useful advice
I went to this place with a group of friends and we had a great time
The atmosphere was nice and clean good earthy colors of green and brown helped add to the clean and simple feel
The entire place is self constructed of the blood sweat and tears of the owners a Husband and Wife team and they have great design sense
Having been to a few of the Cartel locations in other places in the city as well as having their espresso as guest coffees at other cafes around the country I never imagined I would get a great shot at an airport no matter what the brand name on the sign
This place had great service an innovative customer service set up and fantastic baristas that performed as well as their other locations
But overall I honestly think this is a great place - and I'm so proud Phoenix has someplace that actually services central Mexican food there's more to Mexico than a double flour tortilla with cheese in the middle or a burrito
If I were in the area this would be a GREAT place to stop in just for a pint of two
the margaritas were light and very good- tequila agave lime juice - better than most places
Great atmosphere nice outside eating area great menu selection
This is the place my sister and I went to EVERY Saturday or Sunday to enjoy sister-time and some great food
Ambience makes you feel smarter too -- or maybe I'm that already   Service was great my server recommended a small since it's actually a large   Do organic food appear more hmmm
It's a good place to take a family and some friends its a nice and quiet place with very friendly staff
This is a great place to watch any sports game in the Central Phoenix area
Staff is good my water never went empty and the atmosphere is very cool
The fiancu00e9 and I went here not too long ago and the place was dead which typically is not a bad thing
This place is great if you just wanna hang out and grab a drink at a place that has more energy than a restaurant bar
The Jade bar is a great place to mix and mingle before you get seated and it is called Jade so it definitely screams s-e-x-y
We had a fantastic waiter I believe his name is Noah can't remember that clearly after 2 bottles of wine shared between the 2 of us S If you're a vegetarian this place has great big salads
The food is great atmosphere is casual but modern - and it's open late
It's hard to find good burger places in phoenix because it's diluted w/ crappy conglomerate fast food places like McDonald's Burger King etc
Although this is my first review on yelp I can say that Pink Spot is great place in the downtown Phoenix area
Peaceful ambience no loud musak great patio for lunch loads of iced water
Another thing I love is that the place is quiet enough so that I can get some good work done
Chai Tea included and even pizza yes Indian style veggie pizza and its goodThis is why I am so in love with this place 1 Great Flavor you can beat the unmuted flavors that sing in your mouth
My friend and I were in search of a good place for dinner so I turned to Yelp and read the reviews of Original Hamburger Works
Other than that its a great place to go if you want to meet some kick ass people and avoid the drama of mill and sky rocket prices of old town
It looked like an old place that had been around a long time and I usually have good luck with places like that - not htis time
The fact that it was raining didn't detract from the cuteness of this place
Too bad it was raining today but I imagine that outside garden/patio area would be very nice to dine in
Now that I have had two breakfast burrito's I can honestly review this place again and say that the egg bacon and potato burro's are quite good and reliable
Saw too many great reviews for this place to pass it up
This place is good and for the North Scottsdale area a welcome higher end normal place to eat
Being surrounded by either expensive or bad places and sometimes both raises your boat sorta like being the smartest kid in special ed class
I had read good things about this place so I was excited to try it
It is close has good ambience and consistently good food
The atmosphere was nice and the service we got was great
You can always count on the British Open Pub as a great place to watch a sports game--you'll always have a TV available
If you can look past the odd decor this place in not at all that bad
Granted I did have an awful experience that one night but that wasn't the norm and every place has a bad night
you're just outside in a great little garden area
I so badly wanted to love this place -- and still spent maybe $70 -- but if their prices weren't apparently based on the randomly high prices Amazon
Great drinks great food and a great place to hang out with your favorite people
But sometimes you just have to buy stuff for baby and this is as good a place as any to do just that
Great place to get out of food rut and find your food groove
If you need cute scrapbook papers for your recent Disneyland vacation this place would NOT be for you
I will go back to this place as it was really good

My first real fondue experience besides at my kitchen table was last year in Washington DC at a great place called 'Bread and Chocolate' try it next time you are in the DC area
The place is cute and the service is really great once you get seated until then everyone looks kinda rushed and annoyed by you
A year ago I would've proudly given this place 5 stars but the last 6 or 7 times I've been here it just hasn't been as good
Oregano's is a great place for affordable tasty Italian food with a twist
It is a great place to meet for business or with family and friends
Good luck finding it  *Thanks goes to Groupon for helping me find this place
Service was good just not what you'd expect for a place of their reputation
Great location and nice atmosphere minus the annoying bird that kept squawking all day long but it was nice to enjoy the weather the view and the ducks in the lake

Im sure its a great place to go see Celine Dion acoustic or something equally lame

Place is very chill and waitstaff was great
Not the greatest place but i will revisit for the alligator po'boy and sea food gumbo so far i am unimpressed but i'll go here before i drive all over the valley to get my cajun fix
Also I have a general expectation that businesses around college campuses look more like a disheveled  dorm room than modern european kitchen but Yogurtland does a great job of keeping this place neat and tidy
But if I am looking for good wings or boneless in this case there are some other places I will look first
I don't know about you but a restaurant keeps me coming back with 3 main ingredients  1 good food at reasonable prices 2 General atmosphere & cleanliest & 3 Excellent attentive service

This place looks like a typical American franchise and I was not expecting the food and service to be very good
This place is definitely fan friendly and I had a great time
If you are traveling and in the area it is a middle of the road place for great happy hour food and drink
Good for a date or even better the perfect place to bring Mom to let her know you took some of her nutritional babble to heart and are eating at places like this in your young adulthood
The restaurant did feel a little crowded and there were certainly a lot of people there but it seemed like a great place to eat nonetheless
The atmosphere is upscale casual so you can get by in nice pants even jeans and a nice shirt
The food was great the service as well - and it had a friendly and positive atmosphere as well
Open till late and food is ok but the ambience is great

The food probably could have been bad and I would have still liked the place

This means having a place that delivers good pizza and wings is a must
I gave this place a 3/5 because the Tom Ka Gai soup and Holy Basil were VERY good
Atmosphere cool dark pub-like atmosphere that would be a good date spot and equally as good to kick back with friends
Food stuff I LOVE includes the Vegetable Chop Salad maybe one of my top salads anyplace that's big enough fir an entree loaded with good stuff including fried okra and eggs and hard to pass up
I needed a Greek place that had more seating than the BFG Express on Warner; long story - it was a birthday thing So we settled on Niro's handpicked by moi willing to try something new and good ratings on Yelp
- Good service water was refilled 3 times naan was replaced immediately upon decimation

this place is great for family or even with friends to get a great bite to eat
Maybe I've stayed at too many cheesy timeshare condos-but I thought this place was great
Overall kind of fun for a casual drink or maybe a good place to have a couple drinks before you go out somewhere else
The brisket and beef tips were great the only problem i had with the place was the wal mart environment crying kids way crowded people acting like THAT steak was the last one ever made etc and i did make the mistake of going during grandma social hour but aside from that ill go back when Im craving 10 different things at once which happens often Dinner buffet for 2 runs a little under 30 bucks with drinks

This is a great place for a big group or family
Cute name for a sports grill convenient location with ample parking a vibrant casual atmosphere and the massive amount of TVs at this place is impressive
I wanted cheap and easy and this place reminds me of Le Pain Quotidien in how it offers great food for reasonable prices and other market-style goodies as well
The atmosphere kind of reminds me of an upscale employee cafeteria but the bar area/patio was good for people watching
It has some large tables and would be a great place to bring a large group 6-8 people

White Chocolate Grill does nothing to help my bad habit in fact I can't leave this place without having a dessert
I'm not sure if Keegan's Grill is the kind of place where I will plan in advance to go but overall it was pretty good
]I'm also not sure if this place is now called Silver Q or Trickshot but whatever the name it's a good venue
Not so great when it's a new place and it's empty
This place makes me laugh its not a bad joint but its kinda cheesed out they claim its a modern tavern who does that I guess because they have exposed brick walls and green light up shit outside but as far as food and drinks its not so modern or stylish boring is the best word to describe it
It's not as good as unPhogettable but then again I haven't found a place that is

Great location next to many restaurants and causal dining places
In addition to great margaritas this place also has decent food
This is probably not a chain but still has the vibe of one which are not my particular favorite type of place this turned out to be a great find
This place is standard and generic in every way - and that's a good thing
deffinetly a great place to stop by for some 8ball
This should have been our first indication that this place isn't very good
But I think it's great to take a break from the norm and explore new places once in a while - and also to step back and hike for hiking's sake and not think about this climb is going to burn x calories at y heart rate in order to leave me with -z% body fat
The place has a great view of A mountain
Overall great place and if they had some sort of imperial on tap that is similar to lets say

Sacks knows how to make a tasty sandwich and is a great place for lunch
I expected so much more from a new neighborhood place especially one that's gotten some good reviews and publicity
First of all I like the system of ordering at the counter for casual lunch and dinner places but there's something about breakfast that it's ill-suited for
The atmosphere overall was poor full disclosure - it was a Wednesday night and the place was empty but the service was very good
Over all good for a quick meal but I wouldn't say its a huge destination place
it's almost just about as good as a non-chain place

The atmosphere wasn't great nor did it do anything great for the experience
While the food was good I was disappointed with the service and atmosphere
My husband and I went to Smashburger yesterday and had a good experience trying a new burger place

It still is a great place to hang out with friends and if your looking to share your food with someone cause the portions are HUGE
The egg rolls and wontons are tasty as well  sometimes I get dissapointed with bad eggrolls not this place  Fried rice is great and they give you wonton chips with your meal as well

It is a great place to take small children for a stroll or to help them learn to ride their bikes and their scooters to hit and catch balls or generally just to play
It is also great place to sit have coffee or a cool drink and people watch - and uniformly most of the people are friendly
The reverse happy hour really is a good deal especially when I just want to go out and grab a few drinks and some food with friends and not deal with any Scottsdale BS like you would encounter at a place like Sapporo
Yes this place is in the hood and is smaller than a postage stamp but is so good that you can brave the seedy location for one night
If you like fine tasting food and beverage this place is great
Prices were good food was good atmosphere was good  service was good minus a few missteps and the sangria was good
After meeting with 2 of the most bad ass Yelpers at our place- Stevey P and Mr
But Hanny's is within walking distance of my place and could be a great destination downtown when one wants to enjoy a night at a nice lounge
Maybe this place had a good rep in the past but I will never go back there
I was really disappointed in this place I love hot wings and beer I thought it would be a good spot
In short I could see how the other offerings on the menu may be good and given the ambience and service another experience with different food may give better ratings but ya gotta do your ribs well if you are going to call yourself a BBQ restaurant
Service is always good the portions are a nice size and the atmosphere is great
Good news the place has a great location hip crowd trendy hot spot cool vibe etc
Bad news ironically because this place has a high demand the staff has a you need us more than we need you attitude and trust me this shows
I researched the menu online but wanted to make my to go order in person to get a good feel for the atmosphere
All in all a good place to which we will return
I have been to this place many times and the food is still good staff is still friendly table is still clean
If you like good buffet but don't like the crowd this is the place for you
This place was hoppin' on a friday night always a good sign
Now this place is suppose to have good ice cream - and if you know me - you know I eat ice cream almost daily

It's a great place to go browse before or after going to one of the other interesting stores or restaurants in this small center
This is a great place to meet for work or meet after a game
The demo is certainly nothing like any place I've ever been to in Phoenix so those who decry the lack of diversity in this town perhaps you just need to expand your horizons to include Great Wall into your rotation
Yes as others have commented the previous restaurant in this building was one of those 50-style dinners but they have a nice assortment of Thai decorations that the atmosphere is pretty cool though casual
It has become a great place for me to get work done at and occasionally hang out with friends
The place is clean; the meals are nice; it feels safe;  nice business center to print and fax documents; good fitness center and cut-rate daily passes to LA Fitness next door; very convenient; good laundry machines
It seems like a good place to come to after a game or show downtown
Service was good prompt polite and efficient and the place was clean and tidy
This is a great lunch place I would definitely revisit
Great atmosphere fun crowd really great food
Great atmosphere great food and great service
Overall it is a good place but it's not something I would crave for and rush there but more like if I'm in the area and not feeling other fast food joints

Wow what a great place for breakfast had the rancheros and eggs breakfast on my first visit last week and had to stop by again this week for a breakfast burrito

I get sick of the chain places for breakfast and this is a great alternative
Went here with a Groupon and had heard great things about this place so were looking forward to it
Overall i was disappointed after hearing such great things about this place and have had better Latin American cuisine elsewhere at better prices as well  - sorry Fuego Bistro

The aspects of Bar Smith I like best is the music the cleanliness and relaxed atmosphere
The wait is a bit longer than some places but not bad
With Sunday night's half off bottle of wine this is a great Sunday dinner place
So I give this place five stars anyway because it is super cute and I don't think I could eat everything I wanted to eat there if I went in for 14 days straight
Dear God I will never go back to this place   I only gave it 2 stars because some of the deals on clothes were really great
Very cool setting and relaxed yet hip atmosphere and crowd
I love deluxe and also places like Stax which is good but not great deluxe is great btw not Stax either way the food was great not the service or annoying people next to me but i cant hold the restaurant responsible  the people behind me made me want to stab myself in the ears with an icepick service was crap but

I read such bad reviews about the food in the Phoenix area from foodies like myself who come from places famous for their independent food scene
hole in the rock is a great sunset place that's easily accessible from a staircase
There are other pizza places in Phoenix with perfectly good food
Needless to say we loved this place not just due to the amazing food but also the atmosphere may be in a shopping area but still nice and cozy and the great staff who were very friendly
Although we skipped dessert I still think $100 tip included was a great value because of the upscale diner atmosphere the Kierland location and the decently priced drinks
When I crave this place I really crave it bad--other times I can go without it for months
Completely deserving of the great reviews this place consistently garners
The ambience is really cute and wasn't crowded
This is a good place to go with long-lost friends since you'll be waiting at least 1 hour if not more for pizza next door

Good brunch and the atmosphere on the patio was very nice but a pretty significant I won't call fatal flaw that merits no more than an A-OK
did not do a very good job of staying together it was sliding all over the place
Both my companion and I noticed the place was pretty quiet despite being full of people-maybe it's because it gives off a romantic vibe
If you need a place to stay near Sky Harbor Airport this is a great option

We travel a lot and many nights we would prefer to stay in and now we finally found a GREAT pizza delivery place
Grocery selection is great for a non-grocery place
The spot is intimate and cozy and a great date place despite its strip mall location
Wrong unfortunately this place messed it up real bad
They are a good place to go with a large group
I went here in search of a good close mexican food place and this is not it
Either way they both give a fantastic view of the valley and it's a great place to play a quick 9 holes after work in just over an hourOnly eaten at the clubhouse once but both me and my bud liked our burgers and it sits next to the 9th green which is great for a little free entertainment

The place only got a second star because the tangerine chicken was good but I would be hesitant to go here again because apparently my business means nothing to this restaurant

Great prices freshly made corn Tortillas and its also the perfect place to request freshly grounded masa

This was my second trip to this place but will probably be my last because there are just too many good restaurants in the area to waste time eating at run-of-the-mill places like Elephant Bar

All done very well in a great atmosphere with attentive service

The atmosphere was very fance prob not a good place for kids
My husband and I had heard great things about this place so we ventured over there this morning
It was a rainy Sunday morning and the place was packed which was definitely a good sign
The only positive thing I can say about this place is that they serve good bacon because my husband was kind enough to share a bite of his meal with me
I've heard this guy at other times say things I thought were wrong for a server to say to a customer and I hope they find a better server to replace him because I've been going here for many many years and I don't want a bad apple to spoil the establishment
The place doesn't look so great from the outside and the drive-thru is a little strange but it's delicious

All and all a good birthday meal at a friendly place
Very cute wine bar with a relaxed atmosphere

This place wasnt bad but they werent good really either
I only know that my mouth and belly left pleased as they have been by no other Thai place in town and that is good enough for me
Rather than list everything I love about this place I encourage you to get a DD hop on your bike or take a cab on down to the Papago belly up to the bar grab the beer list or consult the usually very helpful bar tenders and prepare yourself for some good food and even better brews
The atmosphere is usually a little on the busy side but relaxed
great food great atmosphere and good people
The casual attire is nice kids love the slide my daughter loved looking at the city lights also workers are very hospitable all in all one of the nicest places I've been to and I would love to go again whether its for another family outing or just my husband and i

Definitely a nice place to bring your folks when they visit or for a lovely date or dinner with a good friend
Papago Park is just one hell of a great place to watch the sky as it turns red and gold with cactus silhouettes in the foreground
I suppose the emptiness is due to their out of the way location because the food service and atmosphere is great
In the morning it's a great place to pick up a coffee to go or read the paper while the bartender watches the Cartoon Network - come on where else can you get that
They also offer a good variety of bruschetta so it would make a great place for happy hour if you just wanted a drink and a little bite to snack on
At first glance this place may seem sketchy but if you have the time and patience check this place out for great deals and bring your hand sanitizer
It's not always the cleanest place I've seen the trash overflowing on a few visits but the food is always good
I have heard a lot of good and bad things about this place but we were happy with everything and we will come back to see if they are consist ant

If your somebody who prefers a mom and pop place over a chain like iHop this is a pretty good alternative and probably a better taste too

I get late night yogurt cravings  This place is great it's cute not that that matters very much  The staff is friendly it isn't very expensive
The Keg is a great place to go and spend a special evening with someone
We normally get a bottle of wine The Keg has a good standard selection with fair prices taking into account that you are paying for presentation and atmosphere
All in all I would definitely recommend The Keg to anyone who would like to enjoy a wonderful evening of good wine and great steaks in a modern atmosphere right here in Tempe
Food might have been good but the place was just one of those joints that time forgot
and not in a good way So I've been wanting to check this place out for over a year now
There were some pro's about this place Service was decent and some of the food was really good

OVERALLGreat place for a quick downtown lunch if you don't mind Americanized Mexi-food that could be cheaper
Though both places serve great food at reasonable prices Da Vang's food is just a little better - and the main reason is their Thit Nung grilled pork
So what can I say that is bad about the place
First off the place is adorable with a counter full of fresh baked goods
Mexican food purists would be turned off by this place but it's a fun joint to get a good couple of tacos
for a divesque place with no customers they had a super cute college-aged normal looking bartender
Still ya gotta love a place where you can crowd 15 of your friends on the patio mark off a bit of territory with a couple balloons and have a great time for a couple hours
I can't possibly say one bad thing about this place
Their ambiance is energetic the music is good and it's truly a bustling place
Carrabba's a great place good food and great management
I just wanted to offer my two cents because I feel like this place gets a bit of a bad rap on Yelp from people who are seemingly disgruntled that Zoe's sandwiches or ingredients are not more quality or gourmet but if you just adjust your expectations you'll realize that you're actually getting quite a decent & convenient lunch for $6
This is one of the few non chain places for lunch in the heart of down town and its good too give it a try it can even work for a business lunch as it was not too loud and decent inside

I was specifically looking for a good breakfast place in Phoenix
not a conventional take out coffee place like  Starbucks but a good sit out cafe overall
I can't imagine what the bill would have been for a diner atmosphere in a strip mall bad service and semi-decent food if we had taken any of the waiter's suggestions
We don't mind paying for good food but the prices do not match the du00e9cor or the service of the place
This is a great healthy lunch option and a place that I will definitely come back to
Good that it was as it's a neat place
I'd heard how great their burgers were and that if you wanted to spend a little more than the average to get a fantastic burger that was the place to go

Definitely a great place to grab a bite and chat with your girlfriends or an afternoon date spot with your significant other
a truly family run operation serving up good pizza in a friendly atmosphere
Surprisingly this place has good food
Again I go back to my rule about ethnic restaurants - the less people of that ethnicity you see patronizing the place the less likely you are to get a great meal

It wasn't as good as its drinks service or atmosphere

Great ingredients produce great ice cream and this place has the best I've tasted
All in all a good place to go if you want to look cute all-American and laid-back

Bottom line here If you're looking for a fun place to grab a beer or glass of wine and maybe a burger with a great vibe and fun people this is the place
Groupon ran a few specials to this place and I bought a few thinking $5 for a ticket and drink was a great deal
Like the last couple of places I reviewed this one also had great service with a very hospitable owner
The buffet had many choices also like the other new places and everything tasted great
Good place to bring company but might not be worth the journey for us anytime soon
The atmosphere was pretty awesome great interiors
Chipotle is a great place i think if you want to eat healthy this particluar one is close to my house the food is very good but its the service that gets me sometimes i always order special things on my burrito and its a bit complicated usually at other chipotles the person making the burrito is nice and does it with a smile at this one they always seem so impatient and fast and when i ask for my special requests they seem a bit upset
All-in-all this was a Yelper disappointment for me as the place was rated as if it were a great place and it was merely ok
It's a place with delicious food and good value
Definitely a cute place to go on a casual date
I signed up here just to write a great review for this place
While not quite as good as the Sonoran dogs in Tucson or even Mexico this place more than sufficiently satisfies your cravings

Sorry peeps but no good recommendation for this place
I wouldn't be surprised if it would be similar to other Yelpers' reviews about this place and not a good one
This is a great place for groups like bday parties
The restaurant is noisy inside so it's not a place for a quiet or romantic date
It definitely was not good enough for me to forgive the faults and try this place again
I wasn't sure if it deserved four stars but what they had was pretty good the place was nice looking and the waiter was great
So to drive past a place called Sacred Hogan resulted in a U-turn to go take a look at what was evidently a shrine to the greatest wrestler in the entire world

Anyway this is a great place to bring out-of-towners it has a chic southwest feel while remaining upscale and impressive
The place is rather small so you may have to wait for a table but as evidenced by the sound of Mandarin being spoken throughout the restaurant it is clearly a place that has good food
Great place always stop in when I am in town
Atmosphere is great for special occasions
Make sure you ask for a sampler plate and for all the Abba fans that swear this group was Sweden's greatest export you will be very happy to know that Abba always plays in the background at this place

Good team a new decent beer and a place to hide yourself from the unrelenting AZ sun talk about a hole in one Golf reference
I can't say enough good things about this place
I will still be careful to watch the techs here because I do not know enough of them well enough to make a blanket judgement about the overall skill set but it's encouraging to know that management's heart is in the right place and that there was some concern and a real effort to make up for a bad experience
Not that I cant stand kids just that with all the beer served it just doesn't seem like a family kind of place talk about a bad example
Finally we were sat and although the place looks great I did find my seat to be a bit uncomfortable
This is a place you can go look cute and have skee-zoids buy you free drinks all night- but that is all
Its great to have an inexpensive Filipino place in town that can cook Cebuano dishes
First off what a great place to sit and people watch
It is a great place for viewing wildlife including more than 200 bird species that have found the area to be a suitable habitat

My girlfriend ordered the Vegetable Panini after threatening to order a regular green salad for 10 dollars at the burger place she bragged about at the last minute and I was irate with her after she continued to ask for bites of my burger and expressed disappointment with her sandwich which I later thought was pretty good after trying it but nothing compared to the burger
The decor is cute and from first glance it may look like a place your mom would like to go but have lunch there and you'll find out it's not all it's cracked up to be
Having heard great reviews about the place it's food and the vibe
Not bad the decor of the place is great; it looks clean new and contemporary
it's got the potential to be a good pizza place but doesn't fully live up to it
the place has a nice homely feel to it so it's great to go chill at
I cannot in good conscience give this place a do-over
The outdoor events at San Tan are great the place is very very clean the food court has some different options the restaurants are great and the movie theater is my favorite in the area
And as you might guess this is a great place for a gal on her own to go have a glass
The casually elegant or is it elegantly casual ambiance of the patio with dwindling sunlight turning the hills purple the fireplace burning and the nicely quiet setting deliver us from pounding music in restaurants was simply perfect
All in all I thought it was a great experience and it seems like the locals like this place
Come here for some solid Vietnamese place and don't expect a fancy place with great service and you'll be ok

They had some great unique gift items so they're a place that's work checking out even if you're not clothes shopping
Random free cash drawings take place on Tuesdays now which is also a good incentive to play that day
She'll write a great review of this place tomorrow
It is the closest thing to Little Anita's in New Mexico and the only place to get good Hatch Chile cooking
I selected this place based on all the great Yelp reviews and all I can say is that I was very disappointed
bill replaced the belts had a new a/c hose made flushed the system refilled it with the expensive good stuff r12 yet only charged me the price of the cheap stuff i suggested -- a $200 discount
I dont like Paradise Bakery but this place is great the atmosphere is really nice and the service was great the guy behind the counter recommended the sandwich and I was grateful for that
Other than some of the restaurants Biltmore Fashion Park isn't really a good destination place if you live far
Too bad because we liked this place and its very close to where I live
It's a perfect place for casual dining and Happy Hour with friends
Okay United Beauty Supply & Salon this is not a bad place to shop for hair supplies and hair tools
Set up as a cute local family style place we tested it with my well behaved 3year old grandson
I hadn't reviewed it for so long because I wanted to keep it my little secret but I feel that dog owners might appreciate a place they could trust and good businesses should get the reviews they deserve
Service was great and the ambience was low-key and cozy
This place is somewhat inconsistent in its ability to provide good service and in some instances the food was not as good as it was in others
Their steaks are good but not great - nowhere near the quality of places like Mastro's or J&G - but the price is right when you factor in the sides they come with
DECOR NEEDS A REDRESS--long strands of hanging beer flags don't make a place festive unless they're flapping in the wind at a Mexico beach bar--nor do mounted mariachi hats and diagonally-stapled multicolor throw rugs--caballeros and damas are great but don't mount McDonald's-plain Men and Women signs underneath
I have no idea why some people give bad reviews about this place
It was a great change from the stuffy atmospheres of the other local high end steak houses that we frequent
They also have really good lemonade Overall if you're in the area or looking for a nice bagel/sandwich shop check this place out
It looked like it would be a great place for groups of people would not recommend if you are on mission for what you want and want to place an order but it could be a fun experience for some people
It's a dirty unassuming place with a couple of no-nonsense bartenders and a good jukebox
The dumplings were quite tasty approx 8 large dumplingsI got the passion fruit smoothie with boba which was quite good I love bubble tea so much and this place is pretty legit
The experience was overall a good one and I would like to try this place again I was just a bit disappointed with the grease content of the foods which gave me a bit of stomach ache
It is a great place to go if you are going to a play at the Herberger or another downtown event
Thank you Yelpers for recommending such a great place
I've also been here on a Saturday night but I think that's typically when men are on the prowl so I didn't really sense a casual patio-drinking type of atmosphere
There are just a lot of really good places in Scottsdale so it needs to be really a standout to get 5 stars
Triple Sports is a great place for first time triathletes and for the pros
Wonderful urban/hipster vibe even my Mom liked it good place for a hang out w/ friends dates even check out the other local art scenes while you're there good chill laid-back place ; Not to forget also Friday & Saturday open all night
So in summary of my short and sweet and to the point review my suggestion is that next time you are on the go and looking for a good place to find a sandwich quickly check out Sacks
Only downside is the prices are high but as long as you are prepared for that going in it's a great place for special occasions or groupons
a mix of a simple casually-upscale atmosphere including a terrific patio area lounge music that sets the mood without drowning out conversation good service and of course excellent sushi and other menu items
It's definitely on the high-end of the price spectrum and sure you could get sushi as good for half the price elsewhere but it's not your weekly sushi place
For the area it is in this place is great but if you don't live here it's not worth the drive into the area
Great name for a froyo place but gone to waste I think to die in Laveen of all places
This venue is also recently completely overhauled and essentially 2011 new on the inside so you have shiny tables tops and linens sparkling light fixtures a good crowd-level ambience with loudness but you dont have to yell at your tablemate to be heard
This is THE place to go for swing in greater Phoenix on Wednesdays
And it's next door to a great pizza place
This little neighborhood spot in a strip center not a lot of atmosphere has a great que menu and a huge commitment to quality
Each stop was unique with good atmosphereDining here was like being welcomed to share a casual but delicious meal with family
The service is usually fast and always friendly which makes it a great place for a weekday lunch
And it has a great atmosphere with Latin music playing in the background not too loud either
It's probably not the place to go to on a night of hitting up Old Town but it's definitely not a bad place to pop into for a drink or two
Cozy atmosphere tons of televisions to watch the game and for a sports bar - the food is actually REALLY good
You have to try Sapporo - the atmosphere is great
From a relaxing eye-pleasing decor to misted outdoor seating to a cute little ice cream shoppe in the same building to the clever wall of cassettes this place has lots of charm without overdoing the kitsch
This place was outrageously delicious great service and good atmosphere
It was candle-lit and romantic but had a relaxed atmosphere
I specifically picked this place because of the great reviews here on Yelp
This might be a great place if you want a quick crew cut but you might just go to supercuts for that too
Overall this is a great place if you love coffee and/or tea and the  owner and barista's will make you feel at home
over all a great place to go and its in the hood
Probably a good date place if you beat the crowds
The prices for their entrees are kind of hefty but I like their bar atmosphere once in a while and their food is pretty good
This place is great a true American breakfast joint
I would have never tried this place on my own but holy good god was it a taste experience
The patio has a relaxing atmosphere - very loungy and good for sipping wine in the afternoon
I wish to goodness I could remember the name of our sweet waitress who was very attentive but never pushy and even gave us some advice as to places to shop nearby
This place is a good stop in Central PHX
The atmosphere is quite modern for an asian resto in chandler casual and clean
This is not a large place so this and the dim lighting added to the rustic and cozy ambiance - a good place for a date
lol A place that provides great food service and ambiance deserves the extra $$
I think this place has great history and is a perfect destination for getting out or for an event
The first thing I noticed was the interior it was fairly small but in a good way the ambience of the place has a classic southwestern feel to it; and not in the kitschy way that non natives might assume a sw theme should feel
Will be returning very soon - great place
I would return to El Napolito but there are loads of great little Mexican places in the area that I'll be stopping by first
Seems like places with great downhome cooking don't have websites and if they do they're crappy
The sushi is ok-good not worthy of a 4 or 5 and if you're OK with crowded noisy bustling places then Hana is for you
The parking was bad but the atmosphere was kind of cute
It's a pricey place but the food is great so coming here for a special occasion is definitely worth it
I highly recommend this place as the food is great and the service is equally great
The atmosphere was alright good for a quick lunch to catch up with friends
If you go to Sushi Broker expecting a great rowdy bar atmosphere with good strong cocktails and ok food you'll probably have a good time
Service was great atmosphere is high end for the area with a dark modern look
We went on a Friday for lunch and though many of the tables filled up the restaurant was still quiet providing a great atmosphere for conversation
My nephew is an Asian food junkie and loves Teppan so for his birthday we really wanted to give him a great experience and Sakana remained one of two places in town we have not tried so onward
The atmosphere is great- you can be silly and merry and not get weird stares from the people around you
Ambience is nice but food especially mexican usually has great flavor so give it to us
The adult in me knows better than to go back and blow all my cash on toys but it would be a great place to buy gifts for others
Caminero replaced my favorite taco shop Bisteces a few years back they changed the meat in the burrito and it wasn't quite as good Bisteces probably had my favorite burrito and salsa ever
Went to a friend's house sat night and they were talking about going to Mark's Cafu00e9 for some eggs benedicts They found the place on yelp and have read all the great reviews on the hollandaise sauce
If you want cheap margaritas and great chips and salsa this place has Ritas for 1
This is a really great place to get tipsy and fed with friends if you happen to live walking distance
So this place has great potential as an economical yet gracious spot for lunch
We attended the night of a Suns game to have a great neighborhood atmosphere
That said this place is great for private events with a lot of people
CPC is a great place for carnivores omnivores and veggies alike probably vegans as well
Overall I think this place is good but I will only give it three star for now
The amusement of eating at a place called Heart Attack Grill that makes you wear a hospital gown and whose servers are dressed as nurses is only good for one visit
A great place to take your lovely lady for a really nice lunch or dinner but be prepared for a crowd
Great place for organic grass-fed locally sourced beef and pork both my dog and i love this place
I did shell out 9 bones for a sandwich with no side but man this place is great
Even in a good mood this place wouldn't be breaking a 2
I really have nothing good to say about this place
The atmosphere has a cool vibe with exposed brick cool lounge chairs couches good music but not too loud and since it's upstairs you can get a great view of Downtown
This place gets a bump because it could easily pass for a set in a John Woo film and because there's just so much bad chinese food in the Phoenix
In a city where good customer service is as rare as snow in July this place exceeded my expectations
I feel like Blue Wasabi and maybe a couple other places has a bit better tasting sushi but for what I pay at happy hour and the great time I have everytime I go here it's worth it fo sho
I may give the place another try in the future because I have had good food here in the past
In fact I think I might like this place a little better than Da Vang but I'll rotate between the two since they're both so good
For years I have been looking for a place that served a good bowl of niu rou tang mian and while my favorite Chinese late night food isn't served at Cherry Blossom there are plenty of delicious noodle soups that will keep me happy until my next trip east
The ramen was great we had it yesterday night but the beef iron pot was even better todays lunch- yes we loved the place so much we went twice in 24 hours
I lived in the neighborhood for a good year before trying this place
I had heard great things about this place before and actually received some of the olives and olive oil as a gift last year
Elements gets snaps forSuggesting on the bottom of the menu that people turn off their cell phonesA decent wine selection including good by the glass options perfect for the lonely travelerHaving foie gras on the menu since it's all but disappeared most placesThe views do indeed seem to be goodYou can sit at a 'community table' to meet fellow lonely dinersBack to the story the restaurant isn't so much off the lobby as it is *in* the lobby
The selection isn't expansive and the place isn't necessarily upscale but the service is good
But It is pretty much as casual as the Joe's real bbq which gives more character to the place
This place is in a new urban development that looks great
I spent 2 years in Honolulu and used to eat at this great little place in China Town
highly recommend it if you're looking for a great place to take a date or chill with some friends out in the patio over some wine
The quality of the food is consistently good and flavorful and the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant is very tasteful
I hate writing bad reviews and I try to find the best in the places I go to
after searching and searching I found this place and i saw the great reviews and was so excited
Its great to walk into a place and be greeted right away and when you return they remember you
Great wines comfortable seating great atmosphere wifi fantastic patio and you can bring your dog can't beat it
This place supplies the ambience and sets the tone for the mood you should be in; relaxed and chill
They have at least 10 big-ass flat screen TV all around the place the rest are good sized CRTs I counted almost as many TVs in the place as there were beers on tap
Outside there is a great little gazebo/patio with misters excellent place to chill outside in the summer
This is a great place to go on a Sunday afternoon to sip champagne and people watch
Windsor has gotten 190+ reviews almost ALL good in the short time that it's been open so that should already say a whole lot about the place
I am a big seafood lover and there a lot of chain sushi places in Arizona that are decent and good for rolls but if you want quality and authentic Japanese style fish and incredible Sashimi you need to go to Yasu
Maybe I will go back and try their tacos but I am thinking I will keep it as a good place to sit on the patio eat chips & salsa and drink a good margarita or two
The 2 other staff that were there at the time also pitched in by clearing plates which shows that they are a great time and they were laughing with each other which makes for a great atmosphere
Olive and Ivy is a restaurant in downtown Scottsdale that features great food a very extensive wine list and an all around cool atmosphere
Great food along with a great atmosphere gives Olive & Ivy five stars
It's not one of those places to go if you're looking for outstanding service or ambience but the food is always great
It's a great friendly and yummy place for some great Italian Ice
Things I did enjoy included the ambiance its a really funky fun place with good music and colors  Overall we just found this place laughable
That being said the drinks were good the atmosphere was comfortable yet trendy and the service was attentive if self-important
Fleming's is a fantastic place to dine for a couple family or with good friends
But even without that the atmosphere is great dark and mysterious and every drink I've ever had there has been exceptionally well-made
Sweet little place if you are not picky about great Italian food
Also not a bad place to meet ditzy office supply store employees
I've never dined in before but the place is really cute
Good atmosphere overall for a laid back drink
The only good thing about this place is that they adjusted the check appropriately for our meals
Very responsive when your card is green which is great because other places make you wait
good for a place to meet a group of friends not really a place for a couple or just two of you
which I felt really bad for the place all the glass in the book shelf broke when the shelf FELL
Love a place feeling alive and full of energy just not fun when you can't hear to have good conversation with the folks sitting at your table
This is such a cute little place with a simple menu of baked goods sandwiches soup and salads
Super cute place perfect for lunching with a girlfriend
This bar/lounge & theater has such a great atmosphere & vibe going down  Moroccan lights perforated steal & wallpaper stencil art by Joerael Elliot
old thin linens furniture that needed to be replaced badly
Anyone who says they are from Sicily Italy Philly Chicago are of Italian heritage or believe they know good Italian food from bad AND give this place more than one or two stars is full of shit and lying because they don't know what the fuck they're talking about
I am always in the mood for a good Deli Sandwich and I was randomly driving by Breadcrafter's while looking for a place to have a late lunch
This is a great place to go on a date though it is kind of spendy
It's a really cool place to people watch and the food is pretty good- not great- but good
This is not a great place to pre-party as they will ask you to keep it down if needed
Great place to have a drink before hitting the rest of Scottsdale of 1 after dinner
The office was in walking distance of my first place when I moved to Chandler but since then I've moved to North Scottsdale but I still make the drive because despite some hassles I do believe I get good care
I love all the flavored cream cheeses especially the strawberry and the garden veggie and most of them are reduced fat but they still manage to taste great
However that being said I live close enough to order takeout whenever I've had that sort of bad day that needs Mexican food in decent quantities  The foodAlbeit a little unhealthy and definitely Tex-mex rather than Mexican and pretty standard fare in that regard this place is just ultimately satisfying
If you read anything about this place that is negative then try it again - again you can B*&^h about places all day long but really - good food is subjective but well crafted food is unusual
Good place with a wide selection and a picture menu on the counter just in case
I've been looking for a new place to get a good gyro ever since I moved to the North Valley and I finally found it
Overall this place is a must visit if you're looking for a good Greek place in Happy Valley
aside from the EWWWWWWWWW factor since they didn't tell me they did that this is a pretty great place
I have to confess in general I love coffee shops for the atmosphere and not for the drinks but Solo has great tea options and I am always pleased
Like I said food was good atmosphere charming but no choices in menu
It lends itself to being a great little neighborhood place to pop in and pick up a few things grab lunch or dinner to go or sit and chill at the wine bar
The atmosphere feels authentic the prices are great and the staff is top notch
The only good thing about this place is the ambience
This place reminds me of an old western movie where a villainous cowboy would come crashing into a saloon and is quickly tackled by the good guy
Now I have been to several Mexican restaurants and I have to say this place is not bad at all
if you're in town like I am on business this is a great place to take anyone
Quality Control ingredients are as good as it gets  Pizza quality one of the best again one of the best so many great pizza places to choose from especially in the Phoenix area
A place to be and great place to enjoy with people
The ambience is great - not your typical mammoth Phoenix chain
Being a vegetarian I always get the same thing at every sushi place I visit so I can spot a good veggie roll when I see one
To maintain a successful restaurant you need a good menu with quality food nice decor/ambience and great service to keep the patrons coming back
The service is great and the atmosphere is casual and intimate
First off you know this place is good and authentic because every time you go in there are plenty of Vietnamese people enjoying their wonderful traditional Vietnamese offerings
Overall it is a great place and I hope it sticks around
Very dark and geriatric inside this place offers one of the great happy hours in Scottsdale
Added with some interesting art deco around the joint this place has a relaxed overall vibe
Our beers arrived shortly before we placed our order bad
Like I said the food was good but not good enough to get us back into that place
A great place for a filling lunch or dinner and you can get it to go as well
The patio is FANTASTIC a great place to sit back and relax and the interior design of the restaurant is cool as well
I was going to put 4 stars since it wasn't really bad the place was huge - but the service SUCKED BIG TIME
They've got a great selection of drinks and this would be a fun place to get a night out in Old Town started
if someone told me there is a better place for enjoying a great selection of beer  I would be very skeptical
Tons of TV's in here and a big bar also mean that it can also be a good place to watch a game
If management would just get their waitresses trained on manners promptness and accuracy the place would be great
Overall if you like to go to a place with great service and mediocre food PF Changs is the place for you
Regardless this was a great place to hold the first-ever Yelp event
When my husband and I were looking for a place to host our casual rehearsal dinner in May we knew we wanted to take our small wedding party to one of our favorite local spots
If you're looking for a casual place to hold your next private event I highly encourage you to check out Cibo's carriage house
Don't get me wrong- it is a cute little lunch place- but not all it is cracked up to be by any means
I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for great handmade Mexican food
Sun Devil Liquors is a really interesting place because the upstairs is a really large liquor store and the basement is a great lounge and beer/wine bar
However the good part about this place other than price is that once you get table you can immediately grab plates off of the conveyor belt
I had very high hopes for this place after the very good reviews Fate got and that Sens has been getting but I was terribly disappointed
Great atmosphere service prices and of course amazing food
Can't wait to bring some more friends there for the oohs and aahs and exclamations of 'how did you find this great place
It's a cute comfortable little place with inside & outside seating
The low lighting and booths seemed like it would be a great place for a more intimate night
Well maybe it's not perfect but my meals here over the past five years have always been good and I consider Los Sombreros a great place to take out-of-town guests
I'm not going to say what has already been said this place is the jammy jam there isn't a bad item on the menu
The only reason why it's not completely 5 stars is that it wasn't very clean and the atmosphere wasn't great either but the food was excellent
Much bigger than other great places such as Native New Yorker
Texture- What's great about this place is that they are made to ORDER
While the food was pretty good & 4 star worthy I felt it was overpriced & the place lacked any ambiance so I think 3 stars is appropriate
Either way - the place is kinda overrun during the day and evening with old-school gangsta goodness - the likes of which you haven't seen since the 90s
Somehow this mall has replaced local parks or playgrounds as the hot spot for bad parents to take their shitty kids
We have kids so we ordered the pizza for pick up the staff was friendly and the place was cute the pizza LOOKED amazing
This place is super cute it has a really nice looking patio and the inside is small but clean and comfortable
They do have a lot of draft beer options which I appreciate and it seems to be a great place for families with small kids
Factor that in and this place probably isn't any better than Basha's or Fry's and not as good as Costco
While the ambience is pleasant lighting is too bright for a romantic evening
We shared a cheese plate and sweet & spicy wings both good but there's a lot of good food in the valley and this place didn't make me feel like I want to go back
Its also the only place we've ever eaten Pho so I don't feel qualified to comment on the authenticity of the food but it tastes so good so fresh so delicious that even if it were not authentic I would still give it 5 stars
+Neat clean store great decor and atmosphere very casual and welcoming+Great food and selection fresh and delicious+I would go here for lunch so much delicious food and decently priced at least it's healthy no fast food
Since the place supposedly has great chicken fried steak that's what I ordered
We had the meat ball starter for 2 huge portion with Gluten Free bread - Delicious fresh and very tastyThen I got a pizza - Italian style with fine crust and plenty of topping on it fantasticAnd the best of all Gluten Free Chocolate Brownie with Coconut milk Ice Cream - DivineThe place looked great the staff friendly and the bill had a good price
A quick tip - ANYTHING with the baja sauce is great Overall this place is a lot of fun and I really like the laid back vibe
Spitfire is one of those places where you get a good feeling right when you first walk in the door
She explained the local beers they have and we loved the fact that they were the only place left in the Valley that still had any of Four Peak's seasonal brew -- I had that and it was great
And to tell the truth this place is so good I'm really wishing Phoenix was only a few hour drive away
The calamari roll is very good texture is not rubbery like other places I've been too *cough* Kabuki
This is a great little place and with amazing quality sushi
This place is great if you have stuff to do downtown either before or after a show/event and the swanky/sexy atmosphere would be great for a date as well
I can tell this is not a particularly popular place which may actually not be a bad thing; but definatly a good place to drink with close friends espically if your from CHICAGO or know anything about Chicago sports teams
Though not blow me away fantastic this place has large portions good value and stand-up food
For some reason I am always craving sushi on Sundays and there is a huge lack of good places open
The atmosphere is great the food is pretty darn good but the staff isn't all it is cracked up to be
A  bit surprised at the high prices but figured that the trendy factor in old town and the atmosphere was the reason because the teeny portions of the food and the quality is just GOOD like the Good egg not great not bad just good
Upon walking in I immediately felt a sense of awe for the atmosphere was great
The place would have been great off the strength of what it looked like the people in there killed it
The lasagna was good but not worth revisiting this place for
The food itself was good but not amazing and the atmosphere was very low-key and local which was one of its high points
Owned by the same people as Joe's BBQ this place was great with awesome selections
The environment of the place is great
Pick Up Stix looks like a great place to grab a quick bite so I stop by
This is a great place to take out-of-towners
Although service was good and the place was nice looking and obviously the wine was spectacular
I can see why he's been a mainstay of the city's dining scene for so long - his food is terrific the atmosphere is pleasantly casual the service is good although not as refined as you might expect for that price point and the prices are fair
But great place for a good bite of Italian to eat
And their pizzas are as good as other notable places
Have had some good experiences at Buffalo Wild Wings in the past but can't really recommend this place anymore due to my last experience here
This place is great for vegans and vegetarians
Other than those issues the place was great
I would say this is a place that in time could end up being decent but will never be great
The atmosphere is pretty standard but nice and clean and the service is very good
Sugar Daddy's is a great place to spend a Sunday when you need to soak up the alchol from the previous night
I was really excited to go to this Thai place after reading all the great reviews
So we did a lot of research because all of the places we used to go to when I was a kid are either out of business or just not good anymore
We saw that this place had great reviews and people have recommended to us that we try this place out
Tao Garden had excellent service it's great for a group and I had no complaints about the food
I don't even know how to convey to you how bad my experience was at this place
It's a great place to watch a ball gameair conditioned until it's cool enough to open the roof
Went here for our company dinner/happy hourWhat I liked-friendly staff pretty quick to serve drinks n food-good bar-very clean and plenty of seatsWhy no fifth star-the food seemed about average-for a clean place kinda has an identity crisis
In fact I've been waiting with beer-baited breath for some time now for this place to open even following the building process on their Facebook page because it is a great downtown destination for a quality beer after work
I want this place to succeed so I don't feel too bad about over-tipping I just think they need to mention the automatic gratuity for parties over a certain size
If you want to avoid bad food and TERRIBLE service then avoid this place at all costs
Taking a long weekend out of town we decided to review Yelp to find a good place to eat breakfast
The waiting area looks like it doubles as a storage unit for junk someone didn't want to be thrown away and the place could use a remodel and good cleaning
We had seen this place when we ate at 5th Avenue cafe not that great btw a couple weeks ago & decided to try it out
Didn't venture out of the bar but the atmosphere was great
We stood outside in the heat and talked after because the atmosphere of bad service inside was so bad lol
I understand the name of the place has Gyro's in it so I can't say that their meat selections are bad
I can tell from other reviews that I am not the only one that received remarkably bad service at this place
The casting has always been superb and definitely one of the low key places to catch a good show
If you have kids this is a great place to take them to enjoy the sights and sounds of being in a tropical rainforest
If you need a place to grab a quick lunch during the week Buono's is a great option
I don't know about the new place but the old place was kind of a hole in the wall diner feel in a good way
The place is super cute and the service was good
Ahhhh I love it when a great place forces me to get off my ass and write another review
$16 glasses of wine or margaritas just made me think of other places I could enjoy a meal as good if not better and either bring my own or pay less
Local Breeze is a great place to have some drinks outside and a solid bite to eat
So perhaps this place is great for dinner and I may come back to try that- but for lunch no way
It's a great place to stop by before or after dinner
If you're looking for a quiet romantic place to dine this isn't it
This place is good for pizza if you're looking for something different
I will definitely go back in a few months in hopes they have their kinks worked out I really want this place to work out its such a great date night place
I could see myself lounging around here for a couple hours soaking up the atmosphere enjoying good company
After reading all the great reviews about this place I just HAD to go so I gathered three of my friends and drove the 20 or so minutes from Tempe to get there foregoing any pressure to get homework or reading assignments done or for some others foregoing the desire to see a new episode of 'melrose place'
This place has a casual feel but it's also classy at the same time because they dim their lights
these guys have really stepped up their game a notchback in the day it was subpar reallybut i ordered a spinach and sausage pizza a few weeks back and it was great not too much cheese and good thin crispy crustnot many places around the area are open latecome 1am you have a choice between various disgusting fast food chains ex$pen$ive $ilver mine $ubs or these guys which when you line em up isnt much of a choice at allgood job fella's now just dont mess it up
*  Great atmosphere provided by a combination of very comfortable booth seating & tasteful decor in a dining room of the right temperature lighting acoustics & layout
Also a word of warning the place does get packed by the early bird crowd around 4pm so come early or after 6pm if you want a good table
This is one great little neighborhood place
This place is definitely a great spot if you need a quick lunch and you are on the go
if it continues to be good I will eventually give the place 4 stars but they gotta earn it
We frequent this place as it is down the street from our business and it's always amazingly good
If you want Asian/fusion food this place is pretty good
First the place always looks clean and smells good when you walk in
I guess I could go on an on since this place is really great
I have been dying to try Pita Jungle since I have had a handful of friends tell me how good/healthy this place was
The wait staff is usually quite good although one thing I don't like about the restaurant is that it is very loud although I guess that is to be expected for a place like this
The place is not fancy and it's not the dark romantic atmosphere I normally like but the food makes up for all that and it's affordable
The atmosphere in Bertha's was very relaxed
Too bad for both you and I because North used to be one of my favorite places in the valley and now I am a little tainted in my view of Fox restaurants
If you're in a hurry definitely a great place to eat and run
SideBar is a great place to go with a couple of friends for drinks and conversation
The atmosphere is comfy the staff is nice and the drinks are good
This is the place to belly up to the bar listen to good tunes on a jukebox play darts or pool & just throw down some libations
People were riding the bull and having a good time and it was a good atmosphere
I have been staying at a lot of Hyatt Places lately and was getting tired of the brand too much of a good thing but this one felt different and I'd definitely stay here again
It's odd because I've heard so many good things about this place
As not-great as this place is the value is certainly there the service is good & they have beer
I would not recommend this place because the food just wasn't good
If you want a great tasting traditional sandwich this is the place to go
Topping off what makes this place great was the service totally on the ball friendly but not hovering
The atmosphere was pleasant I wished it could have been a bit darker but overall the service is good and prompt
I will certainly come back here and highly recommend it to anyone who wants good authentic cuisine in a funky different atmosphere
Other than that the two girls working there were really friendly and overall this place was great and I will probably be back
So now he thinks baldly of chorizo and I think badly of this place
This place has a great overall vibe and we'll definitely go back
There aren't many places that deliver but thank goodness we found Joe's
The location is convenient the atmosphere was fun and casual the place is small but cute the patio area although tiny was nice and covered and the owners were all SO friendly
Went to the Factory thinking that it was going to be some great place that gives you beans and rice for some spectacular tortillas
For the atmosphere the restaurant is very hip but far from hipster which is good
In summary the food is excellent the atmosphere is great and the hours of unbeatable
All around great little place that you all must check out
Their rolls are good sized some places have really small rolls
However if you want good sushi then this is the place
My date and I which was great btw decided to go there because I've just been dying to try this place
The patio is very nice for sitting in a garden type atmosphere and the service was good and very friendly
The staff is very quick and friendly and the location is good as well as the diner atmosphere
There were definitely some bright spots and I'll come back to try more the great service and friendly atmosphere didn't hurt
PROS I'll repeat this place is old school and when you walk in you get good memories of a time when things were a little more simple and basic
The food has always been excellent and fresh and about the only place we go out to eatPlease do not change this great place to a Soup Nazi Field Kitchen or we will not return since we went to the one in Tempe and it was horrible and like some alternate universe ST and these good ratings will be dropping like a rock as have all the other locations that changed
From Los Angeles and have visited Vero Beach for the last two years it was great that old style atmosphere as growing up a dodger fan it was nice to visit the old but now this spring training facility is huge and all you dodger fans need to come and experience this even if you not a dodger fan because all the stadium are close by if you stay in between the stadiums
Our experience bad neighborhood creepy clientele unfriendly owner AC that was either malfunctioning or turned off absolutely no atmosphere of any kind and really really sub-par food
Really just a very sad attempt at food that isn't really that complicated in the first place and the owner's extremely bad attitude made the whole experience kind of insulting
This place is great all-around - for group events or just for a casual dinner
The chorizo was good although I order it from the same place they do which I learned from a NewTimes story good job on this dish it was yummy and I enjoyed every melty piece of cheese and chorizo
I've heard this a great place so I'm probably going to give it one more try
Scale of 1-10 multiple visits7 Food7 Service8 Atmosphere6 ValueThe food is hit or miss some mini-burgers are great some are meh; and the sweet potato fries don't even come close to places like Delux
Quality is bad but again i dont expect much out of these places
I could imagine Olive Garden would be just as good
The thing is I really don't have anything bad to say about this place
The price was good the place was clean and it was a perfect day to sit outside and enjoy their shaded patio
The property is a little older but the staff keeps the place tidy and in good shape
AND THUS THE FINAL JUDGMENT---------------------------------------------------As a well-run cafe serving organic ingredients with friendly and efficient service I'd say Essence is a nice place with great food
Lunch - 7-20-11THE GOODEnjoyed the atmosphere not to mention hot waitressesTHE BADNo AC
Overall it was not a bad experience the atmosphere was nice with the right company and the wait-staff seemed helpful
This is a great place to take the kids for pizza and entertainment when you're sick of the stagnant Chuck E Cheese's franchise
Their pizza though not great is better than most of the kid-oriented pizza places in town and they offer more options on the menu including alcoholic beverages for the grown-ups
A great place to pick up souveniers for visitors or a gift for a friend
Let me start this off saying the place is quite good for bar food but it just is not to my tastes
I've never had a bad roll at this place
The place is small and often frequented by Japanese which has to be a good sign
The location is in Tempe Market Place which is great for when I'm running all my other errands or when trying to kill time before a movie showing
Overall I think this is a great place
This place is as good as it gets when it comes to pizza
It's a chain restaurant but EVERY ONE of these places has good food great service and an extensive menu good for big parties/bad for indecisive people
If I did have a complaint besides the extensive menu which can be daunting to some it would be that this place is usually a bit noisy but it's also huge and often full of customers both good signs
Now I knew little about this place just that the food was very good and they had at least a few gluten free items on the menu
Each dish tasted very good individually but the secret of this place is when you eat them together
Great atmosphere sweet soundtrack helpful and caring staff
Until they come back this is definitely my new favorite place for good donuts and coffee
You just know you are going to get great food when the place is not much to look at from the inside or the outside which means the ONLY reason they are still in business is really good food & service
This place was a great little find and I will eat there again
If you do want to spend money on a good Italian meal check out the ma and pop local Italian places
Roma Garden and Aiello's are a good start

hit up the patio for a killer place to eat outside in scottsdale without feeling like you're outside in scottsdale aka on a bad runway where the models only look like tara reid
As far as the west side of town goes this place is pretty good
I've only seen a couple of places implement this kind of thing and it's great
Anyways if you love to laugh and have a good time this is the place for you
The only redeeming thing about the place was that the dj had a few good mixes during our time but most of it was pretty bad
I've heard some people say that their pasties aren's as good as other places but I doubt that these others have the variety and consistent quality that the Cornish has
Once you walk through the door you are transported into a very well-designed space with great ambience
It's a great date place but also a wonderful place for larger gatherings

Good job Yen I was getting tired of signing high bills while on a half empty stomach from most sushi places
Overall I agree that this place seems like a great concept but falls down a little in its execution
Very casual atmosphere and feel but the food quality and portions are quite good
Most items are around $8-10 and it is a very casual atmosphere but you're getting very good food for that price whether you dine there or take it home
For an unpretentious pasta place that is rather fast with their food this is a good place to visit
The decor was very cool and the atmosphere was great
Service here is great the patio is quite nice with heaters a fire place and even a few patio furniture loungers
it is a great place to go after you warm up at shady's for a while and want to show your moves
Either way the place was bad and now its closed but more hilarious is the picture I posted of  bar closed  written on a cocktail napkin oh westgate aside from the scumbags that gather your no Scottsdale
If you want to try a really good burger AND FRIES place- go to Paradise Valley Burger Company at 40th Street and Bell

Not only has everything I've had in excess of a dozen dishes been great but the face-to-face bar atmosphere has made many of the employees friends on a first-name basis
Seriously this place is great and open til midnight
Wine selection was decent waiter was a sweet heart too- he let us know pets are welcome to join you on the patio too- something about Paws on the Patio so if you're an animal lover it's a great place to bring the puppy
As for food- we had the fajitas- very good- the steak wasn't overcooked like a lot of places tend to do word of advice though- not good as left overs so make sure you bring your appetite and finish them there
When we have guests from out of town and I grew up in an Italian communitty so all of my relatives are darn picky about their Tally food EVERYONE requests that we go to that great Italian place with the great food

I haven't had a bad experience at this place -
Great atmosphere comfortable pampering and to come out looking amazing each time - can't be beat
I remembered other Good Egg restaurants drawing big crowds especially on the weekend so I was surprised to see this place pretty dead for a Sunday morning
The place is super laid back and relaxed
Great overall experience - staff was great decor/environment was nice although kind of cavernous possibly b/c of how empty the place was when we got there service could have been a little faster but it was fine
This is a great place for a romantic date as it is very very nice and an awesome experience
We've tried a few different dishes all of which were great but judging by the quality of what we've gotten it seems to be the kind of place where one could safely order just about anything on the menu and not be disappointed
The atmosphere was a quaint little locally owned place with a bakery/grocery attached and lively music which I loved-GREAT change of place from all the corporate and bland white bread places in the Valley

The fellas doing the music bit weren't all that good which probably explains the begging for tips and its not someplace I would want to wait in line to get in
Great place for business lunches and dinner dates
Still it's sad to see a great if somewhat quirky restaurant replaced by a more modern and generic one
It's new Grocery Section is giving Fry's Marketplace a heck ofa run for the money and the departments are great as well
She makes this place great even though it is surrounded by nothing in the middle of Mesa
This is a great place for a short lunch or a business lunch but I wouldn't order several pies if I was hosting a Superbowl party or had people over

Within 10 minutes he looked at me and said damn you I get it this is a f'ing great place

I've been lucky finding good Italian food places as of late
Yasu has a great atmosphere though I wish they had a longer sushi bar where you could watch the chefs do their thing

This is a great little place inside the Airport on the Southwest Airlines side
It's a great place for a good breakfast not fancy or pretentious for well under 10 bucks a person
The food was very good and very reasonably pricedIt is an outdoor hotel ie rooms are along outdoor corridor and the garden view was a little misleading
Everything is always very clean and in good working order but I just can't seem to get over the aesthetics of the place enough to actually enjoy myself at all until the curtain goes up
The atmosphere is a cute little restaurant with large tables for groups and outdoor seating as well
The patio is small but great for people watching in Tempe Marketplace
Overall Spinato's is a great pizza place and I will be back for more
The crowd is always great as is the general vibe of the place especially the patio area when the weather is nice
You've driven by and thought how very strange and dumpy looking the place was that sat next to the Dollar Store and Smart and Final and that dry cleaners which by the way is a great cheap dry cleaners but that's for another review
Say to yourself we'll try that crazy strange looking place just for the hell of it like I did a few months ago and revel in the goodness of a straight and simple ace of a Thai restaurant

It's a great for a date a special occasion or if you're looking for someplace you can dress up for

What I want to know is this Is there a good all-you-can-eat sushi place anywhere in Phoenix or the surrounding burbs
I remember thinking it was good before but I think it's just cause I was not so widely exposed to sushi and plus the ambience - being on Mill with friends during college and the beginning of a night out - was what made it fun
There are a lot of great places up and down seventh street but this piece of crap brings them all down to a lower level
This place is definitely as good as it gets nothing bad to say about it at all
Great healthy place for food if they aren't too high to get your order right
Wow a new Burger place right in our neighborhood Great
This is not a kid friendly place nor is it a good idea to bring the Mrs

If you want a casual place to drink some beer with pals skip it
You know a place is going to be good when the owner greets you with a fist bump
The lunch special at Thai Spices seemed like a good deal and I'm always up for trying new thai places - especially when they're within 1-hour-lunch-distance from my work - so i put it on my list to check out
I didn't think anyone would ever top my favorite paneng at Thai Orchid Garden in Goodyear but Thai Spices does just that

The atmosphere is excellent - always an artistic display usually great music
This place does have beer and margaritas but that doesn't make a good restuarant
The salsa is good and the service is good but it has kind of a dingy hole in the wall type atmosphere inside
who knew it would be such a great place for a second date make out session
I really wanted a good small non-chain bagel place to go to read not Einstein's to go to with some good bagels and quality lox to have

It needs more flavor and more heat but it didn't taste bad like some places
The things that stands out about this place are that it's very clean and nice inside and the staff is super friendly and good looking
I think my fellow Oreganymphos would agree; this is single handedly one of the greatest places on earth to gorge yourself with some of the most delicious pizza pastas and desserts AZ has to offer

It's right in the middle of Old Town which makes it a really great place to have happy hour or go for a meal before hitting the clubs
If you love funky candles this would be a great place to look -- tons of choices but again they're a little pricey
The prices are so good in this place you feel like plowing over all the slow-zombie shoppers and loading your cart with everything you can grab
I always appreciate a healthy restaurant and I am a foodie to boot but this place had the tiniest portions for the price you pay and the food really isn't that great

I tried the room service and i have to say the my desert choice was not so great it was okay my fault for being lazy and not head out to a place near or around
We have some pretty great places in our neighborhood
but really give this place a try its good stuff
How this place has good reviews is incomprehensible to me

The atmosphere inside was great very quaint and chic at the same time
Definitely a good place to gather with friends or enjoy a glass of wine to unwind at the end of the day
Thanks Timo for becoming my new place to like and a great experience on a random Monday afternoon off
If you don't have a sense of smell this might be a good sushi place for you
I pick up an AZ Republic and order a toasted good grains bagel with garden veggie
I have been to other Sushi lounges in this area and most of the places provides fish that had been sitting in the fridge forever at least they smell like it The quality of food in Stingray was not bad as they were fresh enough

You know a barbecue place is going to be good when you smell it over two blocks away
All in all - if my guy wanted to go back for the good pizza i'd be ok with it but its definitely not a place i'd drag my friends to on a good thursday night

Put Mimita's on your list and make sure to try them soon it's a great place
All in all I will be back but only  because my expectations are not as high as the people who think this place is so great kind of like the same people who think  Chuck Bukowski is a great writer
If you go to this place and want good service you will have to wait that weekend morning for about 45 minutes when the star employees are working
We also had coffee and it was good premium coffee and the waitress even asked if we wanted a refill so even though I could see the place was popular it was nice to see they did not try to rush us out but let our meal have its own pacing
Overall it was a fairly good experience; eating that great enchilada on the patio was memorable; but I do think this place is just a bit overpriced for lunch
The place has lots of seating great music and a classy mellow atmosphere geared towards adults who don't take duck-face photos
But if you want to bounce around and aren't afraid of germs this place is cute
Clean comfortable atmosphere; exceptional and affordable cheery service; great great great breakfast food
It's the little things that make a restaurant great and this place has them all

This place is a great find for breakfast AND lunch
The atmosphere is just gorgeous right down to the gorgeous men having drinks poolside at the more casual restaurant ROQ across the courtyard
You would expect them to be really good with the name of the place but they were awful
Not only is this place great for breakfast lunch dinner or HH
I'm torn with this place because i love it so much but dislike it for certain things so I'm going to stay positive because the things i don't like can be a personal thing about the music they allow in there it has a HELL a lot of beers it has a grand selection of wine it has no food but who need food when you've eatn before going to the LOST LEAF the music is a hit and miss some days a very kool unique style and other days not good and i think this is why i sometimes have a problem with the music is because with all the great local musicians out in phoenix it should be easier to play this place but it isn't
There was no minimum charge either way which is a stellar bonus considering so many cute bridal shower-y places in Phoenix require you to spend a certain amount
so not a great place for a business lunch/dinner
Ambiance It's everything you want in a cute lunch place
went on a bad day or b the cute little Asian couple that owned it when I used to patronize the place over 2 years ago have sold
Food was great - anyone who has ever eaten GOOD MEXICAN food will know this place is where its at
I've had the chance to try several dishes at Rice Paper with mixed results but overall this place has solid food and is an overall good experience
If you are any type of foodie or just want a really good meal with great service this is the place to go
Great new find for us we stumbled across it on a Sunday and were trying to find a place and not many were open in the area
Sure it's not in the best part of town but don't let that scare you off of a great place
After all of the glowing reviews I read about this place I figured it would be the end all to good veggie/vegan food here in the valley
Food-mehBeer-goodAtmosphere and music-awesomeI will go back to Rosie's for the music and beer but not the food
One way or the other it is a great place to meet up and have a laid back great time
They also recommended a great place to eat
I guess we keep hoping for a good experience Truthfully the food is good and the patio is a great place to go hang out and enjoy a Sunday afternoon
When working downtown this was a great impress out of town clients kind of place for lunch
It's also a great place to see how big Phoenix really is
Also since I'm a local Realtor it's a great place for out of town clients to stay
I am going to give this place an extra star because the sandwich I had today was sooo good
All around great bar food and a good place to watch a game with all of the televisions
I've read some other reviews that described it as cramped which I can understand but my husband and I were placed at a very romantic table in the corner and felt very cozy
This is not a super fancy place but considering the reasonable cost friendly and efficient service great food and low key ambiance I have to give this place 5 stars
Overall a great place to go and drink beer with friends but don't expect an extensive menu
Since the reviews on Yelp were so good we decided Scratch would be the first place to go
The place mats are cute pink plastic doilies and add to the really cute flair the restaurant has going for it
Nothing I tried gave me the wow factor hence the three stars but it's not to say this isn't a good place to go to get a well-made burger
This place overall has attentive service along with a comfortable open-air casual vibe
They are what your neighborhood pizza place ought to be with great service and a decent price
I certainly think this would be a great place just to enjoy some great wine with friends
Everyone around us seems to be having fun and the place just has a good vibe
All in all a good place to feed your shoe addiction
this place would have to be pretty bad to suck when they offer margaritas for a mere 4 George Washingtons one paper and three terminator washingtons quarters For those of you who don't habla gibberish that is $1
Overall a great place to watch the game and enjoy some good bar food
What's great about this place is that they have all the current issues available as well as a strong collection of back issues
The place is very small it reminds me of a very casual good home-cooking restaurant - not fancy but just good food
This is a great place to relax enjoy a nice hearty meal and chat it up with family and friends
The place is clean and the customer service is great
Would be a good place to go with friends and relax
Mikado Sushi is what going out for sushi should be great food in a casual friendly atmosphere
Good food but horrible stuffy and pretentious atmosphere
great atmosphere wish music outside was a bit louder or loungy
It is just a great place for a nice dinner without it being too stuffy
Nothing fancy about it but it just a great outside setting that is not patio or Jimmy Buffet themed sorry tex-mex places with outdoor seating usually go down the Buffet route
food is good atmosphere is cool and the music selection was great I heard two songs from Radiohead
I will continue to come here especially if I want a chill evening with great live music with Sarah but this isn't your go to place to try new and interesting wine or learn more about wines
In spite of the Princess Hotel total lack of interest in the success of this restaurant The Grill continues to be a great place to get an if somewhat expensive excellent dinner
In fairness in terms of cost it's no worse than Mastros Ocean or any other high end restaurant and certainly less expensive than Bourbon Steak but the setting is much more intimate the service much better and the food every bit as good if not better than those other must do places
Sill a great place to go for lunch until it re-opens for dinner
Luke is a great place to work the people are friendly the layout is pretty easy to get used to but the buildings are pretty old
I normally stay away from themed restaurants but Texas Roadhouse has a really cozy atmosphere and good food
I absolutely loved this place and the vibe and the good energy I felt
My husband and I wanted some good breakfast there were some mixed reviews on this place so we decided to try it
First impression is it is a small place in a not so good location
The atmosphere alone- great music and fun staff is a good reason to go
This is THE place to go for a great deal on wings
its a great place for two to dine OR for a smallish group
Other than that it's a nice place with great yogurt
It's a great place to watch the game and to hang out
It also has great lighting and a really good atmosphere overall
A lot of people dog on this place for being too Snottsdale and I've surely seen that attitude SOME of the time but overall I've had good experiences here
There are too many great restraunts in the Phoenix area with great service and great food to waste my hard earned money at a place like Bread Fruit
Early one morning on our way through the lobby of the swanky resort where we were staying we asked the young concierge if she had a recommendation for a good take out place where we could pick something up to bring back to eat at the end of what was planned to be a long day of exploring Scottsdale
I can't say that I would rush back to this place but the service is friendly and the drinks and food are good
Between the relaxed upscale atmosphere great martinis with blue cheese olives of course friendly bar tenders and the bowls of snacks; I could have sat there all night
This place is cute and the staff is so nice and friendly
Again for the same money you can dine at Morton's Donnavon's or Mastro's all of which I think are superior but if those places are all booked or for some reason you just want to visit the one that was here first Ruth's Chris is still a pretty good steak
This place very much depends who you get the prices are good but the young girls seem too inexperienced
The atmosphere here is casual but classy and it's the perfect location for a date night or a night out with family or friends
As its location puts it in the heart of the Art Walk every First Friday of the month it is a very popular meeting place for cocktails and good beats
lots of vegetarian items on the menu great late night atmosphere
all told i had a great time at shady's and it seemed like a pretty cool place i wouldn't hesitate to go back as long as it's not too packed
Its hard to describe but you'll find yourself coming back its just a great place to work
Something about the place leads to a great day for me and my friends every time we're out there
oh lord what a good place to get some yummy authentic indian food
If you are in the area and looking for some great indian food this is definately the place
Oh HEY  I actually *can* say something good about this place  They refill the rice and noodles quite well
Oh come on-this place isn't awful   Seriously the wings and chowder were good and I'd actually come back here for their happy hour
Cozy comfort with a great fireplace inside and killer patio outback
Great wine list  well thought out menu that delivers and service that fits the food and atmosphere
The staff was a little busy with the place being packed as it was but again they delivered the goods
Liberty market is a great place to meet friends or family for a good casual meal
This makes for a great place to hang out and meet up with people
I have heard great things about this place and I had purchased one of those online deals to try it out
Between the prices on frozen food the sales on live rock and the health of the fish this is a great little local mom and pop sort of place
It isn't often I opt for a grocer for lunch but AJ's is a great little place for a quick bite
The floral section of AJ's has some great picks that would make any dining room table brighten up or your girlfriend and the bakery case is one of my favorite places
-Everyoneokay so that last one was a stretchBill arrivesI snag billGIGANTIC SMILEDetailsAtmosphere Similar to Sapporo without the sometimes obnoxious Scottsdale sceneFood 5 stars Fresh and very very good
What I think is really great about this place is the hotel shuttle
The drivers were really nice along with being helpful in giving me tips about good places to eat
Next time your near Norterra and looking for BBQ that's quick and cheap this is a good place to go
This is not a good place for groups larger than four people
I would say this place is great for lunch or quick dinner
The chicken was good but it wasn't as good as I have had it other places and it wasn't that spicy
Overall the place was good it just didn't measure up to other places I have tried BUT it did change my mom's opinion on Indian food which is awesome
I would've rated this place better but the service wasn't very good
I'm not big on Scottsdale so I always forget that its there which is a shame because it's such a great place
Unlike the typical Scottsdale hangout this place is completely unpretentious and usually has a good mix of people from young to old and black to white
This place went above and beyond to accommodate us I went from beyond grumpy to relaxed and pleased when we left
They had a fantastic little jazz band trio playing I just fell in love with this place lots of room not too load great ambiance and fantastic service
Place is absolutely great and the staff gives awesome customer service
But the list of places to try is big and I'm having a GREAT time doing it
I decided to check this place out today for lunch with a friend and it was pretty good
This is a great place for kids or couples on a date
The only complaint I have about this place is that I've been here countless times and I can't recall ever getting good service
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++This place has pretty good sandwiches/salads/soups
They have a great atmosphere and a great staff
I live about 2 minutes from this great place
My Mom was a graduate of Carlsbad Highschool 1957 and I am from New Mexico so this has a special place in my heart
The fireplace which is outside smells great in the winter months
This place is probably great during happy hour but when you're paying full price it's just so not worth it
I think Ra is great if you want to go to a tready place and have fruity overpriced drinks and sushi
Now look it isn't pretty inside it's divey a weird fish tank and ventriloquist doll are kind of strangely displayed but look past that and see this place for what it is a local joint with real honest to goodness people serving you
Good drink great food great music great atmosphere great service
Now the bad aside from the place being divey which isn't bad to me but I know it is to some is that the parking is kind of a nightmare
Check this place out with a good friend and an open mind we love it
I like Sportsman's because it's a friendly and warm atmosphere and they have a great variety of discounts for their different levels of alcohol
They have a great atmosphere decent happy hour and well trained bartenders
I had to write this because this place is great and doesn't deserve the previous low review
Seems like more of a place for straight guys and kids if you ask me but my experience today wasn't to bad
The ambiance is great and everyone is friendly esp when you stay here in summer and the place is empty
It is a great place for an date family or just having a girls night out
Overall a great place to eat and be seen a perfect combo for Scottsdale
they also didnt use a scrub and the place smelt like horrible nailpolish and my nails smelt bad no nice lotions or scrubs or ANYTHING
It's also a good place to grab dinner at 1030pm on a Saturday when nowhere else is still open
A few things one should expect when coming NOCA-you will never be thirsty waterboy is there stalking empty glasses like a hawk-the pasta is not at all impressive-cotton candy is complimentary and served at the end of the meal-this is casual fine dining = large rimmed heavy expensive ass plates with dallop of *insert food here*-great venue for a date-menu changes NIGHTLYDim lighting  small cozy atmosphere but not excessively loud either
It's a cute place and the owners seem pretty nice but there are a few kinks that need to be straightened out
Don't let the fact that it's at 19th Avenue and Indian School scare you off this is a great place to take care of all your home improvement needs
Overall very solid and would eat here again good service nice non-tourist trap atmosphere
Another thing I like about this place is that they always have great service
My initial impression of the place was pretty good
The beans were great as well which is an important test if you want to know how good a Mexican food place is
The atmosphere is casual with lots of decorations and pictures you can tell it has been here a long time but it does not look old and run down
Postino's reputation in the Arcadia neighborhood brought me in and the good food and relaxed atmosphere has made me a believer
We were right by the fireplace and it was romantic and intimate
The patio atmosphere is great - especially in spring time
Service can be hit or miss but overall a great place
Oh- also they had some sitting rooms with magazines fire places -oh my goodness
It has a ways to go to become a great place but for dropping in to catch some fried food and a burger it beats a lot of other options out there
It's too bad that a lot of their prices have gone up as have other restaurants but I'll still patronize this place
A full bar and wall to wall tv's makes this a great place to catch a game any night of the week
Don't get me wrong the food was good but at this level you are also paying for the atmosphere and the experience both of which are lacking at Atlas Bistro
check out the pic I postedFor a more relaxed atmosphere sit in the dinning room area
This place is totally cute inside and i guess i expected the food to be just as good as the place looked but ended up being super disappointed
Its a fun atmosphere coupled with a great menu which means that you are bound to have an excellent time with friends and family
Everybody was friendly the service was good a bit slow but not awful and the place was very tidy
The atmosphere is sooooo great -- an old house thats been redone with a great porch and fantastic big outdoor bar
Gus's on Campus is a good I'm drunk and hungry place
However good experience good atmosphere and a GREAT price
Second upon us entering the Museum we were approached by a very nice volunteer whom we asked about exhibits good for kids - the only place she suggested was the Experience Gallery
This place is great the staff is friendly and the fruit is fresh and delicious
I've heard nothing but great things about this place but in my humble opinion it was just okay
The lounge in the bar has a great atmosphere and we spent hours eating drinking and talking
It is hard to find a place that even knows what an Old Fashioned is let alone make a good one
Throw in the great beer and service and you have someplace with a little soul in the midst of the urban sprawl
this place has a great selection of subs and soups plus the service is great
Great place friendly staff nice atmosphere
Maybe the 5 star is a counter balance of how much disappointed I've been in the past at other places but this place is great
Have some fun Sakana is a good place to try some good fish RAW
We had lunch there yesterday since I wanted to try someplace new and I'd read good reviews
You walk through an attractive fireplace'd patio and into the aroma of fire- grilled meats and romantic darkness even at lunch
This place may as I have heard have great drink prices for happy hour and cheap munchies for the same but the salad and rice I received were certainly not the focal point of the chef
Cute modern looking place to grab a burger and a beer they had a good selection on tap with friendly service
Lots off great places in the Central Corridor - including Switch
After all of the great reviews even non yelpers I couldn't wait to try this place out
I did think the whole tavern like ambiance was great good place to go to cool down and get away from all that Phoenix sunshine
It's clear that this place has a good following of locals which means they're obviously doing something right
This place is great for Friday night hangouts Saturday football games and in-house entertainment and anytime you want to take a break and have a cold beer after a long days work
All and all this is a great place for lunch or dinner
I love going to pubs where everyone seems to be having a great time - this was my kind of place
I came to this dog park after reading the good reviews on Yelp and thought I'd come to the wrong place
Good food and a cool laid back atmosphere go a long way but annoyingly slow and inattentive service go a long way too
Though perhaps not the place you may pick for a special brunch with champagne and chocolate brioche French toast a signature breakfast at the Sofitel Philadelphia the Good Egg is my choice for neighborhood breakfast that offers consistent service and food in a comfortable atmosphere
well basically it's a good place for anyone
The atmosphere is sparing which means you get more great deals and savings
Places that eschew bad chemicals completely but don't jump through the government hoops to get certified like Desert Roots Farm for example are more desirable to deal with than mass-produced certified organic producers many of which have lately been rocked with scandal
The atmosphere is beautiful and service was great
I paid my bill and decided there are plenty of places with good beer and good food
The beef ribs and tri tip were great and I would recommend this place to everyone
You will def get a awww this place is cute from your date certain guys and all girls
The place has really nice tables good cues which is a commodity in the pool scene and a pretty good bar/tap
One thing about this place is that if you order steak or prime rib they use very little seasoning so it is great for true steak lovers who don't need to drown their meat in sauce and seasoning to enjoy it
The chips are good which is a huge deal to me as many of the fast food Mexican places have terrible chips
This place has the greatest muddle bar ever
Finally a decent downtown Thai food place with good lunch prices
Great place to punish yourself with too much alcohol and some artery-clogging mac and cheese
I'm sure this place has some good dishes but I clearly didn't order one of them
There are some good things they offer though such as watercolor classes that take place in the store and they have a bulletin board where you can find instructional art classes teachers and art openings
Being so popular and good there's always a line outside the place to get in
We had a great time and I printed more passes so other family members could enjoy this place
I have got to say what a fab little place with great customer service
If you are looking to pay a decent price starting at $50 and up for an hour massage tailored to your needs/pains while walking away feeling relaxed and pain free then AZ Body Therapy is definitely the place to go
The atmosphere is intimate and cozy the service outstanding the Pho merely good but the the prices were rather high which is why they are only getting three stars
This is really a good place to invite some friends for some food and fun and lots of booze before you go next door to cruise and booze some between dances
It amazes me that a place that seems to focus on one thing does such a bad job at it
Good deal for crap you just have collecting dust in your place anyway
We came here after seeing the place on Triple D and after hearing a few great reviews from some friends
I over heard the owner mention he didn't know what a Gastropub was until someone told him he opened one he did a good job I enjoy frequenting his place
Sometimes you just want to eat something that makes you feel good and this is the place
Well let me clrify it's not a good 'first date' place
They are now asking for a cover charge which is good if it was comparable to other places that require cover charges
Owned and operated by Eugenia Theodosopoulos an Ohio native fyi and considered by many to be the best patisserie/bakery in the state I approached Essence with a note of skepticism largely assuming much of the hype was derived from Tempe's plethoric college crowd but arriving at the doors of the small shop on a particularly lovely 80 degree morning I gathered quite quickly that my original conceptions were misplaced; not only does Essence not look like a college haunt neither do its prices or products - a vast selection of at least twenty items aside from the posted menu sitting beneath and atop a glass case forcing me to make more than one tough decision that was not helped by my server's accurate assessment that everything was really good
We really enjoy our Japanese cuisine and thought that our native state had some really great places to offer
Overall I won't eat here again which is too bad because I really wanted to like the place
Good atmosphere too although maybe a bit too trendy to bring the parents here
Great atmosphere massive humidor probably as big as they get and incredibly knowledgeable staff
The size of the restaurant is ample so this would make a great place to host a dinner party
This place reminds me a lot of The Vig modern atmosphere with good looking people inside
We ended up having a great Valentine's day and he was able to get a reservation at a much better steak place cooler atmosphere better food and he received an email confirmation of our reservation with a reservation number
The place is homey and cozy with the delicious scent of good food all around
This place is good for young people first dates families celebrations and anything in-between
However if you want to eat some darn good vietnamese food this is the place
there are too many great places for that go here for the Liquor and beer selection
All in all great place to catch a game fun club to watch and first class guest services
avoid this place if you want real good food
If you're looking for a breakfast place open early in that general area I suggest you drive a little further up Central to the Park Central Shopping center and hit up The Good Egg
The service - the staff is great and it's a very laid-back atmosphere
Good food decent service nice atmosphere although you do have to shout over the cougs at lunch
Throw in authentic southwestern Mexican dishes served quickly and a great bakery with a huge variety of fresh Mexican sweets and this place deserved five stars hands down
I had the pleasure of attending the grand opening last night and this place is great
Another great thing is that if you keep your receipt and go back the next day or so you can get a replacement for any produce that has gone bad and you didn't notice upon purchase
I have had good sushi experiences so many times at this place but one near-death event really helps to wipe those memories away
This place is by no means fancy or upscale it's just a mom and pop restaurant with great breakfast
Very cute place I'd think to take children if you have them
I've been to this place for lunch and dinner on other occasions and the prices are really good  but their food is just OK
Overall a nice place with good service I cannot say I'd go out of my way for Over Easy but considering its location I could certainly see it making a great breakfast spot after a morning skate - goodness knows it would have trumped the Denny's or Bob Evans I frequented after hockey as a lad
The atmosphere in and outside of the restaurant is great
I loved the relaxed atmosphere but like I said before their food is what will get me talking
Their other dishes were so good and so much better than other places they still get a 4-star review even with average fried rice
I would recommend this little humble not so flashy kind of place to anyone looking for some good mexican seafood
It's a great place to meet with friends or study but as for the crepes I've had better
I am always a little aprehensive to go to a new place with my daughter since I never know if the atmosphere would be good for kids or not
The atmosphere has a good vibe and a nice buzz
I don't frequent quiet places with my 3 year old so this was great
Having eaten more than my share of the brassica family most places tend to greatly over cook it and usually serve it limp and dark green
In terms of atmosphere it's cheesy Mexican decor that's not a good thing or a bad thing
Liberty Market is a great place in downtown Historic Gilbert
the place is great for lunch and breakfast kinda slow service and cheap diner food but worth the price tag
I was stuck in a rock and a hard place until Miguel went out to my house and went onto the roof with my insurance adjuster and showed him how bad the damage was and that the parts were no longer made
The place has great atmosphere and a cute patio area to sit outside when it's a nice day service was prompt and courteous
Definitely check it out one evening it's a great place to have a drink with friends
Great if you're looking for a place that always has something new
As good a gyro as you would want from a steak place I guess
If you prefer eating at that other place that competes with Cibo you probably think Del Taco makes really great  authentic Mexican food
I think that a lot of times people including myself think hat this pace is the last place to go to get good deals but if you sign up for the rewards program and look that the weekly add's you can get some pretty good deals at Toys R Us
The price I got is a great deal and even cheaper than some places in glendale which were closer to school
It's a great take-out place I can't recommend it highly enough
I figure that has to be a good sign that it is worth it to her to hoof it in and out of that place for that much food
Pretty good but seemed out of place at a Thai restaurant
This unassuming pizza place is right down the street from our house and provides a quick go to for some good food and excellent service
Since this place is so close and better than other pizza places near us mainly humble pie we will be frequenting here whenever we have a hankering for some good quality pizza
good place to take out of towners or if you really really really like hearing about a architect
This place rocks and it is always packed that is a good thing cause I need them to stay in business
I went for it after all the good buzz about this place
One because it does what a lot of great places in Phoenix do well - lives downtown in a beautiful old home and is classy but unpretentious
I ordered these two items a la carte so they come with a serving of rice and naan- which is a pretty good thing as far as value is concerned at Indian places
would probably be a great place to watch the suns lose to mafia-paid referees
The bottom line is that the food is good and cheap and the place is real
The atmosphere is great- relaxing intimate a place where you can talk with and enjoy the people with you
This wasn't a bad place to stay considering the alternative to driving home to Tucson after the football game
this place is becoming more of a place that i want to have a casual drink at even if they don't have a football game or a ppv fight and thats what i thought  was lacking before
bottom line fun place good food but limited veg options
When this place first opened they had some really good Mexican food and service
Unfortunately this place has really gone down hill and their food isn't that great anymore
Great atmosphere - a real nice pub complete with jukebox dartboard and a lot of really good beers to pick from
It's great to see a new FroYo place opening up in our neighborhood
The Living Room is a great place to kick back and relax on a date or with a group of friends
Finally a place that serves great Hot and Sour Soup
Would go back again but there are other breakfast places like Ronnies on Cactus that are as good and more homey
I would have loved for the black pepper reduction to be a bit thicker and for there to have been a bit more as it paired so well with the pork and I would have really loved for there to have been room for dessert though I'm pretty sure Chef Beckett had little control of that detailIn all Beckett's table will take it's rightful place among the most well regarded restaurants in Greater Phoenix and become a must visit destination for fooderati
this place does a great job of setting a comfy and relaxing atmosphere right from the get go
I wouldn't say this is the BEST place to get breakfast downtown but it is very good and fairly inexpensive so I would definitely come here again
It's simply a great place to catch up with a friend study read or grab an afternoon pick-me-up
There are certainly better places to go as far as the food is concerned but this place is definitely a good lunch spot any day
Overall this is a great place to have a glass of wine and just relax which I did not long ago or even a meal with family and friends
If you're looking for a good Japanese eat in Arizona then this is your place
I wanted so badly to like this place but I really didn't
Great for a meal with some rowdy party people as the atmosphere is lively
This place is great and in such an unexpected location
I work over here and I am thrilled to find a great place to each lunch
If you just want a good beer in the neighborhood and a passable roll to fill you up then this place is perfect
overall place wasn't half bad it just got on my bad side with the hair/bone/check issues
The room service is great the food is tasty -- it's the perfect place to unwind
The little restaurant area to the right of the lobby as you walk in was a good place to relax and chat after a long day
In short I love this place there is nothing better than tipping a Guinness and a Jameson with a few friends in one of the cozy booths and listen to some great Celtic band bring the roof down
It gets five stars because if you're comparing it to other strip mall nail places it's as good as it gets
If you like Italian food and great wine this is the place for you
+Excellent service+Great atmosphere I completely lost track of the fact I was in a Casino the place is quiet intimate no smoke or machine noise
I'm not sure what they are known for at this place but that's how a lot of Vietnamese restaurants are they make a few things that are great and they specialize in those and just have the other stuff just cause
They both featured a warm atmosphere jazz and blues influenced playlists and pop art type pictures of jazz and blues greats
The issues that I have are the really weak drinks don't even bother ordering a cosmo or margarita especially since the drinks next door at Z are amazing and the not so great eye candy behind the bar which has been in place for years
If you are looking for a way to help out your fellow man this year Andre House is a great place to start
The only thing good about this is place that the one star gets is the lemonade mango juice
This place has a great happy hour which we have been to a couple of times so we decided to have dinner there
Its the best value of all of the options on the resort and if you're looking for a good quick meal and you're on a budget or a per diem like I was this is the place to go
the zoo does does seem to do too much to just want your money - you pay a good fee to get in and then there are places everywhere to take more money from you - opportunity cost eh
I am giving two stars because I think the place is well designed and the food is not great but good
Healthy affordable food great staff good atmosphere
First the service was impeccable and the atmosphere was great
Yes the parking sitation is a bit iffy but when are really good eats found in well-lit places
OK now that you know that I have to say this place is good
What really sets this place apart is that the frozen yogurt actually tastes good
We also greatly enjoyed the comfortable atmosphere created by the owner and staff
people this a freakin bar for goodness sakes a hole in the wall  its no Bistro Its no classy spot and you can honestly smell a stench coming from the place weather its the bleachy pissy smell  or stank coming off the BAD SERVICE
Food-wise the menu is kinda geared towards comfort and southern style offerings including mac-n-cheese scallops with bacon and corn grits dungeness crab cakes with complementary slaw pork-belly etcAgain overall good place to go for a casual and relaxing drink or two
Great atmosphere nice loungey chairs plenty of tv's to watch sports
I can't let this place get a bad wrap for one unsatisfactory review
This is a place to go to feel appreciated and have great coffee or tea
It's not fancy or pretentious just a great place to stop in and grab a sub
I really wanted to like the food because I think the building and patio are beautiful and it's a great place to sit back and relax
Don't leave this place without trying the horchata either it's so good
R-eally great atmosphere without pretentiousness
It's never to noisy so it would be a great place to take a family or even a date
I would recommend if you want a great glass of wine without food Cork is the place though our waiter Winston had difficulty remembering what wine was ordered at our table
We definitely need a good gyro place that delivers in the area
It is a good place to meet someone at 145 AM
And that's why it's a good place to go in Old Town
The waitress was great-the restaurant still never got busy and we ended up closing the place down that would be 10pm
It was a great evening and a nice place to have played catch up with old friends none of us are 40 yet so they wouldn't like me calling them old
That is why I return again and again to this place also the vocal entertainment that was there also provided a great Sunday lunch experience
Want to have an inexpensive lunch and don't care about atmosphere but rather just good quality food
The inside atmosphere is nice jazzy/loungy my French Martini is gone in 60 seconds the food is pretty good
I decided to try this place with my family and the service was GREAT
Good places do have a wait - that's a given - but very good places have a more customer-oriented approach to their waits
There are plenty of other very good places in the neighborhood
You get in and like other reviews it really is like a gift shop and then you walk into the back which is a HUGE and clean restaurant that has a great atmosphere and seats plenty
Some places do it extremely well and others are just plain mediocre and soemtimes bad
Most other places seem to just throw any kind of strawberries into their yogurt line but Yogurtology happened to have some really good calories

They play great music have lots of TV's all over the place
Great atmosphere the service is friendly helpful and quick
Great food great company and amazing scenery This place is cookin'
I've read good things about the experience there pulling up a stool and can't believe I left the place without even taking a peak at the thing
That one must have spoiled me because to me this place - while not horrible - is far from great
If you are looking for a great place to celebrate a birthday or you have a big group this place is awesome

We walked around the stadium and there doesn't seem to be a bad seat in the place
We had a pretty good vantage of the whole place
The only knock I have on this place in comparison to Delux is its lack of good beer and its dwarf sized burgers
Based on the great Yelp reviews this place will not be hidden for long
Simply this place has developed a really bad attitude
I've tried many of the burger places here in the Valley and honestly nothing is as good as Smashburger
If you're a woman and want great East African food then this is the place but from the vibe in there I reckon you'll enjoy it more if you go in with a man or in a mixed group

This place is do-gooder heaven as Cups is owned by Hospice Care Colorado the staff are mostly volunteers and all proceeds
The interior epitomizes the word charming and with its good light numerous wall outlets and spacious tables it is the perfect place to set up your laptop and relax into your work and if you have a book club or meeting to organize there is also a small room off of the main one that is just waiting to welcome you in
The good thing is the beer list is one of the better ones in Arizona for the place beer list at Papago is good but not my scene that's the one good thing

This place is a little hole in the wall but it's got some great food
There are some great things about this place but then there are some
If I talk to my parents about how good this place is with any luck I'll get a gift certificate for Christmas
The really great thing about Casey Moore's aside from it being in a haunted house is that when I was a scrawny ASU undergrad it was a great place to hang out with your pals and now that I'm an out of shape ASU alum many years later it still is
But it is a place where young and old Sun Devils students and alumni and profs can all unite under one roof and put back a beer or two in a laid back charming relaxed environment
Summary  Scottsdale beautiful decadent great place for special occasion
Great food fun atmosphere and wonderful service
Your pets deserve good healthy quality food and this is definitely the place to get it
The atmosphere was relaxed making it a great place to sit talk and watch some sports
Wow~that really is too bad that this place was put on the Dirty Dining list
The reason I stated that this place is a good introduction to Vietnamese fare is that I personally felt that the flavors were more suited to a Westernized palate
Phoenix has so many great Mexican food Places
it would only make this place the more romantic by being directly across street from a south coast worthy mall
The rooms are beautiful the bathrooms are unreal/nice the lighting in the rooms is pretty the decor is incredible the pool is perfect the restaurants have great happy hour the parking is free if you find street parking and it's a quiet place because not that many people have discovered this gem
Also they were shown on our local TV station as a good place to do business
It's also a good place to use one of the resort fee perks--each room gets a free appetizer each day with an appetizer purchase
If you're an early riser the outdoor patio is a great place to watch the quail and hummingbirds busily feeding while the sun comes up
I do have to admit that I lived in southern California for a long time where burger spots like this were ALL over the place and many of them were very good so it's probably an unfair comparison
The place is really cute and their ice cream is amazing
The market salad is not an every day option but really damn good so if this is offered on the day you go get it as a side to make you feel less guilty about eating all the bready wonders in this place more to come
The food here is okay - the scones were great the hot food what you would expect from a breakfast bar atmosphere
This is one of those places that makes Yelp great
This bar has the maturity of a 13 year old so it is a great place to just act like a kid again
too bad but you knew it would happenthe douche bags would find this place outand now the hoards and the massesof DB's are roaming aboutthis groovy mid-century modernthat tosses a pretty good piebut sadly the ol' DB factorhas ruined the place for this guyit's no fault of the ownersthey did their very bestbut now the dicks and bonershave descended from the East and the Westside in their True Religionsto prey on the Cougars et alwho also have seeked out the parlorthe kitty's have started to crawlaround looking for actionmade up for making outand you know the rules of attractionwill keep the C's and DB's turning out
It's a small place so prob not good for a group of more than 4 but the two times the bf and i have gone we've only waited about 10 min before a table opens up
The place is a dive though but you know what they say about divey places having good food
Luckily this place is a pretty great option when my regular doc is closed
- the place is super clean and smells surprisingly good- all staff members are knowledgeable friendly and actually seem to not hate being  there another rare find at a doctor's officeEven though this urgent care isn't close to my house I will continue to come here when I'm in need
Good place for veggie heads or folks who eat fish
This is a good place to enjoy breakfast or lunch with a client friends or go by yourself and enjoy the free Wi-Fi
The service is great the atmosphere is fine the food is adequate and the dessert is definitely a step or two above average
It's a great time for someone who wants to see the Disney version what the old west really was like or just for someone who wants a nice steak in a fun atmosphere
I have had a good time here in the past have never been disappointed and must say that it is definitely a fun place to go
It was an excellent treat to have such a great meal at a place that can easily be labeled as a trendy casual cantina
When we left the super cute owner I didn't ever catch her name but was told she owns the place hugged us all as we left
All in all a good place to grab a coffee and cupcake  meet a friend or get some old fashioned reading done
Perhaps it's because there really aren't that many good places to get a sandwich in this neck of the woods
It's a good place to not be seen if your operating on the down low

Great place for the young and the single
This place has so many memories and I still have a good time there
The atmosphere was great there were lasers and couches and a full bar
They have all three of the essential triumvirate of a successful eating establishment - Great Fun Atmosphere Awesome Food with Ample Selections  & Nearly Perfect Service
Convenient location good prices relaxing atmosphere make for a pleasant experience
The place is packed at night which most of the time is a sure sign of good drinks and crowd
Everyone is friendly and casual which is soo pleasant for the atmosphere
Secreto has a nice atmosphere and great decor so I'm giving a second try in the future but I find it fishy that 2/3rds of the entree menu is steaks and pasta when this is suppose to be a New Mexican restaurant
This place has great food good service and excellent outdoor atmosphere
Tacos are good drinks are strong and sitting outside under the zigzag of string lights is very romatic and laid back atmosphere
Great place for families though chill atmosphere
In all seriousness I have heard good things about this place from several people I kind of walked in and was trying to think what the hell was the theme here seriously if PETA ever went in here they would close this place down with stuffed animals on the walls they would have a field day
Very rare to find a place where everything on the menu looks good
The ambiance is great it's a tiny casual but not to casual place in an slightly upscale grocery store parking lot
seems silly but besides this small quirk it's a great place
I found Cibo last summer when I was looking for a relaxed place to meet my grandfather for dinner
It's a great place for breakfast but it's nice to know it's a good place for dinner too
As a big breakfast lover I was pretty excited when I found out there was a new breakfast place opening with a name as great as Bacon
I've been told by others that this place is great
Harlow's is definitely a great place in Tempe to get good breakfast
The atmosphere was warm and inviting and it just has a great vibe
I would highly recommend this place for a lunch with really good friends
We all agreed that the food was as good or better than any other place we have been to
Overall good service great atmosphere and good food
All in all its a fun little place to go with friends or on a date for a good laugh and I will definitely be going to another show here in the future
Went to Gallaghers on a Thursday night for a blind date I can't really say much about the place because the date and I just wound up talking nonstop and only ordered drinks it was a great 1st date but not really great for our waitress who was waiting for us to order have to say on Thursday nights there is a trivia  night which brought out a good crowd but with the questions being asked my date and I felt like we missed the study class and jumped right into the test wow we only got one answer right  and that made us both laugh too
Everyone says good things about this place cause that's what's expected
Situation Wedding AnniversaryApp Brie BruleeSalad RoquefortMe Lamb ShankWife Sea BassOutcome So few times have I ever run into a place where the food is so good it puts pictures in your mind
Sure the place cost a little more but so do really good seats at a show
The atmosphere was great the food was outstanding but the service was embarrassing
but hey freaking good for a place like Arizona right
I must say I do like this place they book good artists it has a good feel to it
Good suishi places tend to have a busy bar though so you probably have come to expect such things
It only took 10 minutes at lunch and already we had the sneaking suspicion that this was a great place
Was on my way to see a movie thinking I could get a casual quick bite to eat I didn't realize there are so few places to choose from in this immediate area
The moment we walked into this place it was alllll bad
I've always thought this place had good food and that the prices were fair for the huge portions so I was super excited to find one here in Arizona
The place was packed but they blocked off a few tables for us and we were able to all fit which was very nice and things went great
I'm a huge fan of this place because of the good sound
The whole place is constructed with that great solid brick therefore you don't hear your neighbors
AZ88 is a great place plain and simple
Not a good place to come if you need a quick lunch
Overall this was a very good place to take family to
Now compared to California dim sum places this would only be an average place but because I don't have to drive six hours to California and the quality is good I give this place 4 stars
It's also a great place to just chill with a small group of friends
Great place - the service was very good the bartender very helpful the food was delicious and the prices were very reasonable
Municipal is a fun and great place to watch a game but falls short of some of the other stadiums in the area for me
A great place my wife and her friends alerted me to
I decided to try this place out based on good reviews
very good service also the decor is a little weird because this location used to be a 5 and diner also if it's slow time of day it's really quiet in the place no music in the background so it feels kinda strange
Thought I'd head over to Truckin' Good Food and place my order since a crepe normally takes 12 to 15 minutes to prepare due to all of the people lining up for their fix of French delights
This place is an awfully darn good breakfast joint that sources from locals
providing a comfortable and hip atmosphere great service and mouthwatering delicious stomach stuffing
18 Degrees is a great place to take the kids on a weekend afternoon
This place is not bad by any means it is the ultimate epitome of average nondescript personality-less and blah
The lady at the register = super cute and I kinda like the stab joint classic chinese restaurant looks of this place
I heard great things about this place from my boyfriend so I had to try it
Liked our waitress Theresa seems to be a good place with good people & friendly staff
They have lots of TV's so we expect it to be a good place to watch some events
My wife & I relocated from Boston MA for her to attend Grad school from 2003 to 2006 - for the first year we wandered through the desert lost trying to find some quaint local haunt that had great atmosphere fantastic food and awesome beer
- The Food and beer selection is AMAZING- The atmosphere is great - not too college-ey not to snooty like Scottsdale - but a great mix of college young adults and families
Great place to grab a stiff drink at a reasonable price and check out music of all types really
I can't say that I'll be a regular here anytime soon it's a bit of a drive from my house and there are other places that are basically as good but cheaper but you can count on seeing me here from time to time smile on my face and meatloaf in my mouth
He said it was a great place for him I think I did good picking it hahaSo we ordered the wings with spicy thai peanut sauce and beer bread the wings were so dang good it packed the right amount of heat
If the people who don't like it here stop coming more great food and atmosphere for the rest of us
Overall its not that bad of a place but Einstein's has become rather bland and boring over the years leaving me desperate for better service better bagels and a mostly generic feel
Besides that the service really was great and I did not regret my decision for choosing this place
They may not be Lo Lo's good but they are darn fine for this kind of a place
But really I think that just enhanced it because I remember the places we got bad food at that hour OH so clearly
The place does good business though it seems so I may be the minority in feeling the pain in the pricing
The atmosphere is really relaxed and friendly
Overall it was a nice place but not as great as I'd expected
I suppose if you were on a date where you wanted to be really close to the person all night without being obvious this would be a good place to do it
However that makes a mess on me so I get the bowl instead and this place is great for filling up on good tasting food on the cheap
As is par for the course in some places in Phoenix the parking is horrible with most of the good spots reserved for the store next door
The good things-The place is very very pretty there are a couple of places here and there that could use some minor repairs and updating but really this place is pretty
I have lots of great things to say about the place
- good coffee and treats- 24 hours on friday and saturday open late on other nights- cute atmosphere- free wi-fi with plenty of outlets- drive thru- music performancesi so love this coffee place
It's a great place to read a book or people watch- or both
The place has a cute look but I will never be back
We get our drinks and the menu looked good and we figured out what we wanted to order but then another 15 minutes went by without any waiter attention and we decided to head off to another local place that we knew we would get better service
The atmosphere was very chill and the service was great
Good wine selection too and though I'm not usually one to eat/drink with my feet up on another chair the atmosphere is super chill and I felt relaxed to the max
I have spend literally hours at this place working my way though the menu and all I have found is great well executed delicious dishes
A great place to buy accessories for your instrument and they also have a small but high quality selection of guitars both electric and acoustic
I've never had a meal that was really that good here but do continue going back because of the atmosphere and drinks
It's a great place to grab a drink or app though so i will continue going back but hopefully not for dinner which I get roped into
This place is ok for fast Thai food when you are am craving Thai and you just can't drive to the West side of town then this place is good enough to kill the craving
My copilot on this adventure said her chicken tacos were not so good either and when we got back to the office she noted that we won't be trying that place again
There is not one bad thing I can say about the decor of this place
There are bad restaurants too so there are places to avoid Cadillac Ranch Darcy McGee's
You might think with a name like Fox Sports Grill the place would be more like a ESPN zone/ Dave n busters type place with tons of TVs and a super casual environment
So back to the review 3 starts because well at this experience the wait service just wasn't all that great and it may be my only experience since a restaurant I do love the herb box is within walking distance but I think that over time as long as management is self-reflective this place may continue to improve
Fez has GREAT Fez Benedict eggs Benedict this is one the of few places you can still get great eggs Benedict
Old Navy isn't usually a place where I buy clothes for myself but it's great to pick up shorts and swim trunks for the toddler and the Ahwatukee store is by far the best because not only did they give me a price adjustment when everything went 30% off they still honored the $10 off coupon I had used when I made my original purchase which had expired by the time I had gotten the price adjustment
This is a great place to bring the family or a casual date
Good place to have a beer duck fart or whatever you may fancy
Good place to watch sports too- that's just not really my scene
Great place to grab a bite after your'e done hiking Pinnacle Peak
Great place great burger definitely better than Five Guys
I was sweating and it's just a great feeling of accomplishment when you get from place to place
I went to this place after seeing all the good reviews on yelp
Is it sexy you bet great location yep - the design is takes a page from all of the latest new places with stone steel and wood striving for an industrial yet comfortable feel
of Phoenix Stadium so I can only imagine this place on game day but any other time it is great for either business or pleasure
This review is based on ordering many things from the overall menu over a 1 year period however one item there deserves a 5 star rating which I will get toOverall most of the items are fairly americanized and not traditional which you expect from a fusion place - however most items are very average and for the price I do not feel you get good value here That being said the one item that does stand out here is their Shrimp Tom Yum Soup which i feel deserves 4 if not 5 stars - it is excellent and flavorful with a lot of shrimp - make sure to order a side of steamed rice with it medium hot and you will have a stand out dishIn general their soups are solid but the only thing I have not found better somewhere else is their Shrimp Tom Yum soupGo for the Tom Yum get your Vietnamese soup from Khai Hoan down the road a few miles
This place is billed as romantic but we didn't find anything romantic about the place
This little place is tucked into a small plaza and is never too busy however the service is always really great
Ambiance is good and on the surface you expect to have a better than average burger given the price and the upscale feel of the place
I finally decided that this place is the best of a bad situation
Though Kona Grill at the Fashion Square in Scottsdale was always my fav I considered Zen 32 to be the best sushi place in Phoenix -- great dim ambiance a big outdoor patio with misters for Happy hour and cute canoes on the ceilings
Great Reggae music and comfortable atmosphere
Great place to be only less than 2 weeks old
This is a place that I recommend to peeps when they want good mexican food and don't care about the looks of the place
Love love love this place - the only bad thing is they have 1 location -I drive all the way from N Scottsdale to downtown Phoenix for their fresh deli sandwiches
A great place to have a b-day party with friends they have huge screens at the end of each lane that were playing college football games when we went
Good place for lunch with a girlfriend but I feel the place is more gimmick than quality
Which I suppose is good for those who need a good study or work place but I almost felt like I was intruding barging in to place an order and talking on the phone while waiting
They have a great selection of gear bikes and accessories across all price points - If you are looking for a starter bike or just want to look at the lastest and greatest high end stuff- SMC is your place
I personally feel that all Hawaiian barbecue places are pretty much the same but I like this L&L because the service was really great
The noodles were good but not quite the quality as places I visited in California and Las Vegas
My dad decided just to get an appetizer sampler and I tried a stuffed mushroom and I will admit Olive Garden or not that was a pretty good stuffed mushroom
Plus Kendra Wilkinson of The Girls Next Door fame freakin' loves this place so it can't be that bad right
But it's a damn good place to go when you're moving cleaning out downsizing whatever
Good broth I like that they use cilantro and green onion which some places seem to skimp on -- just my preference to have more in there
The horchata was pretty good I've had the homemade stuff and nothing compares but not as good as the ones you can get from a Betos place
Looks like a great place to spend a Saturday or Sunday drinking beer and watching football
It's good when a restaurant takes you to another place and AB did that for me
The atmosphere is really romantic but fun at the same time I would be just as comfortable there on a date as I would be with some girlfriends
We have heard great things about this place and were very excited
This place is a great little place and you will feel at home
The place was packed with Spanish speaking people who know a good thing when they taste it
Phoenix AZ has the potential to be a great place
A couple of caveats really responses to the negative reviewers for those of you considering trying this place 1 - it is in Guadalupe so there are no frills here this is a casual mom and pop dive
I hope this place is around for a good long time
the korean family that runs this place is super sweet and has done a great job of providing quality sushi for a fantastic price
The Quiche is served with red skin potatoes that were a great thing in my mind as I had been missing the home fries that get served at all the great breakfast places in New England
The drinks wine is so bad you can expect to spend most your time 'later; in the bathroom with diareaha either from the cheap beverages they serve or the nasty germs they have in this place
The hot sauce in the bottle was also very good standard chili garlic Mexican oregano that you find at most places
You'll leave full from a great meal within a comforting atmosphere
Just had lunch there and as for being a major taco fan i have had betterLos Angeles Tacos still rule  but overall its pretty good compare to other places near by
Great place for a good lunch and awsome concept
I had read good things about this place so I decided to try it for my birthday dinner last night
A few indicators of a good yogurt place-Always packed-A variety of flavors that swtich out frequently-A family friendly environment
While the place was clean the bartendress friendly and a good selection to drink
Sometimes its like my dad always told me some people would complain if they got hung with a new rope Guns Plus is a great place to do business
A band was playing which made for a great atmosphere but was not at all too loud for conversation-- a definite plus
Great inexpensive food casual yet trendy atmosphere perfect location
A hip family-friendly easy-going place to get great food and beverages in a clean clever setting
As I would never have the patience nor diligence to come up with trying to make food without meat taste GOOD this place wins
This place is great if you are buying food for just yourself or you and one other
I think if other newer breakfast place are around longer they would start doing that and also end up with a good egg menu cluttered and full of items
Wildflower really is a fantastic place and I feel a bit bad giving them only 4 stars
All in all it really is a great place to go
This is a casual place but my dusty hiking clothing may be too casual for some of the patrons so sitting outside was nice
I went with a couple of friends on a Sat nite so the place was crowded with young good looking people
Life can be stressful and it is good to know that places like Aji Spa exist to quiet your mind and be pampered
I think this place is a great activity for kids of all ages but I think they should start to think about keeping up with the growing city and renovate the prime real estate they have with better equipment
It's the perfect place to take out of country or town guests that want to experience a little bit of the cowboy life but I think it would be great for children's birthday parties group functions and even those that just like cowboys and cookouts and all that jazz
There's no safe in the room so you'd better find a good place to hide your laptop
Considering the massive indoor mall is pretty much a dieing part of our culture Fashion Square is wonderful for what it is; a place to shop eat and catch a movie in a climate controlled environment although the theater here is pretty bad so I would recommend skipping the movie unless you're going to the small artsy theater just outside
Last time there were hints of bad service but this time we were there with friends we'd told about this place they didn't refill our water remove empty plates and the never brought over a 48 we ordered
The Hotel Valley Ho is a pretty sweet place to stay with a good location in Scottsdale I've been here a few times and really like it but it is not without a couple of quirks
Something about this place is so fantastic to me if I figure out how to explain it I'll update my review but with it's close proximity to all things Old Town and minute walk to the great Trader Vics I hope I have a chance to stay here again soon
Sonora Mesquite Grill is the solution to Arizona's bad rap sure we can produce ignorant rascist laws like SB-1070 but hey we also have places like Sonora Mesquite Grill
We spent our two hour wait on one of the many benches admiring the historic buildings looking at Chris' gardens watching kids play and generally enjoying the great weather
Great place for a quick affordable good meal
It would be a great bar kinda place but not for dine in
This is like a Fry's Marketplace infused with everything that is good and expensive at other gourmet grocers
I would never have noticed this place if a good friend hadn't shared her discovery with me
The atmosphere is casual colourful and relaxed
Everything tastes fresh the service is great the staff is friendly the bathrooms are clean it's fairly affordable and I just can't think of any reason to really knock this place
I was hoping to have a decent meal in a place with some history and instead I have a meal in the wrong restaurant that was on the bad side of mediocre
This place is pretty good and moderately priced
The place is often loud with a mix of good and bad music
I've had papusas all my life and I've been to a few great Salvadorean restaurants on the West Side but this Mesa place was not all that
You will find great southwestern atmosphere a beautiful patio good service pleasant outdoor service with great views of the mountains plenty of  good food for fussy eaters and lots of history
All the food was fresh; nice generous portion of green leaf lettuce good-as-can-be-expected tomato 2 slices and the waffle fries were in the exact correct place on the delicate Greasy-Crispy Spectrum
I was looking for something approaching good Indian food in the Phoenix area and must say I've found the place
The place was empty at the time Wednesday at 5PM so I was a little nervous but the food was really good
The staff is friendly although a few of them are difficult to understand and although the place is frequently packed the service is still pretty good
Boy do we know our coffee in the great northwest or what oh I know I haven't lived up there for 15 years and it takes a threat of physical force to get me to go back to the ranch these days but I still like to claim the place for something more than the rainAfter my run this morning I had to go pick up my mail and can anybody tell me why they moved my PO Box from the very convenient Osborne location to North Tempe
This place is that hole in the wall that you are surprised and delighted how good the food after your first mouthwatwering bite
Oh and if you are raising kids in the Glendale area I highly recommend this place as a great memory maker
This place hit the home run of bad restaurants
But Golden Wok just wants to be another bad Chinese place
Such a cute place with awesome food and service
There were a lot of good reviews so I went out the next day on a mission to try this place and review it too
I initially thought it was good but maybe not great when I first tried it but found myself going back and trying the pork instead of the beef and that is when I connected with this place
My husband who is vegetarian/vegan and I being Vietnamese thought this would be a great place to try during our visit to PHX this past weekend
It's a nice room the service is always good and the food is definitely a notch above most Vietnamese places
Comfy couches nice lighting great little patio overlooking a golf course suuuper friendly and attentive staff and a pretty good happy hour make this place awesome in my book
great place to enjoy conversation and a glass of fermented grapes
At some point my original bartender's shift ended and his replacement wasn't as great a little slow but that probably worked out in my favor anyway
We had a great time eating lunch in the really lovely place
Joe who owns the place chatted us up and was just great
I love a good burger and I recommend this place highly
I hate giving this place a bad review because the concept is so great
This is a great place to go after work for a few beers
This place is great for lunch with girlfriends after a day of shopping but equally as fitting for a Saturday night date
It also feels good to support  a place that gives much back to the community----from fresh roasted coffee beans to display space for local artists to music
They had a good selection of different foods a TV playing the basketball game that was big enough to see but placed in such a way that it didn't demand attention or take away from the dining
If you're in the area and desperate for Indian food or if your friends want to eat at the nearby Heart Attack Grill and you can't stomach the place this is a good standby restaurant
and I don't go out to farms and gardens much but the whole idea of having a restaurant with a garden and farm makes pretty good sense
It's probably a little too noisy to function as a study place for me since I need absolute quiet but I can see it being a great hang-out spot with friends
Not a good place to go for a drink after work
I travel to PHX for business and this is my place to unwind and have some great food
Other than that a great date place or a place to chill with co-workers
Exactly what you need small and intimate but good acoustics and atmosphere
Nestled in a strip mall this cute little place will leave you delighted and stuffed
This place used to be really good under it's old name
If you are travelling to this area and need a comfortable and clean place to sleep this is a satisfying option at a good price
So they replaced it and said it was good to go
This place has amazing pizza and great service
Did not have a bad thing to say about the place
Regardless want a great place without giving you any shit and keeping you drunk for less hit this place up
One of the waitress we had actually kept selling the place out telling us basically the food here is bad go somewhere else
a great little Irish dive bar that's been in place for 22 years
With mediocore food and bad ambience our experience wasn't all that good
Dining in the place is very clean the service good
Bottom line little value great looks eat pizza if you must frequent this place
The prcies are not too bad especially considering the atmosphere with a small gourmet pizza enough to feed one person and leave you full for around $10
Next time I will plan to stay longer and enjoy the great atmosphere over cocktails
The pizza is also pretty good but you can get better other places
There are always interesting and fun people here and it's a great place to meet someone new
It is a great place to hang out for hours or just get well crafted espresso drink and a pastry
The atmosphere is cute and I am more than sure that we are paying for where they are located
Great atmosphere great food and most importantly a moat around the front
Still a great place for people watching especially pre-post games and concerts but not really a food destination
I might end up buying some bottles because I thought they were so tasty- the staff knows their stuff- the caprese was great- it has a very laid back attitude when wineries and wine tasting usually exudes this air of elitism- would be cool to have a private party here which they do a lot of- tasting 5 wines for $10 is pretty awesomeCons- it is kinda weird to be the only people in the place no matter what day or time it is- i don't need to watch you put on rubber gloves and make my food you can do that in the back
the food was good not unlike food that you could obtain at scores of other places around town
Kona Grill has two different atmospheres Inside it is a classy yet casual relaxing place to have great food
Outside on the patio or in the bar it is a great place for socializing during their great happy hour
A great place to take the kids for an above average fast food meal heck if i was driving by and was hankering a burger in the middle of the day I certainly would be back
I will admit this place has always been bad with the wait time
If ambiance/atmosphere mean a great deal to you then you might as well stop reading this review & ignore the five stars
They also just call orders out as they're ready not necessarily in the order as they were placed so things can gets a little helter-skelter but in the end it's all good and the Chuck Box is as good as it gets
This place was a standard good sit-down mexican tucked in a cozy little historic downtown
1150am  My friend and I arrive good start nice artsy laid back ambience just to my liking1155am Seated and served our coffee and soda1200       I ordered The Cortez my friend one of the burgers1235pm Concerned about my flight back to San Jose departing just after 2pm we inquire about the status of our order
I just found this great new place to have a warm soup bowl in our cold AZ winter
I will be back as this is close to my office and it is a great new place in North Chandler
I love this place for many reasons and the food is great
To start Malee's atmosphere was not bad
I found this place completely by accident and it was great
I have been looking for a good NY style Chinese place since we moved here
This place is so good the rice is fantastic the food is very good
The place is pretty good but could use some consistency
I really wanted to like this place since it has such good reviews and nice happy hour prices
good place to stop for coffee if you're in the area
It was easy to find and a great little hide away place
YUM on food Great for service and Place is clean
Heck even Guy Fieri dishes out only good things to say about this place
I'd recommend the place for a good time with friends
I always leave this place feeling rejuvenated and healthy - you can FEEL this food is good for your body heart and mind
If you're looking for a pub-like restaurant that has good prices pretty tasty food with a good variety of items on the menu and excellent cocktails Keegan's is your place
While the gold-fit student section can get raucous and humorously nasty to visitors I know -- I used to drink 40ozs in there -- hey it was college *shrug* the donators alumni tee-shirt fans and casual observers make for an embarrassingly flat atmosphere
While visiting AZ we husband & I are typically on the look out for a good breakfast place
As a gluten free person I was extremely excited to hear that there was a place with good gluten free burgers
Highly recommended for the casual atmosphere fast service great food
Siamese Cat isn't as posh trendy or expensive as a lot of other Thai places but it's a great alternative to the crowds if you're looking for an exotic romantic weekend dinner
While there is another place close by that is just as good but not as central
The market place is pretty good I have only walked through it but saw they had some really good looking stuff to bring home or eat on the go
A vampiro at most places is the size of a good portioned tostada
The place has a casual relaxed atmosphere and the staff is friendly but it often seems to take forever for the food to arrive even when the restaurant isn't busy or crowded
Sometimes I worry their location doesn't give them enough justice to how great this little place is
Overall if you are in the mood for some fry bread this is a good place to get a quick fix
Good local brewery--nice to see a place like this in downtown Chandler
Like I said earlier I don't know whiskey but my friends who I was here with say this place has a very good selection and they enjoyed there cocktails as well
If you're looking for a place in Old Town that's a bit more laid back yet classy Old Town Whiskey is great spot
This place is still really new so they're still getting the kinks worked out but it looks great and the film selection is awesome
If you're being a hermit for the night and want reliable Chinese delivery then this place is as good as most and better than some
Honestly I liked it a little more before the smoking ban seemed to have more ambiance but it still is a good place for some cheap drinking
It takes a great deal of perspective and mental channeling to give this place even a neutral review
Good atmosphere cozy with just the right amount of  mood music
I can't get over the no-frills cafe-esque atmosphere with purely good veg head food
Great vibe - really small place so no wonder there is a wait
Not only does this place have great food and great service but they are caring people
They have a great atmosphere and the employees at this restaurant are top notch friendly and respectful
Maybe it's a great place to see a hardcore punk band but for something a little more subtle like Band of Horses there is no need to crank it up to the point where the sound is distorted
I was a little disappointed because I didn't expect a fast food place but the service was great and the food was very good
Googled best breakfast in Phoenix and this place  popped up saw Guy F's review from April this year and it was good so we gave it a try this morning
Service was warm and attentive atmosphere was nice and the place was cute
All in all this was a great place to stay and they offer discounts as well thru AAA etc
I SOOOO wanted to love this place as it is cute as a bug's ear
Friendly service cool atmosphere and really good food - and I definitely felt like we got our money's worth
Due to it's smaller size it's probably not a great place for a big group but if you have just a few people it's a fun place and you definitely you get your money's worth
I had time to go here for 30 minutes and it was $18 so the value was good as other places charge $20
As with any place I've had a few downers like bad service - but that's very rare
Overall I go back frequently both to satisfy the social needs of my daughter support Arcadia businesses and just because it's a good place that has stayed good
this place has good food good service and yes quaint if you like that grandma house thing w/lots of kitch
I love how relaxed but clean and modern this place feels
This is an easy place to get good traditional Mexican food for lunch
Love a good ol' brewery this place hits the spot
The place is really nice great ambience and the food is very good
I walked in here thinking this is another place that could serve dog shit but if they dress it up with a nice drinks good looking people and a Crate and Barrel catalog it will get 5 stars
Overall I would love to come back and would recommend this place to anyone who likes some good fried chicken
That said when a good friend wanted to try FNB I was good to go - but in my mind I was somewhat hesitant wondering if it was one of those places that had a rush of good reviews then service ambiance and quality would slide
There's nothing better than buying a great new book followed by a fresh cup of coffee in Wildflower's colorful atmosphere
The ONLY place at the lake but still a great choice
wow good thing i had my TUMS lol over all The atmosphere was amazing
If I could afford it I think I would book this place again just to have another great party that I could have time to actually enjoy
Modern Steak house is a great place for an upscale dinner
It's a great date place with a great atmosphere
I would go there again because they have happy hour prices for lunch score and in a pinch it isnt a bad place
The restaurant scores because of the amazing ambience  live music great atmosphere and crowd and the overall good experience me and my friends had
All the brightly lit walls filled with shiny black lacquer rows of my favorite beauty products -- makes me feel like nothing bad can happen in a place like this
Komen half marathon on this trail because the steep incline on the west side of the mountain is a great place to build endurance
Overall this is a great place to get outdoors and workout
The outdoor patios and gardens make this place feel as though it's your own back yard keep up the good work Aunt C's
The french fries I guess all Chinese buffets have them now were very good - I wish all places that serve fries served them this way
The beers coming in giant schooners the prices are good and they have a guy who places great sing-a-long acoustic guitar on a regular basis
This place is a joke and can't even make a good pie
This place is small and didn't have a good selection of beer or liquor
This place is great  there is a large distinction between their atmosphere
Or alternately makes a great place to do business or dare I say - meet a date
It's not my favorite thai place in town but for a quick filling lunch for under $10 this place is great
We wanted to get some drinks but we were unable to because the place was so crowded which is why I gave it two stars instead of one don't know how good the drinks may be
I live so damn close that it would have a waste of a cute place if it really sucked
Great place for an early lunch I go in at 9 or 10 am all the time
This is a great place for kids dates and friendly outings
This place has been around for over 50 years and it still preserves a cute retro vibe
I think if it weren't for the great prices and salad I'd give the place 3 stars but it's worth a trip for the salad alone
The place has been there for a long time and serves consistently good sushi
Luckily I had a sense of humor so when I ate it I said Man this is so disgusting that its good  All I am saying is if you like good cheap hole in the wall type food this place is not for you
I know this is a kid friendly place during the day but for goodness sakes make them behave
The changing colors on the bar were a bit funky but place has a good vibe
The ambience was great we sat outside under a tree with lights all over it
You have no idea how happy I was when this place opened - and turned out to be good
This place has great ambiance and a good staff
There are many tricks here  a great garden patio and a fancy mystique
It's not a bad place for a concert performance or a Yelp-event
The Dodge Theatre is one of my favorite places to see a show because you can sit almost anywhere and still have a great view of the stage
Its got a great vibe and atmosphere but could take some serious notes from the Filberto folks on the food
I rarely write reviews but I have now eaten at Italian Restaurant a few times and after reviewing some of the other Yelpers opinions I felt like I had to write this because this place is great and deserves kudos
Heck I'd never had Ethiopian before coming to AZ so I consider us lucky to have such great places to eat
I probably should have studied up a little more on this place before deciding 8 o clock on a friday as a good meeting time
I don't want to make it sound like you shouldn't go there everything about the place was a good experience except my main course
but the service is superb and it's a cute/quaint little place
Add in the great service and you have a solid pizza place for the south Scottsdale area
there is really no better place to get a meal especially a romantic on  this is the place
Perfect for fish and chips a Guinness and a great bar atmosphere
If you're looking for a place to hang that is casual and fun try Rula Bula
NOTE-- 5 stars for a hot dog joint not for The Four SeasonsIf you are jonesing for a good hot dog this is your place
Overall a great atmosphere great food and a great restaurant
Personally I think it's a great place to go for lazy day drinking on a Saturday afternoon
I would have never found this amazing place if it weren't for all the great reviews
Tempe Market Place  Anyway this gas station is pretty good
Honestly there were so many choices in each category and everything sounded so great that it took us about half an hour before we could place our order
We have so many great local businesses that there's just no reason to support a place like this
This place has great ambiance and a good fun festive vibe
I'm on a quest to try all the local island restaurants and heard that Ono was a great place to get Hawaiian
The replacement service is great for the times when you get a bad dvd usually a cracked on from the delivery and they've never let me down with price selection or service
I don't  know if it is possible to drain some of the noise out of this place but i am 24yrs old and enjoy a good party but his place is full of men trying to wear Christian Audigier and Affliction when they should be wearing diapers
We went with another set of queer folk and one thing I love about all these places is that there isn't any anti-gay rudeness that I've experienced in a good number of other places
Great place with reasonable prices given their generous portions
Our office is moving soon so I hope the new FedEx spot I end up going to is just as great as this place
The bar area is chic and a great place to grab a cocktail before heading out to a long night on the town in the extremely close Oldtown Scottsdale bar scene
But if you are wanting to try something unique and are looking for a nice place to get a cool meal I think Breadfruit is a great new lunch spot
This is the one and only place where you can get good coffee at the Anthem outlet center
CPK is a pretty standard place that you can go for for a good experience
I love breakfast places and have been to many great ones all over the USA but I think this is the best one I have visited
Black And Bleu Quesadilla - A+Blackened Fish Tacos - C Chips - A+Salsa - AI will be back to this spot for sure an all around great place for a good meal
This place is a good model for any restaurant owner/manager who is struggling with getting their troops to provide more than sub-par service
This place is super swank great for people watching and the food/service are top notch
I'd almost give the place 5 stars even if the food was crap just b/c Alberto is so darn cute
Later I casually told my friend about this place
sakana's is a great place also in Ahwatukee with a little livelier place
What can I say I like what I like and anywhere I can pick up a growler is a good place by me
There are very few places that come up in conversation where people unanimously start to try to yell over each other to say how good it is
They've always done a great job and the price is reasonable 30$/hour compared to other places in the area cheapest I've found is 28$ at other places with a coupon
I wouldn't mind trying some of their other dishes too but I think it is just to expensive of a place for a breakfast/casual food menu
Regardless Arizona Sunrays is a great place to bring your kids
I have no complaints about this place service was great food was good and happy hour prices were decent
The atmosphere is casual but classy at the same time
