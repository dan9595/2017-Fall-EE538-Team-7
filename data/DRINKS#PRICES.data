It's hard to get 4 drinks for that cheap let alone an appetizer and dinner for two
Even the beer selection was good they have a great selection of craft beers for a good price
To sum up - decent to good food for sports bar food attractive servers wearing skimpy outfits stiff drinks at reasonable prices and sports on big screen tvs
- Work on your wine listFor what you have its over priced
I do recommend for Happy Hour half off almost all all apps and drinks but don't you dare pay full price for anything here
Especially notable was the great wine list with non-criminal price markups
The size of the drink for the price was a bit disappointing as well
Anyway Taste of Top's has a really well-chosen selection of beer on tap and wine by the glass all reasonably priced and all connected to Tempe's friendliest funkiest best-stocked liquor store where you can ask for pretty much any bottle you'd like
We started out with the drink menu the mango drink with mint is very good and reasonably priced compared to everything on the menu
Drink prices are fair and the crowd is usually fun-going and casual
Their happy hour prices are quite nice and the bottled beer was frosty-cold
From 4-8 you can get 7 dollar cocktails and martinis that are very good for the money, although at normal price I would shy away from the drinks
Not only can you get half price drinks, from 4-6 you also can have all the prime rib sandwiches you can eat
not Irish grub to help you pack more cheap drinks in the belly
Great place to fill up on drinks and grub at a fairly reasonable price and if you think it's expensive - it's worth every last penny
Prices for drinks are pretty normal and the price for shows will vary depending on a scale of one to Bon Jovi
This place has a fantastic set of brews including various seasonals and cask-conditioned beers all at a good price
My only complaints would be the amount of time we waited to get our food/drinks it was pretty loud a bit too dark and the portions were fairly small for the price
Which includes $3 Domestic bottles $4 Premium bottles $4 Craft beer $4 Wells $5 Calls $2 off all glasses of wine and  1/2 price Kelly's cocktails so everyone should be covered with something they like to drink
Everything is over priced so don't be surprised when you pay $8 for a glass of their cheapest wine
- Beer is cheap in happy hour- Friendly staffCons- It's an American corporate chain restaurant so don't expect gourmet ingredients
Drinks in general were about standard prices
That and the half price wine makes it a steal on Tuesdays
Avg dinner price was $20 per person with no drinks
In an area of town that can get expensive this is a nice affordable place to visit for a bite to eat and a couple of drinks and while you are at it you can pick up some things you need at home on your way out
Happy hour pricing was fair with 1/2 price craft beers and some appetizers were on special but not the ones I desired
To my surprise it is a pretty cool neighborhood spot to get some drinks on the cheap the margaritas by Clay are great stiff but not too strong
Again drinks are way cheap and that helps a ton for a fridays night out or pre-drinking on a sat night to get the party started
The deals are good especially if you want to explore some new wine tastes at a reasonable by the glass price
The drinks are well priced about $3-5 for draft beer and margaritas
Yes the drinks are a few dollars more than usual but the food and movie price seemed about average to me
The drinks weren't very cheap but they were strong as I said
We shared a glass of the cheapest glass of wine on thelunch menu a sangiovese and it was quite serviceable for the price
The drinks prices are standard-high but then again its Scottsdale so you should know better but I still recommend this place rather than many of the nightclubs in the area because it has a rather big open seating/terrace where you can escape from sweaty men and armani exchange cologne and attempt to have a good time
Pizza is ok prices $35 for pizza drinks and tokens for 4
All of the items on the happy hour menu are very reasonably priced so you can get some good food and drinks
Great crowd great food and the best part- 1/2 price bottles of wine on Sunday
Excellent place to relax and have a beer if you are craving a sandwich salad or appetizer for a relatively low price
The drinks are also a little overpriced for how weak they make them
Drinks have always been crazy cheap and they have 2 for 1's
99 also house wines and draft beers which I don't remember their drinks being that cheap
There were other issues with her service like bringing out the other more expensive wine that I didn't ask for twice
Wines have been hit or miss for me but there's a few good beers and plenty of girly drinks at pretty standard prices
We chose the fixed price menu and a great bottle of wine
Overall it was pretty blah chain-like food that when coupled with drinks makes for an overpriced underwhelming experience
A great addition to Tempe Marketplace The Thirsty Lion provides a great atmosphere a wonderful selection of beers on tap and reasonable prices
Moderately priced it's well worth venturing in for a drink if it's cold outside
Seriously a GREAT deal because breakfast and drinks are pretty expensive elsewhere
The prices are slightly on the high side of reasonable more than I'd like to pay but I don't feel ripped of for a quality beer
We ordered cheese curds which were great for an app and a couple of cheap beers
The sake menu is slim and there are no inexpensive options; it is missing most of the reasonable favorites one is used to finding
All the prices really seem amped up a notch compared to the actual quality of the food/drink you're getting; I suppose you pay for the atmosphere
They also had a wonderful imported beer lane but I don't think it compares to the prices at Topps liquor
They had lots of local wines and 1 cocktail on the menu a Vespar affordably priced at $7
They have an EXCELLENT happy hour but their normal drink prices are incredibly reasonable as well
In additional to the great atmosphere delicious high-quality food great drink prices outstanding happy hour warm and attentive service they also have GREAT hours especially for an Asian restaurant
Still - it was good and thet drink prices at happy hour were excellent
The appetizers are cheap and plentiful and the drink specials really roll around to some good stuff

I've always loved YC's and appreciate that you can select your bowl size AND the price includes a drink
3 1/2I like the Buck Hunt super-sized hard core mixed drinks friendly bartenders cheapness backyard for smokers and with a big group of people you can pretty much take over this place
Drinks They have good prices and a good selection of Mexican and domestic beers
The only negative is that their wine prices are a little higher here but I have plenty of places to get my wine so no big deal
The drink prices are really good and the bartender got our drink order as soon as we sat down even though the entire bar was full we got the last 2 seats
And I especially don't need to hear you belittle a woman for ordering a particular wine and then how you up-sold her a bottle she didn't want that was more expensive and how you're so much cooler because you got her to buy a more expensive bottle than what she wanted
The wine list is good with reasonable prices no extreme markup
This is a cool place for brunch good service good selection and decent prices it's even close to Old Town go figure  I had the salmon flat bread pizza with creme freshe capers and arugula this was perfectly paired with a nice strong cup of coffee served in a clear plastic glass
I admit we should have never ordered it but after a glass of wine I forgot to check for prices
This place is a bit pricey compared to a lot of the other lunch options around the airpark but it's a nice place to go for lunch or drinks
There were soft drinks included in the price but alcohol was more
happy hour ends at 6 here so get in while you can so you can try some of their more expensive wines for only $5 a glass
For dinner I had a chicken parmesan hybrid which wasn't terrible but the sauce tasted a little bit like spaghetti-o's and there wasn't enough sauce to coat the pasta Drinks were also on the expensive side--$13 glasses of wine
We got an amazingly soft and awesome-looking huge rug there for a great price as well as lots of random glass vases plates crystal pieces and even Voss also at a good price compared to other places and it's my favourite water

Their food and drink prices are definitely lower than iPic but are comparable to YardHouse pricing

It's great that the 2 item requirement didn't mean you have to buy 2 drinks but everything on the menu was overpriced
The food was fantastic the drinks tasty/strong and the prices reasonable
The drinks were good and strong like I like and reasonably priced
Anyway I wouldn't refuse to come back to Majerle's before or after a game but I definitely wouldn't choose over 15-20 other places in a 5-mile radius that have great food cheaper drinks and friendlier service
Drinks are not cheap either so expect to spend $50+ for one night
The drinks were not very good for the priceWe did not have the food but judging by what I saw it looked like traditional bar fare
So be sure to ask which wines are at the HH price
We were there after happy hour and the drink prices were still pretty cheap
I was only there for a late afternoon lunch and enjoyed some great prices on wine by the glass and some half priced appetizers including skirt steak and calamari

I have to say the food is gross but the concerts are fun and the beer in the concert venue is cheaper than on the grounds but either way- no beer for me
I guess this place is a little pricey for college tastes as in not $2 a slice but a friend and I each had root beers on draft it's amazing shared a 10-in half-Hawaain-half-Thai scarfed the warm brownie sundae supreme which TOTALLY lives up to its name and had a $25 check
Maybe if I was a seasoned wine drinker who knew the labels I would like it more  but I think  AJ's carries enough of the stuff I adore and only slightly gouges the prices

The drinks were a little more expensive than most places
IT was after 10 I just had many cheap drinks near by so the apt name was in play

The drinks are expensive but I didn't think the food was
They have a fantastic offering of wines from all over the world and at very reasonable prices
Price wise they are ok but with a drink I was up about $12 each time which is at the high end of what I consider fast food
Went here for happy hour which is 7 days a week btwAll speciality drinks and appetizers were half price
My favorites here are $5 frozen long island iced teas for a drink not sure if that's happy hour price as we usually go around 7-8pm
They also have unbeatable prices across the board on wine & liquor I can find a lot of my favorite higher end brands cheaper here than BevMo or elsewhere
Our two bartenders weren't on the same page I ordered a round of drinks and the next round was a completely different price
Yes it is pricey but no more so than going out to dinner and drinks with the girls
So it's definitely worth ordering a pitcher when you compare the price of a pitcher versus the price of an individual glass
Pitchers of beer were cheap and they had a ton of tv's all over the place
we sat outside enjoyed a couple of beers and some very reasonably priced sushi
Also their weekend rates are pretty pricey - I can't blame them since the market bears the price but three games can cost almost $20 per person with shoes which means a family of four will walk out  spending almost $100 if you get some food and drinks
The drinks are pricey unless you go to happy hour
Sure they're both big box liquor stores but if you prefer a less fluorescent and industrial place to purchase your spirits with low prices and huge selection choose Total Wine

I like their iced tea and I like that they make a chilled espresso drink that you can pour yourself for the same price as a soda

What keeps me coming back to the 'Dillo is the perfect blend of- Delicious food drink or no drink- Reasonable drink prices- Servers who go out of their way to learn about their customers Yes 2PM on a Monday can be depressing
It does not get five stars for two main shortcomings- Wine list pretentious and overpriced and the wine by the glass is more by the half glass- Service we got our mains while we were hardly 1/2 way our shared starter
They have some wicked happy hour specials on wings and other greasy snacks and even regular priced pitchers of beer aren't bad
This is cheap tequila but so is the drink

Typical drinks and beer are provided which seem to be reasonably priced
Drinks are obviously over priced and all over the place depending on which bro or babe is making it but you can't be picky because it can take a few to get one of their attention
the reason I knocked it down 1 star is because 1 it's very much a family restaurant which means it's inevitably loud and 2  although they have great cocktails like spiked strawberry lemonade the drinks are kinda pricey considering the lack of sufficient booze to drown out the loudness of the surroundings
And it wasn't terribly expensive because we didn't order drinks
I have sampled a few of their specialties on the drink menu and they are all quite good even if they are way overpriced
Not too pricey as I think for 2 drinks and a sammich it came to about $30 total
The poblano creamed corn was the highlight of my meal and I would have been a happy camper with a large bowl of it but the $80 price tag for enchiladas salmon chips & salsa oily penne and 3 non-alcoholic drinks plus the tax & tip was a little too much for our liking
Also beware although the childrens' menu says drinks included in the entree price of $6
Quick friendly service good food and drinks good prices
Maybe a giraffe ok the banana bread is good but that's it their drinks are over priced

Overall 3 stars because the food is nothing special and the drink prices are high
Check it while I break it down two whole new rows of fake meat to try killer fresh produce sushi to go that is actually tasty cheap juices to try mocha chocolate sandwiches cat food good red wine delish cheap soy yogurt with real fruit vegan granola my favourite shampoo and conditioner pineapple empanadas cheap soy milk feminine products 55 cents dark chocolate no preservatives or additives and frozen raspberries and Spanish quick race that kicked TJs ass

The sushi price is a tad high if you order exotic items which is why i only come during happy hoursTheir happy hour is awesome an array of appetizers/drinks/rolls for 50% of the regular menu price
Do not waste your money here because of half price apps and drinks
I won't waste your or my time with obtuse banter so here is the rundown - Atmosphere typical black and red Japanese decor - Bathrooms cool stone sinks that drip and slosh water on your feet so be aware - Sashimi overpriced so-so quality served in a glass bowl over ice - Rolls underwhelming - Calipico soda fabulous - Deserts yummy but small - Birthday celebrations abundant and noisy with little tambourines that lit up
Ok good service nice atmosphere good food excellent sake not priceless
Draft beer prices are amazing and the service was good
the duck tidbits were dry and unexciting the asian ribs were a nice portion and decent the best tasting app was the burger spicy toped w/slaw  and a $11 hearts of iceberg salad off the reg menu a few $11 martinis which for the price could have been a little more of a generous pour and one fruity cocktail for the wife and bam a $70 dollar bill

The building is beautiful the parking lot is full of expensive cars and the place is full of beautiful people eating drinking and playing bocce ball

I much prefer the Happy Hour at Montana Avenue with the half-priced bottles of wine
Somewhat because we eat and drink a lot and somewhat because they have incredibly inflated prices

all getting their drink on with cheap margarita's and cheaper cerveza It's a tried and true formula for the transition from drone infested uptight I know a word right out of the 60's work-a-day world to a somewhat more relaxed slightly or heavily inebriated night-time world
They carry a decent selection of wines - having sampled quite a few I've decided that the least expensive ones taste best
Wednesday night they have a steak night with drink specials and a reduced price steak dinner
For the small prices to get soup or salad a drink bread dinner and a scoop or spumoni what more can you ask for
So anyway - in spite of this place having great wine selections at reasonable prices considering the cost of the food great pretzel bread the illusion of great service and good food when they allow you to order it I won't be going back
I would have given it 3 stars if it wasn't for the cheap alcoholic drinks and the reasonable pricing

Cheap alcohol with plenty of beers on tap
Complementing the food is a well-thought out wine list and at very reasonable prices

On the other hand it gets really crowded if you don't get there by 1130 am or arrive after 1245 pm; the parking lot is super small so you typically have to park at First Watch; there is a sign that drink refills are for the large size only I have ignored that sign as I find it ridiculous that they could actually monitor who refills and doesn't; it gets very very noisy so it is hard to hear the people sitting at your own table; and I think the price is a bit high for a sandwich shop about $9 for an 8 inch sandwich chips and a regular soda which apparently I can't refill
Regardless of that though it's a good place to have a nice dim-lit dinner with reasonably priced bottles of wine
The drink prices were high for the quality and the size

Yes the martinis were small my husband had the special Hanny's martini with vodka and gin and I had a French martini but they were mixed well and at only $5 my husband's was well priced for the size
For what I had I found it disappointing and at $11+ a drink tax and tip it's not cheap enough to be worth it
I normally frequent RA Sushi but I could no longer deal with the over packed over priced food and drinks
Also they have a great wine list = Since they have recreated their menu the prices are excellent too nothing was over $30 and the average price is $15-$20
Additionally 9and not in your case since our drinks were priced for happy hour my money that pays for inflated bar and food prices should cover me for FREE PARKING and not to have to pay or even tip some juvenile dipshit whom I wouldnt let drive my car if he was my own relative
the drinks are still cheap the bartenders are still nice and the place is still a hole inside but it's just not as fun as it used to be

Everything here is just too expensive for a sports bar and I can't recall but they either completely lack draft beer or are damn close

They have good prices on glasses of wine and beer as well - that being said we always return to the orange slice
The wines are all South American and we did a tasting of 3 chards which were all inexpensive and surprisingly good
They also have some good wine options at very reasonable prices
They also no longer have prices posted so more than once I have been surprised by ordering a premium beer when no indication of this was given on the menu

Prices are reasonable you're going to be out around $10 for a plate of food drink and left overs
There's nothing to be said of this place that another yelper hasn't already said more intelligently except for this  I leaned my bike up against a shelf my tire slipped and bumped into said shelf knocking an expensive free-trade no-war-orphans-were-maimed-or-blood-spilled to deliver you this glass type thing and it shattered on the ground
Wine is also inexpensive if the mood strikes
I'm a casual girl from the NW so if you're looking for a casual locale cheap but good tacos homemade smoothies and a beer head over to Two Hippies
Stick to the Chymist for happpy hour - where you will get half price apps and a drink for the attitude
Pros-nice ambiance-friendly service-nice menu options-fair prices-hot sauces on tables are awesomeCons-carne asada is smoked with mesquite I think and tastes likes it's been covered in bbq sauce-not the biggest fan of the chicharron de queso husband liked it though-service was a little slow they set themselves up for failure on this by giving you tiny ass water glasses-coke is served by the can for $1
The wines-by-the-glass list was definitely over-edited IMHO and quite pricey for what they were offering

The price includes a drink rice soup and some different toppings they have available after your stuff is cooked
They also have stiff drinks in large amounts at reasonable prices great food and good enough service considering how busy they always are
I didn't drink at the place took care of that before and after so I can't comment on drink prices
On a positive note they do offer half priced bottles of wine on Mondays but overall this is just an average pizza restaurant
but we ordered a TON of food and a TON of drinks well they did not me Its a great first date or special occasion type of place a little pricey for an every day dinner kind of night
I like the idea of every bottle is only $125 for service there is no drink over the price of $8 and that you have great people that work for you
I'd also be careful of their wine list - very high and not as good a list of wines as the prices would suggest Souverain Sauvignon Blanc retails for $14-16 per bottle FGS
if you want a pricey beer that you can find anywhere and an unimaginative menu doused in napa slaw this is the spot
I also think they could add a couple more micro brews into their beer selection and considering they don't have happy hour it isn't cheap to go for a round of beers and some wings
+1 cheap drinks+1 for peanuts-2 for half-assed and rude service

It's a comfortable place with a nice shaded patio and cheap beer
Beer prices were $1 off so that's a good sign
Their drinks looked pretty cheap and I wouldn't feel so bad about the wings if I'm paying half price and drunk
Adding a drink - not your obligatory diet Coke but a REAL drink - and tax AND tip pushes the price easily into a 3-dollar sign tier
This could be a really cool place if the owner paid a little attention to his business lowered the prices a bit it's on the high side for a beer and burgers place and greatly improved their service
