The place was almost full - always a good sign and a very friendly waiter seated us and took our drink orders
We found it best to go when they are having their special 1 pizza 2 drinks and a salad for $20 and it is a really good deal
It's a good time when you're able to bring your favorite wines with you to dine and not pay the restaurant's prices
Their food and drink pricing is very reasonable considering the quality and taste
Just for a glass of wine and a shared dessert - Bread Pudding delicious
The beer selection is not the finest picks but a good average English medley
It is a great local cafe where you can get basic eats today I had an egg and cheese croissant and good drinks at a fair price
One thing I was hoping for on the wonderful drink station was the red cream soda you have at the BBQ rest
Plus the Chilly glass looks amazing all lit up
Ruben made stiff but flavorful cocktails and kept coming to our table and refilling our drink orders
4 bucks for two large slices and a drink is worthy of a lunch stop
The seabass was good but the mushrooms in the sake soy sauce made the dish even better
Suite 301 combines my desire for nice crowds good drinks atmosphere and friendly staff
After several drinks which I recommend go out on the patio and gaze at the city below
I never mind the food prices and accept that wine is pricy but like any other restaurant the prices creep closer to retail as you go up in quality and price
The beer selection is top notch the sandwiches are worth the prices the cheesecake really shouldn't be drowned in chocolate syrup but who cares it really is a nice people watch place
It has reliable service and sandwiches hipsters and good beer
They're coffee and drinks are pretty delicious too
It's a funky artsy place with healthy food that tastes good and a huge selection of food and drink
The horchata was very good but around halfway through it became nearly impossible to drink through the straw because of the fruit and nuts
Quality local sports bar with decent food reasonable drink prices $2
On the plus side they do have a decent selection of good looking pre-made dishes and some different wines breads olive oils etc
overall it's a nice little place with good drinks and toast strange i know  oh and my little sister loves this place I am not allowed to go there without her she is 8 so i'm assuming all the kiddies love this
The staff are incredible the architecture and layout is amazing and then the food and drinks
Highly recommended especially for First Friday- the artists selling their works jewelry handmade goods purses sunglasses and more are lined up down the street near the Lost Leaf and you can walk a short distance to galleries and the AZ Center great place to park if you don't get downtown early
- Seating It's not a large space but I always manage to find a seat - Beer selection is awesome- Good lighting/atmosphereThe bad- You can't take your beer outside on the porch/outdoor area- Hipsters please kill yourself- Staff please read above statement be nice to people even if we aren't artists/emo/punk/goth
In summary  I'm sure I'll be there a lot because the beer is good and it's close to my house
What Panne Bianco gets right is -quick polite but personalized service-a great short menu with no surprises-great to go options-big portions when a sandwich and a drink cost $12 it better be good-close to my work wishing they would move into my work's cafe space-its right by lux-its food that any single person could make at home with a sandwich press but doesn't b/c high quality bread and the like go bad too soonthe somewhat bad-wierd hours and parkingkinda high pricesno place to sit and wait
frozen vegetables in a balsamic butter sauce the white corn is mmmmmm edamame shelled pomegranate seeds nuts wasabi peas fruit leather wines some really good ones for just $3
Found D'lish on Yelp and ended up going there both days because the Breakfast Buzz drink was out of this world good
What I do like about DukesCheap drinksBloody Mary barA billion TVsShuffle BoardThe layout and big spaceFree Wi-Fi No I did not take my laptop but for those fantasy football players that must have their scores immediately it seemed like a good thingAll in all a good place to watch the game whoever youre cheering for
worth a try if you're strapped for cash and need to get your drink on
10 minutes later she came back and we ordered our drinks and appetizers
Not that the drinks were THAT cheap - but they were good
While enjoying one of their amazing drinks the thought comes to mind this is what coffee is supposed to taste like
They just have so many wonderful things that I want to eat and drink and play with seriously every visit here is like a brand new adventure
Amazing selection of beers that i have never heard of with in my opinion the best music section in scottsdale
The fondue was delicious redolent of wine and Kirsch
PGC has a small selection of wines but their flavored teas are so out of this world that I could float away on them
its nice with alot of good wines on the list
I heard through Facebook of the excellent food and great selection of beers gotta tell you we were not disappointed the food was soooo good that several members of our party requested to meet the chef our waiter went to the kitchen and soon we were speaking with chef Diego what a true professional who took the time to explain the dishes and their origins
We started with cocktails and our server recommended a drink not listed on the menu; a cherry lemon drop
Everything from the ambiance food happy hour beer and even cake pops were simply amazing
Generous portions of juicy tender flavorful chicken piled in one corner of a styrofoam take out tray partnered with loads of rice flavors vary for example rice and beans or pumpkin rice and your choice of plantains or my choice steamed cabbage for about $10 with a drink
I walked down there today and got a wonderfully delicious sandwich on their fresh 9-grain bread along with chips and a drink for under $8
Online I learned they had a good looking happy hour with comfort type food and reasonable drinks - score
Good Mexican beer selection and margaritas which is my main reason for visiting
While waiting for my lunch I can never resist their outstanding macarons I prefer the chocolate but both are delicious cakes and cookies go for the chocolate truffle displayed so innocently behind the glass case where you order
The staff is entertaining & fun the drinks are awesome the food is fun & delicious
For one drink 2 refills good service with Fajitas I escaped for around $18
Great music and excellent service make this a place worth checking out for a few of their cheap drinks
He recommended a bottle of wine that would suit both a meat-focused entree lasagna as well as a fish dish
The Reuben is a must for the first-timer spot-on and delicious with every bite best enjoyed with a locally brewed on-tap root beer
Samples of both the root beer cream soda orange cream soda and apple cider are available and all very good
1 Appetizer 4 meals 1 Dessert and 2 rounds of drinks cost around $250 so prepare for about ~$60/pp or maybe $40pp w/o drinks appetizer and dessert
Olive oil to die for with the bread amazing wine selection mouth watering food
Good drink specials on beer wine and cocktails
I was even more impressed with the menu/drink samplings and restaurant choices this go around
The price point at Total wine is absolutely amazing
With phenomenal wines on the menu dishes filled with a melange of delicious flavors and fresh ingredients and their bread is some of the best I've ever had
everytime i have been here i see something worthwilea fight between two hobos on the way there punk bands from denver too drunk to properly play vampish girlies that'll steal your soul at pool with a sly wink and kids smokin chiba from a beer can in the back alley
You won't find the million varieties of crazy drinks they now do in many coffeehouses but  you will find excellent drinks done by people who are serious about what they are doing
4 people 3 bottles of wine 3 appetizers 4 happy hours plates and all less than $100
Would it be worth the money after 630 pm when bottles of wine are not half off
Like I said before the duck taco I had was pretty good and I hear good things about the BeerRita
Other friend ordered some fruity tart type flavored white wine
We were totally indecisive and she recommended wines and entrees and never rushed us as we looked over the menu
Good wine but for a wine bar a little sparing
We went ahead and ordered wine and appetizers which it took the waiter quite some time to figure out that we may have wanted to order some apps before the last two arrived
The food was so ridiculous good that we actually forgot to drink
From the local draft beers to the great menu and original entrees to ending with flavored cotton candy it has never disappointed
Service has plenty of room for improvement;  Warmer staff will definitely help this manner; I do understand a few minutes of wait before getting seated but every time has been at least 15-25minutes which  becomes very slightly annoying at times but it will give you an excellent opportunity to have a drink or two at the bar and try one or couple of their Mojitos which are excellent while waiting;Staff members  are very knowledgable
not The Predator what he recommended from the tiki style Friday night $3 drink specials
They make excellent coffee drinks from Ron Cortez-roasted beans and all of their tea and pastries are from local businesses as well
To summarize atmosphere is a 5 cleanliness 5 food/wine 4 service 3/4 and yes I would recommend this place to others
Make sure to check out the crazy good berry-citric-weed beer too and keep the secret to yourself
Drinks were good and the service prompt and friendly
but their alcoholic drinks were very delicious
I forget what I had but it was very tasty and very strong although I didn't notice how strong it was while I was drinking it
The wine I chose was delicious - a blend they're usually better
Wine salad and entree for me was $30- excellent value for service and experience
The drinks are good I like their sweet concoctions especiallly
The drinks were amazing drip coffee that wasn't so acidic that you suffer heartburn and had a deep rich flavour that blew most restaurant coffee out of the water
The Dj usually plays a good mix but depends who's there and if there having an off night but if you want a good time strong drinks and just a packed atmosphere
He is also pretty good to look at  I'm just getting into wine and he has been a fabulous guide and always gives great suggestions
Great place to socialize eat good food and drink tasty beer
We tried a few of the beers and were very impressed with them
The drinks were good and pretty cheap
Food and drinks arrived quickly and were good
For a place that is primarily a coffee/beverage spot with some good food allowing people to sit and drink free drinks all day would be a bad business decision
The service was great I always had something to drink and the food has always been tasty
It's worth a trip just to hang out in their decked out patio area if only to have some drinks
Lee Lee carries a wide variety of Asian beers of course plus some good sakes and plum wines
it is also is in a historic building that has a lot of theme nights good drink specials and sometimes has indie concerts
it had awesome music stella and vodka drink specials and really good sound and lighting
I would imagine that one of these pizzas and a good glass of wine which they have a large selection of would make for a nice evening of food wine and conversation
The music was spot on if predictable the drinks were affordable and potent $5/beer in AZ is spot-on and everyone there was looking good
[Value 3 stars Food Flavors Service and Ambiance 4+ stars]I have been here several times for drinks but last night was my first night for food
We also split a couple of different rolls that were HUGE each one of them were delicious although a little too 'American-ized for my tastes  I would definatley come back here for drinks or as a date night if you go early
The server asked what kind of wine I liked and then brought me a taste of their white blend which I enjoyed
Everything was very good ambiance was nice and romantic and the wine selection is phenomenal
A girl walks over with the 3 menus they have sushi appetizers and drink menus
baconized goodness in a tall glass of awesomeness no lies
But $7 for one small glass is not really a good deal
But overall I thought this place had good food but the price was a little pricey for me come on' sandwiches and appetizers with 2 glasses of wine for 2 people costing nearly $50
I am not usually one for frozen drinks but this was wonderful - like frozen raspberry lemonade with a great kick
95 for the large glass of chocolate milk for my son and good size cup of hot chocolate for my daughter
So the sushi is half off plus the house drinks and all the flavor infused sake is too
Wonderful adults only pool with great refreshing food and drinks
And we both enjoyed our drinks all for a total of about $20
The beer selection is good not great but they rotate drafts quite often which is nice
It's a little tucked away but very low key and friendly and plain old good beer and good pizza
Every time I go there's at least one person with a bitter beer face & I just assume they are generally unhappy people because the show is good
I love the wine being on tap it's eco-delicious
Customer service is great reasonable prices excellent deals on domestic beers and if you get their loyalty card you get even better deals
So the 5 wine tasting and an appetizer for two
Yes yes there are those of you who will TSK-TSK and tell me that's what I get for drinking decaf but in the year 2011 believe it or not strongly flavorful decaf can be had
Unfortunately the beer was REALLY lacking in flavor
It's probably not a good sign that they describe most of their beers as lightly hopped with a smooth finish
wine not good solo but good paired with pork
It was about 9 dollars a heads with a drink which is fair for what you get in quality
The wine prices are good and they have a nice selection of beers as well if wine isn't your thing
They also have a wine club that is well worth the money
if you can afford the hefty price tag dinner for three with three appetizers was and a couple beers = $220 would have been slightly less if we were not charged for the waiters mixup
They have some pretty good coffee drinks and the place just has a cool vibe
The $20 bruschetta board and bottle of wine deal is too good to pass up even though I think the bruschetta here isn't that great
Some of their own brews the orange blossom and coco joe are some of the most delicious and unique beers I have ever tasted
The wine list smart the appetizers tasty salads luscious deserts to die for the location is adorable and of course the pizza is perfect
the wines were reasonable waitstaff attentive food was good
They offer deals on drinks sushi and appetizers
Anyway loads of good points - decent beer selection for the freshman beer snob and there are even some good surprises such as the Leffe and Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA
Lots of unique drinks on the menu recommended for quieter times
If Postino is your quintessential laid back Southwestern wine bar then Cheuvront is the quintessential urban wine bar - sleek hip modern fantastic wine list delicious cheeses great food and a nice variety amazing desserts and friendly staff
The bartender Jeff is truly outstanding - incredibly friendly knowledgeable about the wines and cheeses but not in a snobby way and a good conversationalist never a how's the weather today
You will likely be introduced to one or more delicious and inexpensive wines you never would have otherwise known about and they give you the opportunity at the end of the tasting to purchase the bottles at a reduced price
The pale lager seems to be suited for the Miller crowd but for those who appreciate craft beer the other offerings are worth seeking out
They offer $3 large beers on tap including some super good beers like Alaskan Amber
They're worth a visit just for their beer specials
The beer is cheap good specials and the pineapple bacon pizza looked very tasty
My husband had the beer sampler and enjoyed most of the varieties the Raj IPA was his favorite the 8th Street Ale and Kiltlifter are the more popular ones
Had 2 very good drinks and they were comped because our table still wasnt ready on time
Food is delicious awesome beers and cocktails and great service
that really sucks because I think they have the foundation for a restaurant I would adore and go out of my way to go to and want to support - extensive beer selection great ambiance perfect location local ownership - Please Carly's can I petition for some better quality/more adventurous food options
I always end up drinking a little more than I planned because they're so delicious and that leads to me splurging on appetizers
All of their beers are worth trying since they brew them there you're not going to get them anywhere outside of AZ as far as I'm aware
Short version good food good beer one-of-a-kind establishment go now
The beer here was good authentic German beer
I was also impressed by their beers on tap - they even had one that was made in house that we really liked
TL;DR 5 stars for the excellent customer service comped craft beer and extremely cheesy pizzas
Bartenders make good drinks  or you can go for the PBR of course and the prices are better
They are beer battered like fish which could be good but the execution on this was terrible
There was a full bar with a good selection of beer & other malt beverages bottled & on tap and mixed drinks
Drinks were good I had a blood orange margarita and wifey had the pomegranite mojito
I wish I could have two different ratings one for beer and the other for good
If you are not into really good beer then don't bother with this place
Drinks- JR's Ripper and the Corpse Reviver #2 Both good
For drinks I prefer the classic Mai Tai but the Longboard beers on draft are good too and friends swear by the Tiki Bastard and Pink Martini
What good are $3 appetizers if I am paying $9 for a glass of wine
The wine and sake pairing was excellent and very generously poured
So we got there early enjoyed a drink around the corner at my fave bar - Merc
1/2 price wine + good company + live music - who could ask for more
but whenever I go to the Vig I always go back to wine so I can't comment on the mixed drinks food is decent but what doesn't taste good when your starving and drinking
From Susan nudging me to get the bigger glass of beer good call and it was an easy nudge to all three of them checking in on me as I was devouring the 2
This most recent time beverages took forever the server didn't know how to properly open a bottle of wine thank goodness this one server whom I've seen bust his butt a couple times before helped us out and I got a spotted glass that I ended up polishing myself
figured i'd get some good beer and brats
He made a great cocktail with sweet tea vodka very summery not too sweet and recommended a great wine for dinner
During our trip we enjoyed all parts of the restaurant-the dining area retro modern and industrial; great to overlook the outside patio--the bar area awesome lighting and display case of tiki tchotchkes also in view of awesome hexagonal window thing--the outside patio awesome rock fire pit for sitting and drinking bySo that's just the rad decor
I also passed a lovely area by the pool with a hammock I am tempted to sneak in and send a couple hours there with a good book and umbrella drink
The potato salad was pretty good and the drinks were poured well
The wine list is very good and the food is outstanding
To drink everyone else had different wines which they enjoyed but I had a glass of sangria
The are friendly relatively fast priced for the beer budget and quite tasty indeed
The hot dog thanks to its luscious pork belly wrapping stood up well to the strong flavored beer which it seems I did not based on how I felt the next morning
cucumber gin drink was pretty strong but not necessarily tasty
Fun unique selection of delicious food that you'll find nowhere else in town great selection of cold beers cozy dark atmosphere friendly staff
There wasn't much on tap but the Four Peaks brew that I was drinking was tasty
Honestly I didn't get a good look at the menu food or drink but since this place is still in the process of opening everything is still a work in progess
My sister and her fiancu00e9 thoroughly enjoyed the wine selections
but they actually had two pair in good shape - we tried to hunt down the missing one in a Berkeley Goodwill forever and never did find it and groovy martini glasses for $1
In this area DUI's are more common than a cold and it's a light and tasty wine with a low alcohol content
One more thing when I was reading some reviews about this place being expensive I wanted to laugh it's very reasonably priced good quality beer comes at a price
The drinks are always good and the service is always friendly and attentive
Maybe it's unfair to expect so much from them all the time but it's billed as a special place and with appetizers entrees wine and dessert you're easily over a hundred bucks a head before tax and tip
A gathering of folks to eat some yummy food drink a good martini or beer and support Packages from Home a worthy charity that sends packages to our men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan
The drink was good but the service and quantity in the cup was a totally disappointment
Service is always friendly and prompt water glasses always refilled happy hour specials are a great deal large and tasty
For the money $30 for a pizza three drinks and tip I could have had much better service and equally as good pizza at NYPD or Bell Italia
There are a few good bars particularly the one with the Western Theme in one of the domestic terminals that offers a free shot with your beer which is something out of the ordinary
I love your wine list - lots of great choices some good beers too good happy hour and reverse happy hour specials and 1/2-off bottles of wine on Sundays/Mondays
I hate how you treat me sometimes - you barely greet me when I sit down you make me wait for my delicious drinks and you forget what I ordered
I thought to myself self a lite snack and a drink while reading my ebook chillen at a cool table sounds good so self said lets look
Their happy hour = 1/2 off most appetizers and I believe drink specials too
In response to a recent thread about Boba drinks in CenPho I said that Rainbow served at least 1 flavor- chai- which my husband found to be just ok
My cousin really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere here and I'd have given this review another 4 stars if it weren't for the fact that our bartender gave us such an attitude when I asked to sample the two wines first before ordering
Recalling this plus the wine and salad/hummus incidents I may just have to say goodbye to O&I for a long long time
they have pretty good drink specials during the week
I'm simple so give me good food beer service and music and I'm pretty happy
We got our food drinks and check within a good time frame and she was happy enough
Pros Delicious beer choices good food as far as I tried Cons Bathroom was kind of gas station-esque  and while the food I tried was good there was a dreadfully small food menu
'  I was impressed to see not only a variety of coffee and tea drinks but other frozen drinks and even an option to add protein as well
we sat down at the lounge/bar area and each ordered a drink and a couple appetizers
And if you like beer they've got a pretty good selection even sporting a Hoegaarden on tap a personal favorite
They also have some decent drink and appetizer specials if you are interested
What a shame that the good food and drink and nice ambience of the place has been ruined by an incompetent staff
The wine list is extensive and offers lots of Arizona wines that are just too good to all have in one sitting unless you're into that
Overall this is a place for a quick happy hour drink and delicious $3 taco or a nice light lunch
Staff was great drinks were great outside patio had an amazing view crab cake and oysters were amazing ribeye & Mac & cheese were delicious however we ordered sautu00e9ed spinach which had no explanation of how it was sautu00e9ed & when we received it
The house red wine was good and generously poured
I ordered the peach sangria on the recommendation of a friend but found it to be too wine-y for me
Wow what a burning sensation at first drink but man it was good
They have a very good wine list that will compliment your meal very well
Flavor suggestionsRed Bull and Vodka - this is a popular drink in the bars I frequent and I think it would make a great ice cream flavor as well
My friend recommended La Bocca because apparently she used to frequent this establishment for happy hour quite frequently for their half off wine by glass
The few other times I have been to Switch was with alcohol and their mixed drinks are really good
There was a pomegranate and vodka drink that I recall being very original and tasty
Saying goodbye to carbs for the next 3 months as she starts serving up swill with hefty amounts of god forsaken vegetables and no carbs
The drink list is plenty and there are delicious things to eat while you are at it
The waitress did a good job keeping my tall glass of tea filled
The restaurant also had a weekday happy hour which we took advantage of twice during our stay with $3 drinks and $5 appetizers that were delicious
The pool bar also had some great specials on drinks; $15 buckets of beer 4 Peaks and PBR $6 fruity cocktails and some appetizer specials
I have tried many things there their fish tacos their carne asada tacos and I have to say the carne asada tacos arent the best the meat tends to have a sweet taste-like flavor that isn't really appropriate for Mexican food but their tortas were to die for as well as their Paloma drinks delicious
we would like to check the place out again for some beers and pretzels which smelled amazing
They have a nice selection of sandwiches not just banh mi and other assorted goodies plus a bevy of drinks to quench your thirst
We went during happy hour with a group of 7 and even though nobody was drinking alcohol we recieved excellent and fast service
Their happy hour is fantastic; they have really affordable appetizer and sushi rolls from 3-6 as well as drink specials obviously
Sure enough within minutes he and his team cleared off a neighboring table and pushed it together with one of ours so we could all sit together and enjoy our delicious food and drinks
BUTIf you are a *new* bartender don't upsell me a handmade margarita with Cuervo instead of your house concoction that comes out of a tap  use the small side of the jigger to pour said tequila into one of those ridiculous tiny cactus margarita glasses haphazardly salted expect me to pay $6 for tiny little glass and crappy pour and somehow appreciate that you have any understanding of what it means to make a good margarita - you know one where the orange from the triple sec lightly dances with the tequila flavors rising above the  sweet and sour and the tang of fresh lime juice - especially when you still haven't given me a menu and are now serving jiggerless poured Crown and diets and Jack and diets to your 21 and a half-year old friends who are leaning all over the bar with slithering arrogance and no sense of personal space yes I can smell your drugstore perfume and no it doesn't make you pretty
Drinks never refilled waited 15-20 minutes AFTER we already finished our appetizers for the server to take our order for dinner
We also enjoyed the Kobe Flap steak with wine reduction and tiny marble size multi color potatoes and tasty spinach
KILLER dessert and wonderful selection of draft beer
They also have really helpful staff that will help you pick out affordable good wines
BBQ and sushi  they have a BBQ everyday for lunch and it sometimes has really good deals -- like a chicken sandwich a side and a huge drink for $5
Pretty good wine and from what what we got to try of the appetizers they were very good-especially the butterfish
I had a little sushi nigiri sake and maguro--decent quality
The service was good it was packed we sat at a bar table the waitress was very sweet and the drinks were strong I had my usual the crusted chicken romano and it was just as good as always
Aside from happy hour drinks are tasty but pricey
The prices are great for how spectacular the food is although expect to cough up a solid twenty per person for an appetizer entree and beers
I got a PF-X drink which I highly recommend
The wine selection is good and drinks are typically pretty strong
Also an amazing selection of wines - a great place to experiment and try new things
I was excited that they had harder to find beverages like the non-root beer flavors of Virgil's
I ordered the fried chicken for dinner which was delicious and I got the root beer float for dessert
Dear The RooseveltMy friend and I in town from Boston came in to enjoy a delicious beer on the night of First Friday
The service was terrific the pizza margherita was wonderful and the drinks were stiff without being obnoxious
The staff was very friendly and it was endless entree we had absolutely too much of everything includingCheddar Cheese Fondue This was amazing with a beer base
The Moscato wine is also worth noting we purchased a bottle and it was one of the best Moscatos I have ever had
I've been here twice now and am just as enthusiastic about the joint as i was the first time  I didn't review the first time because I had been drinking all day and well everything tastes good after that
the staff is strong and the drinks are amazingly inexpensive considering the surroundings
I recommend the garlic dip and peanut chicken wrap and good service refilled drinks often brought more pitas brought boxes when we were done w/o our having to ask
The service however is excellent as our waiter scored 2 points for the wine and dessert recommendation besides he had an Italian accent and and old world charm that I couldn't help but like
The dish I had a homemade egg noodle pasta dish with a variety of fish and shellfish in white wine scampi sauce was good
Would I come back and just drink beer for the pleasure of good company
Despite delicious food and an impressive wine list it hurts my heart to say that this place isn't worth the trouble
Location = awesomePatio = awesomeFood = really goodDrinks = really goodPrices = are you kidding me expensiveThat kind of sums it up
The adjacent wine bar is a good idea and definitely the money make for the place as the food is very reasonable
good thing because that drink was powerful and possible flammable it was so strong
I enjoyed the wings pretzels and beer bites
#15-House PHOnomenal- decent broth not too fragrant a little stingy on the meat portions but overall a good bowl of phoIf you like lechee they have a drink pronounced hot-ee and it has little pearls of lechee juice and tons pf basil seeds
I hate to give this place only 3 stars because the atmosphere is comfortable and cozy and the staff will remember you from visit to visit but the quality of the drinks varies too much for my liking
I think the quality of the drink is dependent on the server which is sad because this place is sooooo close to me
We also mentioned Yelp and got $2 glasses of a tasty St
and a little natural disaster in a glass so I recommend sharing if you are not plan to make it your meal
He was laid-back and recommended some great beers to us
The bartenders and waiters were friendly and attentive all good looking of course Scottsdale and all of our drinks from beers to martinis to fruity stuff were delicious and not too overpriced I mean they were overpriced but not quite Scottsdale overpriced
I paid for Kristen and I plus the newly engaged couple and including drinks and all food it only came to ninety eight dollars that is a bargain for this atmosphere and the overall quality of the food and staff
I`m usually not a big beer drinker but I did try a dirty black and tan  half Guinness and half Irish cider hello delicious
Love the attached wine store the girl that worked there helped us pick out an amazing malbec and the general ambiance of Atlas Bistro
Service was excellent and drink refills were always plentiful
if you are looking for a great place to hang out people watch and enjoy amazing food and drinks this is the one
Zen 32 offers $3-$6 happy hour sushi rolls appetizers and some drinks from 10pm-2am
I love the egg dishes try the Chicago omelet the salads Trifecta rocks pastries made in-store the black-and-whites are good and the fat-free blueberry muffins are better than the regular ones--all are usually refrigerated though so you may want to ask for your muffin to be heated before serving and the bagels have the perfect bite and chewiness contrast with the bagel-shaped bread that Einstein's churns out
Palate cleanser  Toasted nuts raspberries cheese and balsamic reductionAppetizer upgradedLobster roll - So amazing I will be back on a Wednesday just to eat this againSecondiHand Cut Pasta with brown butter and FennelEntreeVeal Scallopini-  This was perfectly cooked and the presentation was amazingDessertCotton CandyPassion Fruit and CoconutI also paired the meal with the wine accompanies which all were great except the dessert wine didn't really pair with the dessert I got but after I finished it and had a few minutes it went down well but just didn't go with the food
This place is for weddings family gatherings just simple good food morning noon and night and amazing drinks
After 3 bottles of wine shared between three of us my Mommy friend was being good we had such a great time chatting it up with our server and enjoying each others company
I recommend the lasagna new york strip Wine or a cocktail and of course popcorn
every beer this brewery makes is masterfully crafted and wonderful to enjoy
We bowled our two games while munching on delicious chicken quesadillas we each ordered a platter because they were so good and downing cold beer
Like other reviews I too enjoyed the drink menu and tasted a couple of different sakes that my girlfriend and I enjoyed
At the their new prices -- $280 for the large tasting menu with wine -- it wasn't even close to worth it
I can't think of any particular drink specials this place offers but the vodka/soda's I had the last time I was here were pretty strong so that's good
It's just a beer and Wine joint with 2 frozen drink machines- didn't check on the flavors
I noticed lots of local foods and a good selection of Arizona beers too and not just the standard Four Peaks offering that you can find in most stores
You would have no idea that there is such a wonderful beer selection inside
I would recommend this little diamond in the rough for people in Tempe looking to bulk up their drinking resumes
Anyway the drinks were pretty good it was really dark inside like the others stated with is a relief if you ask me from the Phoenix sun which seems to be about 4 inches away from your face
Overall it was good food good drinks good atmosphere and I am definitely excited to have another restaurant option nearby
The glass was never empty which being someone who is constantly thirsty is a good sign
PS  Their specialty milkshakes and coffee drinks are amazing as well
The food was very good again that's what I would expect of restaurant where I am spending north of $500 for dinner and a couple drinks for 4
There was a short wait when we got there so we sat at the bar to have a drink and appetizer while we waited
As an example here's my bill$16 - 2 cocktails$14 - 2 glasses of wine$  6 - 1 appetizer$25 - 2 meals$  7 - 1 dessert= $73 before tip
Had the olives and pub board as appetizers along with a very nice Spanish red wine that was suggested by the server
But then we ordered drinks really good sangria and mojitos and I don't say that about very many places
Second quality products such as these should be served in a china cup or glass
We posted up in the corner on a couple of couches the server was prompt in greeting us and getting our drink order I ordered an IPA and my wife had a red Italian wine after a recommendation by the server
My wife was happy with the recommendation it was a good wine for her taste
I'm all for happy hour at this place for a drink and snack and the happy hour menu/drinks are actually pretty good
Interesting contrast found here  excellent abundant authentic well to my American palate Sonoran-style Mexican food but in the setting of a semi trashy beer hall
I've only ever been to Casey Moore's for appetizers and drinks so my review is based on that
Casey's has a pretty good beer selection both drafts and bottles
Good beer selection awesome appetizers and great atmosphere give Casey Moore's an above average rating of four stars
The wine list is pretty good but no bargains there
I got a white cheddar with cranberries in it that was good and they only thing is the beer is so weird there its hard to pick anything out although I would like to try some but they all seem so odd the types the names
The drinks were really good but I couldn't repeat the names of them to my server without blushing
The Mill Ave Starbucks provides a great venue and even a good drink here or there
If you spend a sunday morning doing work over coffee a good way to spend the afternoon is doing less work over beers
But Lyte does offer some tasty beers - like Peroni Pilsner Urquell Newscastle Stella
This place has a quirky atmosphere and amazing bottled beer selection
Overall this place could use some improvement but does have an excellent beer selection
Its weird that they have no taps keg beer is the cheapest way to buy beer and is totally worth having some beers most taste better out of a tap
Likes-*Seems like they always have a spot outside where others are packed to the max*Can bring your dogs with you to hang out on the patio*Happy hour everyday 3PM-7PM with great drink and bar food options*Prices besides happy hour are not that bad either*Free chips and salsa-Very light salsa and fresh which tastes amazing
I highly recommend going there for happy hour in the wine cellar like bar
I started off with the Cucumber Refresher drink and it was delicious
Perhaps it's a better drink and appetizer place - I almost fell over when I saw the bill $175 for six
Drinks We got the pomegranate mojito very refreshing and a peach-blood orange mojito sweet but very goodStarters Signature empanadas Tasty
Two of us had a red blend wine that was recommended by the server and knocked ourselves on the forehead when we got home for not knowing what it was because we loved it
The drinks are good tasty and not bad for the price
Both beers were excellent full bodied and fresh
I enjoy sidecars because they incorporate a lot of different sweet flavors but this just made me feel like a lush drinking a citrus-flavored martini
Speaking of martinis the gin martini was decent although tiny but a good buy for $5
Just five bucks for a mini pitcher of a draft beer - that's a little over 2 pints' worth of Kiltlifter Hoegaarden etc
i walked back to the counter to ask if this was the correct drink and that it didnt taste like there was any flavor or coffee instead of apologizing and re-making me a new one the woman responded thats the way we make it    again wow
The beers are good but I would not recommend getting the tasters
My recommendation is to try the hefeweizens if you you like Belgium beers and with a pizza
The pineapple wine is very tasty not super sweet despite what the waitress told us
All that and an amazing bottle of wine that was half off - sitting outside under the misters at a nice 90 degrees - in Beautiful AZ - who could ask for more
Service was great - friendly and competent and not at all weird about our ordering 2-3 drinks at a time to take advantage of the deal or deciding to order yet another appetizer because they're just so damn cheap
If you know good beer you know that it is hard to find in the bud light / tecate mecca of the world
I don't know if the horchota is any good I don't drink that stuff
Their barteneder makes great drinks the appitizers were excellent my wife had chicken taco's that were fine can't really do much with chicken tacos imo I had the Obama Burrito
The service was very good although we did have to ask a second time for one of our drinks
Unfortunately however the food quality and wine list do not compare to Houston's and I would have gladly paid the extra $50 to have simply dined there
So much flavor in such a little glass with a fun little spoon to eat your little calorie filled well in comparison to the full size dessert
It's a dark sexy looking place where the music is always good you're going to run into people you know whether you want to or not - always good for some drama and yeah the drinks are pricey but not by Scottsdale standards
It's not expensive there's delicious bruchetta and salads disguised as trendy light food and great drinks
I definitely recommend the bruchetta and grab a glass or two of wine
We all ordered the pink diamond which is a delicious champagne drink with some acai and fruit juice so you don't feel guilty
Met friends and sat over 30 minutes with an empty drink glass  not offered food no chips were brought to the table until we asked and had to ask if we could order an appetizer
Here at Olive and Ivy you'll find a fresh panini or two recommend the Pastrami a few salads and select coffee drinks made to order
she was patient with our party of four she joked around with us got our orders right kept our drinks filled and had an amazing looking green studded belt on to boot
They have a good selection of mostly beers but the real focus here is the food
The appetizer was very good especially wiath a Sapporo beer hard to find in my experience
Four Peaks has a decent number of TV's a good amount of seating good beer of course and a large menu with enough variety for everyone
It also would be a good place to bring a visiting friend from out of town so they can sample some good local beer
I enjoyed the modern clean atmosphere and the food/wine/service was outstanding
When Christina P entrusted me with choosing the location for some good wine good food and good company it was like choosing the location for my Last Supper
Not to mention it's pretty good with the wine too
It's a fun lively place for some good grub and more than a few beers
This was followed by fish and chipsone of the best I've had in Arizona I'm sadly resolved to the fact that I probably won't get good English-style fish and chips anywhere in The Valley so this will do There's nothing I can say about the beer that hasn't been said but their summer seasonal was amazing and I could have stayed there all night putting many away
I was not impressed with the beer selection at all
I just spent $55 on eight bottles of pretty good wine
my wife had some great wine and i enjoyed a few awesome beers
It's really dark inside and the food goes good with beer which they have much of
Since I was DD the hubby had another drink this time the Kingston Rum Punch wow that was strong but tasty
They also have cheap drinks and they pour them pretty dang good
I also convinced him to indulge in the mango lassi god I miss those dairy yogurty drinks and it was tasty-not that sweet and maybe a bit yogurty than necessary but really cooled down the mouth when had too much of the spicy chutney
My mother had the tiramisu drink that was so strong it knocked her sandles off but it was good
Uhm maybe since they do have a couple good beers available they serve fresh fish and they have a pretty wide selection of oysters to pick from
I was equally impressed by the wine selection and prices it being Sunday Brunch we settled on a Bottle of Prosecca which they had for only $28 what a steal and it was fabulous
I definitely tasted a ton of pomegranate flavor and both drinks weren't overpowering
Some of my favorites are- Frozen mashed potatoes ok this is one of those items that it is almost embarrassing to admit that I don't make myself but they are so darn good that if you tried them you would understand- Frozen breaded chicken tenderloin breasts- Wine Country pecan and cranberry chicken salad filling- White meat chicken salad filling- Frozen Mandarin Orange Chicken along with Veggie Fried Rice- Sliced cheese platter- Asiago bread - dip it in olive oil & balsamic vinegar
The wine selection to start was good and had some off-the-beaten-path choices
I've never had a bad experience here--service food wine all good
The drinks were great however we weren't thrilled with the appetizers
The beer is good with lots of different choices
Great place for some tasty grub and refreshing drinks
My drink was worth the calories I had the Limoncello martini
i think this place would be a good place to go for happy hour or a drink and one of the cheaper menu items
I like their food & drinks and they have some good deals
RA in Scottsdale is only good for groups if you & your friends are up for doing sake bombs in the bar for 2 hours while you wait for your table
Service was good he refilled our drinks several times and asked if everything was ok
We were the kind of customers who said I don't know what I want surprise me and they seemed to have fun with it and the drinks were always delicious
Maizie's has become my temptress as of late luring me out of the confines of my apartment to dine on oh-so-delicious food and drink great local beers all while not breaking the bank
When the food arrived and after a few bites me and all the others arrived to the conclusion that Hanny's might be better for drinks the pizza  if you can call it pizza is more like a flat bread with very little flavor and with cheap topping the salads were really small and again with cheap ingredients
we got the mashed potato stuffed shrimp just cuz everyone commented about it and I was extremely underwhelmed just as I was with the sea bass & my hubby with the what's in the steak steak - the wine was good but very pricey most glasses were $14 & up and we lived in the SF Bay area for 15 years and didn't pay that
The barmaid was very nice though extremely busy and the draft beer was good
Lunch for two with appetizer and a drink was about $40 before tip
The drinks I had were a little sweet than I usually like but still good
Make sure you catch Happy Hour during the week to take advantage of their drink and appetizer specials
germaine and beer was sweet but tasty love cocktails with carbonation
They have a pretty eclectic selection of draft beer so I had a 90 Shilling excellent and a Hemp Ale also good
They really have some good drinks too
95 with a drink and you have to get ice tea to get refills all the good ones u have to pay not that the others were any better another $1
I like a good brat and cannot remember the last time I had brats and beer
Based on the apparent quality of ingredients artisanal attention to details unique offerings as wells as standby favorites attentive and friendly service and beer selection I heartily give 4 stars  upgrade the bun and I would cheerily upgrade to 5 stars
We had a few glasses of wine and had The Butcher's Block for an appetizer
Their chips and salsa are tasty and the drinks are relatively cheap and you can usually find a $10 for $20 coupon on here which makes it a good value
I had a sour cherry caipirinha that was a seriously well crafted beverage and again our server made excellent wine & cognac selections for after dinner
Big  tasty slices of delicious NY style thin crust pizza and a drink for $4 bucks
Moe's also has a pretty good selection of cheap beer
I have  had some amazing good times drinking a silly  drink called Mr
-the toilet paper is stamped with their logo This means they got   somethin' good going on I'm sure-cheap during happy hour-super cheap during happy hour $5 pitchers everyday foo ' I think between 11 and 5-Special $20 wine/bruschetta thingy
Stick to what a dive is good at beer and the occasional house cocktail
The by-the-glass list has several good selections including a very well priced sparkling
They have pretty good daily and happy hour specials on drinks
They have a nice patio for a beer after the round and it's a pleasant 19th hole to sit and recount the good shots and forget the average after the round
We both had a glass of wine and the wine list is pretty good if a bit pricey
I sat outside with the owner and we all spent about 20 minutes chatting drinking and having a good ole time
Half the beer list is from Arizona including some of our favorite Flagstaff breweries and many excellent Phoenix area breweries
As soon as we were seated the server gave us on the house cups of tofu vegetable soup that was fresh and tasty and later took our order skipping out before we had time to order drinks
1/2 price on all their drinks and appetizers--sign me up
The drinks are great definitely a strange place to find a great spot but it goes to show that with good food everyone will come and come back
This was the 2nd location in the valley and they're not doing a good job of holding up to Total Wine down the street
They brew their own beer obviously and it is really good
When I went to brunch my girl did like the drinks and the chiliquiles are good but you could do better from any torta chain with little effort and just suffer from the ambiance for better food
have hallucinogenic properties but it was about my 6th drink of the evening so I obviously had a good time with it
For the money you're better off going to Four Peaks where the food is incredible and the beer is tasty
The rest of our experience with dinner - service restaurant ambiance overall feel and all of our food and drinks before the entrees was AMAZING
But worth it to be able to sip a drink while watching the movie
The Saki infused drinks are tasty as well
Our martinis were excellent - I had the 11th Generation Martini with gin raspberry peach tea and honey; and hubby had the Blood Orange Basil with grey goose
The fact that we were less than impressed with the atmosphere really dark decor kind of reminded me of Black Angus and staff our server was overly enthusiastic when presenting the specials but not around when you needed more water or the check isn't enough to make me take away a star or two because the food and drinks were delicious and well-prepared enough to make the experience a great one despite these drawbacks
I got the Movie Star Martini and my husband got some version of the Manhattan can't remember the name - both drinks tasted like well-thought-out concoctions and were definitely worth the $10-$12 which is something I cannot say for many over-priced restaurant cocktails
I understand it was a free tasting but the whole point of doing that is to market not only the wines but your shops quality of service too
The wines were very good however and we did end up purchasing the Pinot Noir for our upcoming Thanksgiving dinner
The wine list is pretty good with a lot of choice by the glass
My biggest complaint about this place is the lack of good craft beer that is kept cold
I quickly ordered a wine flight for each of us $2 off each flight and an appetizer of chicken satay with pineapple salsa  $8
We received our wines and they were all very delicious
The coffee is SO tasty I no longer need ten pumps of flavored sugar to drink it
It is a perfect compliment to a glass of wine or two and is definitely a good choice for the summer
A few years ago right after I turned 21 a few of my friends took me to this place it was awesome loads of people good music and two for one drinks
The music was pretty good the new dance floor was shiny and the drinks were ok but they really pissed us off when they kept calling last call
The drinks at the bar were watered down and weren't nearly worth the $6 price tag as cheap as that is
I actually don't drink but the wine list was very extensive and have heard good things about the selection
We were done with our meal enjoying some wine good selection by the way and had some time to kill before the event we were going to was starting
As for drinks Jac's has a really fun cocktail menu and also a good wine selection
We were totally spoiled the first time we hit this place our server knew the wine list inside and out and recommended wines that we really liked and regularly look for now
Since then when we ask our servers what they recommend for different types of wine they have had to ask the bartender and even then the wines just haven't been on target
The beers are pretty good I liked the Devils Ale and the place has a nice upscale pub ambiance a lot like Four Peaks in many ways
Good for watching the game happy hour meeting up with an old friend or just a casual meal & drink
I mean I can drink the peanut sauce it was that good
the drink alone was worth the $4 something dollars for several reasons but the sandwich was gross and totally over priced
The drinks are very expensive for the quality of alcohol you will be getting
Some demerits                    include over steamed Shrimp rice noodle [some firmness                   is better] the Har Gao shrimp dumplings were good                    but on the verge of being over-steamedDrinks  No Grade we did not consume any alcoholic beverages so no grade is given in this category - though I have to say my Oolong tea was delicious
A couple of beers better-than-average bar food open late-ish for Arcadia you're good
We sat on a L-shaped couch in the corner and enjoyed the rest of our drinks
Both were amazing especially the Peach beer
The waiters and waitresses are amazingly knowledgeable about wine especially considering how many are on the menu
I love their zipparitas in every flavor they often have great deals on food and drinks
The wine list is quite good with awards from Wine Spectator and a cozy bar as well
The keg wines were outstanding-- decent value and good flavors
The beer selection both on tap and by the bottle is incredibly impressive and the list of appetizers is almost as long not really but you get my point
So take the review for what it is and if nothing else go in the evening for a glass of wine and the olive appetizer a steal at $5 but overall it did not wow me as much as I expected from all the write-ups
Let's name themSteamed Edamame with Sea SaltCrispy Fried Squid with Chili and LimeButterfish Tataki with White Asparagus and Yuzu favoriteZucchini with Miso MustardSausage Platter2 Other Sushi dishesGood wine as my friends would say and awesome photographers
Love coming here for dinner or just drinks and appetizers
The service was very good  the waitress kept the drinks full which is very important
The bread loaf with the garlic spread is a good munchie but let me tell you all you need is two martinis to call yourself done if you know what I mean
She took our drink order but unfortunately it never came so we just had water which in the end was a good thing since the food did not have much flavor
The shepherds pie was good the beer was cold and the waitress was very attentive
The drinks are good albeit a bit inconsistent
The fresh rolls were indeed fresh--lettuce pops of flavorful herbs glass noodles crunchy chopped cucumber and fresh chewy wrappers
The wine was good and so was my meatball pizza
They have really good drinks a bit pricey but really tasty
The pros - good experience lots of menu choices good food smells wonderfulThe cons - poor parking you will be a little crowded $10 guacamole and $11 glass of sangria
This place was nothing special thats for sure good wine list though and the bar area did look fun unfortunately we didn't both to stay and check that out
Wine selection is excellent if you are bargain shopping and they do carry a few mid-higher grade wines
You can get decent value wines much like you would at Trader Joe's with a good selection of countries available and they often have an impressive selection of organic/biodynamic wines if that's your thing
Each time they brought a big carafe of coffee and we also enjoyed a freshly squeezed glass of grapefruit juice
Basically The Tavern is a good sports bar offering all of the bar food and beer a sports fan can love - I was impressed by how friendly and fast the service was despite being there on a Monday Night Football day
I will be honest I think your best bet with this place would be to go for happy hour $5 wine $5 appetizers or on a date where someone else is paying
Unfortunately she also didn't know anything at all about the wines but I made a selection we enjoyed anyhow
It's a great spot to go with friends for excellent beer and grub
The food is delicious the antipasto is excellent as is the Tuscan white bean salad and their wine list is quite extensive
They also offer delicious specialty cocktails if wine is not your forte
The Sheraton hotel has some issues to work out we spent the night - had to after all that wine - driving wasn't really an option but they do make good to resolve their mistakes
$59 for $144 worth of food with a bottle of wine seemed like a great deal - unfortunately it wasn't
Drinks were nice and strong so it was a good time
They also have delicious ice in their drinks I like ice that has more air bubbles in them because it just break really easily in your mouth
For the two appetizers five pizzas a glass of wine a coke double expresso and a cappucino our bill came to $111
I can't vouch for all of their drinks as I've only tried the green milk tea and avocado snow but every time I have ordered them they have been super good
I enjoyed a fine Pimm's Cup and even though I didn't drink it the Celebratory Champagne complete with confetti was entertainment for the entire table
There is a place not so far away where the wine is delicious and the tranquil sounds of divine music play
I would recommend this place to anyone looking to have a great meal a good drink in a laid-back atmosphere
When I found this place on my Yelp app I naturally assumed I'd be getting some wine but I couldn't resist trying the Epicenter from San Tan Brewery holy mackerel - is this a delicious beer
She got us our drinks and brought us amazing jalapeno cornbread
I'll give them a star for good fries and IBC root beer though they could pick a better root beer
The music while good was really loud and the people drinking in the bar must have been mic'd because they were as loud as hell
DRINKSI told Sam what I like to drink and he recommended an amazing tequila
For goodness sake people this is an urban nursery in a commercial area on Bell Rd
The trail mixes in the bulk food area are tasty and the beer and wine is reasonably priced
Though I am always on the search for eclectic and unique cocktails this is definitely a place I would journey to for its delicious and inexpensive non-alcoholic drinks
As wedding prices go it was definitely reasonable - no idea why the world thinks that in order to have a lovely wedding you need to drop oodles of loot - the Farm is a great option for nature lovers people missing trees grass etc great food amazing service and a memorable location for their wedding it was actually less expensive than 90% of the hotel/buffet options out thereFood there are three dining options at The Farm Quiescence fancy high end dining Morning Glory Cafe breakfast/brunch The Farm Kitchen - lunch I could write a novel here but overall the food is a little expensive lunch is usually $10-$15/person with drinks or if you want desert tack on an additional $3-5 bucks but it is very good plus you get the great ambiance of dining under trees on a picnic table or in their little courtyard area
I was very pleased with the food here and good drinks
And while there isn't much to DJ's it's small and all attempts at decorating the place were spared it's a good place to do some serious drinking
and for not much money me and some buddies can plug our beer-filled guts with some greasy yet oh so delicious pizza
The wait staff was good nothing that was absolutely amazing but they definitely did their job drinks food and ticket were all on time that's all that I wanted and expected
The drinks were SO good and there were a couple GREAT sushi standouts
the standard california roll - fresh and goodDrinksMuai Wowie - fruity and tastyWango Mango - fruity and tastyMilky Way - who doesn't want a chocolatey drink with a caramel rim
SO dangerously goodSo if you want a lively atmosphere with friendly waiters/hostesses and  really creative sushi and some drinks this is the place to go
This past Wednesday happened to be their 2-year anniversary and we were fortunate enough to be there for the free appetizer / drink coupon as a result
Only downfall was service -- our appetizer never made it and extra drink did not complaining about that
The service was good and all else but man I couldn't drink enough fluid the rest of the night to
Drinks are limited to cans and bottles so getting you food to go and getting a drink at the adjacent circle K is recommended
They've got a pretty good selection of beers to choose from but the thing that kills this place for me is the service
You have to be a pool shootin beer drinking sports lovin good ol' boy or girl
My friend had a hefewizen he really enjoyed the clean citrus notes in the beer
At places like this I have two main expectations 1 Good beer with lots of it on tap
The beer is tasty and cold as it should be but the bar food didn't do it for me
The service is always good and it's a better place to drink than to eat even the desserts and appetizers are good just not an all-around contender for favorite bar and grill
Usually they bring in good DJ's on the Saturday nights and the drink prices are pretty average for a club
This venue would be great to take a date or bring good friends to share a bottle of wine
Most of the drinks we had were good including bloody maries but make your own mimosas by buying champagne and a side glass of OJ
We eventually did check out the free glass exhibit and it was very much worth the drive to Mesa from North Scottsdale
The Terrace Bar has excellent views and the drink prices are pretty reasonable given the location
It is good for drinks and service from the girl I mentioned all the rest of them seemed a little stand-offish
I ordered a Mai tai  the drink is strong and I recommend it
Total for the three entrees two bowls of extra rice appetizer one beer and two ice teas with tax was $60 so this isn't exactly a cheap Asianish dinner
It was a wonderful experience for us when we were just expecting to try a few different rolls and drinks
It's a decent place to pop in for a drink and a bite to eat sometimes can get busy but it's good to have places like this in the neighborhood plus it's not a chain - bonus
They have a beautiful wine by the glass list and some amazing cocktails
Long wait for drink order to be taken longer wait for appetizer/pizza order to be taken refills on water long extra long wait for drink orders etc etc There was seriously  a couple seated after us in the same seating area with a different wait staff that was served & left while we were still waiting for the check
Very disappointed in the service & deflated after a long day of work & spending 2 hours for an appetizer pizza & 2 beers is not the way I went to spend my evening
My two go-to drinks - the Pour Over and just good old fashioned shots of espresso with the sparkling water chaser they give you
We all had the Oregon wines which were fabulous and tasty
Rather than categorize by red white type of wine or region they categorize by the same flavor families such as crisp mellow nectar bold and I believe a couple others
They had some amazing wines on the list including New Age which I am sure I have everyone hooked on now and most of them didn't even try it on ice
This tasting was pick your own from a list rather than everyone having every wine in the same order and I was impressed at how the staff remembered what we all wanted every time and we had a group of about 14 people
good drinks got a green tea the name of the tea called Infusion lives up to it's name
I ordered a tasty glass of dark beer to accompany my excellent meal
For $65  you get a great four course meal a shot of good tequila and 3 nice wines to go with the  wonderful food
It's called the Wine Me Dine Me  Not only that I mentioned that the ceviche looked really good
Service was good she took a while to get our initial drink order
After walking in to find candy-striped pink walls shiny white tables decorated with pink flowers in glass vases and white counter tops with glass casing home to all sorts of baked goods my hopes were high
The food and drink are certainly acceptable but you'll never walk away from it saying Wow that was as good as any Starbucks I've ever been in
They're busy every other night too simply because they're one of the hippest places around-a hot staff a huge wine selection a pretty patio wonderful food and pretty ambiance
--The fries were addictiveThey have a good selection of beers and they are priced lower than I expected
I live in the adjacent apartment complex so I am there at least once every ten days and the quality of service and deliciousness of the food and drink are always exceptional
Finally though I cannot speak for all their drinks my margarita was well mixed and very good as for being a mexican restaurant they had a variety of tequilas and I am sure anyone who like to imbibe can find something they like here
Yes it's a beautiful people place but I was very happy and comfy and wrapped in the haze of good martinis -
I plan on visiting again for happy hour to enjoy appetizers pork belly pastrami and drinks
The sweetness and freshness of the mussels along with white wine garlic and butter just gave the superb flavor away
I am writing this update soley based on the feeling one gets when going to Spitfire Grill the food and drinks are always good
This is a great place to go for a glass of wine and appetizers with your girlfriends
The wines are very good and pretty inexpensive
This place stands out for its ambiance great tasting wine and good service
He worked on repairing my lock for a good amount of time even after he had already determined that the lock couldn't be picked due to the key being broken off in it was a much larger key than intended for the lock it was in a big glass case I picked up from friend for free
It makes for a truly delicious drink and Cartel has served me really amazing versions over the past month or so including 2 days ago up until today
The barista at Cartel literally refused to make the drinks we paid for saying that he could add vanilla or hazelnut but that honey doesn't make our coffee taste good
I only heard amazing things about the White Chocolate beer that they had
What could be better than watching an indie film with a good cold beer in a place where only people with similar interests hang out
The front section of the place when you walk in is a small bar with a good selection of bottled beers and wine
The beers to wash down the meal were tasty and they had some unique options to choose from
Service  Well I've always gotten pretty good service they can be slow on the bill and sometimes they disappear but in general I order get my drinks get my food and that's about all
The drinks are strong the deserts are really good I don't need much more out of a restaurant
I enjoyed two Sierra Nevada's on tap and what I appreciated was that they were served in  nice cold glasses
We sat at the bar and took the staff's recommendations on drinks and food
It is the real deal and I look forward to drinking gallons of their delicious brews over the coming years
In addition to good food Four Peaks has great beer and drinks
Of course I had to pair it with gulaman at sago a popular Filipino cold drink sweetened with panocha brown sugar and with cubes of gulaman flavored agar and tapioca balls
Twelve packs of beer good stuff like Dundee honey brew and Moosehead Lager for ten bucks
I am sometimes caught by sample stations giving our samples of wine or beer and it's so good and priced well that I typically grab some of that too
Upon discovering this place on line I was instantly intrigued I love wine and the reviews on from my Yelp friends were pretty damn good
I wish they had a better beer selection but the Kuna on tap is pretty tasty even if it's simply a traditional American Lager
Pool good music dancing reasonable drink prices
The honey wine is amazing as well as the hot tea
We order some wine - mind you there was no recommendation or comment on our choice
I Loved it so much I suggested we come back my last night in town for drinks and appetizers
Rarely can you count on a place to have quality live music a bustling dance floor and speedy drink service every night of the week
Their fresh fruit drinks were really tasty as was the Tamarindo
Not only is food good but they have a nice cocktail menu and they are known to fill their drinks to the tip top
They have a soda machine with about 20 choices for soda coke sprite energy drinks etc EACH with up to 5 or 6 flavoring choices strawberry berry etc
What I've found is that the food is pretty good but really over priced and they make horrible coffee & chai iced drinks
but you're over priced and you couldn't make a good coffee drink if you tried
No watered down crap or some fruity tasty drink with no alcohol
I'd say this is the kind of place you bring a couple friends to kick back a few beers with and just have a good time
I must say the root beer is pretty tasty though
Solid wine list good happy hour plus good service would bring me back for a snack and a drink
I enjoyed the wine I ordered and everything about the place as well as Meow Meow the resident cat who makes herself more than comfortable on the cushioned couch
In addition to a tremendous pizza recommendation our waitress was constantly refilling our drinks and checked in multiple times
The waiter helped me pair a fresh white wine that I seriously enjoyed
Amazing drinks with flavors I have never tasted before
My wife was floored that she could experience a good drink with no alcohol
Even though I stopped drinking it regularly years ago I still can't help myself when it comes to good quality soda or even crap soda
After asking staff what his recommendation was for great root beer he helped us by explaining the difference in taste between brands
I would recommend the Mexican Standoff no it's not Mexican wine
Great Vibe great wine selection impressive selection of beer and if your'e like me prefer a martini over wine they make a good martini too
The beer selection is quite good and the service was prompt and cheerful
We also shared the salad and burger-which btw came on an english muffin and for us ladies looking for new food tricks to conserve calories for our drinks what a brilliant and tasty decision
A casual and comfortable atmosphere with awesome food and good priced wines
I love 5th and Wine for Happy Hour during the week with girlfriends-try and sit in their living room setting and grab a few appetizers and a $5 glass of wine- I really love their Riesling
My spicy friend has tried most everything else says these dishes are good short spare ribs fried turnip/ radish squares lean sliver-sliced pork crispy spring rolls flavored riced with minced meat and vegetables under glass bowl tripe bowl rice wrapped in a big leaf and sweet custard mini-pastries
Nevertheless the wine that was recommended wasn't even what we were looking for
While i respect the honesty of your lack of knowledge don't recommend a wine to me please
The wine selection was so large but the server was able to recommend a wine
Good not great selection of tap beers - all good and interesting but not extensive
I've heard they have good beer but what I'm reviewing now is their food
Beer is good good with food I ate and drank so much I almost pooed
Some more positive notes were our waitress was pleasant and always filled my drink before it got close to empty and the fortune cookies she brought were light and delicious
Beer was as good as ever but not enough to overcome the disapointing food
Dinner came to be a little over $200 with drinks so yes its pricey but my fiancee and I loved it so it was worth it
Basically it has excellent produce bulk goods and a nice wine selection
Let me just say for someone who could care less about pizza I would definitely come back again in 2 weeks for these pizzas accompany with their delicious Italian wine collection
My friend ordered some Sake that I thought was real good and smooth -- don't ask me what it was the lighting was low and I didn't care much by the time I arrived
The food is delicious the drinks are yummy and the scene is ferosh
I especially love coming here during happy hour for discounted delicious drinks and can have a phenomenal meal for under $20
What's going to give Harry Morton his big tax writeoff is the quality of the food and drink or lack thereof and the music was so loud during both visits I couldn't carry on a conversation with my dinner companions
Just such a awesome atmosphere for small groups or a date and really good food with a very nice beer list
I had the house french bordeaux wine which was also good
I once had the glass noodles it was quite good
The beer selection here is good some non standards on tap such as Left Hand Polestar Pilsner which was a bit disappointing compared to some of LH's other offerings but that's nothing against the restaurant and one of my favorites Deschutes Black Butte Porter
If I remember correctly the burgers at Delux were around $8 and were just as good or maybe even better fries were still shared and their beer selection terrific
I think the wine selection is less but the food choices are slightly expanded and the quality is wonderful
The manager offered us free drinks I had the best tostada in town and the chips and salsa were really good too
I had a Four Peaks beer something I had never tried before which was quite delicious
They have kilt lifter on tap and a pretty good selection of other beers
for those non-winey's this is quality price ratio
The food was amazing and I will definitely be back when in the mood for some French cuisine or even just for some wine and desserts
AZ Wine co has a wonderful selection to choose from
The wine that we ultimately picked was wonderful
We enjoyed everything from the food drinks & service that we decided to come back and try their dinner menu
They have a decent drink selection and lots of other italian items on the menu that I've never tried because the pizza is so good
It's June -- tomatoes are in season for goodness sake
I am a regular however and go in to sit at their bar for drinks and appetizers weekly
Beer selection was good LIITs were excellent - and even better we were pleasantly surprised by the food
The beers on tap the quality of the bathroom and the huge smoking patio put this place over the top - 5 stars
This is why I hate when restaurants job-share tables it puts you in a position to have to punish a good server for a crappy drink service that was someone else's fault
I thought that was the course paired with wines such as Laetitia Pino Noir were good choices
Each mouthful produced smiles as I enjoyed the contrast between the hot waffle and cold ice cream the soft smooth texture of the ice cream and the chewiness of the bacon
We also enjoyed some sake and The OC martini was great
but so worth taking your own wine to go with the good food
Anyways I got chips and a drink with it and all around it was tasty
The food is great the service is great and the beer is wonderful as well
so that probably explains why I actually like the placeThe Beautiful Carin and I wandered over for dinner the other evening as you can see I am a little bit behind on writing my little review-like storiesWe have been a number of times over the years because when you live in Old Town Scottsdale Bandera is* Close* Pretty Decent Food* Close* Pretty Good Martinis* CloseWe generally go to Bandera in the summer and fall when the crowds are gone and they seem almost pathetically happy to see us walk through the doorI do enjoy the corn bread
Go with a couple of friends so you can share all the good food and drinks
i hear the beers are amazing if you are into that sort of thing like the majority of the world
We sat for 15 minutes before we were able to order drinks and the waiter quickly ran off before we could get our appetizers order placed
He showed up 10 minutes later with our wine and then it took another 20 minutes to get the appetizers without one Pan Shrimp with the excuse that the fryer is all backed up remember it's only 5 PM on Fri
The mac n' cheese was very good and cheesy but it wasn't very noteworthy - it was basically high quality Velveeta cheese a slight beer-esque tang to it topped with parmigiana
I would come here again to sample more of the beer and for dessert or a Happy Hour-priced appetizer but not for lunch or dinner again
I'm a straight up coffee person so I stick to pour-over drip or espresso but the mocha is a delightful drink with a good quality chocolate home-made whipped creme and chocolate shavings on top
The pros - fresh ingredients- attention to detail - variety of foods snacks goodies and drinksThe cons- expensive- location / parking inconvenientBrief reviewAll in all a good place to hang out and grab a drink with a friend when it's nice outside
my inner nerd coming outMake sure you stay on a Wednesday there are free drinks and appetizers in the courtyard
But other than the price of drinks this place is amazing
For those who feel a little nervous I do recommend bringing some wine along with you
She poured me a glass of a local chardonnay recommended the turkey sandwich I sat down and just relaxed
I guess I would give them 3 stars cause its got good service and a nice selection of beer and wine and very nice ambience
You can get some good beer here too and every now and again I pick up a few groceries to take back home as well pizza dough anyone
If you're having dinner here I recommend bringing a nice bottle of wine to enjoy with your dinner
The bar has an eclectic array of booze  they have good tequila and unique beers
They dont carry any good craft beer either which absolutely drives me crazy
But this time I already had two incredibly strong and delicious martinis from Sens and was very glad to have taken the light rail
I highly recommend this place especially if you want a casual yet classy place to grab a drink
Drip coffee and espresso drinks are good too
They have a good selection of beers and even have various flavors of lambic
I would definitely come back here to try different flavors and to drink yummy coffee
A good selection of beer on tap - and none of it is Bud Light Miller Lite Corona
It's pretty cheap there to make it a meal with the drink and chips and of course the cookie always comes with it which are really traditional and tasty
When I got home to tell the hubby about all the scrumptious food and drinks we enjoyed I fell asleep telling him because there were just too many items to describe
Theirs is not as good as Halo-Halo's but it's still one of the best things to drink on a hot day around here
I will tell them to SHUT UP  b/c they just turned down 8 people who drink a ton of alcohol and give good tips
Most recently my husband and I went on a night they were having a VIP Guest Appreciation Night; we were treated to a night out that cost a mere $60 and included many glasses of champagne as well as hand passed hor's dourves that were quite delicious
The happy hour menu features half-off appetizers party bowls and bottles as well as two-for-one drinks
They also have delicious signature drinks as well as a great wine selection
The staff there is amazingly friendly-- especially Jenny-- who remembers our names and our drink preferences
Concession prices are good as well I fed myself with a sausage and a beer for less than $13
And the 'sample' of wine that was delivered to our table when we first sat down was a good move too
Oh PS the drinks are tasty and interesting
Zipps always has great service and good drink specials
Only reason I gave this place three stars was because I have not tried the food yet BUT I will say this place is a good place to stop by and go to the bar for a few rounds of sake bombers
We had such a good experience just having drinks at the bar that we will def be back for a full experience with food
Solid wine list offering by the glass  2 glass pitcher or full bottle we had a New zealand red that was very good
i recommend finishing your  wine by the hearth
There is an amazing variety on both the food and drink menus to choose from
Amazing and inexpensive food great big drinks that are masterfully crafted and waitstaff that knows what you need before you even know you need it
The pricing is what you would expect to pay from a trendy sushi place my husband and I had an appetizer a few rolls and drinks for under $40
Good service good food awesome beer and the company that goes along with all of the above certainly doesn't suck
Then we go to the bar to pick up some pitchers of beers not any good beers on tap and the ones they had were super expensive for this dive place
Half price drinks and carafes of sake rolls and appetizers
The food and drinks at the Spotted Donkey are consistently good
This place gets a solid 4 stars due to good wine decent food and the enjoyable and somewhat surreal time I had there
The wine when it came was pretty good
The drinks were tasty albeit a little pricey
The beer was extremely tasty & I don't usually care for beer
Ate here last night on recommendation from AZ Wine Co
Have appetizers and a glass of wine not my 13 year old but feel comfortable taking her ;-  LR is definitely NOT a place for kids
On a positive note the food and wine was reasonably priced as well as delicious
The food is delicious and the drinks are really good
Shell mixed a delicious Manhattan with a Croatian cherry liquor for me -- a super cool giant ice ball to keep it chilled and after finding out about my desire to keep the calories down treated me to an awesome tequila drink with a natural juice fresh fruit
I dislike meat on top of pasta or potatoes  because when you cut it you crush it into the pasta  The wine list was good the teramasu was good
For $240 for four people it wasnt worth it subtract $78 for wine it was still high
it's a light beer that after first sip the aftertaste gives you a light hint of orange creamsicle goodness
served with an orange slice the beer tastes good until the last drop
I am a fan of the Peach beer of four peaks but this yelpers is better because the Orange Blossom has the ongoing blossoming of flavor
I liken this dark beer to black coffee with a hint of sweetness it's heavy and good
The martinis are delicious and different
Chill place along with an amazing wine list gives Kazimierz five stars
that was with NO dessert and only $4 worth of beer
Appetizers Hummus Plate Drinks Drunken Italian Soda - SO refreshing & tasty during the summer
It was kind of hokey and drinks are expensive but it really was a good night out
But I don't need to eat more because I fill my mouth with a good wine

The beer is excellent the service has always been attentive and the food is above normal bar standardsThe fish and battered fries was very good the tartar sauce is good but ask for the cocktail sauce
I'm not sure if it was because the ensalada drink looked like a liquid highlighter or the fact that an ice cold beverage was served with a hot soup but being the starving beast that I was I took a sip of the glow-stick and devoured the tasty chicken soup
You're the only store in the valley that I know of that sells Cock and Bull ginger beer quite possibly the best there is in the world even better than the really good Jamaican stuff
[ *if anyone knows of better ginger beer cough it up because I am in love with it* ]  Your other selections of gourmet sodas were all excellent choices too
Sapporo beer rounded out the awesome meal and the Tokyopolitan the girlfriend had was worth the money
I can only recommend it for grabbing drinks with that hot GILF you found at the Yarn Barn before you take her back to her retirement community to bang
We usually get half priced appetizers for happy hour and a few drinks
Real cocktails here worthy of the name Deseo meaning Desire and I desire a great drink
We were then asked for our drink order and were served some amazing $5 glasses of wine for happy hour right away
I do wish they had self serve fountain drinks but other than that as long as I can get some good tacos I'm cool
Without going into a huge story about all the times I've been here I'll just list all the food I love Portales Portobello Sweet Mash Boneless Chicken Wings late night menu only Cheese Crisp seasoned fries Spinach Salad Spicy Crab Cakes Green Chile Burger Habenero Burger it is good freakin spicy and comes with a glass of milk Tortilla Soup Green Chile Stew Chile Rellenos Carne Adovada Plate Green Chile Mac and Cheese late night menu Key Lime Pie and Basket of Sopas
That includes 2 appetizers 2 entrees 2 deserts and a bottle of wine
When the bill came out the waitress said that our whole bill 4 drinks and two appetizers were completely comped
others i have gone with say the beers are amazing but i wouldn't know because here i prefer wine
The beers on tap were posted in good view on the chalkboard most hover around $6 and go up from there to $10 for a pint - pricey but this is the good stuff Lagunitas Chimay etc
The beer they serve was pretty good as well
We started out with a bottle of wine recommended by our server not one of the pricier ones and it was excellent
Again great service and excellent wine selections
I don't drink anymore but back in the day I got really tore up at Shady's strong drinks good conversation a good place to hang out especially on a Sunday
The staff was good as well as their drinks
Maybe I'm getting old haha I just don't expect to spend over $12 on a quick lunch tax + tip I love a good lunch time special that gives me a meal bonus points if it's on the healthy side with a drink for under $10 tax and tip included
Great staff Good food High Price TagFood and wine was great
The only good thing about this location was our waitress Betsy she was very nice helpful and kept our drinks full
99 wines that could rival two buck chuck prepared foods are very tasty and they have huge price cuts on things about to expires produce meats dairy prepared foods which is perfect if you're stopping in for dinner that night
It doesn't take too long to get a drink and there is a good variety of beer/wine
It's clean and has nice seating and good food and beer selections
World of beer should be amazing but instead it's beyond lame
The service was excellent and the wine list was good
The drinks are amazing- every last one of them- but the margaritas are the best I've ever had
The beer selection is AMAZING and the bartender let me sample a few on tap of course before I made my selection
I am a fan of wheat beers but there's a certain flavor I've never been able to tolerate in about half I've had
Patience is worth it in this place the food and beer and atmosphere is just awesome
Good vegetarian choices LOTS of wine and booze tastings Roger Clyne and his delicious tequila and way less annoying people than GAP
also their pomegranate green iced tea is so good i didn't drink anything else for months
After my wonderful massage I had a wonderful wrap sandwich and a glass of sangria sitting in the outdoor area
Either way the drinks were good although we were drinking a bit much - then again it was Cinco de Mayo
We had an amazing table with a dramatic view of the Valley and a very knowledgeable server expertly pairing wines at the drop of a dime
My friend and I had 1 plate of nachos appetizer and 3 beers and the total came out to 30 dollars
They do have some good hh deals on a few apps beer and house wine
I had a delicious mojito and my husband Dave had a glass of Torrontes white wine
This is definitely an excellent choice for weekend night drinks or weekday happy hour or dinner
As usual I asked the bartender what she recommended and she basically made one up that wasn't on the menu whipped cream vodka with root beer and it was AWESOME
Nonetheless if someone ever asks me where to go for a nice slice of Sicily I will happily recommend Crust Pizza & Wine Cafe
-Strong drinks-Friendly & attentive waitstaff-Tasty & interesting specialty appetizers that just had to try kettle of green chili pork & green chili mac 'n cheese
Food*Bruschetta toppings are really solid but bread is a bit soft*Vegetable salad is really fresh but could use better lettuce*Tuna panini was really good and quite large for the priceDrink *Bloody Mary Martini with jalapeno vodka and fresh mozzarella garnish is where it's at*The glass of Albarino $5 during happy hour was really crisp and goodWhat makes the Living Room different is that it's much more of a swanky/loungey feel while the 5th and Wine spot feels a bit more cafe-like
A good friend dragged me here one night three years ago playin' it up over their cheap Red Stripes her drink of choice and well drinks vodka being my drink of choice; though preferably not well
PERKS Looks like excellent happy hour specials apps drinks M-F with reverse happy hour daily
Not only did this Sincerre which is quickly becoming my new go to wine  pair wonderfully with our meal but at $44 it was a bargain
Off the tap the beer had a nutty flavor a little malty and not very bitter
When they brought our drinks out they also brought a bread plate that had soft pretzel sticks and three different flavored butters
25 beers in a mug and $5 pizza's and appetizers
Boy-o have I've put in some good hours here at The Half Moon particularly because many of my friends-slash-footie-teammates are servers bartenders and managers and insist that we drink their booze whilst we watch them work i suppose
Food was on point the beer is good the happy hour specials seem promising and the staff is cool
Service was good but I wish the drink menu stated that they had Blue Moon on tap didn't want Bud Light or Miller Lite
I had never thought of having a glass of wine with a burger before but I must say the Ravenswood Icon Syrah was excellent
The wine itself was delicious but with the USDA Choice all-natural grainfed Certified 4 Diamond Angus Beef it was to die for
i have always loved  whole foods but this one tops them all as they have an amazing bar with at least 20 beers on tap- microbrews and imports
Good drinks and creative menu in a stylish atmosphere
Basically its a 'good' place to go wine and dine
Plus their milk shakes are excellent food is made to order and not under a lamp and if you stay and eat there seating is in abundance there are misters outside and the drink selection is plentiful
In all fairness I am yet to have a full meal here but have been to happy hour a couple of times for wine and appetizers
This is a GREAT place if you like good wine for reasonable prices
The bus staff was so good - ours took personal pride in what he did and seemed to sweep by as a shadow to clear empty plates and fill glasses
The service was very good and there are some good specialty drinks that were well made
We ordered this The natural drink ohh the flavors I loved them
I once went to a perhaps unsurprisingly now defunct Trader Vic's in Washington for happy hour and was impressed by neither the food nor the drinks - this is not that story
The queen bitch had her eye on me though and like a good divey day drinking spot should be I did not have to seek and destroy to get another beer
It has a nice patio to relax with your choice of drink/very flavorful teas or bubbly at affordable prices  $7 a glass
Good thing I decided to share not only my wine bottle but meals too
the sorrel drink was gingery hibiscus goodness
And if that doesn't fill you up there's del piero their small bistro that features sandwiches tasty fresh side dishes soft drinks  pastries & coffee drinks
SUPER GOOD prices-only $5 for a glass of wine $3 beers and well cocktails
Also as a past bar tender myself I have been very pleased with the martinis and mixed drinks that they serve and no one is more critical than a bar tender I am slightly embarrassed to admit that their frozen margaritas I know I know I did drink a frozen margarita are really really good
This is not a Sports Grill you go to for crappy food and good beer I'd say it's a Sports Grill you go to for good food and crappy beer
It was better than your average bar food but I think in this day and age of gastro-pubs and high end wine bars you have to have quality food
The Beer Bites were tasty but lacking in seasoning
I am not a huge coffee drinker so take that with a grain of salt but I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it
Drinks did include a wonderful selection of Jamaican soda
You would probably need the drinks to mask the poor quality of the food
The waiter took our drink order and brought a loaf of bread that came with two spreads - both were excellent
Not impressed that at 530pm I had to valet when I'm with the family I'd just rather park and walk needed to walk off the prime rib and wine anyways
For what it's worth this is the only stuff we drink at home now after trying it first at the PHX Public Market and then in a gift basket from ZonieBaskets
We left no room for dessert but we can vouch for the bar  fantastic cocktails Bitter Bees was a really good one and if you're a white wine drinker either of the albarinos are great but the Licia was a perfect pair with the rich salmon
Both are very tasty and wont way you down afterwards for additional drinks or desert
Their drink specials are ok but not amazing
Maybe we thought it was good because we were full of wine
They also have an excellent happy hour with half priced entrees and good drink specials
You are sitting in a lovely place with fresh flowers and quality food where the napkins are linen the salad plates are chilled and the wine list is extensive and extremely reasonable
If however you're on handlebars and looking for a spot to dive in for a couple beers good grub bikes to gawk at fire up a cigar and head back out on the road
shrimp appetizer one glass wine 2 beers
Service was great drinks were fast the food was very flavorful with a nice presentation
I wavered on my first selection and asked the him for a drink recommendation
The bartender who served me was good she offered up her personal favorites and recommended other beers based upon the IPA that I ordered and even gave samples without me having to ask for one
So if you have some free time during the weekday and want the opportunity to sample a good variety of beers then I'd recommend giving WoB a shot
good drinks good music a dance floor for those who really get to feelin' it
They have a great happy hour with certain drinks at less than $4 and an appetizer option for a discounted price
I wipe my hands after finishing the appetizers with the only small drink napkin they brought us
Had some good wines and I had the organic wine Pinot Grigio which was really nice
I met a bunch of my neighbors drank a bunch of good beer had a cheesy dinner with a kick and fell in love all at that same moment
Finally after about 10 minutes he comes over and takes our drink orders and recommend some specials
My drink was very nice I had the Green Arnie which was nice if a little subdued flavor wise
Ordering the meals went smoothly food came out in a decent amount of time and the margarita drink was good flavored not that strong
I recommend the SunSpot Gold beer or the Hefewizen
We had I light flavored beer the waitress recommended
We were having a good time at bar at  the Fairmont Princess Hotel on the New Year's Eve of 2012/2013 where we had purchased a table and three bottles until the end of the night when we were awaiting a cab/town car to take us home so that we would not have to drink and drive
My favorite was the baked beans and the house made rootbeer which had an almost medicinal kick to itOverall the food was ok and the fun retro atmosphere is worth the vist if you're in the area
They also have good prices on wine larger selection than some wine stores
I was so stoked for the Crepes and Craft beer event@ Hanratty's w/Truckin' Good Food but I can't say I could 'rave' about any of it
Interesting Arizona wine selection was generally good
The wines were good the staff was fantastic the prices were a little stiff
Dinner for 2 2 drinks 2 appetizers 2 main dishes 2 desserts
I went with two of my friends for some appetizers and drinks this past Friday and it was so yummy
Everything was very good and provided a great base for the drinking that was going on
While the drinks were rather pricey they were very good
It also looked like the bartenders were making some pretty good drinks
Food is very good though pricey and cost of drinks is commensurate
I definitely recommend arriving before 7 PM and after 9 PM on the weekends otherwise you will wait 45 minutes for a table standing around without a drink
I have not had the pleasure of enjoying a full meal from Central Grille but I have had many drinks and appetizers from there
The portions are yes small but after an appetizer and some wine I did feel satiated
When I dine at finer establishments I'm normally offered free dry cleaning or an appetizer/drink of choice
You never can really trust the opinion of a bar from an out-of-towner who's only been once so take mine for what it's worth but I will say I'll be sure to have a few drinks here next time I'm in town
Our wait was 2 1/2 hours of which we spent sitting outside having a couple drinks and appetizers from the bar
The first night we went we noticed the bartender consuming large amounts of alcohol while working from shots to beers was kinda strange but we were having a good time so I guess we didn't mind
Sure it's a cool looking place and I'd go again if it were just for drinks but I wouldn't recommend it as a restaurant
Started with excellent service were greeted promptly with a smile and received drinks and menus
I had a well poured cocktail and my guest enjoyed a very cold beer
Highly recommend the Quesadillas Mexico City style to start off; nothing like it in town and positively delicious with a cold beer or margarita on the rocks
The music is always good even if you've never heard of the song the performers are phenomenal the drink prices aren't awful and it is one of the best places to people watch on Mill Ave
I arrived early so I sat at the bar and ordered some calamarisee picsPJ the bartender took very good care of me he was funny without being obnoxious we watched jeopardy together and he knew all the answers he even gave me a wine tasting tour of the most expensive wines they have
Luckily I had a few drinks and enjoyed the extra time with my friends
If you want a Scottsdale vibe with overpriced drinks and unauthentic food then this is not the place for you but if you want home flavor cooking with fresh ingredients with an authentic smile then don't miss trying out this great new hot spot
We tried one of their flat bread cheese crisp type appetizers which was a perfect compliment to my drink
Their beer is truly fresh and outstanding-their Peach beer is legendary but every single one is amazing
No I am not a street performer but work for a local advertising agency and the restaurant options if you are looking for good pizza and wine or beer is non existent
The sangria margaritas and wine are all really good
Good breakfast in the AM  at a reasonable price and drinks in the PM
The beer was ice cold and delicious and the margarita was one of the best I have ever tried
It was so good I ordered a second one for us to share after I finished my beer
However they did have a very                       good list of wines and some nice bottles of beer available                      for those who are seeking stronger libations for lunch
This is just the type of hole in the wall type of place where you can always count on a cold beer in a frosted mug and some really good options when it comes to really unhealthy food that rocks
I was expecting a Native New Yorker-type place so I was flustered when I saw the extensive beer list- I quickly ordered something the waitress just told me they were out of then changed it to just a Blue Moon then asked what stouts she recommended before settling on
Fortunately the inner turmoil was quelled when the drinks came- the cider was excellent
The food was fabulous and the drinks were amazing
they also feature stella on tap and many other good beers
It's definitely cool good jukebox and good beers
Today I started with a glass of lemonade a big pulled pork sandwich some tasty skin-on mashed potatoes & creamed corn
This is also a good spot to sit back and relax with a glass of wine in hand
no insurance accepted just $29 no tax either its just $29 they dont do eye exams so you have to have a prescription but they will call your dr if you dont have it with you the service is always amazing & they will adjust your glasses for free as many times as you need did i mention im clumsy
However I think Cheuvront is probably best enjoyed when taking advantage of their wine selection
For drinks I recommend their sparkling sake
The only high point is that they offer this really tasty diet Soba grapefruit flavored drink at their soda fountain
Get the margarita pizza and nice salad a great bottle of Italian wine the wine list is extensive and priced well a seat on the patio and you'll have a wonderful evening
Before I forget or the keyboard shorts out from me drooling the wine selection here is also amazing
Beer choices good unfortunately out of my first pick but can't knock 'em too bad for that and a bit warmer as well again my choice
Travis one of the wine makers was very attentive and had some good recommendations
On the good side the water glasses were filled with great regularity
We had great gellato sushi and would have gone to Yardhouse which in addition to beers from everywhere on tap has an excellent menu
Aside from the beer the food is AMAZING
I love the diverse beer selection and after telling the guy what I liked in beer he picked the Kronenberg which is what I drink on tap at Cornish Pasty which I get to drink with delicious food so he was totally spot on
I tried the chocolate beer flavor and after just trying those I was hooked
Excellent beer selection and from what I could tell a solid wine offering as well
Use him for all his wonderful winey wisdom
Also if you like Kirin beer- every Kirin you order allows you to choose an appetizer add-on for $
I mean the flavors and variety and range of beer is much easier to distinguish than wine
Thank goodness we were able to take our glasses of wine from our dinner at Ocean Trail up here
Our server tended to forget about us once the appetizers were served and drinks went empty for longer than I prefer
They have some amazing beers on tap all brewed inside the same building
The service is excellent with plenty of help around to make sure your glass is refilled and you have everything you need
My sister and I ordered alcoholic beverages mine was good but I wish it had more alcohol and the glass seemed really small
We ended up ordering 2 appetizers 3 specialty rolls 4 martinis and a bomber and had more food than we knew what to do with
I think the food is worth the price and the porch is great for casual wine drinking  I'll definitely be coming back
The wine parings chosen for each course were perfect for what I was eating I love good wine
Luckily his counterpart who was serving the next table over took pity on us and refilled our bread basket and water glasses offered us fresh ground pepper for our appetizer and  answered our questions about the dishes our own waiter had abruptly plunked down in front of us before bolting back to the hostess station
They do have a decent selection of on tap beers so for a show and a few drinks it's a good night out
Sundays 1/2 priced bottles of wineRetro modern spacious designTasty pretzel buns n' brew combinedAre simply divineDidn't like the crabmeat and artichoke dipFlavor was out-stripped By competing with the spicy pita chipsWill be back to try moreAfter all there's a new menu to exploreAnd plenty more beer to pourHope I don't pass out on the floorA great place to flirtTo hear the latest dirtIn the women's restroomWho's dating whom
We would normally have enjoyed their extensive wine list but we were in the mood for cocktails on that particular night so we ordered mojitos
Came here after flying in for work and wanted something that would be light have a good wine selection and a nice outdoor patio/bar area
My favorite places to go are ones that have a good bar -have some drinks appetizers and good conversations with friends
I don't usually like beer but this was particularly tasty
I also love the idea behind this place - a place that specializes in quality Arizona foods AND wines
She wants to come back soon and try every single one of their appetizers and sample some other AZ wines
Overall I would go back with friends and possibly bring a dog or two have some tasty drinks and split some chips
Pretty girls good food and a surprising selection of decent beers
The lovely duo of Megan and Gretel took care of me with good food and drink and everybody I met there was really quite friendly
Their beer selection is good and their French fry selection was decent too
I would only recommend going here if you are looking to eat quick because the place is EMPTY and are craving beer and fries
Go for lunch and you pay a fraction of what Modern Steak gives you in return - an upscale experience top notch food good selection of wines and a full fledged coffee bar
The drinks are good and the appetizers are fantastic
Very romantic good music and the O SPOT drink is FANTASTIC
this place is another trendy flamboyant read Gay owned restaurant that serves good drinks offers trendy waiters that pretend they are the food version of a Sommelier and act like they have a PhD in food and know so much more about chicken enchiladas than you do so for the average Joe white dude in Phoenix they are impressed by this
Really tasty and the crust had the right chewiness to my taste
50 I enjoyed a kids meal including a drink no age limit on the kids deal
The food always comes out fast and the service is usually pretty good; someone will usually offer to refill your drinks which is nice for a fast food-type place
I went in looking for some cheap boardshorts nothin good but found some nice sunglasses that actually fit my crooked ears and didn't have tacky designs all over them which is a rare find so I figured what the hell nice new shades
so anyway a friend recommended this place and I was taken care of by Adrian who btw did a fantastic job on the haircut never mind the fact that he was quick to make sure I had my drink of choice by my side very cool
They have a good broad variety of beer and wine as well as an adequate amount of selection on the dinner menu
I was impressed that they served mu by the glass
We were taken to our table and we waited probably a good 20 minutes until somebody came to take our drink order
We saw a few hawks and eagles learned about the local vegetation including a really cool clubbed saguaro found out when the fishing season was and enjoyed some great local beers Four Peaks on the boat
Good food great beer selection really bad service
The martinis were shaken and poured in the most excellent manner - and man am i seriously picky about ingredients the mix the shaking  presentation and the pour please have little ice floating please be ICE cold frozen tini glass earns extra points
We went for drinks and to share an appetizer
Scale of 1-10 multiple visits8 Food9 *DRINKS*8 Service8 Atmosphere7 ValueDon't underestimate the power of a good Marg
I can't remember what local beers we had but they were excellent
Her recommendation for craft beer was dead on
I recommend this a top place for Friday Afternoon Drinking Club
I think the next time I visit it will be just for a few drinks and an appetizer
They have a few specials which elude me now but I remember one involves 20 bucks for wine and an appetizer
As if all of this wasn't good enough already it gets better you can BYOB/W here and he'll even provide the wine and beer glasses
Now i'm quite into girlier beers so I will say that if you're looking for a light and sweet beer the Orange Blossom is amazing steer clear from this beer if you're into hoppy bitter beers
I tasted and tasted and tasted some more LOL Probably tasted 1 1/2 glass worth of different Italian wines
Add in friendly service and a pretty good wine selection and you've got yourself a fun evening
The beer was cold and had a nice flavor to it
For the 5 of us to eat plus 3 beers for my bro and an appetizer the bill with tip came to over $100
Focus on the cheap drinks and the amazing food and you will love this place forever
I enjoyed a wonderful glass of Pinot while Dr
A decent beer selection although not anything worthy of a WOW
it would be easy to say oh this is a fake beer bar it's just jumping on the good beer bandwagon and so on
Now when I'm buying underwear at Target I have a place to pop in for a quick pint of some good beer
I'm not saying I'd choose this over a Papago just that it's great to see good beer getting more and more mainstream
So getting good beer at a Tempe Marketplace is a great thing
Speaking of their cocktails the martinis which I have had on a different occasion are quite good
My family was so impressed by how cold the beer was
I strongly recommend the fruit drink with chunks of fruit in the picture
I was wary of trusting Yelp after the debacle of culinary excrement served to me at Wineburger but Rocket Burger delivered the beefy goods
I'm not a big exotic soda pop fan but as previously noted if you are they've got probably 6-8 big coolers worth of everything from cream soda to energy drinks to regional colas
It took two trips to get all the drinks and she asked about appetizers and took our orders
The food is AMAZING and they have a great wine list as well
Also just a side note they have the really cool new Coke machines that allows you to mix flavor into your fountain drink as seen on Food Network
We went for a couple of appetizers to share and a dessert along with wine pairings for each dish
There is a deli fresh seafood in some cases so fresh it is still alive beer and wine saki and other cooked meats frozen foods packaged products cookware and utensils and an entire aisle of every kind and flavor of ramen you can imagine and guaranteed to be the best you will ever have
DrinksOrdered the Bobby Q seasonal draft beer and my friend ordered a drink the waiter recommended some mixed drink that came in a pineapple
They were also pretty good about keeping the water glasses full
their drink menu leaves a little to be desired but i do recommend the pomegranate infused wine
I love sitting at the bar here the employees will always give you a great recommendation on things to try and their local beer that they serve goes really well with whatever you order
We had an appetizer two entrees dessert 2 glasses of wine and a beer and our bill came to $68 pre-tip
They now have a cafe which serves edibles such as gelato sandwiches baked goodies and coffee drinks
Good service and drinks are served in jars gotta love that
The double burger was worth the money and the guy delivering it to my table asked if I needed condiments or a drink refill -- I thought that was nice
The drink are tasty strong and well-priced consider the quality of the drink and ambiance
Jade bar has a very nice happy from 4-6 where drinks and appetizers are half-price
While the drinks were all very delicious and strong the food was not spectacular
come for this amazing drink that you will simply not believe
the hummus was good but since they were out of their usual variety our drinks were comped
The menu had a variety of salads burgers and sandwiches & the food was tasty and drinks are even better
The servers are always super polite and good at sticking around your table so your not left without a drink
Started with some of their drink specials which were tasty and unique concoctions
We ordered the  grilled artichoke which was of course amazing a vegetable pizza and another round of drinks
so when you want a quick pick me up head over there Music is upbeat place is colorful food is delicious and fresh made drinks pretty darn tasty too
I had the beer battered shrimp which were huge and their beans and rice were so flavorful
Both were good but not exceptional; the quality of the root beer and ice cream was average
She made a great wine recommendation subbed out the fries for steamed veggies and what a great meal
If head chef Rick is there think Kyoto of Empire at 24th and Camelback then Ichi Ban University off McClintock ask him to make you a Fat Bob on Acid for good ol' times' sake
The bartenders are really good and can make almost any drink
The drinks are incredibly small and a bit of a rip off but I was impressed that they had the Caribbean drink called the PAINKILLER
And my pama martinis were so delicious that I had 3
All the drinks are either a dollar or two off and the appetizers are all half price
The drinks are pricey and so is the food but it's worth it for the customer service and quality
In addition to the fries the staff is always friendly it's never too crowded it draws an interesting blend of customers all ages families single 20-somethings and the beer is pretty good as well
They have a good selection of better beers Fat Tire was our beverage of choice along w/ Maker's Mark for the birthday boy at entirely reasonable prices
1/2 price bottle of wine from 3 pm to close great bar drinks pricey yes and simple but good food
The drinks are super cheap the sound is good and the music is wonderful
However i would go back possibly for drinks and appetizers
Overall though the crowd is lively the pianists are entertaining to watch and the drinks are good
They carry German/Russian/Eastern European itemsGreat beer soda and juice varietyGood cheap Thai chile's
Anyways I saw some people ordering food I was just here to drink and it looked pretty good
I know you're wondering why I would wait the 15 minutes but I really wanted to see just how bad the service was going to be and frankly I just wanted some good $2 wine
I wish that I could actually review their wine and food but the service was so poor and substandard that it's not worth giving them my money
For the adults they have some pretty good drinks including some wine  Guinness and Blue Moon
The beer menu while small has a few quality and local offerings and is varied enough to satisfy most everyone
I wanted to give this place 5 stars because it is truly a wonderful jazz/wine bar
The bartender made a very good drink and the shirt allowed me to get up to the front of the line
50 pints during Happy Hour*Decent selection of beer including Stella and Pinstripe mmm*So-good-you-want-to-moan artichoke dip which would be that much better if served with warm pita bread; not chips*Cool decor with a spacious modern outside patio*Friendly and attentive service*Beautiful and/or interesting people to watch*Fave candle and hand lotion in the ladies room*Attracts an array of patrons like muscle-y tat guys Euro intellects  buxom beauties network engineers and writers*Trivial Pursuit cards on each table - woohoo
The drinks were good but nothing that I haven't had before elsewhere
The good Responsive management who seemed to truly care that I had a bad experience at his restaurant the wings decent drinks and a good selection of beers
Better than my initial review indicated but it didn't live up to the promise of its very delicious wings and beers
The food and wine pairings were delicious and the impeccable service by our waiter Oliverio as well as the Chef coming out and presenting each plate made for a very memorable evening
They also have amazing drinks decent desserts and pretty yummy appetizers
The same person made my coffee drinks each time and the quality was consistent
Our waitress checked on us regularly and we always had our tea and water glasses filled which I think is always a sign of good service
The ambiance food and direct interaction with the staff was all really good and we still wound up having a great time helped along by a few glasses of wine but I really can't let it go that two direct requests were essentially ignored along with the feeling that we were not being treated equally to some of the other guests
The only  thing good I have to say about this place is that every time I ordered a beer the waitress brought me one immediately and then about 20 minutes later the busboy would bring another out to me thinking I never received the first either way no matter how drunk I got the food never tasted good
The service was reasonably attentive- we never lacked for food or drinks and had an absolutely wonderful time
The food is amazing and their wine list is impressive
I forget the name but I tried all of my friends' drinks and they all tasted yummy and for 1/2 price that's always a good thing
The beers are cold you can order the MAN size or girl size nice marketing ploy  The food was better than I had anticipated with large portions and full of flavor
The happy hour and reverse happy hour specials are very good for both food and drinks
The beer selection is marginal at best though the African Amber was quite tasty
He had great recommendations for food and beer; our food came out fast and our drinks never wanted for refills
I could keep drinking those all night I just may not have a good morning the next day
The drink menu is unique and offers a good variety of different tastes
Upon reading various reviews about Chef Gross we were both very impressed by his awards varying from Open Table's Diner's Choice Local Eats 2010 and Phoenix Magazine's review to Food & Wine Magazine's Top 10 Best Chef as well as a James Beard Award Winner his resume speaks volumes about his food
We tried the beer sampler which I recommend anyone who has never been here and there is not a beer I wouldn't order
Hmm now I'm thirsty for overpriced beer-flavored water
He came with good suggestions for wine pairings knowledge about the menu and timed our food to an absolute T
Not only was the beer excellent but the bartender exceeded expectations
Good forDatesInternship meetingsSending parents when you need to clear the beer cans from you placeChillin with friends
I wasn't super impressed the place food was average service was average and the drink prices were average
We opted for the $125 tasting course and requested that the chef recommend wine pairings
The beers are consistently good and the food is above reproach with fantastic daily specials some of which you'd only find at high end restaurants
Not too difficult to find I parked right near the entrance and had that strange revelation that I was finally entering a worthwhile wines and spirits mecca
Right at the entrance were shopping carts and it's a good thing I grabbed one because I ended up purchasing more than a few good wines and liquors - at least the ones I seem to be happy with
The Phoenix Art Museum's bar Artenders was a little harder to contact and communicate with but they were honest and accurate in their billing and they made good drinks
There's a good selection of wine and also some interesting beers
They have a filet cobb salad with a red wine vinaigrette which is really good and I always love the baked broccoli or the honey-gooped carrots not their real name
I had the 2 item lunch special and also got the beef enchilada with beans total cost came to about $8 and another $2 for the drink so with tax and tip it didn't cost much at all for a good meal in a restaurant
But despite all that every single time I have been here maybe 4 or 5 times in my good faith effort to give it a shot my drink has been really crappy
Great beer fun atmosphere and good food as well
You can't go wrong with a brewery with good beer that serves good food as well
We got 2 burgers/fries and 2 drinks for 20 bucks and it was worth every penny
I could hang out in the courtyards with a cool glass of lemonade some of their fresh baked breads and a good book all afternoon
We decided on having appetizers & drinks only that day  since they did not have the full menu & were closing early
We ordered some poolside drinks and food and enjoyed ourselves immensely
The weather was perfect for it just a slight chill in the air while we enjoyed some cool white wine
My husband tried a dark beer last night that even I thought was good and I am not a dark beer fan typically
Beyond the schedule1 Drink selections are no good either
It is located in a strip mall on Scottsdale Road toward Tempe in a strip mall as most of the good restaurants in the area are Walking in it is a bit confusing as you go through AZ Wine which is a very large wine store with a great selection of Sake Wine Half Bottles Craft Beer Aventinus so turn to your left and there you will see the dining area if no one is immediatly there someone will pop up shortly as there are only two people working the front of the house
Once we got settled with drinks in hand a server brought out three kinds of fries with three sauces as a little appetizer for the table
We told him what our favorite wine was and while they didn't carry it he did find another Cabernet that was very good and actually made it on my list to have again
The standard goodTacos- steak chicken grilled fish breaded fish shrimp all yummyIce cold beerHelp yourself to the Salsa Bar with fresh cut lemons limes and jalepeu00f1os too
Their drinks were exquisite and judging by the pretzels I know they probably have some other good menu items up their sleeve
Our meal including an appetizer salad two entrees and wine was just over $100
From the martinis the appetizers pastrami pork belly is really that good
I liked this place in previous years when their selection was more focused on the quality craft beers
It's a Starbucks they burn the coffee beans and use really artificial flavors but I'm addicted and so are you so we all grumble and pretend to be coffee aficionados while take the mediocre drinks on our daily commutes
He did pour me slightly more wine than my boyfriend but I don't know if it was worth the extra $3
The drinks were pretty good but expensive
I was surprised by how tasty the watermelon wheat ale is - smells like a Jolly Rancher but has a smooth easy-to-drink flavor
We had a catered lunch in a small conference room which was delicious an assortment of sandwiches and tossed salads champagne wine while the guest speakers were presenting
As a concert venue - 4 stars - easy to get to friendly staff affordable drinks good sound and a stream of good acts
We really enjoyed the rye wine this one was 12%
The beer bread was tasty and comparable to a tortilla  but thicker but not as thick as pita bread
The beer selection was amazing for a small place
There is a cover after 1030 but never too pricey and well worth it considering the drinks are good and a good price
I told her I had just moved here and she was more than happy to share her tips on other good places to drink
I also had unfiltered sake really good as well
Either way it didn't seem worth the $10 I spent there on a basic sandwich and drink
They also have a good amount of beers that originated from Europe
They also have an interesting order form for charcuterie which was really tasty and went well with their different wines by the glass
I can't come up with a single complaint delicious food friendly and helpful staff free samples of items if you're a first timer trying to decide a huge plate of food for the price and they even sell beer
Wine list is a bit below average but probably a good edit for the audience
For instance with only a few wines on the wine list - the staff really should be able to recommend something
We started with the rattlesnake appetizer drinks and fry bread
The orange chicken was slightly better quality than Panda Express and really not very good and very odd for a German beer place
Stopped by Brix yesterday to check it out after it came recommended from a wine friend who lives up north
Overall if you get out of work early go here to get some amazingly cheap drinks
The coffee/drink bars and the props from other shows in the lobby also provide good relief during the intermissions
If you are looking for a good beer and WAY better service do yourself a favor and go to Red Robin
I loved the patio the seats were very comfy I enjoyed the wine and I enjoyed my couple hours there in holiday mode
Tasty little burgers and beer in a modern setting what isn't there to like
It seems that they have good beer specials most of the time
The desserts were the highlight of the meal and they had a good selection of wines by the glass
I've been here a few times since they opened i live next door and have always had amazing food drink and service
ordered drinks and apps all came out fast and amazing as always
Good stiff drinks great appetizers though I wish they'd put the seared Ahi back on the happy hour menu
It fills up quickly but it's absolutely worth it when you're paying between $4-7 for your drinks and appetizers
The beer/wine is good the food is good I like the southwestern egg roll apps the price is good the service is good and the atmosphere is nice thought I was going to say good huh
I must go back when I have some time to have a drink because this place is where I want to relax and have a good time
Tons of good looking people inside chatting and drinking up
The food is good and reasonably priced and the same can be said of the drinks
Expect good food good beer & fun with your friends but don't base your experience off the waiters because youll probably be let down
Most of the staff here have good customer service skills and I even see the manager busting his butt busing tables refilling glasses seating people and expediting food leadership by example
The food was excellent the wine selection was excellent & the service was EXCELLENT
Service was very good the girl was very nice and kept my glass full of some delicious ice tea
It did take our waitress awhile to greet us and take our drink order but other than that slowness at the beginning the rest of the service was good
They also offer an assortment of hot teas plenty of coffee and mocha drinks Italian soda and lots of baked goods although I'm fairly certain they are not baked there for you to grab and go
So a spontaneous decision leads a bunch of wayward people to a  good meal and good drinks
We sat down researching wines on our phones for a good 15 minutes or so before we were called to our table
That is one of my favorite desserts and turning that into drinkable goodness I was very happy
first we got seated and then didn't see a waiter for a good 10 minutes--she then asks if we would like a drink--I ask her a question about a wine--she says she doesn't know--that she knows more about the reds than the whites--I had to ask her to go ask my question to the bartender--instead of coming back to our table--and answering my question--she goes off to another table and takes their order--so we got off to a pretty rocky start
I'm bumping Rula Bula up to four stars because I always have a good time drinking there with my husband and friends
I kinda got lost looking at the beer menu as I'm not a huge beer fan but wanted to give something a try so I asked for a recommendation from the bartender
Thanks Brat Haus for delivering a fun and flavorful alternative to the ohso boring wine bars
The wine was 40 bucks for a carafe  maybe if we would have got a 100 dollar bottle we would have gotten better service  The Dessert was good it was a rich chocolate cake with nuts and chocolate sauce
Overall the experience made the meal not worth the 115 bucks in these times not to mention they overcharged my girls card for the drinks at the bar
On the way we found fresh squeezed lemon ade - and I mean fresh; the guy squeezed lemons into the cup added filtered water amd sugar and poof - a delicious and refreshing drink
I tried a Japanese beer with the meal which was also very good and my husband had a Thai beer which he loved
Very good prices on beer & wine as well $13
The drink was my main reason for going out to lunch today and Chipotle has a margarita recipe that is Very Good
I recommend being patient ordering a cheese plate and sitting at the bar and asking advice on their wine - they have a great selection
There were so many excellent wines to choose from the water was even good as well and was served in a quaint old fashioned milk bottle
I would say that I could recommend it for a first date because you will spend at least an hour waiting for a table so grab a bottle of wine and chat however once seated in the restuarant the lazy romantic atmoshere diminishes
- Office assistants were nice too- Sat appt - Digital x-ray- Emergencies & walk ins welcome- Fees reasonable / 20% cash discount- Instead of getting a toy for the goodie bag we got a balloon & a Good Job certificate for Peter Piper personal pizza & a drinkThe bad- Need to redo their flyers to indicate that certain location Mesa don't have digital x-ray Sat appt etc
I thought that was pretty cool but that's about all that was cool about the place oh and the wine selection was very good
We ordered off the full menu had many appetizers to start full dinners desserts and drinks
The meal was quite pricey but that's often the case when you enjoy a few glasses of wine with your mean and that's not necessarily an issue with me as high quality restaurants like this aren't ones I visit often
The guy was good at the actual service part - refilling our drinks etc
Service is fair enough drinks are good but still not exceptional
Quickly I will give a recommended first trip order and then give details about what I love about this placeDrink Any Arizona Stronghold wine I really like their reds - Dala specificlyApp Meatball trio in Vodka Sauce - it didn't sound good to me either and then I tasted it WOW
Drinks  Very good wine selection whites and reds and they do a respectable job making sure to work in good quality local winieries Arizona Stronghold and Pilsbury come to mind
Food Good selection of wine and beer
We did not order any alcoholic beverages so I cannot comment on those but from the looks of the drink menu and all of the people around us ordering drinks they seem to be pretty good
I didn't try any of their food offerings just a beer enjoyed slowly and honestly felt like taking a little nap
As I was trying to decide on a drink I asked the bartender what a good option would be for something not too sweet and she said that she could have the HH Mojito not as sweet
The $3 draft from local only beers is AMAZING I recommend the Lumberyard Porter paired with anything
Service was good since our server seemed like she had an eye out for our glasses - more wine more water- Bam
Let me tell you these are no write home about tacos the salsa on the other hand I could drink both kinds it's really good
They do have some tasty drinks but their menu is lacking basic options for those of us that aren't quite up to par in the foodie world
Mixed drinks were goodOverall and OK place and might be worth trying again but only after trying some of the other places aroundExpensive for what you getNice surroundings
The staff really friendly and helpful I ordered a beer off a list of beer I have never had before I went with a Karlovacko it's the house lager I really enjoyed it had to order another
They have really good happy hour and brunch specials on drinks but I'm still undecided on the food
We had sake bombers which were great as always and a what we thought was complimentary four square check in edamame appetizer and then ordered the calamari
Their fish-n-chips on the night I went was near perfection with a nice strong beer flavor that is often listed beer battered but hardly ever tasted
I would recommend this place just to grab a drink and hang out
A bowl of Ramen in Japan is like getting a hotdog from a street vendor in New York it is supposed to be quick and inexpensive and while I understand that it is a niche kind of dish here I don't think $10+ for a bowl of soup and a drink is a very good value
For drinks we all got tea mine was the only unsweet one which was really good
The place has a very good beer and wine list with some interesting beer cocktailsBeers with a fruit puree mixed
I have found my new wine place and I can't wait to go back to try more of their delicious food
You can order some small appetizers there choose something from the beer and wine list try the dos cabezas if you like reds and they will come and get you when your table is ready
The only place I've seen come close is El Zocalo in Chandler but I don't think they hit that and they certainly don't have an entire page of a menu devoted to the delicious cactusy drink
I couldn't be happier-and recommend them HIGHLY if you have sliding glass door screen or sunscreen issues
A little magical a little homey a little bit of wonderful with great food and plentiful draughts and just enough contemporary edge that you can impress a date or drink with the dudes
We ended up paying about $150 including tax for 3 adults and considering the amount of wine we drank I think we got a good value out of it
So in order to quench your sudsy curiosity I recommend trying their SanTan Beer Sampler which will run you $8
The drinks are generally good especially when made by the owner
I recommendFox Sports MargBeersGrape Bombers
I love a good breve but stopped drinking them because of the outrageous fat content
For me beer is like enjoying a really good piece of bread
I tend to order dark beers since I enjoy the deep robust flavors and SanTan's Gordo Stout $4
The Gordo is one of the lowest alcohol content beer made here and for me one of the most flavorful
I was also excited to see the Quilmes beer as well as the Argentine wines -- I developed a fondness for them when I was studying abroad in Buenos Aires during college and I still love a good malbec more than just about anything else
Put on your must miss list everyone - just go for drink and maybe an appetizer but go somewhere else for your main meal
Yesterday I stopped in for a drink after a long morning of Christmas shopping and wasn't really sure what to order so I asked the barista for a recommendation no one was behind me in line so I didn't think it was a big deal
1 We were served by Serena who served us with a huge smile knew her beers and amazingly was happy to help us out
Every single visit all food all drinks service always good
Mind you if you try the bar on a Thur or Fri Happy Hr good luck even trying to find standing room let alone a drink
Scenario 2 I have a short time to chat up with friends visiting from out of town I can convince them to meet me for a high quality beer or wine before they pick up a case at Taste or relax without a bar scene' impending on our socializing
We went to a wine bar for drinks and appetizers before dinner so we did not sample any of the starters
All appetizers are half price and being a wine lover they have a great true Italian Chianti for $5
The bar had good service friendly bartenders moderate drinks and prices
The coffee is really good too and I'm not a huge coffee drinker
In the end my drink did turn out pretty good some mixed whiskey drink but that's not the only reason I go to a fancy bar
After getting our drinks we ordered our food and  that's where the good feelings quickly changed
- Cool 70s-ish tables and chairs- Cozy and dark and almost cave-like in a good way- Great menu - lots of choices- Awesome drink menu- Drunk people whooping it up at the bar- Lots of salt on rim of margarita and they even brought me extra salt when I asked yay- Lotions and potions and girly stuff in the bathroomDespite the taco situation I just kind of want to go back
We enjoyed our cheap drinks and cheap sushi which was really not that bad
You come here to drink and have a good time
the tap water tastes good the glasses are quaint and beautiful
Unfortunately the cost cutting has also affected the food and drink quality
They have a lot of beer on tap but it is almost not worth it just for the slow service  I know other reviewers had no problem with service but our server messed up our beer orders twice and was not quick about it maybe she was having an off night and the Snottsdale crowd
Why go to the Yardhouse where there are so many delicious beers on tap and order some sugary horrible cocktail
If you are looking for an impressive selection of beer show up to the Yard House  for happy hour order a good beer or two and then head on over to Papago Brewing for the rest of the night
My friend does not drink but I ordered the Rasperry Fruit Punch a very good drink made from Raspberry Wine with Fruit Punch
Appetizers pizzas and sushis half off plus drinks
My sister got the homemade rootbeer and it was delicious
Amazing patio great musiccheers to whoever auditions these people or trusts their mixed tape great wine selection and awesome food
Our server came and took our orders promptly was kind about waiting for my mother and aunt to decide what they wanted to drink water which again doesn't scream of good tips and eat
I also loved loved loved the eclectic beer list and did I mention the hummus was really good
This is an excellent place to go if you like meat potatoes and beer
He was quick to the table to ask us for our drink order of which he recommended a medium bodied Pinot Noir
With its sheer curtains and dim lighting it's a nice little hideaway where the drinks are tasty and the food is delicious
The server said that's a good question when I asked what kind of San Tan Brewery beer they had on tap
Bar area - nice vibe good simple drinksParking - lots of it
Being a lunch break we didn't get drinks but their margaritas looked delicious
Some of the selections on the drink menu sounded quite good and very reasonable happy hour prices
Their wine selections are categorized by color and regions and you will definitely be impressed
drink a few adult beverages and dive into some tasty wings or strippers
v's play cards or a board game even bring your own food in  if you want and just chill out and enjoy some good beers
If you want to buy some good wine - there are several good wine stores like AZ Wine for example around the valley with knowlegable staff to help you out
To wash down all this great Bobby Q we all had huge glasses of their house made sweet tea which was super sweet and delicious
I have eaten at this location once and the food was great I wasn't a huge fan of the bar area for after dinner drinks however the crowd skewed much older than my preference and I am no spring chicken the service was very good and extremely  friendly though so no complaints there great wine list despite the fact that the mark up for booze there is nothing short of highway robbery
While I tried the Bearnaise and red wine sauces the steak's natural flavor seasoned to perfection was really all I needed
The alcoholic drinks are very good and the button to call the waiter is fantastic but the food is lacking
The drinks were wonderful and I'm not a big sweet drink fan
They  were nice enough to bring us some super delicious complimentary dessert shots of a creamy cinnamony drink along with mini churros
The only thing I found lacking is a good premium beer selection
Three dollar beer wine specialty cocktails and appetizers
Once our names were on the list we scored a seat in the wine bar next door brilliant set-up when you have a captive audience and enjoyed a couple of glasses of chianti while we waited
More wine was ordered and we started with appetizers of spiadini grilled prosciutto-wrapped slices of fontina on rosemary skewers
Our server was very attentive and friendly and made some very tasty wine suggestions
We left with a small bill after a few drinks and some good food and vowed to go with friends again soon
Go to any of the other stadiums for a great venue shade food choices good beer etc
Service was good drinks were refilled and dirty plates were removed as needed
Our server recommended his favorite bottle of wine
It was very good and I don't usually go for blend wines
the food is very RICH especially their iced tea it's like drinking pure sugar soooo good
Was really good and I am a bit of a wine snob
Total close to 100$ but we had drinks appetizers two deserts etc
here I am in Tempe on Mills and I'm just looking for a place with good food and drinks
So this is a shorty review but if you are in need of food for a reasonable price that is good over conversation and drinks you might want to consider this one of your stops
Clubhouse seems to land hosting duties for some really great bands though so if you're a fan of good music you'll probably end up seeing a show here at some pointI can't imagine why anyone would come here just to drink however they definitely serve some strong drinks here
Plenty of parking good audio stiff drinks all-ages bar w/ ID good bands and enough of a dirty divey feel to bring you back to the good-old-days when music was good
As everyone enjoyed their drinks Aura and I shared the Lobster Mac and Cheese
On certain days they have a counter set up where you can sample wine one day we were lucky enough to sample some wonderful tequila
There is an amazing variety fair prices you can get 10% discount for buying a case of wine the staff is friendly and super helpful
Also it's not over priced for what it is 7 for an app 7 for a burger cheap beers good specials 4
That said--the food is good [kind of modern fusion] I've only been there twice for lunch so I can't say how dinner is and since I've only been there for lunch I can't say if the wine list is any good
The food however was very good and so were the drinks
Their shakes are pretty good and they give you a lot the glass plus any extra in the metal mixing cup
The good things- bar has nice strong drinks- the pool is super cool with waterfalls- free parking- decent size room and bathroomso even though the good things could make up for the first two 'bad things' and land the place a 3 star rating unfortunately those things don't make up for a good bed so 2 stars instead of 3
It took a good 10 minutes to get our drinks which were brought to us by our actual server with an apology for the bartender being backed up
House margarita was pretty good, but  overpriced $7 considering the glass was filled to the rim with ice, resulting in a rather small drink
The service was attentive, the drinks were imaginative and copious, and a good time was had by all
So I was more than happy to return recently for wine and appetizers under the stars
Sitting back and sipping a nice glass of Latour Domaine de Valmoisinne Pinot Noir I thought this is as good as it gets
We weren't full meal hungry so my friend and I decided on a few appetizers to enjoy along with our wine Escargots en Crou00fbte - this was my first experience with escargot and I will admit that due to an unfortunate childhood snail incident I was a bit hesitant
They ususally have good beer fun atmosphere and tasty bar grub
Also don't expect to be super impressed with the beer
We decided to have appetizers and drinks in the bar while waiting for our table
The dessert and drink were comped but even if they had not been it would have been worth it
Highlights Good beer selection friendly staff extensive menu with the emphasis on meat and pork stick-to-your-ribs German comfort food gemu00fctlichkeit ambience
This includes drink and is a good value I would imagine
He got our drinks and told us about the specials and his recommendations
There is also bar space where you can sit and enjoy a drink and appetizer or even dinner
The happy hour menu include teppanyaki sushi a lot of different appetizers and drinks
Excellent drink selection but like I said I had already had enough
Their happy hour prices are amazing especially for the sake bombs and the Tootsie Maki
My sandwich and home made potato 'chips' were fantastic I added a little malt vinegar and salt to them - and for a drink I had delicious iced green tea which somehow tasted like fruit loops
The downstairs and upstairs bars are tasty though the raspberry lemonade is too sour and the drinks have a lot of ice and priced in line with most other places
Most of their food is worthy of four stars they have a decent beer selection and know how to pour and the service is good
It has the best bar food you're likely to come across and some great beers that are so good you can even get them at the local liquor store
My drink was an overpriced can of soda and the whole deal was several dollars more than a wonderful meal elsewhere
To round out the evening our wines and the selection of wines were mediocre at best and the service was not worth mentioning
If you're looking for good local beer hit up Papago or Four Peaks instead and save your money and beer belly for something tastier
When our first waiter arrived he seemed friendly at first but when I asked him if the flirtini drink was any good he proceeded to say  If it wasn't good it wouldn't be on the menu We were like that is not necessarily true but hmm ok
It's quiet relaxing and a great place to enjoy good wine and good company
The selection of food is not as good as 5th and Wine but is great for an appetizer or snack
The waitress was very helpful and knew the menu and the wines and made some good recommendations love the Newton Chard
I've also got to give props to the well-made drinks decent beer selection friendly bouncers and a surprisingly good bar menu
While searching for a place for some drinks and appetizers in Scottsdale the other night some friends and I decided to pay Loco Patron a visit mostly due to their spacious outdoor seating
After seating ourselves my party was promptly met by a friendly server who brought out our drinks before taking our orders for several platters of appetizers
Admittedly and possibly for the first time ever I didn't keep track of the costs of our drinks and appetizers but we did take advantage of the Happy Hour menu that consisted of fried goodies and decent drink specials
While I suppose $21 is a bit steep for a sampling or two of each of the appetizers and two drinks each it wasn't unreasonable
We stayed to finish our drinks and enjoyed the music
I was there last night and enjoyed the $20 bottle of wine + bruschetta deal after 8 p
I am not a huge beer drinker they don't have a full bar and I asked for something sweet - the bartender recommended the Lambic and it was fantastic
Other than that it's a recommendable place if you just want to throw back a few drinks over good food
Split a salad with the house vinaigrette  add a glass of vino or a brew and you are good to go
Bottom line when a buddy wants to go grab a drink and some bar food I'll recommend we go here so at least I can eat something but the price point prohibits me from eating there even semi-regularly
I initially went to the Gordon Biersch in Tempe and was not impressed as their beers were flavorless
The first thing was the excellent beer selection right when you walk in
All I have to say about Harkins though is that if you see a lot of movies it is totally worth it to buy the cup and the shirt we never wear the shirt or even take it out of its package but it still gets us cheap drinks and free popcorn
I can have good Mexican food a lot of places and for a lot less than $40 for two people dinner drinks tip
It is a nice place for drinks and maybe appetizers
Our drinks arrived fairly quickly as did our appetizer
The drinks were ok quality of liquor used was lower end
Its a wonderfully relaxed enviroment and its someplace you can go by yourself too take a date or just meet up with people for wine or beer
All 5 of the other people in our group were drinking martinis which they all said were very tasty as well but at $12-$16 per I'm a little put off
I'm more of a beer guy anyway so I had a couple of craft-brews that are not available everywhere and then settled on a Firestone DBA -- a very very tasty beer -- and had several of those
I have never ordered a drink in this restaurant that was not good
This is one standard of Ocean Club that Flemings should scotch unless of course the waiter says i recommend the XXX at $21 a glass
The wine good as well the previous time they were out of the first three wines I ordered
I recommend sitting at the end of the bar where the table curves around where you can chat with your friends and of course Aaron which showed and offered up some of his favorite wines -- Thanks man
Besides the food they have an amazing selection of wine and specialty beers
However if you want a drink that is not on their special menu it will be just as amazingly delicious but a little pricey
The pizza was amazing and the few glasses of wine made everything even better   We sat outside in May though a little warm it was still enjoyable
My friend didn't like it too much when I got him one but then again he lives off of energy drinks so his taste buds are probably no longer attuned to the flavor of healthy
This meal would not be complete without ordering their super delicious Sweet Tea which is served in a glass jar
They also have a festive atmosphere for wine tasting - you can come in buy a bottle to open and have their cheese plate which looks delicious
We all ordered 2 bottles of sangiovese~merlo wine which was amazing and we also some of us split our meals which gave us a chance to try different things
However aside from the pain in the ass parking them not taking reservations being herded into his cramped almost non-air conditioned bar for overpriced drinks for hours then being made to sit at the bar instead of a table; the food was very good
For two people with drinks appetizer pizza and dessert you are looking right under a bill with tip
I'm picky when it comes to a quality diverse craft/micro beer selection
If you love good beerand I'm not a wine guy but their wine selection looks pretty large especially downstairs around the small sipping bar then you have to stop here
This place has amazing service and I'm still having a hard time believing that anyone would sell glasses at the price I paid or really why other places like Lenscrafters can get away with charging so much
The glasses were $29 she recommended upgrading to antiglare which brought the price up to $79
After about ten minutes someone came over to take a drink order and we ordered two cocktails both of which were excellently-crafted luxardo cherries *swoon*
Our server was great throughout the night and five of the six wine pairings were relayed to me as being very good
The beer selection is amazing and the food is top-notch for bar grub
Been there once and never went back again thanks to their awful long lingering wait staff that took forever to bring us drinks and food along with the low quality of the food
We had 4 alcoholic drinks and 3 non alcoholic and all were tasty
The service is amazing one time my good friend Adam tried to see if he could get his glass filled with ice since the waiter was on top of his water and never let it reach half full
Our waitress was very good and had this almost Amy Winehouse look going on
They have a pretty good selection of beers and wine all reasonably priced
Although the eggs were poached nearly perfectly they were covered in a bland red wine Hollandaise that looked like melted Silly Putty and lacked the citrusy brightness that a good Holalndaise should have
we ordered the Prickly pear and strawberry colada's very good she looked up and said nothing but continued making the ofter peoples drinks
Like the huge glasses of ice water and the fact that they leave the coffee pot at your table coffee flavor was distinctive but not over-roasted
allow you to drink beer/wine provide servers that bring you drinks and food during the show amazing recliners foods like hummus and paninis and awesome customer service
All in all it's not the most fancy place to go but its a good spot if you want to have some lunch do a little off track betting or just go for some drinks and food after work
I've good wines and bad wines but I'm fairly convinced anyone talking about the boquet of light oak with a strong raspberry melon finish is making it up or part of a cult
Maya recommended a fantastic wine and between her and Carla I sorted out which of their famous bruschetta I was going to try proscutto + fig salmon + capers tomato jam + goat cheese apple + brie
first time -- sat in the Bru Haus with friends and tried some beers we had never had the fresh-baked the tasty Belgian fries and a myriad of sausages
Oh and of course several rounds of good German beer
We often come on Thurs nights as they have all their Blue Bunny Ice Cream flavors for 75 cents although the wine probably is more my desert than ice-cream
Speaking of wine okay so we love Happy Hour Happy Hour is from 3 - 6 pm Mon - Sat with $2 off appetizers $5 glass of wine or $3 microbrews
We enjoyed our food and drinks on the cool patio area
I sit at the bar and there is usually a sports game on a good looking bartender pouring me coffee and a guy with a hangover wearing sunglasses wishing he'd ordered the breakfast burrito sitting next me
The Rojo Chili de La Casa is my go to unless they have a special like Machaca Tostada's or Country Benedict with sausage patties in place of Canadian HamThey are really good about keeping the drinks topped off
I had an Old Fashion whiskey drink which was delicious and a nice treat considering most bars in town aren't equipped to make 'em
Give me a great atmosphere tasty food made with fresh high quality ingredients good drinks AND be kind to my wallet then I'm yours
If sugar plum fairies came in the shape of delicious beer batter fried dogfish shark pieces
Two were from Arizona-a cream ale and Good Vibrations-and the third was from Montreal and made the other two seem like some ugz stepchildren of a beer master
our party of four got seated right away and we were quickly greeted by an amiable waittress who got our drink orders and an appetizer order
For vegetarians the Spicy Tofu Tacos were quite tasty but I would venture out to say that if you want a fun atmosphere with tropical style drinks then this would be the spot
00 appetizers and signature tropical drinks
Serve real salsa and guacamole Please for goodness sake
The second time was on a Saturday a couple weeks ago and my buddies wanted to check out a cool spot for food and drinks in Scottsdale so I took them here and it ended up being a good call
2nd experience 5 stars chill lunch atmosphere with good food and good drinks
Overall the food & drinks were good but I'm not really dying to come back
Also it ended up that you got a half glass at least with each course so I think it is a good value the wine pairing was an extra $45
So delicious that I overlooked the fact that it was not served to me in the bucket glass as deemed appropriate by the IBA
The drinks are good and strong and not badly priced
They had plenty of good choices for beer on tap
moreover it's rare to get a good drink at 3 Roots
Great place for a good drink and tasty burger
The Fish N Chips are just as good and if you're not a drinker grab a pint of Root-Beer
00 pint nights with the purchase of the logo glass so I intend to put it to good use
The problem is that they dont make amazing beer
Our beautiful spiked drinks arrived in tall pretty glasses and while P's was quite good mine tasted like a tea made from old sweaty gym socks
The owner was nice enough to invite us back and offer complimentary drinks and appetizer
Service is good and they have those great glass bottle sodas like San Pellegrino Aranciata I prefer the bottle over the can
The drinks were well priced I personally had good service so no complaints from me
I'll be back for happy hour it's tough to beat $5 for local beer convenience and some good TVs
They offer a great selection of beers at a very good price
We come early for the great Happy Hour with drink and appetizer specials
In terms of drinks my peach bellini was tasty and thankfully heavy on the prosecco and the few sips of St
Our drinks took FOREVER and our waiter was not very helpful for recommendations or in giving descriptions of the drinks Uh there's bourbon in it
I haven't had a drink at Nello's but they have some good beers on their list eg Franziskaner which I rarely come across
From the traditional Oggie with beef onions potatoes and rutabaga with a lovely red wine gravy to the adventurous Lamb Vindaloo with basmati rice potatoes lamb and a wonderfully spicy vindaloo sauce all of Dean's creations are worth trying
There's nothing amazing about the place except for scantily clad women and cold beer
Unfortunately none of us ended up having any wine even though the selection looked amazing but the food more than made up for that
Overall a pleasant experience good service nice atmosphere and a great wine selection
I would not say this was a really good value $15 for ten wings a glass of iced tea and a tip
You won't find donuts and egg dishes here but if you want amazing coffee drinks go to Dutch Brothers
I had two drinks while ridiculously expensive they were very good
They have a pretty good happy hour from 3-7pm with a variety of appetizers every day and assorted drinks except Saturday
The reasons it gets 2 stars and not 1 is the bartender who we met the night before at Citizen Public house is a good bartender and I have been here before on my birthday and we had a good time but the drinks are expensive and they add an automatic 20% gratuity which is also stupid
This only goes on sporadically but they often have very good wines available
Quick example  Palmaire cocktail was delicious as recommended by server but the wine on special was Le Cabernet de Paint Thinner
First time I came here we sat outside on their large patio for a few drinks and appetizers
I would come here again but probably not during the afternoon since the atmosphere is kind of depressing but for a few evening drinks the Armadillo grill is a good choice
When I chose my seat I was greeted with a basket of warm delicious bread and a glass of water
We truly liked the atmosphere the staff was super nice and they have a good variety of drinks to choose from
The wine is terrific the food delicious but boy was it crowded
This is not an ordinary coffee shop - all three drinks were rich creamy and had wonderful flavors - i was completely blown away
We all ordered beers nachos as an appetizer and then both couples split a meal
We got free appetizers and beer/wine I JUST SAID FREE FOOD AND BOOZE
The service was good the beers were awesome the tap beers didn't have their own menu which I'd prefer
Until then good luck in the parking lot drink well and don't tap the keg until you're good and ready
The service is good and the waiters and waitresses kept the drinks full and kept apologizing for the wait
The food is standard pub fare they have a good beer collection along with ciders
- Hamachi and serrano chili makiGrilled stewers Both of these are a must- Sweet potato- Sweet cornEntrees- Korean spiced lamb chops- Yuzu miso black cod- Rice and mushroom hotpotDesserts Both of these were excellent with really unique homemade ice creamMango and vanilla cake with toasted rice ice creamVanilla panna cotta with yuzu ice creamDrinks2x large AsahiGreen teaCome with lots of time and lots of money
I didn't try the food here but the selection of beer is good
If I hadn't questioned it I might've unknowingly spent a good amount of money on a pair of knock-off sunglasses
The chefs create artistic masterpieces in that small kitchen using regional proteins and veggies creating pates jellies and cured meats in house and even selling their delicious selection of cheeses retail out of the AZ Wine side of the shop
I highly recommend grabbing a bottle of wine and heading over there for an amazing meal
But in addition to their own beers they have over 20 other rotating taps and a couple casks with amazingly rare and unique beers
In addition to the beer they have an amazing atmosphere and surprisingly good food
It can get a bit crowded at times which will make the service slower so I recommend ordering another beer when you're about 3/4 done
Unfortunately they're only available every December but for $40 you get a dollar off and an ounce more for your beers which is well worth it
We just had an app and beers but overall it was good
The service wasn't that good and they didn't bring the beer in cold glasses which was disappointing
A few other good factors that Delux offers Good service fantastic beer selection which are primarily microbrews from across the country and reasonable prices
They had a pretty good beer selection but neither of us felt like drinking so will have to review that at another time
Good clean modern place to pick up some wine or beer to go with the food or for a friend's party
They got good wine at $18 price points or higher and in many selection
My suggestion to Hanny's is to think about the successful AZ/88 combination of good simple meals combined with strong fancy drinks
The service was great and the menu had a good balance of wines beer and sake and a nice variety of sushi
The rose wine was a perfect choice recommends by the server
Many different options of wine and alot of them tasted amazing
No happy hour deals for seasonal beers but don't let that steer you away from the delicious Pumpkin Porter only offered in the fall
We enjoyed sitting at the bar having a few drinks and visiting other patrons
They have a great little bar a decent selection of beer and a good wine selection
Get there early and get your fill of tasty beers and appetizers
The drinks are good- cocktails are just the right amount of strong and their beer has never been stale
Tuesday night special at least I think its Tuesday is All You Can Eat pizza couple that with a pitcher of beer and a good movie and it's a great weekday night
They buy good brand stuff in bulk like watches jewelry sun glasses clothing etc
We ordered the calamari appetizer some wine and a beer
The service was good but he seemed to disappear a lot which was kinda annoying especially when I would have had another glass of wine had he come back to check on our meals
We ordered four drinks that were a little pricy but worth every cent
I could've put that sauce on the drink coasters and enjoyed myself
I also add a bit of dry red wine for added flavor
I recommend the Moonston Lemongrass Coconut  non-filltered sake
They know what they are doing and have no shortage of suggestions for what to drink or how to drink it a quality that I feel is the mark of a successful server
for wine tasting good food and live music
live music from great musicians almost every night relaxing ambiance good food and wine
I had an amazing sandwich and wine pairing the last time I went
I'm not a huge coffee drinker and I'll admit that I often review coffee houses based on their baked good offerings
I have a perfectly healthy appetite for mixed drinks and one of these are enough for a good buzz
Lots of great vegetarian & gluten free options everything was very well priced a bunch of affordable options on the wine list and the cocktails were creative and delicious
I wish I could take a bath in that macaroni is something that was definitely said last night by one of us probably me I can't really remember very good wine
American pints are supposed to hold 16 ounces of delicious liquid happiness but Tilted Kilt's thick-walled thick-bottomed glasses only seem to hold 12 ounces I also tested this with a 12-ounce bottle
That 2/3 lb double cheese bacon cheeseburger was as delicious as the $12 i paid for it with fries and drink
He got our drinks asked if we like start w/ an appetizer so we did
$30 for 2 drinks and an appetizer total waste of money
Service food quality variety selection portions drinks and value were all spot on
Bathrooms are pretty clean and the drinks are pretty good
members of the DC voted to award an extra 1/2 point for delicious drinks and a nice happy hour
Plus the funky old building has an awesome 6 pane wall window that is an awesome highlightOverall worth checking out great drinks good food and a fun atmosphere
Combined with their excellent wine menu great staff this place gets 5 stars in my book
You can have a nice hearty and delicious dinner for 12 people for less than $100 and that includes drinks a bunch of food left over to take home
I'd really love to come here sometime when it's not packed before a show because the food and drinks are surprisingly good
The place was packed and the only seat left was in the bar which was OK since we were only there for appetizers and beer
They have a special butterbeer which is butterscotch soda if you are a Harry Potter nerd and a seasonal pumpkin pie float which is rich creamy cinnamon-spiced and delicious
But if you're looking for a nice friendly little bar where you can have a giant glass of excellent wine for ten bucks you will be very happy here
We had Pulled pork sandwiches - A+ Excellent cooked to perfection and full of flavorNew Potatoes smothered in butter - Absolutely amazing just like i remembered probably going to lead to a heart attackColeslaw - Not sure but the fiance said it was amazingCreamed corn - very tasty and sweetWe each had a beer from the large selection on hand
with good food and lots of beer i usually want to stay out later
So ho to The Strand and order some drinks and an appetizer then head over to another restaurant nearby for the main course
My glass of Pino Noir was fabulous thank you for the recommendation
Start off the morning with a fabulous latte and chocolate croissant and end the day with an amazing glass of wine and wonderful cheeses
Lessons - CheckOld Fashion Ice Cream - Check Awesome Bar - Check Duce Lemonade is AMAZING Hula Hoops - Check DJ - CheckFood - A-Ok options are a bit strange Price - A little high for the drinks and the foodStaff - super coolCHECK IT OUT
It was a very impressive bottle of wine for the price I highly recommend it
funny staff very energetic and excellent service drink never went empty
My drink was pretty good it has an overly string bourbon taste so if thats your thing you definitely might enjoy
Pro's* Wine list was pretty good with allot of great wines and reasonably priced too
The cocktails and wine were reasonable and delicious and the owner served us all complimentary guapa after dinner and came over to thank us for coming in
it was a mixture of randomly-beautiful-people hanging out for cheap drinks and good grub
The reason I was not very happy was that my bill was around $80 for a small filet a couple glasses of wine and a couple shared mediocre appetizers with two other people
again the wine list is compact but very good with some labels such as their Malbec that you don't find at a lot of other restaurants
And one more thing it's really awesome that you carry beers brewed by Rinkukiu Alaus Darykla the Lobster Lover is DELICIOUS
First time trying a brined turkey which tasted great - but the unpleasant surprise and stress that it caused made me hit the wine even earlier wasn't worth it -
Good class of customers great food and drink and free rides home if your tipsy
I ordered a few drinks all of which were very good although pricey
EXPENSIVE- not worth the price of food/drinks
something wheat berry something which was good as all Four Peaks beer is
They fall short of the beer offerings from such brew houses as Four Peaks and Sonora Brew Pub then again what beers come close to being as good but they are solid offerings nonetheless
$1 off beers $2 off all appetizers and half off mini pizzas
Our waitress was nice but didn't offer my little brother any pizza dough and didn't do a very good job of keeping our drinks full
The drink prices were very good and it seems they offer different deals daily
Very tasty beer and a +1 for having my fav beer Guinness in stock
Service is typically pretty good you'll be able to keep drinks coming and food comes out quickly
He actually recommended my main course and the bottle of wine we ordered over what we were originally thinking
Top that off with a few glasses of really good sangria and you've got a really good meal for right around the $40-50 mark
Came here for lunch yesterday and enjoyed the gorgeous weather over a glass of
The bartenders were good looking and I really like the beer selection I would def hang here if I was in walking distance
Good drinks - I had sake bombers but a couple of friends tried their cocktails and said they were good
There happy hour specials are excellent if your a well drinker
Example we had some wine out on the patio for dinner and wanted some nibbles but didn't want to order a full appetizer
The Velvet coffee drink with whipped cream is the most amazing coffee I've ever had in my life
They close at 2am which is good if you work late and need a beer to relax you
The waiter was on point and the drinks were good
Their margaritas are honest and good tasting and bunch of different kinds of beer does not hurt either
The italian restaurant Alto on property is quite good I enjoyed a chicken dish in a red wine reduction and they have a lovely wine list as well
Drinks are good great selection of beers and spirits
Matthew the bartender was great he provided good suggestions on the wine and great service
We had received a coupon for a free pizza with the purchase of $20 worth of food and drink
Friday is ladies night at Su Vino so appetizers are half off as is the 5 wine tasting normally $10 but Fridays for ladies it is $5
The five wines I sampled in my tasting were the fruity chardonnay good; riesling my least favorite of my five which makes me sad because I love riesling; gewurztraminer smooth and good; sauvignon blanc my favorite of the five
Travis waited on us and I thought he did a pretty good job considering there were 7 of us partaking in the 5 wine tasting and most of the time we all ordered a different wine
Music solo guitarist was decent service was good beer cold too bad the food was such a let down
I like their Tater Tots tho I haven't had them for ages they have good drinks the breakfast sandwiches are pretty good  though not very healthy I'm sure
The beer selection was pretty good and I like that they support local brewers
The bartender did not have many guests and our table of four were drinking at a pretty good clip
The food is always fresh and hot and tasty and the service has always been friendly and efficient I've even been offered a free beer on a number of occasions because of frequent visits
I think their pizza is really really good and they have a great selection of beers on tap
The house wine was delicious and oh-so-well priced
Our server was completely fantastic and even though I really disliked the drink she recommended the honey lemon ginger with rum her upbeat attitude was totally worth it
We also ordered a few bottles of wine and for the life of me I cannot remember what they were but they were good bottles of red
It doesn't matter if you're seated downstairs in the cozy darkly lit bar or upstairs where you can watch the chef's make quick work of your order in the open kitchen you can expect friendly service a fantastic wine list and very tasty food
The horchata was really good considering it came from a fountain drink machine
PS- what is up with avocado-flavored boba drinks
5th and Wine was recommended to me when I was searching for a place to hold our work holiday party
If you like a beer selection that runs 60+ deep eclectic music a killer patio with Downtown views and wading in a sea of attractive people odds are strong you'll have a good experience at Copper Blues
Special Happy Hours Attended two of these the specials were good although only on domestic beers
Sorry but while I am no where near a beer expert I still know good beer
It was damn good - I'm a huge Belgian/fruit lambic kinda guy and I wasn't sure how much I'd like this orange beer but boy is this yummy
It's not overly orangey it's light though smooth with some good body it leaves you refreshed and paired quite well with our grubBar Food+ Beer Bites
So I can see why the locals like it it's huge it's got a damn good beer selection but they don't carry Fruli or Wells Banana Bread Beer
The only good thing about this place is that fountain drinks are free in the bingo hall so bring your empty 2-liter bottles to fill up & beer is $3
I ordered a peach lemonade the drink was tasty and three fish tacos
Great selection of tasty beers and the bands are usually pretty good
My drinks were very good and the staff was awesome very attentive and polite The DJ was ok nothing to write home about and the clientele were mediocre at most
For drinks we recommend the prickly pear and bitter mango margaritas
Don't be surprise if someone buys you a drink there just because they are in a good mood
They make good drinks and there alot cheaper then some of the other places people go to have a drink
Treat yourself to the cookie for goodness sake
We ordered the following in order of our favoritesBurma GaiTropical PineappleThai Basil Margarita tastyDrunken Dragon wraps a little bit saltyMalee's Roasted DuckSpicy Cashew Beer tasted like it was a crocpot mealHope you enjoy it as much as we did
The food was amazing as were the prices and the wine
Generous salads burgers pasta desserts even the house wines are quality
I tried the White Chocolate Ale which had a nicely toasted nut flavor with a white chocolate background more of a refreshing light beer
I'm not too much of a beer fan and the closest beer-like beverage I've enjoyed is lambic but it did taste nice compared to other beers I've had
They recently opened around the corner on Thunderbird and were more than willing to recommend a good wine for our Italian food so I gotta give them props - make a stop by here before going to Giuseppe's as they have some unusual California wines that I've rarely seen outside SoCal
That plus a hugeormous selection of beer and amazing service equals a great meal
So La Bocca you are really good lookin' but you need to figure out what it takes not to be the Applebees of wine bars we have enough of those
Since she was waitressing we enjoyed a nice leisurely 3 hours or so eating and drinking at this brand new spot
The best HAZELNUT flavor drinks of all kind here
Tasty stuff and it seems that we got the Beer Club mug as an additional upgrade
Like many other stores they have a 10% off when you buy 6 bottles of wine but unlike other stores they will really mark down some good wines I have left paying less than half price for bottles after all discounts kick in
I'll go elsewhere for a delicious Filet Mignon but I'll be back to Durant's for the wine and shrimp cocktails and maybe I'll try those scallops I've heard good things about
We ordered an appetizer because I knew with a 3 margarita maximum they weren't kidding around with the strength of their drinks
It is not super dark or even very 'trendy' but they have good drinks and are a nice place to relax
-Groupon check-Cool unpretentious waiter check-Live music check-Amazing menu double checkWe ventured over to 5th & Wine a few weeks ago after buying our Groupon online for $15 bucks for $30 worth of food and haven't stopped talking about it since
I don't know why this place isn't any busier but I guess cause it's sort of tucked away but seriously its worth it to go there if you want/need glasses
After two of the Delicious bellinis he very nicely informed me on the 2 drink Max but offered to get me a different cocktail
I used to frequent another locally owned Tempe coffee shop to get my work done during the day and to visit with friends in the evenings but between good coffee drinks and a perfect laid back atmosphere OSP has definitely won me over
uhm creative to say the least and have names like the dirty sanchez for one example The martinis are fantastic- I tried one made with Pama and it was amazing
They serve a FREE Breakfast buffet and FREE nightly appetizers and drinks everyday
At night they had Free Beer on Tap and Wine along with fresh salads veggies and dips chips pretzels  popcorn and hot appetizers like egg rolls
I told him I wanted a sweet white wine yes I know but it was hot and I wasn't going for something of quality
So I wouldn't suggest this place if you're really wanting to look around and want a good quality liquor beer or wine
The drinks are slightly pricey but worth it
I won't write too terribly much but recommend it for anyone Gay or Straight who likes to dance have some good drinks and chat up whomever admires and subsequently worships your large boobs
Anyway the mixed drinks were innovative and delicious
I didn't get to sample the drinks except for the water omp it was amazing
We could debate whether the upgraded wines was really worth it at all; I don't think so
Their wine selection is great and the prepared foods is super delicious too
I'm not even a beer drinker so can't review the quality of their brews but apparently the Oatmeal Stout was good and a deal at $3
Decent service and overall good place especially for all you beer drinkers out there
For lunch and dinner they have tons of pasta pizza sandwiches and soups to choose from as well as a pretty good wine and beverage list
Good food good drink comfortable and relatively authentic atmosphere
The gyro meal is a good deal and my go to here a GIANT gyro fries or side salad and a drink
It was rich and flavorful but not at all overwhelmingThe drinks were good
I do not recommend entering the hiking area from this side especially with your dog as there is a lot of broken glass on the hillside you can see it glimmer in the afternoon sun
They even have VIP that include a wonderful dinner and discounted drink tickets
Excellent selection of beer and while there is a sizable bar and lots of televisions the sound was not overpowering as happens in so many bar/restaurants
the restaurant itself is great looking and will be wonderful when the weather warms up as all the walls are glass doors
This may look like yr average fancy-people grocery store but those freckled and bespectacled hipsters lurking behind the counter are actually little sirens ready to lure you closer with free tastes of rice pudding delicious wine and a rainbow of beets quinoa and kale
The prices are decent mixed drinks are a bit on the stiff side but at least you get your money's worth right
I recommend the sweet tea lemonade alcoholic drink
He was fast came by at just the right times to ask how everything was had good drink recommendations and had just a overall good attitude
Regardless the staff was still friendly the food was delicious and the drinks were still good
As well as being a fantastic environment and atmosphere there is a great selection of microbrew beers the food there is really good and the bar staff are also very friendly welcoming and attentive
I moved from Tempe to Phoenix and was kind of bummed that I would have to travel a good distance to get my favorite Four Peaks beers but Rosie's has saved me that trip
If you're a person that likes a good crowd live music friendly service decent food and great beer you should definitely go to Rosie's
Their chicken adobado is amazing the salsa bar is possibly the greatest thing you'll ever put in your mouth they have a decent beer selection and all you can eat homemade chips
Their Hot Sauce I could almost drink it- it is sooo good
The wings and other dishes were great especially as sports-bar food goes beer selection was good prices were reasonable
They've got a good beer selection on draft or bottled too lots of good choices to go with their pizza
Service was good and drinks were refilled as needed
Since I've heard good things about their coffee I'd like to come here again and try out some breakfast items as well as some coffee drinks
We shared two appetizers great deal during happy hour - all half off as well as half price glasses of wine
The one I chose was very bold and so flavorful and decently priced that I ended up with a second glass fairly soon after the first
Looks like it would be a great place just to go for drinks and they did have some drinks on the menu that sounded excellent
The real deal is if you go in on a week night you get a coupon good for the weekend buy a meal and a 32 oz drink get a 2nd entree free
The food was good however some stations were out of food before I got to them drinks were affordable crowd was mixed live band played a nice variety of music and the staff was very accomodating
if you dont know what you like they will recommend a nice variety of popular drinks
Hubby and I have also done the Charcuterie and Cheese on the left in past visits and all were really wonderful with one of their nice glasses of red wines
Now for my flavor suggestions When in doubt I always go for Taro--it tastes like you're drinking an Oreo Cookie Smoothie
The special drinks are also quite delicious
Service was good drinks were filled consistently and the staff even apologized that some food wasn't as fresh due to lack of customers
The steaks are just wonderful and the martinis perfectly poured
The Lux experience offers great prices delicious drinks and a friendly staff
Just because the server will take back a poorly mixed drink or charred beans doesn't make it a good place to eat and drink
Though my companions enjoyed their drinks my Zombie served in a tall opaque glass with a mustachioed character who looked a lot like me was poorly mixed lacking lime juice and faintly soap-tasting
I think it's in the quality of the ginger beer
The drinks are always good- which is not always the case when you like the fruity frou-frou drinks- and I do
We got all of a drinks and food in good time
I had nearly polished of a bottle of sake by the time the food got there which may account for my belief that the sushi was good lol
The music was good but the drinks were horrible watered down and tasteless the saki was watered down too
We just went there for appetizers and drinks and the food was less than average like supermarket sushi at Trader Joes bland
When I started to realize that we had been sitting for a few minutes without seeing a server a manager walked over apologized for the delay and took our appetizer and drink order
The drinks were delicious and the waiters were amusing
I haven't been impressed with their wines
looks like they prejudice their own bring out water with no ice without asking P - some of us drink with ice  Our server just wanted to rush through very bad - I do know they have good servers but inconsistency doesn't help
My brother and I checked out the place literally on a whim and we're impressed with the beers
better margaritas @ Chili's for goodness sake
They are all pretty good but it seems as if some of them should only be served hot and serving them iced or blended takes a lot away from the drink
I didn't have a beer that night but my friends kept ordering away so it must have been good
We got drinks and asked her what she recommended
1 order of grilled cheese and soup - M said it was GOOD1 order of korean bbq pork tacos - G said it was very good1 order of beef kabob - V liked it I was too full to tryThe girls had tons of drinks too
great food tasty drinks and awesome price for happy hourThat being said after how my wife & I were treated last night I won't be going back
They had some tasty liquors and even a small specialty drink menu
If you want something different the root beer cake is also delicious
so this is for my northern Californians who are searching for a place as good as La Vic's I came here last fall after a night of drinking and of course like any other drunk person I just wanted some greasy ass mexican food
Imbibe  we each ordered a glass of vino for five dollars and we both enjoyed very much
And then my son and I each order a burger and soft drink and the bill was $30 really - and I was not impressed with the burger overcooked and small so
I had a good time at this place but it's not my typical places it wasn't really a dive bar it was more like a crackhead hang out the bartender was nice and hooked up the drinks
If you like a good hard cheap drink this is a good place to go but only if you think you can tolerate some of the crackheads that hang out in there I'm not saying everyone that hangs out there is a crackhead but there are some that hang out there forsure
Their beer list is pretty good with more than half of it being AZ brews which I definitely enjoy trying
Being pregnant I stuck with water but the rest of the people at our table enjoyed some great beers of draft - they were happy with the selection
Also tried the medicine man juice great flavor well prepared and a good change up from beer and soda
I was pleasantly surprised at the variety of drinks that were available I counted 14 different fountain drinks including Cherry Coke Mello Yello Orange Fanta and the other usual Coke stand-bys as well as a Gold Peak dispenser with three different flavors
We arrived Tuesday just after 8p and we were not seated until 1030p but we went knowing what we were in for and enjoyed a wonderful bottle of wine suggested by the helpful and friendly Danielle
For 5 of us with appetizer meals and multiple generous drinks the total was $140
They told me it would cost $1 for a to-go cup of my drink The Good Egg next door gives you free to go cups filled fresh
But hey at least they had the most amazing wine specials that night and I was saucy enough to laugh it off and take a bow
The Tomaresco is quite good and a value at $30 but I am partial to Italian wines
But the drinks were good and reasonable
Long story short I have tried the food and beer here four times over several months and it is not good
But I would rather have a really well-done drink/quality draft and pay a bit more than have worthless average drinks for half price
I enjoyed a lovely white zin in the Keg size 9 oz glass for only $4
Having 2 locations and a loyal following of people who appreciate beer tasty pub grub at super low prices both locations are pretty hopping on most nights
Besides being with friends there isn't anything that goes better with good beer than good food
To stand up to some of the stronger flavors of beer the Bleu Light Special Burger $9 with its thick juicy patty hickory smoked bacon and smothered with blue cheese crumbles was well grounded and a solid choice
Just to let you in on something Four Peaks makes amazing beer bread it's similar to a really soft pita and makes for a great substitute to an ordinary bun
White table cloths dim lighting and a impressive wine list try the plum wine gives a sense of class but food is good and price is reasonable
It may sound weird if you've never had one but is is the most delicious refreshing drink ever
Maybe it was an off day or the cooks were really busy due to the Sunday crowd but for a place known for wings they have a buffalo in their logo for goodness sakes
I also like my latte with someone who can make fun of the 45 year old hipster as well as the 25 year old hipster someone who can appreciate some room and time to sit down someone who can discuss the merits of day drinking and someone who looks good doing it
They were out of Thai tea  and Ben ordered a plum drink that was pretty good however salty which I think is probably how it's supposed to be but being a typical American who does NOT put salt in her beverages it was a little muchI'd go back
Good ambiance good wine good burger [this coming from me] and really great friendly service; even a DJ who eventually listens to a group of 20 customers out back
I would say go if you are getting a good deal on happy hour wine but stick to wine and skip the food
Maybe a place just for drinks but even then the wine list was not all that impressive and I would recommend going down the street to Kazimierz or Postino's
Awesome Happy Hour Drinks and appetizers
6+ martinis 2 steak dinners appetizers bread
and he whipped up a delicious drink using sweetener
*cheese plate - very good perfect for sharing while wine tasting*crispy penne - it is exactly what the name implies - crispy penne
Third though some reviewers have complained about price for Monday Night Football they have all-night happy hour with half-priced beer appetizers and pizza
Our server struck up conversation and seemed genuine in recommending her favorite antipasti pizza and wine/beer combinations
We arrived around 200 and spent a good two hours upstairs in their instruments exhibits before grabbing a drink at the cafe
This Dave & Busters is a bit smaller then the other locations but still does the job i did not taste their food i am sure it is just like any other D&B and the drinks were just as good
Upon sitting down at the sushi bar we placed our drink and appetizer orders right away with our server
But other than that the Library plays good music and the drinks are decently priced
I recommend the steamed chicken pho spring rolls and their great coconut water drink
The list of flavor combinations for mojitos and sangrias as well as margaritas and martinis goes on
The food we ordered Glass Noodle Spicy Salad with Beef & Thai Toast as appetizers and Thai Beef Fried Rice & Chicken Yellow Curry as entree
On the beer side they are doing some pretty awesome things and making some very tasty beer
Their range is quite good and there are seasonal beers coming out quite often Marzen just came out
Aside from having to wait 10 minutes for our drinks they were very good
The musical stops were pleasant and the wine samplings excellent
There food is over the top and they gave some great wine recommendations- we also tried their sangria which was delicious
According to the manager they would like to host one monthly through the summer and they try to limit the seating to about 60 to keep the food quality as high and I suppose the drinks as cold
I highly recommend the pumpkin porter for a unique beer that is very fitting for the Fall season
If you are in the mood for even just a beer or some delicious and unique bar food do not hesitate one bit to check this place out
The drinks are very good perfect blend of alcohol and mixers
I ordered something with gin bourbon marischino liqeur and ginger beer - it was very good
The decor in the restaurant is nice makes you wanna just hang out and have some wine and good food
It is a good place to take a large group and drink margaritas and celebrate and non-romantic event such as a birthday or graduation
This used to be a wonderful place downtown-- an escape from the annoying hipsters at Carly's with their stale food and watered down beer
Great flavor creamy perfect texture and thickness--smooth but still slushy and drinkable
I ordered the HUGE portobello mushroom and received two small ones that were flattened  The only thing worth going back for was the beer on tap since they do not produce it
Beer Pitcher of  ICE COLD delicious draft
I am a fan of the wines on tap for the price quality and the amount of waste nearly zero that the restaurant has on such a drink
They serve some mean sushi extremely tasty as well as the martinis we ordered
Their food competes with the quality of their wine
She even recommended a wine my wife now makes me pick up every time I'm at the store
If you love to people watch and have a few good cheap beers with your pals check this spot out
I don't think the food is AMAZING but it's good and washes down nice and easy with a cold beer
Don't forget to check out the wine section--not only is the wine random it's affordable and a great conversation starter with all the cute names and labelsAfter moving here from San Diego I've been so unimpressed by all the breakfast spots in Phoenix
The drink menu is very creative too and worth a dabble
Tastes like an orange creamsicle beer- it's just pure amazing
Food is good but with the beer selection I rarely eat there
Very light and flavorful which paired well with the wine we brought
The service is always great the food is excellent and the wine list is constantly rotating
I loathe to write a bad review for one of my favorite hobbies drinking craft beer however; Sun Up is a brewing company that I feel the need to never visit again nor would I recommend beer lovers to go out of their way to stop in
We started with drinks where the ladies had margaritas which were good but very small
It is very close to ASU so it might be geared toward young college students who do not appreciate good food and just go for the drinks
It was quite tasty they added Ginger Ale to it but it was a tad flat other than that it was a great bar drink
Long story short the beer selection is atrocious there are plenty of authentic Irish pubs that have good beer selections
Snotty dressy club girls will stll have a good time  its nice to stop in for a drink before the clubs or after the clubs for another round and sme food
It's all about wonderful glasses of wine at Kazimierz and the amazing conversations you can have with the company you bring behind the door which reads Truth is Inside
The decor is pretty nice over-sized couches tables in the corners it's very dark and yes worth every sip of wine to find this Scottsdale wine bar
The wine is excellent and its a wonderful place to visit if you can take out a low interest loan
In addition to the wonderful pizza and the lunch with great friends LGO also provided a bright spot in my day by putting one of my favorite hard-to-find red wines right by the cashier for $10 less than I usually get it at AJ's
Plus I saw people drinking iced chai at the farmers market and it looked good
If I were in the area I would go again for the wine flight and maybe order an appetizer from the bar but I think the hype exceeds the food
Of course only if you're a fan of a huge selection of food small plates at HH prices and excellent wines by the glass for $5
my final day here consisted of me trying to order lunch with a shitty beer the server recommended
The biggest best priced Hangar One martinis in town and the food is always excellent
It's so nice to lounge around The service is pretty good except for whenever I put my flag on the lounge chair they take forever to pay attention so I have to end up getting up and get the drink myself- really not a huge deal I'm just saying
Good thing for you beer drinkers they are super cheap
They have a large selection of flavored sake's and a very unique menu
Fun and unique menu great flavored sake selection awesome food and reasonable prices gives Sens five stars
The wine selection is very good and they have a variety of prices which is nice
You can order 100 by the glass but there were some very good bottles in the $35-$40 range
For drinks I recommend a white cran and cold sake
I love the retro decor the food is amazing green enchiladas all rice no garnish and a flour tortilla is the way to go the drinks are tasty and cheap especially to an LA girl and the staff is friendly
It's hard to get 4 drinks for that cheap let alone an appetizer and dinner for two
Even the beer selection was good they have a great selection of craft beers for a good price
Walk straight all of the way We always walk towards the TVs and made a left groceries are thereNo sake to see but beer and wine and liquor for meWhich is good and nice but this wlmrt is five stars for a reasonAs good as it gets
The service was good always refilling the drinks and available
The waitress brought my drink along with a nice crisp cole slaw type salad with some greens in it that I was not able to identify but which gave it a nice flavor
To sum up - decent to good food for sports bar food attractive servers wearing skimpy outfits stiff drinks at reasonable prices and sports on big screen tvs
The beer was good not great but I would definitely go back to try more
The pizza wasn't super good and with a $75 bill for two pies two salads and two glasses of wine I expect a lot more
I do recommend for Happy Hour half off almost all all apps and drinks but don't you dare pay full price for anything here
Drinks were good lotsa people a good mix of upbeat music and lotsa people looking like they're enjoying themselves
Visit 2 1 bad movie and 3 hours laterWe were seated after the funny looks of weren't you guys just here We had teppanyaki and a bottle of the Robert Hall wine recommended by our cute waitress
Imagine how wonderful this could be if you order a glass of wine and go for a special occasion with a special someone
Now I have no idea what was said from the customer and maybe they deserved a good yelling at but the customer was with her 6 year old daughter when the older woman who worked the front door demonstratively punched open the front glass door screamed at the customer got 2 inches from her face and pointed angrily at her until she and yer young daughter scurried off
I will update as soon as I have a proper meal but their beer is so good I expect the same
Mike and I arrived just as they set up and with a little bit of everything on the bacon-wrapped dogs and glass bottles of Coca-Cola I was scarfing down the delicious mystery meat and considering having another even though it would be too much to digest and I'd be throwing up from the acid reflux
To top it off the manager opened a wonderful bottle that is going on the list Cade so I could drink by the glass
-Homemade limeade - there are no words for this drink it's so good you just have to try it
The drinks are great and the service is also excellent
We started out with the drink menu the mango drink with mint is very good and reasonably priced compared to everything on the menu
The beer is always solid ask for the Bourbon-Barrel-Aged Kiltlifter never advertised offered rarely but incredibly worth it and the food is a cut above typical bar food
I've enjoyed quite a few lunches here and having a glass of wine is really enjoyable with a salad or a sandwich in midday and in midtown
Few things make me happier than wine and cheese -- so naturally I enjoyed the Cheuvront
Fabulous signature drinks/cocktails good food and great times with friends
I've always loved that you filled your delicious martinis to the brim but in the back of my head thought you were always just trying to get me drunk
Summary warm greeting excellent service adequate wine list good food
Therefore it took a good 10 minutes of us sitting in front of him for him to ask us what we wanted to drink
I will say the bar staff was wonderful--very friendly and attentive but after a couple of drinks I felt like I'd gotten all I ever would out of this place
Hubby and I each had the Shaken Beef lunch with egg roll appetizer and drinks it came out to $39
It was tasty but I think I prefer the more traditional less sweet drinks
From 4-8 you can get 7 dollar cocktails and martinis that are very good for the money, although at normal price I would shy away from the drinks
At the bar there is a huge food truck stand-like marquee listing tasty drinks off the menu
They seem to have a good wine selection and it has as the name would suggest a fantastic VU
The wine and beer selection are unexpectedly good for a neighborhood bar setting but I usually go for the Prickly Pear Margarita
s in my area don't carry certain ales and beers due to the alcohol content being too high and recommended calling into Arizona for them
Great place to fill up on drinks and grub at a fairly reasonable price and if you think it's expensive - it's worth every last penny
drinks are also included in the buffet and i chose to have a mango ice tea which was very good
If your idea of good wine is some that comes in a box or is called Arbor Mist or White Zinfandel  this may be the place for you
This place has a fantastic set of brews including various seasonals and cask-conditioned beers all at a good price
they do have a good wine selection as well
My impression is that La Bocca is more of a wine bar that serves appetizers and smaller/lite sandwiches salads and pizzas
The sandwiches and drinks were good but the mashed potatoes were average
My partner had the fish sandwich which she says was just okay all in all it was cute trendy good beer selection but not impressive food
tea is very good miso soup is average sake selection is the usual hakatsuru which is fine with me
If you come during happy hour certain appetizers and drinks are discounted - we got crab puffs for around $3
Yes the Kirin sake bombers are always on special but I like Asahi better than Kirin and they have both so I'm in good shape
I'd prefer something a little more substantial to soak up the beer but the bread was good and served its purpose
The liquor and beer department is pretty large and they have good deals on alcohol most of the time
And we were treated to some really REALLY delicious burgers and great beer
I despise all of the bland fountain drinks served as profit stuffers at most restaurants but the rootbeer here is so so DELICIOUS
First half of our party was going to be late so we decided to put in an order of appetizers and order two bottles of wine for the table
Another five minutes our caprese appetizer came then the wine a couple minutes after that
Drink specials were good for the downtown scene but unfortunately that is where the compliments end
Also good but I'm not a whiskey drinker generally
We ordered two beers $2 Blue Moon drafts an appetizer $2
I could only eat half after two appetizers and a beer
For two beers two appetizers and two entrees
But in the grand scheme of things that's a very minor complaint maybe not so much for my pregnant friend who was ONLY drinking water and was left without for a good chunk of time
Their Chai Iced Tea is really good and they have a fancy coca cola machine you can experiment with to create a unique drink
Upon my 4th visit in which I enjoyed amazing snacks and strong drinks I've decided to shout my love from the rooftops
You have the best drinks ok I've only tried one type of drink wonderful food ok ok
Bottom Line -  I did go during happy hour not purposely and no one was really eating except my face but everyone was drinking and having a good time
The hops do add some nice balance throughout the beer and the alcohol is well-hidden in the flavor
Wineburger makes the short list of unique fun and always tasty places to visit in that neighborhood
Happy hour pricing was fair with 1/2 price craft beers and some appetizers were on special but not the ones I desired
The deals are good especially if you want to explore some new wine tastes at a reasonable by the glass price
She did a great job of listening to our likes and matched two wines to our flavor profiles perfectly
Now most wine bars have wine and no or barely  any food - this place is an exception - Great Lunch and Dinner menu - an excellent  happy hour appetizer menu as well - love the individual pizza's
The $20 deal for wine and bruschetta is as good as everyone says
They are beer battered which makes them a shade of orange and delicious yum
Drinks water and a beer took a good ten minutes to arrive after our waitress took the order
If you like your drinks strong you'll get your money's worth here
Again the fried pickles were amazing and they serve beer so that was a bonus
The drinks prices are standard-high but then again its Scottsdale so you should know better but I still recommend this place rather than many of the nightclubs in the area because it has a rather big open seating/terrace where you can escape from sweaty men and armani exchange cologne and attempt to have a good time
Aaaaand despite me being ridiculously mean about this place I did have a good time but then again who doesn't when you are drinking heavily right
This hurts to say because they are a wine bar so I'm sure it's important to them that they get good reviews here
The wine was good and the brushetta is fabulous
It came to well over $50 with the tip for one appetizer two entrees and two drinks
We went there on a Saturday watched the Dback game enjoyed several drinks and dinner and our tab was under $30 - can't beat that
I MIGHT have even been able to overlook many of the downfalls in service and quality frankly I'll drink just about anything you call coffee and pour in a cup for me if the atmosphere had at least been pleasant
I am getting nostalgic here so let me close with these couple of important details  1 The wine selection was small but the wines were good and 2 the cheese/cracker/olive food pairings were quite good
You can have some good beers and wine while watching some great indi films the theatre itself has some theatre seating and if your wanting more of a table sitting then you have that too
Always delicious quality eats that satisfy any hungry beer drinker
All the beers are at least good my favorites being 8th Street Ale and their IPAs Hop Knot and Raj
Bottom line if you live in Phoenix like beer and enjoy eating a good meal then you should be shot if you don't like Four Peaks
I aldo enjoyed the featured beer - the Bobby Q Amber - which is brewed by Sonoran - so that was double local goodness
We just sat and had a drink and enjoyed ourselves
All of the items on the happy hour menu are very reasonably priced so you can get some good food and drinks
I just had water, but the oogave sodas and all the drinks looked tasty
On the other hand flavored drinks such as white mochas cover up the over-roasted taste and balance the sweetness
The food is always delicious the drinks are always delightful the service has never failed to be friendly and inviting and the restaurant is always clean
The bottom line is Sassy Glasses is good for people with minor vision issues who want to look hip in their glasses but people who need serious optometry services should look elsewhere
Excellent place to relax and have a beer if you are craving a sandwich salad or appetizer for a relatively low price
Service 5/5 I don't recall ever waiting for a check or a drink for too long and even when the occasional mix up happens they remedy it promptlyPricing I would really expect to pay more for food this good
DrinksI love little bottles of ginger-ale and the hefeweizenDesertChili cheesecake 5/5 I am not a fan of cheesecake this with the balsamic whatever is amazing stuff
Our drink total was $84 and definitely not worth it
The espresso drinks are excellent and their baked goods are to die for
But once inside in this dimly lit amazing lounge you pull up a chair and look at this huge list of beer that you can choose from
Being that it was also happy hour I got a good sized burger with a big plate of fries they will also substitute sweet potatoe fries for $1 and a large glass of sangria for a whopping total of $7
The wonderful bartender loved our group and was treating us very well with drinks and mixing up a storm
I wouldn't recommend The Grind unless it's just for a drink I liked the look of the beer selection on the menu and someone else you're with really wants to go
I'll go back because it's been decent in the past and the beer flows freely and good usually with good company but I'm thinking it's a one more chance kind of thing
I will probably never go back to Geisha for a meal but it is a good place for drinks at the bar with friends on the weekend
The only low point on the menu is the sangria which she returned to the server in favor of a glass of quality red wine
Looks like they had a good selection of Mexican beer and a fun variety of margaritas
The beer and wine selections are excellent
There are many places in this town that have a great menu or a piece of local flare or maybe a cool patio but there are few establishments that offer all of the above and fresh quality ingredients a decent 'casual afternoon' wine list and kick-ass iced tea and lemonade with a splash of femininity all over it
So if you're with good company and happy to lounge around and chat over drinks and not too starving Carly's is great
Wines have been hit or miss for me but there's a few good beers and plenty of girly drinks at pretty standard prices
They have an excellent happy hour for drinks $2
I was kind of bummed that I would not be able to get my glass of raspberry ice tea they no longer serve it but our waiter was quick to point out that they do serve a tropical ice tea which was really good
Excellent drinks food service was quick and with a smile
Good job to Ticoz and their delicious drinks and food
I once cut my foot open on an enormous shard of glass that was peeking out of the sand because I was dumb enough to think it was a good idea to empty my shoe out and step on the ground
Dark rum coco lopez fresh squeezed pineapple and oj worked together to make an excellent drink
If I'm paying a good $5-8 for a bottle that I could toss in a few more bucks to get a six pack of I'm expecting a cold glass
A great addition to Tempe Marketplace The Thirsty Lion provides a great atmosphere a wonderful selection of beers on tap and reasonable prices
Moderately priced it's well worth venturing in for a drink if it's cold outside
Unless you throw together an evening meal with appetizer and drink it would be difficult for oner person to spend more than $10
The quality of the ingredients and especially the flavor of the crust were excellent and there is an extensive tap-beer selection and full bar
The good I was greeted and seated right away a glass of water and menu were provided immediately
All the restaurants have happy hour specials from 4-6 with select drinks and appetizers for $5
The can highly recommend the Shellfish Sampler and 1988 Martini from Roy's and the pizzas and Berry Thyme drink from Tuscany
The prices are slightly on the high side of reasonable more than I'd like to pay but I don't feel ripped of for a quality beer
I do go there every now and then and it's a good place for a beer with a few friends but I avoid it when it's busy and I usually don't get food
I enjoyed some beers on tap but wanted to try some food so we ordered the Copper Blues Burger
Their happy hour is one of the best in Phoenix and they have enough going on for them that as long as the mediocre service isn't disrupting my enjoyment of a glass of wine then we're good
The drinks were delicious as well; I'm not much of a mixed drink or sweet drink person but whatever I had off their happy hour menu was absolutely delicious
We had one glass of wine one Mexican coke I had to ask what it was - it's the old school sugar-cane flavored coke we used to get here in the 70s and two pasta entrees at $15 each and the total was $47
I've been to Margaritaville good for kids and Yard house good if you like a variety of beer but my new spot is defiantly Bar Louie's
All the prices really seem amped up a notch compared to the actual quality of the food/drink you're getting; I suppose you pay for the atmosphere
Conclusion - come here for happy hour drinks and appetizers
They also had a wonderful imported beer lane but I don't think it compares to the prices at Topps liquor
Good drink specials and a nice space with outdoor patio area
They have an EXCELLENT happy hour but their normal drink prices are incredibly reasonable as well
In additional to the great atmosphere delicious high-quality food great drink prices outstanding happy hour warm and attentive service they also have GREAT hours especially for an Asian restaurant
Still - it was good and thet drink prices at happy hour were excellent
The waitress Heather took good care of us - and soon my attention turned to sake
I was even more impressed with the delicious and lush Rex-Goliath PN they served me in a beautiful clean sleek wine glass
Very impressed for an airport establishment when this type of quality is usually not the case Friendly staff bright and fresh salad with plenty of ingredients great wine
I'm giving CM's two stars because despite the fact that the beer was decent and the food mostly tasty I was so immensely turned off when I had to listen to the we really don't do separate checks speech from our server
We were a party of 8 engaging in light drinking and mostly appetizers
The appetizers are cheap and plentiful and the drink specials really roll around to some good stuff
There were a lot of beer choices and I decided to order the raspberry beer which is amazing
I loved the chutney and was also able to try my mom's root beer onions which were good
While the wine list wasn't extensive the varietals were wonderfully chosen
The bruschetta seemed like a good pairing for our wines
Delux is great - lots of good beers on tap
With that being said he's a pleasant guy to be around and if you ever have a chance to share a beer with him at the bar I highly recommend you take the time for a brief tu00eate-u00e0-tu00eate
The price you pay for the beer is a good value
Service is always good and friendly though they could afford to hire more people as the wait for drinks when being served is usually long
After some good beer and a 45 minute wait we got to our table
The beer selection is good and the staff are great and very friendly
They have about 10 beers on draft mainly local all delicious
I very much enjoyed the veggie sandwich on the onion bagel everything was very fresh and very tasty with drink and cookie it came to about $5
they do have beer towers which always look good
Drinks aren't too expensive I haven't tried the food from the restaurant but it does look delicious
Not cool in a I wear D&G sun glasses and think RA has amazing sushi kind of way but cool in a this place has great food who the hell cares what it looks like kind of way
You pick your drink type & it allows you to add flavor shots
That being said the wine is good the staff is friendly and they have good live music on Friday's
What's better than indulging in very good wine with your very best friend after a very long day at work you ask
It is just a very inviting place to be and lose yourself in one of Blake's wonderful creations or enjoy a glass of wine personally recommend by his wife Nicole
Also those drinks made a friend smack me-in a good way but DAMN-that shit never happened at Caseys
We got something like 5 appetizers including the big ass burger 3 drinks and 1 dessert for around $65
Our server was amazing attentive to empty glasses friendly with nice words for the bride & groom and respectful to each person's requests/needs
We ordered drinks from the bar and enjoyed the people-watching
He also offered to buy us appetizers and drinks I assumed that meant the alcoholic kind once we were finally seated
I had the mojito which was pretty decent and my husband had a glass of red wine that he enjoyed
I would have had no problem paying for drinks they were fairly tasty and we didn't have any problems with them except for the fact that we had been told that they would be taken care of
The margaritas are delicious however so I encourage you to stick to day drinking or hopping on the bar at night to Party Like a Rockstar
As for the drinks I had two different types of margaritas and enjoyed both
Dos Gringos is a good place to go grab some drinks and some food to snack on
Drinks They have good prices and a good selection of Mexican and domestic beers
This time we opted for one of their specialty flavor infusions in each of our drinks
There is a good selection of wine and beers and a full bar
The drink prices are really good and the bartender got our drink order as soon as we sat down even though the entire bar was full we got the last 2 seats
They used to have a really good peach malt drink but I couldn't find it last time I went
This sort of place for drinks and good food after and in-between classes is lacking outside of Mill Ave
Make sure you grab a coupon they keep near the register for 15% off 3+ bottles of wine and pair your grapes with one of their wonderful cheeses in the refrigerated section
It was a good time with a variety of drinks flowing and local musician's playing
They really know what they're doing with the food peppered steak is my favorite there's a good selection of higher-quality beer and choices for everyone including vegetarians - I know because I was one once
The pluses a killer parking spot at the back of the Biltmore a wonderful server and a good glass of wine
On the upside my Arnold Palmer drink was very refreshing and good
Pros- Never seems packed- Seats are comfortable- Customer service is good- Popcorn is tasty and always hot- Movies aren't too loud- Free refills on large popcorn/drinksCons- Many times they seem to have problems with the film
I gave them 2 stars only for having lots of good beers on tap
Very unique beer that's very smooth and flavorful

The food is good the drinks are tasty and as someone else described the restaurant is spacious yet intimate
This is a cool place for brunch good service good selection and decent prices it's even close to Old Town go figure  I had the salmon flat bread pizza with creme freshe capers and arugula this was perfectly paired with a nice strong cup of coffee served in a clear plastic glass
But FEZ offers good drinks and good food all set in a very modern hip decor
My drink is warm and tasty and serving it to me is an attractive lass whom fancied my eye and makes me favor places that have pretty girls working there
I've always enjoyed La Grande Orange's pizza which along with its extensive wine list is one of its specialties
I like the pizzas 2 people can share one if you have a moderate appetite Drinks are good too
Pros - Cool House-of-Blues-like vibe includes music-related decor lounge chairs/sofas & dimmer lightingExcellent musicGood service wait staff write their name on your cocktail napkin - nice touchCons -Barstools at main bar are waaaaay too short makes drinking out of straws or from taller glasses difficultSpace for luggage - fail
I never had to get up to get my own drink thanks to my amazing friends but I always seemed to get them quickly
A young fun crowd with good drinks and good Americanized sushi
BTW if you like mix drinks try the jumbo frozen Mango Margarita delicious

Stopped by for drinks the second time ended up ordering a pizza expected little since it didn't mesh with the menu it was really quite good
Very nice restaurant with professional waiters a great menu and tasty wine list

Two drinks an appetizer and two entrees ran about $90
No good Pinots under $80 by the glass - they either lack complexity or contain an overpowering acidity
The drink menu is wonderful bartender Preston's spin on a lemonade based mojito is really tasty
I usually get the Mac and Cheese which is always awesome and went with Sirlon with Portobello Mushroom Mashed Potatoes and Grilled Tomato it was worth it and had it with a pretty good glass of beer with it
Looking for exquisite views top notch service delicious drinks and/or food and a special experience to share with a friend or loved one
Alliance Beverage did wine pairings to go with each delicious course  and local favorite Dennis Rowland performed with his band
My recommendation for SR is it's a great place to stop in for drinks and cotton candy especially when you have friends in town
That's like using a complimentary drink coupon worth $8 to buy a bottle of beer or a glass of house wine that costs less than $5
After a mediocre experience at a wine bar up the street we decided to head in here based on a the recommendation of a friend in our group we ended up with 28 people here at this bar
I attended an Interactive Wine Dinner which was an amazing event and I highly recommend attending one
Paired with the acid of the tomatoes and the creaminess of the burrata highlights the richness of the wine wonderfully
As if that wasn't enough to knock your socks off they paired it with a 2004 Mer Soleil Late Viognier that alone could make you think you were drinking pure sugar with great flavor
An amazing dinner and dessert but in addition to the fantastic food we were connected via videoconference with Chef Russell Skall; Fleming's Executive Chef Chuck Wagner; owner of Caymus Vineyards and Marian Jansen op de Haar; Fleming's Director of Wine
Great service and the amazing wine list beware time for food
Their wine selection is pretty good too I've fallen in love with the Acadia white that I cant seem to find anywhere else
Curious to try their beer that they brew right there in the restaurant & the desserts looked tasty as well
The seasonals and high strength beers are the best in Phoenix only four peaks pumpkin ale and Sonoran white chocolate are as good as the cherry bomb triple ipa and barley wine found at sun up
He was correct in that it was an amazing wine but this goes to show his style honestly and integrity
i'm never one to turn down a good drink deal so i said why not
I had worked my way down the drink list and was feeling pretty good about most everything that night and I am not ashamed to say so
The food was fantastic the drinks tasty/strong and the prices reasonable
The pancakes are amazing especially when accompanied by the pure maple syrup they serve warm in a brand-new glass that is yours thumbs up for not having to use a massivly sticky gross syrup canister sitting at the table
He also made some great recommendations when it came to the beer which they take seriously
It is literally half the volume of a 'normal' double espresso served in a single shot espresso glass but QUALITY WAAAAAAAAAAAAY over Quantity baby
The wine I ordered a white Zin was good
I had 2 beers my husband had 2 margaritas they're very good by the way
The drinks were good and strong like I like and reasonably priced

The drinks were not very good for the priceWe did not have the food but judging by what I saw it looked like traditional bar fare
The house beers are below average in my opinion The food was not good at all
I was only there for a late afternoon lunch and enjoyed some great prices on wine by the glass and some half priced appetizers including skirt steak and calamari
My sweet potato fries were good as were the regular beer battered one
She was polite and easygoing and we had a good time chatting while she was making my drink
The food is terrible quality and the drinks extremely well measured meaning they are not strong
I didn't sample any of the wines I'm waiting to go back for lunch one day for the $5 glasses but the beer list was good
get one before you go because it is so worth it and you can use it for beer -  http//bit
The staff is always friendly the food is always good and the wait is long enough that you have time to enjoy a glass of wine or two before sitting down to dinner

We just wanted good food and beers and did not care about airport mark up as long as we could get something good
The beers weren't amazing but were solidly good and very cold
I don't mind being next door at Bar Bianco drinking some wine with friends and a few appetizers

But BJ's beer is actually really good
Some of the wines I've had are excellent
A microbrewery with delicious food a HUGE outdoor patio that's dog-friendly amicable and helpful staff and oh right did I mention that their beer is amazing
Complimentary valet root beer candy at the hostess stand great people and the part that doesn't make you feel guilty about leaving your pooch at home they make homemade dog biscuits from leftover grain from brewing mixed with peanut butter and some other goodies so your pup can have a good time too when you get home
Great service cold local beer and a good selection of better than average bar food
I personally recommend getting a mini-pitcher of beer for yourself but if the hard stuff is your flavor they've got a full bar including decent wine
I don't know if it was because we were all in such good spirits and a bit sauced when we arrived but I could see myself going back for football or beer pong etc if I lived in AZ
We ordered miso soup an appetizer a bottle of wine that was half off because of a Sunday special they had going on and 4 rolls
the food here was excellent the prime rib was one of the best I have ever had  all seemed very well doneI was talked down on my wine selection lol typical steakhouse wine I did not like the horseradish it was really sour ALMOST not fresh but that was it
I did not take advantage of the wonderful beer selection but look forward to it in the future
If you ask her for her opinion she says in a very stoned face and quick manner it's good no descriptors no recommendations but simply It's good  Then if you pause even for  a second she says I will be right back let me get this other table their drinks really quickly while I give you time to decide  Then we had Charity Case waitress
Items with seafood will be a bit more expensive maybe a bit over the $9 markA very good meal for under $10 excluding drink
Their tap handles always pour a wonderful variety - a beer for all tastes
Events are soo much fun because everyone who appreciates good beer comes out to just have a good time
You either get ASU students locals and regulars people from out of town beer snobs or people that are just wanting to have a good time
Definitely worth going we went there everyday for 2 weeks straight the wine burgers are delicious and surprisingly so are the chili dogs
Dinner comes out before the appetizer dishes were cleared and we were starting to have an excessive amount of glasses and bottles on the table that the server didn't feel necessary to remove from the table
Any bottle of wine and the bruschetta board comes with 4 flavors of your choosing 4 slices of each
Out of nowhere comes this wonderful woman asking the three of us if we would like a table in the back in the wine cave
We jumped at her offer and with that sat down on a very comfortable couch with three glasses of wonderful wine
They have a pretty good wine selection too and you can get some fairly inexpensive labels to try
The root beer pulled pork which was the most dry pulled pork I have ever had but the overall flavor was lacking as well
The drinks are high quality; I prefer the fresh brewed ice tea
The beers were very good and were really rock solid
I really enjoyed the place just wish the drinks were made a lil stronger
Fuego Cityscape is downstairs from the downtown Gold's Gym where me and my friend exercise then go to Fuego for a glass of Zinfandel which is excellent and something delicious for dinner
After some drinks the table shared some appetizers including the deep fried chilis and pulled pork sliders
All of the drinks were full and the house had a pretty good wine selection
I was ready for a drink at the bar and I was looking pretty good so I thought I'd be the vamp at the bar that night
Went here for happy hour which is 7 days a week btwAll speciality drinks and appetizers were half price
FOOD AND DRINKThe Pork Sandwich was very good and so was my wifes salad the drinks were authentic yet creative and I can honestly not say a bad word about anything
On our mini tour we saw the amazing glass front bar welcoming huge wood common tables and stellar use of various materials all coming together perfectly
Awesome place they'll let you sample a ton of wines and they always have mind-blowing recommendations
this is where I go to discover amazing values on wine that offer complex taste & unusual characteristics
For side drinks my wife from South Africa loves to get a picher of Guava Juice to soak in a flavor from home and this is a great place to take kids or buddies for a game on the many TVs
I have spent many of nights on the patio enjoying glass after glass of wine with good company
They have pretty good deals and carry some brands that even total wine or bevmo don't have
I've bought coffee cups salad bowls and utensils my big budda for good luck who've i've named kingston some artwork curtains and more bar glasses then I need
So it's definitely worth ordering a pitcher when you compare the price of a pitcher versus the price of an individual glass
Our drinks were always filled and as soon as we finished a plate she took it almost immediately as well as the awesome service from our server and lastly everything we ordered was so so SO good
I am not very good with wine lingo but those are my unofficial terms that make sense to me

+  A really good drink menu+ A great happy hour+ Great atmosphere- Long wait for a table even when several tables are empty this has been the case for me on several occasions but luckily not last nightWait staff is hit or miss - luckily our server last night was fine although he didn't have much personality- Tables really close together both inside and outIn my case the positives really outweigh the negatives
The place is very dark and very loud so it is a good place to hang out with a group of friends and dance or drink
I had a mimosa while waiting and while it was very good with fresh squeezed orange juice the eleven dollar setback for a single drink was a bit much
She was very friendly made great recommendations and most importantly kept our drinks filled
I tried the featured white wine and whatever it was sorry I forgot was good
The beer is amazing the food is amazing and the people are amazing
Go to Four Peaks enjoy the food enjoy the atmosphere and most importantly enjoy the delicious beer
I asked what beer i should drink and he placed a delicious ale in front of me
Beer Flight from anything on the board is a tasty treat for experienced beer drinkers or a nice way for less serious drinkers to explore
They have an amazing wine cabinet if you can call it that more like a wine wall that I'm trying to convince my boyfriend we need in our house
Our party was treated to a dessert sweet board of goodies courtesy of the Herb box on this confectionary tray was a red velvet cupcake a fig apple bundt cake a rootbeer cupcake a passionfruit type cake and a chocolate type pastry
But the place does good overall and sells beer unlike their place at Pima/Frank Lloyd Wright so I'll give them 4 stars
Once again we were wowed by the drinks and the very tasty food
The bar serves up some wild concoctions that will surely cure what ails you and there's a good selection of saku00e9s and a creative wine list
The flavors were perfect and the drinks compliment these creative dishes
Most of the pizzas here have a fresh and clean tast - which is really good with their wines and cocktails selections
We also enjoyed the complimentary wine and hors d'oeuvres  every evening

We migrated to the patio where I had a cider beer for only $6 very tasty
I enjoyed orange slice martinis and shared several appetizers with friends
We ordered a couple drinks and an appetizer bacon wrapped scallops
I didn't even know this place served other breakfasty stuff until I came here myself but the other pastries & coffee drinks sound good as well
Sangria and house wine was only $3 and a number of 1/2 price appetizers
They had a good amount of water to drink and supplied mango scented towels which was nice
our friend introduced us to the most amazing Spanish beer
Sunglasses also a good idea as my son got eyeburn last time we were there
They were too busy hugging and giggling with the old not even good looking male farts to get our drinks and our checks in a timely manner
Maybe that's why the place gets such rave reviews - after a few drinks almost anything tastes good
If there was something that impressed me was how many times the waiter came by to refill our drinks
I tried a taste of hubby's beer and well it was also very good I just can't remember the name of it
It was a Thursday 2 for 1 drinks til midnight but I thank my good time to the company I was in and the lovely people watching the crowd here provided

The bartenders manage to serve drinks and never look up at the bar pretty amazing talent if I say so
It wasn't a hit you in the face type of drink but had very good flavor
Convenient location pretty good iced cafe mocha free wifi punch-card so every 10th espresso drink is free outdoor seating
OK I could ask for really good pastries and I could ask for toddy drinks
Our party of about 20 ordered a mix of things ranging from the cheese plate to paninis to bottles of wine to pastas and everything I ate and drank was super delicious
Good food lots of TVs with games on fun atmosphere - but where you can still talk nice outdoor seating with misters on those hotter than hell days and an amazing beer list
I'm not even a big beer drinker but I have enjoyed some of the ones on tap here
Right after the pizzas the sides/appetizers and desserts taunt you from a cooler covered with glass that seems to sparkle thanks to all the delicious treats inside
I usually do 3-4 mixed drinks and leave feeling pretty good without spending more than 20 bucks including tips

There were about twenty of us there and everyone clean their plates and glass- pretty much all of their chimichangas were really good
I can't believe I enjoyed a drink that much that had no alcohol in it
Good hostess + decent service + lousy drinks + lousy and mediocre food = a place I'm not running to ever visit again
Skye in a nutshellDrinks Pretty damn goodFood Decent nothing spectacularMusic Great esp after drinks - an older British fellow and his Bonnie Tyler-wannabe partner do a pretty decent job of getting the fifty-somethings up to do The Hustle although to be honest it's more like the Shuffle with that crowd
In some ways it embodies a European sensibility--the communal dining small menu limited drink menu rustic decor and the uber-gracious hostess who went out of her way to save a table for our large party when I called ahead are all reminiscent of places I've been in Europe where dining is about simple flavors good wine and great conversation
However good drinks is only half the battle for a coffee shop the joint also needs good bakery goods
They have a good crew over their that really know their shit when it comes to good beer
Happy hour is half off almost all alcohol and the seasonal beers on tap are excellent
Jamaican Blue is a good spot for late night coffee or a glass of wine or beer
It's a local company the theatres are clean the popcorn is good and best of all you can get a plastic cup for the same price as a regular drink that can be refilled for just $1
Luckily we managed to score a table pretty quickly in this very cool wine bar/restaurant which looks great and had a good atmosphere going on
Postino is my favorite restaurant in the Valley but sometimes you just don't want to schlep all the way up to Arcadia for a couple of glasses of wine and an appetizer
The wine selection was excellent but the food needed just a little tweaking
The vindaloo was quite spicy but delicious and the beer complemented it perfectly
Ok beer selection but they have good daily specials that make it an economical place to have a meal and beer
If your looking for a hip fun and delicious wine bar/restaurant your search is over
The wait staff and patrons are great peoples that come to enjoy a good beer and their friends
Speaking of bringing you the glass the service is wonderful
Its never a good sign when you have to ask the hostess for drinks and your bill
GREAT date night spot great place to get together with a group of friends great for appetizers just dessert wine anything you can think of
They have a few good beers on tap but most of them are what you've seen a million times already
For like $7-$8 and some change in the tip jar you can get a big sub fries and a drink either regular fountain or pick from 100+ different flavored sodas from out of the 6 coolers they have

They also have this mango drink that is amazing
What keeps me coming back to the 'Dillo is the perfect blend of- Delicious food drink or no drink- Reasonable drink prices- Servers who go out of their way to learn about their customers Yes 2PM on a Monday can be depressing
This place has the typical bar food and a good selection of beer
Our server Tina greeted us with a big smile and ready to take our drink orders along with telling of her favourite appetizers

The lunch special Rumba Burrito Drink and Rumba Fries is a good value
I would have more inclined to give Green House a 5 star rating had a couple of poor Customer Service issues not occurred because the food was excellentFirst we ordered drinks there were 4 of us but only 3 drinks were ordered
We came in for the specialty drinks which were good
Buy a beer and get an appetizer for 50 cents
I've been a fan of Total Wine for some time now but this is a As good as it gets review in my opinion
I've recently found a Pinot Noir from Argentina that has turned my fiance into a red wine lover and a Cab from Chile that I've regarded as good as some of Napa Valley's without the heavy price tag
Total Wine also has an amazing selection of spirits as well
Their coffee is pretty good and they have a much bigger selection of snacks food drinks and toiletries than you'll find at other gas stations
We ran up the street to Total Wine and grabbed a few good bottles
If you're into happy hours they were offering a dollar off all beers and seemed to have a good variety to choose from
It was covered with a good amount of peppercorns and doused in a flavorful red wine sauce
We also got some delicious appetizers - cheese/nuts plate bowl of the largest yummiest olives I've ever had and of course we paired all of them with lots of wine
Our bartender was also a bourbon drinker and recommended the Candlestick Maker
I even skip my usual drink of choice to order the Scottsdale Cocktail yup friggin' awful name but the citrusy goodness in this glass is just too hard to resist
I have come to believe that most of us generally desire that unique union of a robust menu composed of carefully planned and executed dishes with a splash of unique drinks a dazzling wine selection excellent service that offer suggestions to round out a dining experience and finally an atmosphere that lets us focus on our palette not our survival instincts
It was okay because there was music playing good drinks served at the bar and pool tables open but still
I enjoyed the Spaten Lager the small still made a large beer for me but I was in Bavarian heaven today
I have a lot of great memories here at the Roosevelt met a lot of wonderful people and friends who have been a big part of my life whether it is just grabbing a beer at the bar or taking over the huge community table or chilling at the candle lit booth section
and I never actually saw a menu but from what I gather the place is totally popular based off the amount of people and the wait I was told about also that they have a great beer list also a full bar and some wonderful orange special sauce that you definitely need to dip your french fries and whatever else in
I have sampled a few of their specialties on the drink menu and they are all quite good even if they are way overpriced
While waiting for our food we enjoyed our drinks and looked at the memorabilia of John Wayne who frequented Casa Grande often and the San Francisco Giants who had trained in the Casa Grande area
4 beers an appetizer and 2 sandwiches set us back $63 not including tip
We can both enjoy a glass of wine a night under the stars and delicious pizza for under $50
I've been to 5th and Wine twice now and have enjoyed both visits
Their wine deals are great a $5 a glass and their lunch menu was good
Quick friendly service good food and drinks good prices
We started off with a couple of drinks I got the pink mojito which I really enjoyed it wasn't sweet which was perfect for me my husband got a sochu which he ended up not liking very much
The mussels in white wine broth were yummy the Thai snapper was moist and flavorful and my braised veal cheeks were rich and delicious
Not much of an ambiance to go along with the tasty wine
The wines I tried were absolutely delicious
My beer was good and cold  my friend ordered a vodka and orange juice and commented that it was a nice stiff drink -  We both said we were glad we stumbled upon Tony's and will be back

Yes the wine the appetizers and the food was simply that good
My cucumber gin martini was delicious and refreshing he also enjoyed his beer
After ordering our meal we asked for the non filtered sake and the waitress said it was definitely a good pairing for our food selection it would nutralize the heat with the suttle sweetness man was she right it was like horchata
If you're only going to drink i would recommend hitting up this spot
Additionally the downstairs bar was great and served up some great appetizers and drinks
The brewed beer here is good but not the best brewery beer I've had
The chips with guacamole cheese and pico de gallo is a nice appetizer as you put a few beers down
I was impressed they dont gouge you on wine prices
He took his time to assist us with the menu and recommending favorites as well as being very attentive our glass was never half empty
Glasses of wine were $9 a pop but you could tell it was good wine so I wasn't too bummed about that
It took 20 minutes to get appetizers and drinks took almost as long
And they have an amazing local beer selection
if you are looking for a fun heavy drinking for CHEAP CHEAP dancing kick back time with music it's a good place
It's a chill place where you listen to Jimmy Buffet with amazing frozen drinks and a pretty guaranteed fun time
They have decent happy hour but the drinks were warm and not good

They have pretty good drink specials and their hibiscus tea is mighty tastey
They're the delicious beer battered kind and not that breaded bullshit you get from Burger King
To conclude this intoxicating tale - if you have enjoyed one of their brews immensely and want to take it home purchase a Growler with the beer of your choice
What I got was an awesome selection of kareoke amazing drink prices and about the friendliest group of customers and staff I've seen in a Phoenix bar
Next on my list from these great people is Baratin - they just opened up a little wine bar cafe and I'm sure the food is going to be just as amazing
All other nights the happy hour price of a pint is $3 which is pretty damn good and the draft beer selection is good too
The kitchen is open pretty late the food is excellent there's no cover and the food/drink prices are reasonable
The mixed drinks were delicious and flavorful instead of cloyingly sweet like many places make them
Fresh flowers + great selection of wine and cheese + all the essentials They deal is that they cut out the middle man to get great prices for quality products and they don't have sales because they always sell their products at the best price possible
Friendly staff good drinks and delicious food
The wine list is comprehensive for both the white and red wine enthusiasts and the servers are willing to make recommendations off of the list from their cellar
Good place for under 30 and killer beer selection on tap Gulden Drak on Tap

It had a good wine sauce however again a little on the salty side
The drinks itself are good and classic nothing too crazy or fancy

The drinks are good and the boba is fantastic
Be warned that some of the more exotic flavors are pretty weird by American standards and if you don't know what you're getting yourself into you might not be happy with your drink
follow the advice of others here and go find a better way to spend your waiting time than spending money on wine and appetizers
They have this amazing wall with coolers filled with every kind of imaginable beer
We were so happy we did because the panoramic views from the deck were absolutely stunning hard to believe that you can see so much just by going up six floors and the drinks that the bartender stationed on the roof mixed for us were really good he makes a mean not-too-sweet margarita if that's your thing
We just got our drinks sat down on the very modern and super-comfortable orange sectionals and caught up on each other's news while watching the amazingly beautiful sunset reflect off the buildings downtown and the mountains on all sides of us
Or you could do what we did and just stop by for an hour or two and enjoy some good drinks on the amazing rooftop deck
I awoke the next morning to find a note written to myself in my phone that merely saidlos abbey angel share is the most delciousber of allll timeAs you can clearly read Lost Abbey Angel's Share is the most delicious beer of all time
I stuck with ice tea but my friend had a drink and she said it was very good
Had heard good things about the beer and the food and decided to spend the evening hanging out with friends over a few cold ones
I wasn't too impressed the first time I popped in here because despite my appreciation for the beers they had on tap I really could not a get a feel on the vibe which is VERY important to me
Also try this place for a delicious brunch with great drinks
So go and press your nose up on the bakery's glass display case showcasing it's decident sweet goods and dont' shoplift any cheese
My bad because when I got the tab it surprised me that the drink cost $9-it wasn't worth $9
They have a fantastic basil martini that is always worth trying not to mention a great wine list
Attended for Restaurant Week for the first time and enjoyed everything from the decadent  yet relaxing decor to the atmosphere food drink and attractive wait staff
I started off with a red wine spritzer a first and oh so tasty the antipasti appetizer plate which was simply scrumptious
It's intimate cozy and serves good solid beer
They've got excellent inventive cocktails and a good wine selection
Drink service was always good especially when I was a regular
Great decor wine bottles being opened frequently and excellent food that I can't pronounce
I got a Papago Brewing Orange Blossom beer which is a locally-brewed lager with an orange flavor
Overall if you enjoy a wide selection of good beers and a casual place to hang out definitely check out Papago brewing company with some friends
Our waiter was also the sommelier and he recommended a great wine after surveying our collective tastes and entree choices
The Mango Saketini's are very very good
I did taste an horchata alcoholic drink that was tasty
The specials are nice I just have to find a good drink in there
My boyfriend enjoyed a couple of their local beers
We should have left right away but instead walked over to the bar for pre-dinner drinks and appetizers
We all enjoyed some wine and ordered the spinach and a special essentially ham with diced red pepper
We sat there for a good 7 minutes before our waitress came over for drink orders and it seemed to set the pace for the evening
It's a great place to hang out and maybe meet for appetizers and drink but hey it's Mill Ave and there are better restaurants within walking distance
Spent $26 on 1 Appetizer 1 Entree' and two drinks
quesadilla the food that's really hard to mess up so I got it is only fair but the drinks are very tasty
Finally a place that northern phoenicians can go to to get good beer
Very much more like a pizza joint than a bar even though they have a wide variety of good beers both local microbrew and imports
Being the only real game in the area they will do good so if you like pizza and beer check them out
Sitting right behind the post office on Mill  Dog 2 Go is a special hot dog stand  dry goods beer and wine shop hybrid
With a choice between poppy or sesame seeds on your hot dog bun sesame obviously--a bunch of toppings and good deals on hot dog-drink-chip combos Thirsty Dog 2 Go is definitely a relatively new favorite on Mill
And apparently they have happy hour 24-7 so the drinks were a very good value
If you live close by and need a drink I would recommend this place
Great diverse selection of music playing excellent & very friendly service great wine and the food
Pair that with a few bottles of wine and we were good to go
Cool art modern space unique/fun drinks pretty people and good food
I opted for a drink off their cocktail menu titled Cider Bellini and it was a delicious treat that reminded me of Fall due to the cinnamon and apple cider
A glass of white wine the 6-dollar one is good works well with the food I've had here
Once we got our appetizers and drinks and placed our order she seem to be in a better mood
Husband got a mixed drink with the rum still good
They have great special drink prices and an excellent selection of standard barfare but with additional unexpected treats as well
Thoughtful because they provided me with a super tasty drink on the fly
Every time I have a special event or just want some good food or drinks
The Thai beer I enjoyed while waiting certainly helped pass the time
Both entrees with two soft drinks came out to around $30 which might seem a bit steep for lunch in Chandler but believe me it was worth every bite
The endive salad with pickled grapes smoked almonds and spicy blue cheese in a white wine vinaigrette was good although perhaps a bit too bitter for my tastes
all that I know is a good pairing brings out the flavors in the wine and the flavors in the dish right
Nonetheless the wines chosen were good wines and I enjoyed each one particularly the last one a Black Moscat
The sauce gives the sweetness of the bread a bit of a tang and following it up with a sip of the wine kept the flavors coming
My date and I twiddled our thumbs on top of the long-closed drink menus for a good 10 minutes before our server came back to take our order
It took an unreasonably long time for our hummus appetizer to arrive - only then did we also receive our sweaty drink glasses
My average ticket is about $30 per person - including wine and yes it's totally worth it
Drinks all set we start looking at appetizers - their Facebook page advertises $5 happy hour in reality they have about 4 glasses of wine and a few vodka drinks for $5 there is no food in the $5 happy hour
They offer a great happy hour with $1 pollo carnitas and pastor street tacos along with $3 margaritas very tasty beer and wine
It started with a request for a wine recommendation
I don't think our waiter knew much more than us and the wine he recommended was barely drinkable
The food was fine - we did add the coq au vin which was a flavorful sauce of fresh herbs mushrooms garlic spices and burgundy wine
The server did a great job recommending wines
They have a good variety of cocktails and spirits to choose from but my favorite is probably a drink called the G-spot classy I know
It was a great time with good drinks and friends
I love their signature cherry vodka drink its tasty
Guess the bat cave bartenders have some good drink radar going on
Almost all sushi appetizers  and drinks are 50% off so you can eat a and drink for a reasonable price
they've replaced the large succulent shrimp with smaller specimens that were decidedly not tasty or even beer battered
We have done plenty of wine tastings at all sorts of places and at most pay $8 for normally 6 glasses of wine with good servings
They have a nice happy hour menu liberally discounted appetizers cheap drinks including exported beers except the Vietnamese 33 beer
Of course being a purveyor  of good taste I order this and was told sorry this beer is not on the happy hour menu So I quickly moved West  and order a nice Chinese beer
They had a good selection of British beers on tap- Tetley and Boddingtons as well as your other standard brews
Drinks in plastic cups out in the hot tub rated high on my list of things I enjoyed too
Beer RecommendationsLady friend who hates beer Snake BiteHop Head PaleComplex Beer Drinker Stumbler or MonkeyShinePilsner
light and amazing wheat finish I can drink this all dayBlonde ok little citrus Pilsner was betterPale
Add a glass of wine for heart health and it's a healthy and delicious meal
Good beer good food and outdoor seating is a plus
I enjoy the fact that the produce is fresh there's a good variety of organics the prices are reasonable and they have a decent cheese and wine selection
It is affordable and the resort fee is worth it as it includes free parking free long distance and local calls free internet and free snacks and drinks at the front desk
When my friend finally flagged down our non-existent waiter to grab her a clean glass he brought one over and said Is this good enough for you
They have some really interesting and high quality beers in bottles but unfortunately the girl behind the bar wasn't terribly experienced with beer and couldn't tell us much about one or two that I was unfamilar with
I consider this a very minor inconvienence and perhaps if business picks up and enough people request it they will add some good beers to the tap otherwise I'd rather drink a bottle of beer at home than in a bar
The drinks are very good if a bit pricy and the apps are wonderful
Unfortunately I had to pass on the alcohol this time but opted for a root beer instead which was refreshing and tasty
For example when she noticed the girlfriend and I having a fun conversation she politely asked if we wanted out entrees to come out quickly or if we wanted to linger over our appetizer and wine a bit
Bar--fully stocked fully staffed good drinks
The drinks were tasty and strong but expensive
Total dive bar cheap steaks strong drinks and a gaggle of mostly OK comedians some were very good
They've got a decent selection of draft beer and a pretty good selection of top shelf liquor better then I expected from the outside
Hands down our favorite place for some quality beans and drinks
After the food is delivered good luck trying to get another beer
But everyone really enjoyed the plum wine
It may have been shockingly bitter if you are used to ordering drinks with sugar syrups but I had recently changed up my routine at my local coffee shop in Tucson to use sugar free white mocha so it was nice to mostly taste the coffee flavor in all its glory
The food's good the beer's usually good the brewmaster's awesome
It's a very nice wine bar with very good food and excellent service
I've yet to have an actual meal here just apps and drinks but the menu items look tasty I'm especially looking forward to trying the Sweet Jalapeno Burger and if the execution is on par with the mouthgasm that is the wings I'm sure I'll be satisfied
If you're looking for random import foods like the real Hinze Baked Beans or a really good wine this is the place
if you want a steak grilled to perfection quality service wine and authentic french meals you go to provance
we still got happy hour priced drinks thoughAs an appetizer we ordered Calamari and I gotta tell you it was fantastic
Multiple generations of my family have come here; my grandfather brought my dad as a young boy when in Phoenix for business in the '30s with cattle all around back then; all of us kids had our 16th birthday in the Pink Room; my uncle would visit from dry SLC and my dad would treat him to martinis and dinner at Stockyards; it was the place for serious dates the place we unanimously chose to go for dinner when we were all home and so many good times
Check it while I break it down two whole new rows of fake meat to try killer fresh produce sushi to go that is actually tasty cheap juices to try mocha chocolate sandwiches cat food good red wine delish cheap soy yogurt with real fruit vegan granola my favourite shampoo and conditioner pineapple empanadas cheap soy milk feminine products 55 cents dark chocolate no preservatives or additives and frozen raspberries and Spanish quick race that kicked TJs ass
We started with drinks and appetizers at the bar
The drinks were affordable and a good pour
It's a good thing your drinks are still cheap and you're right off the lightrail or we would've had some serious problems
But next time I hope that I don't have to wait an eternity for my glass of wine and wonderfully delicious bruschetta
My bf got some beer that was almost 12% alcohol and it was pretty good besides the aftertaste that made it taste like a shot I drove home of course lol
I didnt have any liquor but the beer prices were pretty good
Just add a glass and you've got a good bathroom experience
Bombay Spice also has a good selection of inexpensive wines available for $20-$40 per bottle that complement the food well
Overall Sierra Bonita grill was a great restaurant and I will totally be coming back for happy hour as they have appetizer discounts and drink specials
I didn't order a drink but my friends did and they said the bloody mary was pretty good as was their beer list
The highlights for us are the relaxing atmosphere good Mexican food attentive service cold Negro Modelo beers and talented mariachis playing music
There are a lot of good beers on draft and the batender knew how to properly pour a Guinness
Lemonade Cracker Jax Hot Dogs Beer Peanuts Sunflower Seeds and a good 'ol mouthful of chew just kidding - Jared told me to write that
Listen I just wasn't in the mood for drinking while I was there for a group meeting of a couple hours so I really can't tell you if the drinks were good; but I can tell you that the bartender treated me like a valued customer
My parents had the late-night summer 3-course special that included two glasses of wine one appetizer two entrees and two desserts for $50
For me Bud Light is good enough for a cheap Sunday beer-watching event
We had good food good drinks and a good time in general
We ordered a couple of delicious drinks the Spring Chicken ate some of the very good bread and started discussing the menu
It was great pre-drinking is always a good time but about 2 hours into the wait we went to check on our table and we were told we were taken off the list because we didn't check in every hour
Service was average no enthusiasm about a wine recommendation and I guess they don't believe in water refills
we decided to order a cold sake and it was recommended by our waiter good choice
They have Tecate beer but not on tap -   Margaritas are good
I was very impressed by the increase in the amount of beer vendors in addition to wine vendors for this year's go-round
Hanny's is a fun place to go but really only for one drink and one appetizer
I dislike meat on top of pasta or potatoes  because when you cut it you crush it into the pasta  The wine list was good the teramasu was good
For $240 for four people it wasnt worth it subtract $78 for wine it was still high
The micro-brew and local beers are rich and tasty served ice cold
If you are going to do BLT's you should do them well--spend a little on wonderful tomatoes and put enough bacon on them to live up to their namesake--for $8--i expected more than a strip of bacon--They also put the sandwich on brioche--which is not the right bread for a BLT--the sandwich needs a dense bread--well toasted to offset the moisture in the mayo and tomatoes--this thing was hard to eat at best
I can see going back to the garage for a drink at the bar--but it will not be on my list for lunch or any other meal  I think these mechanics need to go back for some more training on quality
I can plug in my laptop in multiple locations the coffee is excellent although I don't drink the espressos and the music is perfect for working not too loud or distracting
Glad to see some good bottles of beer Dogfish Head Odell's etc on the drink menu and the wine list has some nice wine selections as well
Good thing too because Hubby's beef potato mushroom & dark beer boxty was out of this world
Service was great  drinks were refilled way before they emptied  good service nice staff
The live jazz band was of course a great attraction - good oldies good wine and dark rooms always make you feel warm inside
They were both really good drinks and brought up our mood from the prior disappointments
Once you've tried their brew then I suppose you could go for a different drink next time which I promise will also be wonderful
Dinner combos are freakin' huge and the Mexican drinks horchata tamarindo and jamaica are delicious
The drinks were good and strong but I dont know about the prices
There were tons of beers and non-alcoholic drinks all around and it was happy hour so tons of low cost appetizers
The drawbacks are a relative lack of seasonal beers; a fruit-based beer always on tap and thus taking space from a more deserving beer that really tastes like beer and not some fruit soda enjoyed only by those who need training wheels on their beer they probably drink Coors at home; and the freakin' summer when it's 110 outside
Other than that a most excellent place for decent food very friendly servers and excellent beer probably the best microbrews in the Phoenix area
At Copper Blues everyone is out to have a good time listen to great music and have a few quality drinks
We got an Olive Appetizer a Cheese Plate and Bruschetta Brie & Apples with Fig Spread Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone Tomato Jam & Fresh Sheeps Milk Cheese and Roasted Peppers with Goat CheeseI got the Nine IronHickory smoked bacon layered with grilled chicken fresh burratamozzarella lettuce beefsteak tomato and dijonnaiseMy wife and her friend split the VegetarianGrilled asparagus roasted artichokes red onion vine ripetomatoes goat cheese and house made pestoAnd of course a bottle of wine
Very limited and not so good selection of beers available
It kills me when you see someplace with good food and good wine ignore something that goes better with their food but ignore it because it isn't upscale rnough for them
The blueberry martini is my favorite and it comes with delicious fresh blueberries floating in the bottom of the glass
The beer is cold the chefs are nice and good at what they do
To put you in a good mood there's a number of specialty cocktails a nice wine list and 4 draught beers plus others by the bottle
Very good text message specials classic drive-thru good value overall 10-stamp freebie cards and cleverly designed and consistent-quality drinks
The neat and admirable thing is that they make such good drinks around the sub-prime coffee roast so overall they are still very good drinks
Unknown  Their frozen and fufu drinks look awfully tasty but I wouldn't know how they rate compared to competitors
I wil also give them props for their coffee drinks they were good
Radio is know for their great cocktails but not one person in our dining party ordered one as we stuck with glass after glass of Peroni $5 a deliciously light Italian beer
Good old fashioned and uniquely Arizona outside dive bar/historic landmark/good music/greasy food/decent beer selection/edible burgers
when he asked about another beer his description was very similar although slightly more helpful Its our darkest beer its good
The mix drinks seemed strong and the servers were good about coming around and checking on you
Be patient with the service as they make your drinks from scratch with fresh ingredients it will be worth the wait
The menu is not huge but it does offer basic good drinks
They have plenty of syrups to flavor your drinks if that's what you're into
I began to contemplate whether or not  It takes two by Robb Base was a good music selection while trying to unwind and chill with a glass of sauvignon blanc
The beer and wine selection both were extensive including full descriptions of the flavors of each listed on the menu
So many to choose from Luncha Libre with their mason jar drinks Short Leash Dogs with their insanely creative hot doggies Emerson Fry Bread with their flavorful concoctions on Indian Bread Mojo Bowl with there fresh handmade smoothies Creme Brulee with their rich torched goodness Hey Joe with their fun Filipino Street Food Taste Rite with their oodles of noodles Burgermania with their American style classic burgers n fries or how about some Buzznbeez Good Food with their soulful Cajun southern dishes
The guy that checked me out made some great recommendations on some other bottles of Melbach wine as that was what I was getting
The atmosphere is laid back the dress ranged from t-shirts and shorts to sun dresses and collared shirts the wines are good and the food is really good
Amazing food and drinks but sadly a little too pricey for me
As a drink I ordered the Blue Raspberry and it was delicious
The sushi price is a tad high if you order exotic items which is why i only come during happy hoursTheir happy hour is awesome an array of appetizers/drinks/rolls for 50% of the regular menu price
Seems like they have a pretty good drink menu so maybe a cool bar hangout instead of a meal choice pick
but I could be jaded because of all the wonderful wines I sampled
For exotic wines and exotic meats appetizers look up Down Under Wines
the very first time I ate here was over a year ago and i was pleasantly surprised with good quality rolls satay pot stickers not the best but good and decent drinks
in Phoenix another fabulous bar and restaurant by the way for the seen and to be-seen--and reasonable with amazing martinis The parlor Pizzeria has the same architectural appeal and style
and a very sexy  waitstaff I must add the Chicago-style or New York-style thin crust is super delicious and the drinks--OMG
Oh and if you need a tasty beverage you have the option of the soda fountain or bottled water seltzer and Mexican beer
Come here between 4-8p Friday and Saturday or all night Mondays-Thurdays -  and all the appetizers are 1/2 off as well as many great cocktails for $5 in addition to beer and wine specials
And they let me use my Living Social deal even though my drinks and appetizer were off the happy hour menu
I won't waste your or my time with obtuse banter so here is the rundown - Atmosphere typical black and red Japanese decor - Bathrooms cool stone sinks that drip and slosh water on your feet so be aware - Sashimi overpriced so-so quality served in a glass bowl over ice - Rolls underwhelming - Calipico soda fabulous - Deserts yummy but small - Birthday celebrations abundant and noisy with little tambourines that lit up
com peeps together with the Downtown Friday Nights crew and they had some AMAZING deals on drinks
Today we enjoyed a brew and a glass of red
Ok good service nice atmosphere good food excellent sake not priceless
Draft beer prices are amazing and the service was good
Oh and to top it off aside from the tasty beers the even had fresh cooked chocolate butterscotch rice krispy treats behind the counter
You're close your food is fairly good your drinks are hefty and your 2 dollar bloodies are quickly becoming a weekly excursion for me
Excellent wine list and pairing with each course
Even with a few beers the meal was super reasonable - we did get happy hour prices for the appetizers but I feel like our wallets were just as satisfied as we were
Service was pretty good; they kept my drink full and removed empty plates quickly
The ambiance service and wine list here are amazing
I will be back for drinks but I wouldn't order appetizers again
Their mimosa had their beer in it which was a wonderful twist I will remember in the future
Definitely recommend their beer if your in the area
A good place to visit for really cold beer and that all important scoreline when ih the city of Phoenix
It was delicious and they did give me a free drink
My wife and I went during happy hour and we ordered all kinds of appetizers and martinis
Drinks are good and they usually have good specials
They have Jamaica flavored drink in the fountain dispenser it's red it's tangy and it's delish the creamiest refried beans you've ever experienced lard-a-rific hot ginormous fresh flour tortillas that melt in your mouth chorizo that makes me buy it on impulse and freeze it for Carolina-free Sundays or long trips and hot sauce so good it makes me crave it fortnightly
Flavorful food reasonable prices strong drinks what more do you need
It was drinkable but that's hardly a recommendation
Anyhow my sister and I sat down and ordered a yellowtail appetizer and a few drinks and then she ordered a few rolls while I stuck with the sashimi plate that I usually get
The wings were amazing and it was very refreshing to have a big draft beer out on the front patio
The cocktail menu is inventive and we both enjoyed deliciously unique drinks
The wine menu offers a good variety of foreign wines but it would be nice to see some nice domestic options as well
When we found out that the movie we wanted to see at camelview was sold out and it was another hour before the next showing we decided to hit up yard house for a quick beer and maybe an appetizer
The lights and decor were wonderful and multiple areas to purchase drinks made it easier
It has a euro feel with the narrow market quarters and glassed selections of baked goods and other tasty morsels
We enjoyed wine with each plate and the selection is broad for regions and open for varietals
Province is definitely in the $$$ range - even with the Local Dines certificate we had our bill still came out to over $50 for just 2 drinks 2 entrees and 1 appetizer
The wine list is good - you can't go wrong with the Vietti or any of the italian wines they carry
We ordered Cilantro Lime Hummus appetizer and a beer sampler with 6 of their hand crafted beers plus a pear cider
The Hummus plate came with beer flatbread that was absolutely wonderful
However they do have a large bar so if you do have to wait that would be a good way to drink the time away
$2 Miller Lite bottles and $3 Zuma Juice were the drinks enjoyed by my husband and I
So for $13 before tip Chris and I enjoyed five drinks
We started with a round of drinks nice variety of options and an appetizer of the bacon wrapped shrimp - beautifully presently and perfect portion size for a party of four
Which is a good thing the only thing I miss about eating/drinking at big chain restaurants is the thought given to the design and feel of the space
What a perfect day with good food good friends a sunny day and a cold glass of bubbly
The bartender had told me that their Arizona wine selection on the menu was surprisingly good so I gave it a shot
So if you wanna go hang out with the guys get a quick bite and a drink with your girlfriend or go on a crazy beer safari Papago Brewing Company is a great choice and I recommend it
Given that their Bloody Marys are great and I've had other good mixed drinks there they would do well to invest in some fresh squeezed juice for their cocktails
In sum good food and great drinks served by lovely people in a nice setting for reasonable prices
The Georgia Peach Tea drink was delicious and packed quite a punch
while I can't dispute that they have 52 beers on tap I can tell you that very few of them are worth drinking
If you are averse to being around a bunch of college students then perhaps this is not the place you should be drinking at but it is still worth a visit for lunch or dinner before the night crowd comes
Drinks are boozy - not watered down at least mine weren't so you get your money's worth there
Overall the wine was good the atmosphere was good and the prices seemed average
The wine and the food is good no matter where you sit but the outdoor seating by the fire is where I like to be
Good place for drinks and a few bites but not recommended for dinner
Besides having a really nice menu they have a wonderful selection of Sake's and asian martini's
Dont get me wrong though we stayed for another three martinis each maybe because of the flirty good looking mid-west bartender or maybe because it was crowded and hot as balls across the way at Z Tejas and Kona
it's not a classy place but you'll get good food and cheap drinks
They have a good selection of pizzas flatbreads wines on their HH menu
The wine list was pretty good though I was sad that I didn't see any local wine offerings
I enjoyed a glass of the Montepulciano and the pour was generous
Small burger Small fry Small drink = $10Burger -- Tomato and Lettuce were fresh and good
The wine list is amazing with over 2000 different varietals available over 20 wine flights and a very knowledgeable staff
Service was excellent and wine selection is all South American
Wonderful service here and a great glass of ice tea too
Normal selection of beers some good and some not so good
Our friends recommended the Peach Brew Beer which had a very strong peach taste to it but still a pretty interesting taste
Half off their wine sangria red & white and their house pizzas which I might add are large and tasty
I highly recommend this location for it's authentic feel and great patio to sit under the stars and Eat Drink and be Merry my Friends
I ordered the large Beer-B-Que pizza pie which was deliciousness in a pan and a ton of pizza I've never had anything like it
At any rate we finally figured out how to order a mango smoothie with ice-cream flavor which isn't real ice cream but some kind of drink mix that comes in a carton
The overwhelmingly red decor was romantically retro although I can see it being an awkward color to be surrounded by while on a business lunch the cream of mushroom soup was creamy and delicious my lobster tail was huge albeit a little dry and our dirty martinis were huge and mixed really well
Robert the owner was very inviting and the wine he picked for us a medium bodied Pino Noir was wonderful
He's still one of the only chefs in town serving Foie Grass and Duck Confite both wonderful and worth the trip if a glass of juice wine is added
Very good selection of beers and especially a good selection on tap
Otherwise a very pleasant place to drink some good beer
Also offered creme blended drinks italian sodas in a plethora of flavors Naked Juice
The wine list was fine nothing special but had a good range of reds and whites and prices
They have a decent beer and wine selection and even their coffee is good
There's something deliciously seventeen about drinking in The Alley
The happy hour pricing which goes until 7 and again at 10 is quite reasonable I spent $15 plus tax and tip for two beers and 2 good sized appetizers
We ordered only wine which was tasty yet a bit on the expensive side
It's a full meal and it tastes soooo good especially with a nice flight of wine
She took my drink order and our appetizer order and left
We had good service until a group of about 15 customers came in we got our appetizers ordered one more beer and did not see our waitress for 20 minutes
They have 24 rotating taps always with great variety and top-notch beers -- and they are pretty good about updating their website with what's currently on tap and chances are if what you want isn't on tap you can probably find it in a cold bottle
you will look good if you bring her here and the wine list is actually very interesting and good selection
all the entrees are sturdy and good but the stars are really the appetizers and the drinks
They offered tons of samples and suggestions for mixing flavors to resemble candy bars desserts fruity drinks etc
But I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for some good boba drinks
Our server was very helpful and recommended some pretty fabulous red wine
My girlfriend who brought me here used to work there so she recommended the bruschetta as an appetizer followed by the  amazing 5th and Wine burger and ending with the cheesecake
Just posting a sign about coupons would be a good idea-The way the bar is set up with a crooked line to order a drink you got to just grab the bartenders attention
The server acted like he was the owner in a good way kind gentle friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and the wines
Selection was limited in order to ensure quality unless of course we're talking about wine and cheese which were always in plentiful supply
The good- Upon check in they gave me tickets for either free drinks or free continental breakfast
- Complimentary drinks and light appetizers every night from 5-6 pm in the lobby
The quality of the drink has not suffered and I am grateful the owner found a way to keep operating during this economic downturn and while  WikiWiki is yawn worthy I give them huge props for letting Eba move in
Good beer & drink selection and good food selection
My recommendation unless you like $12 mixed drinks avoid the center bar as they only serve top-shelf selections
Typically at restaurants they give you the watered down version of signature drinks but these really did have a good kick to them
Others at our table enjoyed their drinks as well
The meal included champagne toast and they gave us each a swag bag which included their wonderful wine salt and a voucher for $25
We normally have amazing dinners for $15-20 total w/ drinks but I think we might splurge a bit for our next trip
Though I wouldn't recommend it since your stomach won't like you if you start pounding down all that beer they have with it
I tried the Peppers & Peaches martini and it sounds weird but was strangely good - I wouldn't drink a lot of them but 1-2 is fine
Four Peaks has good beer not great beer across the board though
Only having had their coffee pastries and wine I can't comment on the food but it looks delicious
When a patron says o I don't need more drink the good bartender shouldn't serve more drink
Thrilled with my drink and delicious burrito I promised to take him here next time
My mother-in-law enjoyed her coffee and the sip she had from my drink
Darko recommended his favorite sake and it was incredible
Sake is damn strong and tastes fantastic with the wonderful food we had
The service I've experienced has always been good and I'd say if you're in the area pop your head in and take a look at the digs with a cold beer
I forgot what kind of wine it was but it was really good
I enjoyed my night at the Praying Monk despite my initial sulk and I would happily return for drinks with friends
The happy hour menu also has good drink specials  $1 sake half price sake carafes and specialty drinks and $4 wine
from the yummy fresh warm bread to the salad with the awesome shaved tomato pieces to my HOMEMADE chicken alfredo which was most definitely the best Ive ever had in my life and the raspberry cheesecake everything was just absolutely amazingthe service was great and the wine selection was HUGE
If you cannot drink AZ tap water you cannot expect to make delicious food with it
The drinks were well made and since we went during happy hour a very good price
The wine selection as you'd expect is very good
Besides people watching though the drinks are good average priced for the area and the food I've tried is actually good
perhaps a beer appetizer or maybe a sacrificial virgin
We stuck around and tormented our waitress like the bartender taught us we got the bill it was pretty fucking expensive for a round of drinks and 2 appetizers but whatever my friends r rich assholes so they paid
I like this place because they always have some cool and unusual beers on tap as well as local favorites from San Tan and Four Peaks but the food is pretty good too
On a good night they run 20+ beers on tap
Also it is worth mentioning that Papago brews their own beer
Their iced tea is AMAZING the best I've ever had and I only drink iced tea and water 99% of the time
Decent wine selection tasty desserts and a fun atmosphere
This might be a good place to meet up for an early drink or a happy hour snack before heading out for the evening
The drinks and baked goods looked great though I haven't yet tried any
The food here is good the drink menu is extensive which is always a must for me and the scene was pretty good
After dinner we piled into one of the private karaoke rooms and thanks to our helpful waitress and many sake bombs we had a wonderful night
So anyway - in spite of this place having great wine selections at reasonable prices considering the cost of the food great pretzel bread the illusion of great service and good food when they allow you to order it I won't be going back
good food ginormous drinks warm atmosphere and awesome service
I had a delicious drink special there it had mint in it
The wine list is pretty good and contains some great values if you know what you re looking for
The drinks are delicious and the food is well prepared
If you didn't read the drink's name or ingredients the subtle almond flavor would have you guessing Hmmm
The latte is awesome and if you're a sucker for sweet drinks like I am I do highly recommend the White Chocolate Mocha
For the overall quality and professionalism go check it out and Chad owner we'll be happy to make you a drink
50 lunch special including the drink IS a good deal
James which I thought was delicious citron vodka elderflower whatever that is and prosecco with a twist served in a martini glass
He enjoyed his next drink the peppered pear with pear vodka and black pepper much better
We did get a drink from the Sky Vodka tent which was really tasty but we didn't go into the Sky Vodka garden or whatever it was called
Some good beer specials which is rare on game day
Sounds like an awesome deal 4 or 5 glasses plus an appetizer
The guard asked us for our room # or whatnot and we just said that we planned to have a drink at the bar and he said good idea
Anyway I think this is a perfect first date place and also a good place to go if you want to feel like you are part of high society as long as you don't mind paying a lofty price for a drink or two
Nestled in a rather dull shopping strip this industrial and simultaneously cozy building harbors some delicious beer and good memories
Being able to play games and eat whatever I want while sipping on some good drinks was an excellent way to spend time with friends and then again with my husband
Even better there is a big open sliding glass door that connects Hava Java to The Gelato Spot -- a truly delicious place with tons of great flavors
Go here for after work/school drinks bar area is amazing
The drinks though are watered down and neither refreshing nor tasty - that goes for the soft drinks and the booze
I really enjoyed it here but there's too much freakin broken glass on any of the trails down near the main shade/view structure that you should realy avoid it if you have your dogs with you and stick to the more wilderness areas
I think it also had some orange flavor to it b/c it was served with a curl of orange peel on the rim of the glass
We were all too stuffed for dessert but I got a cappuccino to sip on while my sister finished her wine and it was tasty though more of a latte since the milk was mixed in rather than floating on top
Who would have thought to take a staple drink of the southwest and combine it with shot of espresso and create something so good
I did give it 3 stars because there are good deals to be found on liquor they have a great selection of glassware they have a tasting bar and they are a one stop party shop for all of your drinks snacks stogies and barware
Kathy and Pat have continue to add events to their calendar that keep people walking into their store forcing their consumer to browse wines based on broad term flavor profiles Sweet Bold Mellow etc
Their beer is decent I prefer Four Peaks and appetizers are munchable
Great food good service and awesome wine list gives Cowboy Ciao five stars
We enjoyed a few happy hour beers for $3 to $5 depending on the beer
So if you're into drinking this may be an amazing stop for you with its huge list of tequila if not you can probably find better food elsewhere with about the same prices
The service was excellent the drinks were a little meh
We didn't have any of their food but the beer selection was nice and the red sangria was AMAZING
The beer selection is wonderful and fitting for the Roosevelt Hoodcompared to many other places in Phoenix
I wish we had gotten there before Happy Hour concluded yesterday because glasses of wine are half off and we enjoyed some vino
Great wine list and delicious speciality cocktails
Stopped in here for some drinks after some shopping and was SUPER impressed with the beer selection at this place
We ordered a slushie type drink in Coconut $3 5 other flavors available too
As a water afficionado not to be confused with water snobs who only drink the expensive bottled stuff I can tell you that I don't know where they get their water from but it is tasty
If you're wondering why I'm so fixated on the water I was additionally very impressed by the fact that the instant my glass became half-empty a busgirl would appear out of nowhere and quickly fill it right back up
I'll come here again and try more pizzas and of course more of their delicious beer
Service Pretty good they come by pretty often to clear dirty plates and offer drink refills
I was texted It was great perfect flavor drink refreshing no room for dinner
All flavors of hummus are great and usually some decent wine choices
I generally drink my espresso straight and at LUX it is obvious that the perfectly toasted nutmeg colored crema that the barristas pull is long lasting and as good as anything you'll find in Italy or Seattle As soon as you walk in the door you can inhale the fresh roased beans and the wonderful smells wafting throughout
We thoroughly enjoyed our drinks and our food and would definitely go back there again
They also have a good Happy Hour menu with a lot of variety and $2 draft beer
Sure it's a bit pricey $30 for two people and a few dollars more for glasses if it's in 3D but it's well worth it when you sit smack dab in the middle of the theater and this huge screen is towering over you forebodingly
Their drinks are good and so it their food
Shockingly delicious def could taste the sake but in a good way also there iced green tea was refreshing
The drinks menu was quite good and some very interesting cocktails
So many other delicious choices - even for people who aren't hardcore tea-drinkers - you'll even find something you love here
With 2 glasses of wine an appetizer and 3 entrees I spent $165 including the tip
The wine list was a bit disappointing with very few worthwhile bottles under $50
There is good wine to be had but be prepared to pay for it
I also had the Ginger Fizz drink and it was pretty tasty
I'm not going to repeat what others before me have so wisely stated but this event was like all the others an evening of delicious food and drink
Our wine tab came to $350 for one ok bottle and one very tasty bottle
Service was very good we were there for happy hour and got two glasses of wine half off - Try Simple Life - Pinot Noir - excellent
He recommended a great wine and was just overly accommodating
I think the only thing they have going for them is the ability to customize your drink flavors if you get a slushie
I was also able to try some local beer as well as some of their soup which was all good
With drinks 3 appetizer 2 Entrees tip - the bill was about $100 and worth it
The wife had some sort of veggie burger that she liked and a glass of wine that she also enjoyed
My wife had a roasted pear salad with red wine glaze and a huge hunk of quality blue cheese and she added a chicken breast and he didn't bat an eye
Good cold beer and beautiful red head has to be a cool place
Some bright spots remain half price drinks and apps during happy hour cool outdoor patio when it's warm and a menu refresh that includes skewers that are really really good
Even though they were busy we felt very appreciated and the food and wine were excellent
and the food and beer selection is good too
I'd give it five but I don't even really LIKE beer meh -- but that's how good this place is it actually made me WANT to get a beer
I don't expect the wine to be of Napa or Sonoma quality but at least make up for it with your service
Amazing prices especially for happy hour house red wine is decent
Being a near perfect Saturday afternoon I ordered a Grand Canyon Amber Ale and my wife order the Sangria which was also damn good it had many pieces of whole citrus in the glass
It is expensive no lie especially if you are drinking a glass of their huge selection of wines and they even have an alcohol cart that comes around with the good stuff
The view was amazing the drinks were wicked expensive albeit tasty the food was fantastical and the ambiance on the patio was pretty darn romantic
Lots of nigiri rolls beer/sake and appetizers to choose from on that menu
The Lost Leaf already had the best beer selection in The Valley but they recently added a small draft selection including the delicious locally brewed Four Peaks Oatmeal Stout
You went on a blind date and it went really well and he smells so good and his smile is so white but you find out he doesn't drink but you don't want to be only one drinking
As mentioned on this page its a good spot to grab and drink and go but not really a place to blow it out all night
very hip- good selection of wines- excellent friendly serviceNot so much- food was good but not as interesting as other wine bars we frequent- too many kids
*Cosmetics/Bathroom = ok selection*Rice = several kinds*Snacks = plenty*Dried stuff = plenty Curry Dried Seaweed etc*Frozen stuff = good amount Natto Udon Ramen Tsukemono etc*Drinks = good selection of Japanese soft drinksThe one complaint I have is that they don't have fresh fruits or vegetables
The food was excellent as always the the drink was even better
I came back 2 weeks later for dinner again and immediately put in a drink and appetizer order
I was almost finished with my appetizer and no cocktail no glass of water yet
Also the tasty morsels they have in the front glass case are a huge hit wherever I bring them
At the ground floor was a lounge area called 'The Living Room' we had a very pricey drink although mine was good others had to send theirs back
The drinks are cheap though and if you start off with a few good ones you can really have a good time
we ordred appetizers and drinks and then our 2 entrees came
we paid for our drinks and appetizers and left but not before yelling out  this place is a fraud
She not only selects the beers and wines served here but she also serves these wonderful libations to her patrons
The location is a bit odd essentially behind Party City in a strip mall but the food and beer is amazing
They give you a good amount of wine for each tasting too
They have a nice selection of appetizers to go with their wine- cheese plate crackers dried fruit etc
The appetizers go great with the wine but won't fill you up
My friend and I ordered $20 worth of food 2 drinks a bag of chips sweet potato fries a provolone & veggie panini and a flatbread
Their prices are CHEAP but are definitely NOT a reflection of the excellent quality of food and drink etc Their produce is always amazingly fresh
Their wine selection is extensive and full of quality wines as well as quirky brands I've never heard of and can find no where else
We weren't too familiar with a lot of the wines they offered so we told him what we preferred and asked him to make a few recommendations
Very impressed with his ability to select wine for my wife and I we proceeded to order a selection of meat and cheeses which we also let him pick out for us
I can't guarantee you too will find yourselves in the rippling biceps of the undead if you drink their Mojitos but it's worth a shot
Knowing the Southern influence of the menu we figured it would be appropriate to have a drink and an appetizer while pouring over the details
They have above-average bar food with slightly above average bar food prices and obviously good beer
The beer battered fries are delicious as well and even their side salad is unusually tasty for you know a simple side salad
Beers are average as far as brewpubs go - considerably better than Oggis a couple miles away but not as good as BJ's or Gordon Biersch in the West Valley
My husband really adored the beer and always requests that I get him 8th Street Ale at the grocery now and I thought the Kiltlifter was pretty good even though I don't love beer
But hey after all it is a brewery and the beer is pretty good
Instead we enjoyed a glass of wine Riesling for me a bowl of gazpacho and shared the snapper ceviche
A long day of dining behind me and dinner yet to go I hope Praying Monk is turning better business on other days of the week-my guess is that it'd be an awesome place to watch some College Football in the coming months particularly given the quality of the food and beer list if you're into that
The wine room is small but good and fairly well stocked with a good variety of wines though a measly wine by the glass selection for a fairly impressive cellar
Though not the best wine i've had we got a very good bottle for 15 bucks that was enjoyable
Live music real dart board good drinks and good people
Get a group of friends the like to drink and have a good time and sign up
And if that does not happen at least I will have a good beer to drink
The sandwich and the beer were absolutely delicious
I had a glass of pinot which was pretty good for a house wine
The patio is a nice place to hang out and the beer is good not phenomenal but good
So far after two trips there I would say it's an average  place to get something predictably good and a beer to go with it
The beers are good you'll never get bored drinking the same beer over and over again
Not only did they have a good beer selection but the bar keep ZackI think that was his name I had several pints is a beer sommelier one of about 3 I've ever encountered here in the Valley
Bar was very comfortable proper glass ware was used to serve the beer and @ $5-6 for good IPA a great value for such an atmosphere
The gentleman working there I apologize that I didn't catch his name didn't waste time having me try on pair after pair of glasses - he asked what I was looking for and then listened to my response found a couple of options and I was on my way very happy and looking good
This is becoming a trusted standy by when we want a tasty mealto be  taken care of by great people served solid drinks and enjoy a great atmosphere
Thank you Sens for so many great years amazing food and kick ass Sake
An hour later we had a large group of 6+ we were seated on the patio next to the fireplace and we had a blast munching on the meat and cheese board another bruschetta board - the apple+fig jam+brie is amazing and more wine
It's a good spot to sit and drink and watch the sun go down
When the entrees came out my guests were duly impressed by the quality of the cuisine and quickly forgot the ditz waitress albeit an empty drink or two
In summation the food is excellent and the martinis are even better
the other beer i had was recommended by the barkeep/server Heather odell red ale
I can't help but compare this place to my favorite tapas place in the valley Sol y Sombra in the DC Ranch where they have a huge selection of fantastic wine and a full bar and a huge selection of delicious and much larger portioned tapas for the same price
The beer selection was good and the service was okay
There were five of us we each got an appetizer and each had two or more beers apiece and our tab was $50
So friends- an hour for our food from time of order food that wouldn't even be good if we waited only 5 mins for it and sucky wine choices
We also had a wonderful tour of Italy via the wine that was paired with things
Staff is kind the drinks are pricey but delicious and they have the prettiest walking paths around
Plenty to eat and drink; no need to waste your time on appetizers or desserts
What this place does have good drink selection OK prices and big bathrooms good security and a descent stage
Crepes of every possible species good drinks and a casual atmosphere
the Sets is only good for 3 stars but i'm bumping it to four because they have a pretty cool outside patio  bar area that i can smoke with a drink and it's enclosed so i don't feel like i'm sitting in the parking lot
My friend had the Turning Japanese which I tried as a shot the first time I went and either it was made really sweet or it tastes super sweet after the Mango Sake and she thought it was delicious - so delicious she had 3
5liter beers is another good starting point I got a tasty hefeweizen myself
50 for a half liter of good German beer is pretty good though
The drinks are good wait staff are nice and food ok when you get there early enough
This location is pretty good however the waitresses are slow to refill drinks
We ordered a bottle of delicious wine and thoroughly enjoyed the strawberry hemp-milk ice cream
The food and drink was better then expected Our server Kendra did a wonderful job and made sure we had enough to drink and eat and made sure we enjoyed ourselves
Ten Pack Bavarian Pretzels Looked good and tasty with a pint of beer to help wash it down
This place seems like a good place to watch a game or have a pint as well with plenty of good beer on tap
I'm not a big roll guy but we tried a few rolls and they were all pretty good big beers were $4 during happy hour so a huge meal for two with drinks was only $70 total which is great considering a similar meal in SF would put you over $100 without a problem
I had the Wine burger and it was cooked properly and had great flavor
The main draws being cheap $1 frozen daquiri drinks on Wednesdays oh 190 Octane how I LOVE your orange goodness
Nothing too special about the place - the wine list is OK and the bruchetta is really good but besides that
All in all for $30/person including a free glass of wine during restaurant week a pretty good deal
The prices are pretty good and unlike BevMo you don't have a club you need to join to get Total Wine's lowest price
Postino's has the best deals with consistent and high quality delicious food and wine
Hannibal Lecter while drinking drugged broth before Lecter fed him bites of his own brain It's not very good Buddy
The beer list was amazing and props for using correct glassware for each beer
The guacamole was terrific and we all enjoyed our drinks I had the white sangria which was pretty good
The drink specials on happy hour are pretty non-existent as well so for me the food better be damn good if I'm going to go there
I was impressed by the friendly staff and the other food options including bottles of wine and yes delicious sugary looking pastries  Hey I didn't say I was against the sweets did I
Not only do they have other tasty food they also have some pretty darn good drinks
Great selection of hand crafted beers traditional pub fare and overall there's a good vibe from staff and the building itself
To top it off the red wine gravy was amazing
Anyhoo the burrito was big & delicious and with a beer was only $9
Is it a get your drink on and flirt your a$$ off because you look damn good tonight or is it a fine dining establishment
The drinks are stiff damn expensive and well worth it
Our intentions were to have one drink and then go back to our hotel to get a good night's sleep but the atmosphere held us in and we couldn't leave
it was amazing that might be my new drink
The bar manager Jeff is warm and hospitable and mixed up some pretty amazing martinis
They have a wonderful variety of micro brews and an extensive wine selection
I've been here over 10+ times the last few months with girlfriends for Happy Hour or with my boyfriend on a weekend evening and I have always had outstanding service amazing food and awesome drinks that knock my socks off
Our waitress Helene was on point all night keeping our glasses bread basket tasty crisp-crusted jalapeno cheddar bread and brown bread and butter plate full and the food rolling at the perfect pace including asking us if we needed a breather before dessert we did
I still love you Brio and I suppose I can't really complain too much since $30 including tip got me a round of drinks and four appetizers
Plenty of varieties of beer to chose from mainly your British and Irish varieties but a few local microbrews thrown in for good measure
The coffee drinks are good but with all the good coffee shops in Tempe I'd never pass up an opportunity to get a boba tea here
For the drinks that require milk they use either soy or almond milk I don't remember which so even non-dairy folks can enjoy the whole range of flavors
* Coffees and coffee drinks are very good
It took me a long time to decide on the perfect restaurant for us all to get together for some wonderful food and drinks
My drinks were verrrrrry weak my food was not flavorful or even displayed in an appetizing manner
I highly recommend you pair any meal with a glass of wine but if you are going to enjoy a full evening and truly embrace the ambiance settle in with a bottle
The drinks were good and cheapish and the bartender was really friendly- always adds a star in my book
We got the Elderflower Paloma cocktail and the Ginger Cilantro drink both delicious and not overpowering
Food wise we split appetizers which was perfect for a night of drinking
My BF and I just happened to come here for dinner during restaurant week so I was happy to see the $30 prix fix menu for appetizer main meal dessert and sangria or soft drink
We went on a fairly quiet Saturday evening and were greeted with good service enjoyed good drinks had a good salad and made our way through good entrees
ok I broke my no fried food in the sake of Yelp and the fries where really good
In LA a $16 is a drink with a lousy $1 tip so it seems really good to me
That said the beer was good but not so good as to override the lack of ambience and the average service
And I've heard good things about a drink fittingly called Retail Therapy that I'll try the next time I find myself at Fashion square and feeling the need to drink my I-really-shouldn't-have bought-that-but-oh-well woes away
What I was impressed with was that 1 the Manager/Owner/Proprietor came to the table to ask about the food and the service and 2 the waitress offered me another juice and then offered to give it to me in a glass to go no additional charge
My friend and I were seated right away and since I had been drinking wine earlier in the night all I wanted was water and some delicious food
The service was decent and the place has pretty good drinks so I may stop in again to give something off of their menu another try
That along with 2 glasses of port and we were good to go
We then ordered drinks Javier had a margarita on the rocks he loved it and was the perfect flavor and perfect amount of alcohol
I only had one beer here but it was the winter seasonal which they were selling quite a bit of and it wasn't very good
I imagine how much more these tasty beers would be if they were weren't warm
Drinks here are weak and probably not worth it
Good  varied beer selection all bottle though and they usually have good musical guests
Not a good selection of wine by the glass
I paid 17 bucks for sandwich a side and two drinks for that price it's should be good and have great service I was blown away bye how basically mean the people were and the sandwiches were totally regular nothing special I watched the guys basically throw my sandwich together with distain he even had to make it
Overall a good experience in the 30-45 minutes we were there for a drink & a shot at the bar
But with good Beer and eats  and no worry about failing  pop quizzes can  be enjoyable
2 We had a table because we were celebrating a birthday so free drinks + table equates to a pretty good time for me3 When I did go to the bar for two vodka Sprites they were $5 each
I am belong to those who are really picky about the glasses and I used to spend weeks to look for one that I really like and my wife does too - Anyway I cannot have much to say about this but just GREAT store great service great glasses great people price hummm a bit expensive but i think that it well worth it for the new fit and good look of your face
Maybe for drinks and an appetizer before dinner someplace else
Service- outstanding very helpful and friendly- 4starsDrinks- big cool bottles- 4 starsCollard Greens - spicy tasty make your momma proud and eat some- 5 starsMac N cheese - not that great I mean it's better than the out of the box stuff but after reading the reviews I expected more of the gourmet style
I drink a lot of slim-priced booze & was still not impressed
Excellent selection of beer wine and booze
A large wine selection that is varied in quality price and regions
You just found a bottle of wine with a cool name like Irony and you want to know if it's good
I would skip Latin America Mexican tastings- and go for the Good Spanish Wines
We got the beer battered green beans as an appetizer and it was delicious
Ko'sin is less expensive but serves great good and drinks
Their Groupon specials are well worth it $5 for a movie and a drink
The music was a really good mix from Portishead to Amy Winehouse
Perhaps they didn't notice that there was a lovely museum with air conditioned halls and excellent exhibitions that one could retreat to when slightly flushed from all that sun read wine
The Roan red was a wonderful BBQ wine and great for the early spring heat we were experiencing
The shrimp cocktail has 3 of the biggest most delicious shrimp you could ever find and go great with any of their signature martinis
Typically this kind of place is to polished and Scottsdale to even be worth a review but the menu and beer make it a bit different
Instead head a block over to The Roosevelt for some good beer on tap and some pretty good food
They have a good selection of small plates and drinks at discounted prices
We flew in late on a Monday evening and decided to swing by Yard House for some drinks and appetizers
This is the place to come for specialty items or take home hot meals cold salads and some amazing desserts beers and wines
About the only thing good to come out of the event was that their beers were decent and you get to see the grounds of the Carefree Resort
They also have specialty drinks that weren't really worth the cost
The downside is the long wait but it's really not that bad considering you can go next door to the bar get some wine and appetizers and picnic on the lawn or sit on the benches
I love beer and I especially love good beer and this establishment is on in a long string of places opening up across the valley that pretends to deal in that
Wound-be hipsters looking to enjoy a good beer and praise an interesting venue would do well to go there instead
The Filmbar across the street from Angel's Trumpet has some good beers and ambiance and feels a lot less like a college bar where the inexperienced serve the inexperienced in droves
The Roosevelt not far away though often packed has great ambiance it's an old brick house in a historic neighborhood some good beers though fewer taps and significantly more accomplished servers
They do a disservice to good beer by pretentiously rudely and amateurishly serving mostly mediocre brews
They have a VERY GOOD beer selection but they are all bottled/canned
I was extremely pleased with the price and flavor of the drinks
I have to say service was excellent never once did we have to ask for our drinks to be refilled and they were very attentive to our needs
I can't believe I've waited so long to review the Roosevelt as it is everything I look for in a bar amazing beers and a significant wine list  great food  friendly staff and a crowded yet comfortable vibe
As far as I could tell everyone at the wine dinner had an amazing time and enjoyed the food immensely
As always Tomaso came through with an amazing Winemaker Dinner that was so much fun
They are very attentive on filling up your water glass and making sure you enjoyed everything
I enjoy good wine but when you go to the Mellow Mushroom it is the beers that have top reign here
The Sonoran Root Beer is crafted locally and made from Sonoran Desert honey plus it is mighty delicious
Seriously - can't go wrong with half priced appetizers and beers
Neither my guest or I were blown away by the favors of the food but the drink menu and atmosphere were wonderful
Drinks were excellent  lots of variety and only 5$ for their specialty drinks
I know all it takes is the illusion that booze can be had for me to veer left into a parking lot and saunter up to the bar primal beer good sense a-tingling
Walked in sat down on comfy couches got a great first round of drinks from a friendly barkeep and kicked back to enjoy the eye candy good lookin clientele on Saturday night at 1am
Sidebar has a great drink menu--Belgian beers galore decent wine selection and amazing signature drinks
I have seriously not been this impressed with everything from service to food to drinks in who knows how long
They seated us quickly at a nice table and our waitress was there quickly to ask about drinks and appetizer
Service was good friendly and i want to come back and order something with a beer
They get major points for delicious food with limited kitchen capabilities for a really cool vibe and for the best beer and drink list that I know of in all of Phoenix
Good price on beers but thats all I can say
They have very good beers I especially enjoyed the Blonde Summer Honey which is seasonal
I gave this place one extra star because there beers here are very good
All night we enjoyed terrific craft beer mixed cocktails and various types of wine
The Bartender was friendly and she had pretty good knowledge of the beers they had on tap
A pale beer with great flavor and nice finish
The sample was very sweet with a honey flavor and was excellent - I don't know if they ran out but when I ordered a glass I received a more hoppy variety
All in all an excellent afternoon with a rare limited release craft beer some free pizza and tasty mead
The staff is always on par & occasionally serve up some free drinks or appetizers which are all so tasty
If you're looking to be seen at a hot spot then please stop by and order yourself a fancy drink and make sure it glows and bubbles   Service was excellent - water was full and beer was flowing
I love their drink selection lots of tasty and fresh combinations as well as local beer selection yah
2 The beer selection is incredible full of tasty imports and domestics both on tap and in bottles
I love Postino for providing a great place to be with friends wine and great food at an excellent price on a Monday or Tuesday night
Our thoughts - so you took an extra forty minutes to seat us - when we had a reservation and now you want us to leave your table and you couldn't come up with a more tactful method of asking us to leave note - it was 930/945 at this time we had been at the table for about two hours had a full meal drinks appetizers entrees dessert second drinks - which equates to a full check and a hefty tip
But we have concluded 1 Rokerij does offer good food - but they are slightly over priced for the quality 2 the professionalism was seriously lacking in service presentation of the wine list focused on the price and not the taste pallets and 3 they should get their ego in check - I get that you have a long list of people waiting for tables at your restaurant - but the next time I have a special event I will be going to one of the dozens of restaurants in the valley and receive the level of service that should come with the ambiance and food
We had a variety of excellent cheeses always a great way to flatter excellent wines
I had the ceasar salad and the filet Mignon which was glazed with a delicate wine port sauce - so good that I ate every bite
Say Nah Like the famous sunglasses kid Let's go to Mi Patio and have some fantastic food amazing service and keep drinking to boot
Four Peaks is an excellent establishment because they have wonderful food a very robust beer selection brewed on site and incredible atmosphere
The wine was good and the apple-tini was super great
By the way the price was very reasonable before the tip we paid about $35 for our half of the appetizer 2 meals a soda 2 beers 2 side dished and dessert
The beers and most of the wines are very reasonably-priced so ask your server about what they recommend when pairing your order to your alcohol
This place is the full package the location decor and menu are perfect for an evening of relaxation good drinks and great food
shady's is a good place to drink an afternoon away
The bill for all seven including the tips 7 margaritas 7 soft drinks seven entres and an appetizer came to less than $200 so I guess that's good right
I just took a sip of my Wallaby Darned drink frozen daiquiri peach flavored and it was only 4 bucks
Above all else the beer is very good here
The food was excellent the server was polite and attentive and two different workers were constantly refilling drinks
The staff really knows their stuff and consistently offers very good advice on wines that fit my palate
The wine is always good as they have an incredible selection and the prices seem reasonable esp because there always seems to be a coup
Happy hour at ZuZu's was great - delicious appetizers and good drinks
On the plus side the Natural Refreshment drinks are delicious
The wine tour we were served was excellent and each was paired with a portion of the meal with perfection
Variety of toppings salads appetizers calzones and drinks
If you need a quick overnight stay to catch an early flight i would recommend staying at this place since it has a fully stocked bar and drink all you want before your flight
They have a good selection of beer and a full bar
I ordered a beer and my lovely wife had ice tea while we munched on chips that had good flavor
Very unique stuff which makes very tasty drinks
But - at the same time I think I'd rather go to Trader Joes and grab a bottle of wine if I can - small selection but they have the kind I like there and I don't have to walk the immense aisles of Total Wine but they're amazing - don't think I don't like TW I'm a huge fan
Music people atmosphere food drinks desserts baked goods
50 for a cocktail and an appetizer drink
Everything is clean organic natural and nicely portion and the variety of drinks that are good for you taste wonderful and they are not alcoholic
Liberty Market also has an espresso bar with some excellent and unique drink options
All in all if you are looking for a spot to hang out with a couple drinks maybe enjoy some live music and do some people watching; I would definitely recommend Brackin's
One of the staff there gave us a great recommendation for post-dinner drinks at Four Peaks Brewery another quality recommend
The bartenders at Maestro's are amazing and every drink they serve comes in a 16-oz cocktail shaker so you're basically buying two drinks
The beer selection is pretty good and the service is usually very good as well
The wine list is always interesting giving you choices that surprise and please the food is well priced and the brew-shetta Geordie accent please is ridiculously good
I should give this 4 stars as the service can be hit and miss but I gave it 5 for those great nights with friends when the music is loud but not too loud the wine is flowing and a good time is being had by all
We demolished those and enjoyed our beers until our pizza arrived
Oh to be fair my wife who drinks wine thought the corking fee and bring your own bottle was a good idea because it is cheaper than the vastly overpriced in general  restaurant wine prices
The Happy Hour here is fantastic - half priced karaoke rooms maki appetizers sake and house specialty drinks from 4 - 7pm every day
The beer selection is wide and the prices are very good
The good things to expect is good food at decent prices that is fairly consistent regardless of location good happy hour depending on when you go and great cold beer
The meal paired well with the wine the Sommelier recommended and the sides were great
With three entrees an appetizer and five girly drinks we got out of there for under $100 with a generous tip
The sides were quite good and the drinks were well done
A special mention that the cocktails were very good I had a couple of martinis that were phenomenal
The wine list was simple and straight forward the selections good
As far as drinks go the overpriced Mojito Vanilla was also good
What I impressed her with was a flighty vapid and giggly waitress folks all around us falling off their stools after 10 too many sake bombs mediocre fish and Nickelback grinding our eardrums to little stubby nubs
The moral of this relatively useless review is  The Roosevelt beer selection = good
we only had a couple of glasses of wine taking advantage of their excellent happy hour
Service excellent friendly attentive- the server was energetic answered all of our questions refilled our drinks and the saucesFood my tastebuds couldn't stop thanking me for coming here- the different sauces were AMAZING humus was good salad had a little too much olive oil but still refreshing the rice was so super I asked for more- we ordered the meal for two and it was more than the two of us could handle and I can EAT- the mixed plate had everything and we loved it all
had Drinks and apps and everything was very good
Service was good as well they do ask you before they seat you if you will be drinking and they give you a wristband to wear
The beer selection was good - any restaurant that carries Red Stripe wins my love but they were out of it today so I went with Pacifico
There really isn't a better time to go to Sapporo than RIGHT NOW to enjoy their every day summer happy hour for cheap good quality food & drinks
There are great discounts on beer wine and cocktails including the awesome mango martini and several very popular appetizers rolls and sushi
If you want to watch a great movie have some great beer on tap and a good time TT Roadhouse is great
The first time we went we did the whole appetizers meal dessert wine
For three glasses of wine a flatbread pizza which I didn't try but it looked delicious and my three cheese fondue our bill was around $45
The ambience the food the wine and the outdoor patio were all amazing
I would also recommend checking out the basement bar just to have a drink
Lover's Prawns -- half the prawns are in wine sauce and the other half are in spicy chili garlic sauce; very balancedPillow Chicken -- along the lines of deep-fried chicken croquettes with savory Black Pepper SauceSichuan Style String Beans with pork -- a fantastically spicy dishThe lunch menu includes a number of their most popular dishes including Orange Chicken of course that are very tasty and wallet-friendly as they include a cup of the daily soup and an egg roll
The jamaica was very concentrated so if you like a lot of tangy hibiscus flavor this is the drink for you
Drink-wise I highly recommend the organic green tea served hot
Once we got inside we immediately ordered more drinks and an appetizer
Either way if you want to chill with some good food and drink and watch some sports check this place out
And by great I mean a good stiff drink that's not so strong that you can't taste anything else in it
None the less as the evening progressed the wine warmed up and the flavors came out
Enjoy good conversation good food and good wine
SAM was excellent - he talked with us and explained the items we had questions on cleaned the table in between courses and gave us fresh silver ware - along with always keeping our drinks full
However they have a pretty dope patio because more and more its about the smoking than the drinking *sigh* on point servers modestly priced beer and good tellies
I really enjoyed the Chihuly Glass artwork that was displayed a few years back
I think our bill came to $30 for a glass of wine a specialty drink and the two appetizers
The drinks were good and our waitress was friendly
The decor is fun but not over the top- and the drinks were dangerously delicious
You do have to pay for a drink but it is well-worth it
Here's my idea of a wonderful Olive & Ivy dinner- a drink on the patio along the canal then sit at a booth inside and enjoy truffle fries with the aioli dip PLUS the house focaccia bread with pesto to start
Then Open Source Project OSP is the best alternative with a good vibe great drinks and can help you get work done while having fun
I have ate in there too and felt the service was very good also when waiting on a pick up order I was given a drink while I waited as it was a couple minutes for my order to be completed a bonus is the cute waitresses too
I would recommend stopping in Total wine they had a slow start with me but have since gained momentum and have taken my favorite liquor store award away from Bevmo
Great ambiance and good beers on draft  that are reasonably price which has made me want to like this place
So the ambiance and beers make this place good
If you feel like adding a little drinky to your meal they do have a good selection of wines and liquors
And if you're looking for a place to drink that isn't Mill or Old Town Scottsdale TMP can definitely hold its own with a couple great places to grab a cold one with sometimes ridiculously good specials
The guy told us that separately the 2 meals and 2 drinks would be $27 so the 2 for 20 deal was totally worth it
I've only visited the locale in Tempe and enjoyed their beer and pretzels but this time around a date and I decided to make a stop in and try the 'food food'
I had a few glasses of local wine by the glass at happy hour prices and enjoyed it
The food and drinks are pretty cheap but they're skimping on quality
We each started with a glass of wine - which by the way they have an excellent selection to choose from
A good happy hour bar sure though I never seem to make it anywhere near the universal discounted-beer-cut-off-time so it always seems like when I go here I'm in the happy hour mood at 10 o'clock PM
Rosie's has a good selection of Irish spirits and beers though for some reason i can't get any more creative than a Half-n-half here
We sat at the bar and ordered a glass of wine and the clam cake appetizer
We walked out with $70 worth of grocery items and a Jacuzzi Primitivo wine don't scoff at the Jacuzzi name its an old name and a terrific vineyard - we originally tried their wine from igourmet
They have an amazing happy hour with numerous wines beers and cocktail specials and sushi and appetizers that range between $4-$8
The B 4 drinks were good  and near the hi end of pricingbut hey its Scottsdale
This is a good beer with a subtle cherry flavor
Start your meal off with an app of Pulled Pork BBQ Nachos and some tasty Arizona beer and/or ails
The food is simply amazing as is their outstanding wine list and best views in the valley
All in all I think the food here is decent but thought the wine prices were good
They do have good beer prices for happy hour
The drinks were good and sushi as good if not better
We were looking at wines and the waitress recommended one which was fantastic
Who doesn't love a good glass of wine on a warm spring day while watching the sun set
We sat outside enjoyed some great drinks - and my husband just adored their Scotch selection
But back to positives the drinks are good the crowd is usually pretty entertaining and the prices aren't that bad
My husband is super picky about beers and really likes SunUp so I guess they're good
I really hate to do this downgrade but I have to for the sake of all those that love good beer and some sort of decent service
Sure they have a phenomenal selection of beer but that doesn't do me a bit of good if no one will take my order
I went the other night just for some appetizers and drinks and though the food was decent fried zucchini and mushrooms the parking lot service music and crowd sucked
From a happy hour beer and appetizer there today it's hard to say whether they made good on that
Starbucks is amazing for kids as my dzughter oly drinks warm milk and so anywhere i see a starbucks i can ge a kids milk
I'm a big IPA drinker and was very impressed that the bartender could make legitimate recommendations based on what I had said I liked
Decorated with fancy wall papers flowers on each table and a nice collection of candles the Roosevelt would serve as an excellent place for a casual first date but works just as well for a fun night of beer sampling and cheese-eating snobbery
My favorite drink here is the Matador but they are all good
Though you can get some alcoholic drinks is it really worth it with places like Merc Bar downstairs from the theater
I wasn't thrilled with any of their HH drink specials so I just ordered one of their specialty martini's with Prosseco and some other yummy goodness
I'd give 4 stars for the drinks alone they also had $5 sangrias that were delicious not too sweet and you could tell they used a decent wine
The pharmacy never seems to have a long line the wine section is fairly good for a supermarket and the meat department is the best in its town
The drinks are on the cheap side and good Guinness comes in 20 OZ pints are are cheaper than other places around
With that said the drinks are still pretty darn good
The food is good and the drinks are even better
Well if you're going to reference AZ88 they you better have great drinks and at least good bar food
Instead of the rich buttery lemon/wine based sauce theirs was GREEN it had been reheated to the extent that the sauce had separated and had a granulated appearance the chicken had no flavor and was difficult to cut with a steak knife
Food was delicious and drinks mojitos + maritinis  were great
Great music great drinks great dancing without any of the cheap alcohol sweat and lecherousness that generally ruins a perfectly good night out with the girls
The pitcher of sangria was delicious when it finally arrived another ten minutes- the cup had raspberries and a strawberry in it with orange juice and white wine
The whole cooking with wine concept may seem like a good idea and it does make for a slightly interesting flavor but I wouldn't call it good
Aside from the wine flavor the meat wasn't very good anyway just like the other fixins and the fries
Our bill is usually about $40 and that includes 5-6 rolls a small appetizer and DRINKS
probably the most delicious and satisfying thing we ordered last night--swamped in a sweet creamy sauce they complimented the Plum Wine well
A comprehensive wine list that might be weighted a little too much on the high end on the French side but plenty of good California choices in the affordable range
I have only been here twice but both times the service was friendly and the drink time was good
No draft beer but I did try the Brazilian black beer and it was tasty
Had a nice glass of pinot noir that was too cold when it arrived at the table but after it warmed up and got some air was really flavorful
We both had martinis and they don't have top shelf alcohol but they were quite tasty and really well done
It's a shame the service was so horrible since the beer was delicious
I would imagine it would be a cool place to visit if you were going just for the beer and maybe an appetizer
Though I have not sampled the food I can definitely recommend the martinis
The wine was not good tasted like it had gotten too hot - which I imagine is a common affliction for AZ wine drinkers
Had I known what it'd be like I would've much rather gone to Chipotle where it would be half the price delicious/flavorful & much more friendlynot to mention they have the same beer
My summary A BAD HOT DOG STAND OVERLY EXPENSIVE WITH SOME GOOD BEERS ON TAP
The fries were very good in the beer batter and the appetizers decent as well
Again this can be said to be a good thing as well seeing at the sandwich is 7 bucks not including drink or chips
Some of the happy hour specials are $1 off draft beers half priced appetizers and extended lunch menu definitely makes this time of day a better value
I was planning on going for a drink and a couple of small appetizers and ended up eating a full meal I am powerless against the rainbow roll especially after a few drinks of saki
Mix of young and old reasonably good list of wines by the glass the food is pretty good as well
Walk to Total Wine and buy a bottle of good beer
All in all I don't mind coming here every so often but only when I can figure out a good way to game their system because otherwise it is a VERY expensive way to play arcade games and drink/eat
Anyway the Blonde was not bad actually surprising me that the bitter notes of the beer were somewhat restrained which I enjoyed
I went here on a Friday night and it's a great place to grab a drink and some excellent appetizers
As my buddy and I sat and enjoyed our beverages a woman came in to pick up an order she had previously placed consisting of six drinks
When I explained that I never drink tea they made me something fruity and delicious that has made me determined to go back and be a little more daring
happy hour is very good with cheap drink prices and reduced price appetizers
Oh and they have good Happy Hour deals on drinks and appetizers from 3-6 every day of the week
This is actually just part of mochi but it's really good and I love the chewiness
The Sunbru is the lightest of the bunch for those seeking a higher quality light beer
Service was good and able to get drinks from next door as well
I have eaten at Pepin 3-4 times and the food is decent the wine is good and it is fun to watch the dancing
My husband and I took our drinks wonderful wine
The happy hour drinks are a good price 3 dollars for wells and 2
Sunday afternoon and a packed patio is always a good sign of  great food or cheap drinks
We had a little time as we enjoyed our wine and appetizers and sort of surveyed the room
I think it was a good find but not sure if it will be my regular due to the fact that I'm not really a huge wine fan
For just a few more dollars I could get a delicious cooked burger from Four Peaks with beer-battered fries
Something about condensed sweetened milk makes any drink  tastes good
In addition drink stands such as the Cappuccino Cafe offer delicious and refreshing coffee drinks and Italian sodas with many sugar free syrups to choose from
We waited for about 15 minutes before anyone asked us about drinks and then we didn't know who to grab to ask about appetizers
GradesOVERALL    B- Service   B-    Service was attentive but slowness in picking up the                         check is not a plus Food     B- Burger was good but too large and fries were forgettableDrinks  B It's good but not something I'd write  home about just in case you're wondering - I give A's only if it's superior
I gave Gordon Biersch 3 stars for their location and quality of brewed beer
from the balcony and some very good brewed beer
After the ceremony we hung out in the cantina area sipping drinks and eating appetizers whilst the pictures were being taken Unfortunately it was record cold down there so we were all anxious to get inside and eat despite the good number of propane heaters that were set up and running
The bread wine caprese salad and tortellini were all pretty good
We had drinks appetizers sushi and then teppanyaki
For drinks start off with some good craft beer or have some of their cocktails which they have several mixes that are awesome
I keep coming back because not only is the beer consistently good but so is the food and the service
Pretty much only go if you have to have some sodium after a  heavy night of drinking heavily or in dire need of some good ole hip widening comfort food
We lucked into their Monday/Tuesday night special $20 for a bottle of wine and a bruschetta platter after 8pm - an epic deal if you ask me and all four bruschetta were delicious
I highly recommend this as place to come hang out eat on the patio and have a great meal some margaritas and maybe a few beers
Our server also recommended a really good dessert wine to go with the tarte and it was fantastic
It's just a great place to drink a good beer
The Bar is lined with a great selection of Beer and I very much so enjoyed my wine
Good selection of craft beer bottles with a handful on draft
On my last visit I was even told the story of how the drink the Eleanor had come to be and it was definitely worth putting on the menu We have never gotten anything but outstanding service and whenever friends and family come to town RigaTony's is always my recommendation
With talk of delicious beers aside the food here can hold its own in the Flavor Arena
Pours on the drinks were generous and no one balked when I asked to modify my dinner selection - in fact Paul stopped by to confirm and just set expectations about how he would prepare my meal - a Hawaiian butter fish - which was excellent and the best part of my meal
They offer high quality heat and eat or ready to eat entree's sides and deserts as well as wine and other beverages
this being the first time i consumed their food without multiple pitchers of draft beer i'm pretty impressed
I drank water but my dad went for the Elderberry Specialty Cocktail and really enjoyed it and my mom had a couple of drinks too
The drink menu is good and if you do not find what you like there you are more then welcome to get a drink at the bar next door and bring it over
The bar is now something worth hanging out at the views of the tvs from the tables are worth seeing a game from and the drink specials are pretty solid
All told a good place to grab a drink and catch a game
drinks at the pool are mixed well and worth the $10
So if your ever in need for a very good treat find a sweet republic and Eat Drink and enjoy the sweets my friends
and along with the extensive selection of wines they also have some more unique beers such as lambic as well as a nice selection of non alcoholic sodas The cream soda is locally made and very tasty
The food was outstanding service excellent and the decore was creativedown to the flower pot wine bucket and old wooden crate that it sat on
Of course tons of southwest chicken rolls and hummus were served along with the delicious beers they are so well-known for
I just wanted to add my personal wonderful food and drink experience
$31 for 2 beers an appetizer and an entree is very reasonable in my book especially considering the quality
Excellent food good wine awesome atmosphere
I would definitely recommend Sunshine Moon as a place to go for drinks & apps or dinner
A friend and I were looking for a place that boasted delicious food and drinks for brunch last Sunday and we decided to try out NCounter
I wasn't even gambling and didn't have any drinks so my review is purely based on my love of good food
Now you get a discounted appetizer with those beers may I suggest the jalapeno boats with a sweet dipping sauce so yum
Overall delicious food friendly service tasty drinks trendy atmosphere
Our waiter was very knowledgeable and made great recommendations on wine
Moments later with drinks in hand we had appetizers on the way we chose the sausage of the day and the famous chopped salad then later added the crab cakes and the bacon fat popcorn
The drinks were described as another one of these would kick my butt but it's really good Sazerac delightfully refreshing Moe-scow Mule and very good Berried Alive
After a delightful evening made that much better by the company of our dear friends delicious food and drink and warm professional service we left sated
And they have a good selection of bottled beers including a local organic brew
The staff was really helpful too and gave us great drink recommendations
Drinks a little expensive but still for a first time going there I was really impressed
The wait for the food wasn't bad either but I hate when you as the customer have to ask for a wine list because your wine was empty for 10 minutes but the waiter didn't ask if you wanted anything else because he was focused on the table of 5 women next to us sharing an appetizer
My friend tasted it and ordered that as her second drink since it was so good
We enjoyed the Wine & Bruschetta Special where you have the choice of a bottle of house wine and four selections of bruschetta all for $20 after 8pm
This is a great place to go for some drinks with friends or to indulge in their wonderful food
BeersSmoked Porter - interestingIrish Red ale - tastyImperial IPA - yummyAmerican Brown ale - goodThey only have one Appetizer which is the pizza sticks
Cocktail and applesauce-minus the applesauce- I have had many on the specialty drink menu and all are good nothing spectacular n=but decent although kinda on the pricy side
A Butter Burger cheese curds and a root beer and I'm good
My wife ordered the Grass Jelly drink and it was also good
They have a good wine selection  a little on the pricey side
Not being a coffee drinker I can only say that the hot chocolate was very good
Oh I am big on quality glasses and they actually serve really nice uniquely shaped crystal stemware - bonus points there - I mean that's where the the 5th star comes in
Last night just before going to the screening of Knight & Day  everything arrived within minutes of ordering from the appetizers to meals to entru00e9e-to-go and every drink
They have fantastic happy hour deals on food and drinks--  hard to believe how they keep those prices on such good food
Speaking of me drinking I continued to do so with some of the excellent wine they offer
They have daily drink specials half price appetizers and a nice little lake to sit next to
Beer was super good was bummed the porter was out
A couple sake bombers and you'll be good to go
I purchased two drinks worth $10 each and i gave 3 dollar tip
The filet was great but not nearly as good as enjoying a cigar and some drinks on the patio prior to and after dinner inside
We jetted down to Boulders for wings good beer Arrogant Bastard and pool
We started our evening with a bottle of red wine Dina's recommendation of a Cabernet-Sangiovese blend that was perfect - smooth and tasty - and perfectly paired with our food choices
The Good - One of the best happy hours in town for beer lovers
though I hear it's cramped some of the crews sunday night hijinx I appreciate it - A small broad based selection of excellent beers
After this it took another good 15 minutes just to order dinner and I figured I better get a drink in while I had the chance
He was impressed with the curried duck dish he ordered and that they had his favorite imported beer
The only positive thing I have to say is that I enjoyed drinking a Coke out of a cold glass bottle
Just one SMALL step up from a glass of water in flavor
I mean the food is good try the Rasher burger and fish and chips the drinks are cool 3 dollar Carlsbergs but something is seriously missing
The draft beer was reasonably priced another good thing
Ok the beer specials during the games was a great deal with $3 anything beers pretty cute waitstaff  I wish I remembered my waitresses name but she was very sweet and looked like she was 16 but very nice and quick with drinks especially since we had like 20 people in my group I love places where waitresses can keep up with a ton of tabs and not complainOverall very good I only had scalloped potatoes since I was not feeling well but everyone said the food was good
I also enjoyed the Watermelon Lemonade as a nice refreshing drink on the very hot day
Just order this smorgasbord of delicious yeasty-ness and drink your dinner
Not to mention it was happy hour so appetizers were only $4 and drinks were $3
Although they have a respectable wine list the selections available by the glass are quite limited and not of the quality I would have liked with my meal
On a Tuesday night I was surprised by the number of people sitting outside having a few beers seems like a good spot to hang out if that's what you're looking for
I'm managing to keep from getting pissy and enjoyed my drink
The marinade in red wine gives the beef an edge up in flavor
The beer selection was limited and there was not a good Mexican beer selection
i had some frou-frou drink called the sophie loren which consists of strawberry puree vodka and mint and it was delicious
I ordered a glass of sparkling wine which was very light and delicious
It's dark it's dank it's small and it's filled with amazing people who appreciate a good drink good music and good times
This is a great location though you'll have to pay to park before 6p and a nice atmosphere to enjoy a glass of wine delicious food and conversation
While most of their drinks are pretty good and tropical tasting the Mai Tai is the best in town now that Trader Vic's is donzo
2 appetizers with beer and 2 full entree's for about 30 bucks out the door
They also have delicious mac'n'cheese pizza and WINE
Good selection of drinks and the DJ was playing some righteous chill tunes
The whole meal with fries and a drink was about $9 which is good for a quality meal
This is a great little sandwich shop which serves fresh bread quality meats fat sliced french fries and the best frozen drink out there
Good food and drinks there service is pretty good too with some friendly waitresses
I would recommend this pool room as a person who plays pool very often wants a bite to eat or drink
I'd go for the wine and probably stick to just the wine next time they have a good selection and lots of custom and interesting flavors like peach berry and Summer Rain for the girl that just turned 21
The drink is still tasty so I recommend it to others
There are several options to go with for the fruit flavored drink
Although mixed drinks are a bit pricey they are really good
Waited in the bar for our table and had a drink which was very good
The food and drink not to mention the happy hour prices make this place more than worth it
two stars because they do have volleyball and the drink i was able to harass the bartender to give me was good
The food is a little pricey compared to the drinks but still a good deal
Excellent beer selection for the Tempe area
Pretty good selection of wine here than most TJs
The drinks were OK but not good enough to get me to go back
Great wine at competitive prices tasty house cocktails and a really fun use of space
They have a wide selection of beers of which I enjoyed a few pints
They had some drinks that looked delicious too
Even if you take away the amazing beer - the food is great too
We had two great bottles of wine the Malbac and the Teprinillo a cup of amazing spicy corn chowder artichoke dip and the brichetta apple and brea smoked salmon and pesto fig and prosciutto roasted red pepper and goat cheese
Very nice and took very good care of us even though there was a miss-hap with out food we didn't care we had wine and it was fun
The WIFI is consistently good they have a plethora of drink options to choose from and the staff is friendly
I'm not a coffee drinker but the mango smoothie is amazing and they are happy to make me a raspberry french soda when I ask
The drinks were amazing and strong and plentiful
Worth the wait-- because waiting on a picnic table in gorgeous Arizona with a couple glasses of wine is nothing to complain about
Our server was Katie and she was good at making sure our drinks were filled and that we were happy
They were really tasty and went very well with our wine selections
Once inside the display of food and drink was amazing
As for the drinks there are 2 walls with everything you can imagine such as milkshakes smoothies fancy coffee flavors etc
I stole a half-glass of wine from some friends which was good and noticed that they have Ace Pear Cider on the menu for $3
This is my favorite place for appetizers and wine
You don't drink a screw-cap wine when you have a good meal and you shouldn't put that kiddie mustard on a good brat
I'd recommend this place more for an outing with friends to grab dinner and drinks and less of a quiet family dinner kind of place
If you enjoy a good steak paired with an excellent wine they have a huge wine list you should definitely give Fleming's a try
Take advantage of their 1/2 price drinks and appetizers best deal on Mill Ave
They make their sangria in house too and its a wonderful and refreshing drink to enjoy on their airy pateo looking out over Old Town Scottsdale
On a nice night it's great to sit out there having a drink and eating their delicious pizza
Happy hour drink prices are good but at 700 we had to pay the full price which is kind of high
If you want to watch the game with a drink Majerle's is good
You will pay the same--drinks are like $12 and up but they are really good and usually pretty strong
Postives*Open 24 hours on the weekends*drink menu is priced accordingly with good drinks to chose fromNegatives*The internet connection here is AWEFUL
If you aren't getting Tortas or Tacos expect $20/person + drinks and appetizer and dessert costs
Plus they have an amazing selection of drinks and a great happy hour if only it went a little longer in the afternoon it would be perfection
But keep in mind if you get an appetizer drink meal and dessert
The beer selection was not-so-great completely unimpressed
The service was good and fast - no wait for a table and the wine came quickly
From the wonderful happy hourhalf off all appetizers and most alcohol to the large beer selection with a bunch of local brews and the delicious pizza we are pleased to have this new pizza joint in the neighborhood
Went with a friend on Friday night for happy hour had amazing sushi and drink specials and ended up staying way past happy hour was over because we had the BEST waiter ever
EXCELLENT service and very good food and wine
Next time we'll try the wines - they had a really good $20/per person for 4 wines and an appetizer on weekend nights that we'd like to order
One good thing They have drink specials EVERY day from 4 - 7 p
Though this was a specialty drink  Margaritas are suppose to be made with Lime juice not nasty ass margie mix- So that's a good thing
I don't care what the law or code is make me a drink that tastes good and gives me a little buzz
Good cocktail and beer selection surprisingly good food for a bar and a great staff
This joint offers yummy appetizers to munch on with your drinks or bottled coca cola if you dont drink
The drinks were good as the bloody mary's had the perfect spiciness level and the bacon condiment was a great touch
They have some kinks to work out but even still is a good experience for dinner drinks or a game
Maybe I would try again and just do wine and appetizers
It really didn't have a good flavor and was lacking that bite that most root beers have
After the initial mental adjustment I had to make The second bite was surreal - rich mousse-like so delicious with the wine they served
Much of the vegetables meat wine and even the coffee are found locally and he supports the area while cranking out some amazing food
Plan on spending $50 per person for a 5 course meal excluding wine pairing or any adult beverages which is truly a good deal when you see how much you get here
$5 for house wineappetizers are all half off with the exception of one
I remember coming here with my parents as a wee little one standing on my tippy toes with my hands and face pressed against the glass trying to pick one of the glorious 32 flavors yes they have 32 not 31 flavors at this location I was going to indulge in on my sugar cone
Switched to beer and was very happy with the Abita Purple Haze a crisp and delicious beer with hints of wheat vanilla and raspberry
The sangria at Havana Cafe is packed full of fruit flavor and it's a really refreshing drink that goes well with the heat of the Cuban dishes
good quality pictures not cheap like the ones inside the mall and they have little masks glasses and mustaches-on-a-stick you can use in case you're tired of flashing the peace sign or making that horrendous duck face
I am not too much of an alcoholic but I would recommend the sake bomber since you get more bang for your buck
Several good beers are on tap there the appetizers are tasty and I've always found it to be a pleasant crowd
And the kiddies also enjoyed root beer floats
The wine selection here is minimal but good with a house Chianti that was better when we first started going but has been replaced with one that is almost as good
Drink selection is amazing and they have a signature drink menu as well
The Cornish Pasty Company was shown as about a mile from my hotel very good ratings with a good beer selection
The beer was okay but the house pinot noir was very good
The good Drinks are dirt cheap especially during HH
Still got my drink promptly and I enjoyed it so much I had to repeatedly remind myself I had plans that I would not be able to show up to in a cab
Anyway I had a couple of drinks also and the bartenders were wonderful
We went a bit early to get appetizers and drinks and I honestly could have passed
They have a small but good selection of beers on tap
But the Vig is one heck of a place to take a date for sweet potato fries and good wine
Of course the bar makes very good drinks too
Local beers on tap and a selection of tasty signature cocktails
We both ordered coke lights apparently the Italian version of diet coke and they came in the adorable classic glass bottles and were very tasty
We started with Italian glass of wine ordered white bean and arugula salad added some Proscuitto to the salad and had side of their appetizer meatballs
their wine selction is amazing with a sommilier at your service to offer suggestions and selections
Like many of the other reviewers I STRONGLY recommend the Raj IPA if hoppy beers are your thing
As for the food both the sweet jalapeno chicken sandwich + beer-battered fries I got here and the grilled chicken beer bread a wrap at the Scottsdale location were honestly about as tasty of chicken sandwiches as I've ever had
They had just sourced a new wine from Lebanon - Chateau Musar Jeune Rouge 2009 where the wine is aged in cellars that have served a dual purpose as they made excellent bomb shelters for the local people during a civil war in the late 80's
fantastic bartenders fun company on either side of us great wine delicious food especially the bread with pesto sauce and Dwight on the piano with a vocalist
Cheap drinks generous pours low-key vibe plenty of heaters on the patio pretty damn good live music and minimal douche-baggery
The happy go lucky drink was tasty made with lemon and lime juice lime zest  rose petals and rose flavoring
All that for just over 8 bucks drink not included is a heck of a good lunch deal
Happy hour three dollar pints of their micro-brewed beer and three dollar appetizers
The specialty drink menu is awesome with all kinds of choices but although very tasty they are expensive $8-$12 and I would have liked to see them be just a bit larger for how much they cost
With the Groupon I was able to take try 5 different wines and share an appetizer with my friend
My favorite wine was the Summer Rain as it had a light taste and fresh flavors to combat the summer heat in AZ
When I sat down I was greeted quickly and when I had questions about a wine I was looking for they sent over a very knowledgeable gentleman who helped find two excellent wines
Overall the drinks were good food was good service was good and so were the musicians
The only downer was that Bryan split our check in half which would normally be fine but this time our friends had an appetizer and about 4 $10 drinks more than us
Of cos by the end of the meal i was more than incoherent and couldnt take anymore wine Overall the staff at Binkley was amazing
The atmosphere - 10 Food - 8Service 7Price - 4I think they are a bit pricey for what you get and wished they offered discounts on food  during their AMAZING Happy Hour and not only the drinks
Went back to FEZ last night for a couple of appetizers and martinis and had an excellent time
I think that FEZ's specialty martinis are delicious - a lot better than the margaritas we had last time
I had the Orange Marmalade martini which was only $5 because it was Svedka Tuesday meaning that all specialty martinis with Svedka vodka were only $5 and it was deliciously citrusy without being overly sweet
I do think that if you're looking for a quiet spot to share some drinks/appetizers and chat you'll probably want to go later on a weekday and not during happy hour
First let me admit that I drink a lot of coffee specifically flavored lattes
The coolest part was they let me take a beer from the wall and enjoy it with the wonderful pizza
The wine list was ranked  gold silver bronze but it was purely on price not relative to how good they really were
Plus our server was quick enough to bring us drinks and my soup order etc to hold us over;  Our server guy was outstanding - friendly in a genuine way prompt kept checking on us and had very good customer service skills I'll get to that later
The wine list is impressive with a wide selection of all things good that come from grapes
We also had a great waiter the first time who recommended an Indian beer that we hadn't heard of Flying Horse Royal Lager beer
Good deal for someone who is not too versed on wines and wants to taste different wines without blowing the rent

the used to have pretty good HH specials like half off apps and half off draft beers and well drinks
It was our first time to Tempe Marketplace and the Cadillac Ranch looked like a cool place to grab a couple drinks and some appetizers
No also because it has a nice wine selection full bar tasty if simple food solid veg options and that chilled out Phoenix bar in a house vibe
The Gold brew was tasty and a bargain at $4 considering the large glass it is served in
However the quality of the wine was not good
We did have good wine but it was all very underwhelming and sad
They have a great jukebox pool table and tasty beers/liquor
This is a beer drinker's paradise for sure with a consistent selection of good brews on tap
The veggies and glass noodles are delicious and the chicken is always tender
Pisco a strong colorless grape brandy is expertly processed turning out a libation that resembles a very smooth tequila in flavor and is the base for the drink
The house made caramel corn that poured out the top of this glass was obscenely good
I HIGHLY recommend the Farmers Feast with wine pairings
It's a goofy little neighborhood bar with sassy waitresses who serve up delicious wings and cold beer
All wine by the glass and champagne recommendations were no more than $12 each - and they were good
I'm not a beer drinker though so I can't tell you how good it is
The addition of the Lost Leaf to the downtown bar scene creates a trio of coolness as you walk from 3rd to 5th Streets even in our 100+ degree July nights  the Roosevelt for an appetizer or drinks on 3rd Fate for dinner on 4th and the Lost Leaf for drinks on 5th
Not a sit down with a bottle of wine have appetizers chat
The wine was okay the strawberries with mascarpone & chocolate infused wine were amazing

It probably took ten minutes or so for the waitress to return to our table with our glorious fancy fruit decorated drinks and a moundful of torta goodness
Great people awesome atmosphere and tasty drinks and food
anyway stop in to quaff a beer if you're on the way to another spot but dont come here with the exclusive intention of having a good time
And it's not a good idea to show up at the end of the night because the variety of beers is staggering and incredibly difficult to read on their menu if you've already tipped back a few
I'd rather spend that time running back and forth between Pane and the Parlor feeding all of the hungry patrons waiting to get in Pane the Parlor's delicious pizza and pitchers of draft beer
He was cool and recommended we try one of the mashed drinks and we went with Strawberry but was accidentally delivered a kiwi one
Bartender Mellisa does a good job fixing everyone drinks and recognizing the regulars
I suppose that it's good that the drinks are organic but there are a bit pricey to make it a regular visit

Plenty of beer choices and lots of options for food that are quite good
They have a good wine list and the apps are good too
It was a flavor explosion of beer battered fish crunchy cabbage guac and two sauces mixed together

I was asking the waitress for some recommendations on a Papago beer since I wanted to try one of theirs well after not shying away from hearing 12% alcohol I went for the Oude Zuipers
Great if your looking to get drunk or try something out of the ordinary but if your drinking to enjoy your beer I recommend trying something else

As we sat at the bar and enjoyed a bottle of wine and 3 courses we were compelled to share our impressions in hopes that the team that is putting Taps together will read and take note
With good food and drink an attempt at atmosphere and some leadership this may become a cool and convenient spot for west siders
The appetizers were free with a large beer purchase
**End edit**The bar has a good selection my midori sour that was a size of a water glass was probably around $8 but if you think about half that size at a club going at $6 the hotel's price was pretty decent
I spent over $60 but the beer and food was worth it
Who ever was their mixologist did a wonderful job; food and beer goes hand and hand very well
Not only did our server get drinks out quickly but with no hesitation he let us know how many would be served by an appetizer mixed tray
Well it was worth every penny to be instructed by the chef learn about the ingredients see hands-on demonstrations of techniques use their huge kitchen and utensils without having to wash the dishes meet new people who share a love of cooking and then to finally sit down and taste everything for dinner with a glass of wine
Padre's is another one of those restaurants that consistently produces good quality food and good drinks
I was incredibly impressed at how the girls that were serving us really truly seemed to have some serious beer knowledge
I came out with a taste of delicious fresh tex-mex well made drinks and a GREAT dining experience
The coffee tasted extremely weak and watered down which was surprising since their coffee drinks are usually pretty good
the beers are good service is fine by myself with a group with my dog without my dog- I've never been ignored and the ambiance is chill the constant hip-hop music seems a bit incongruous with the 'image' of the place but as I like the music they play no complaints
Very good beer wine and drinks and you can't beat their happy hour deals
It may not make #1 on my list of best burgers in the Phoenix metro area but it is up there and I definitely recommend The Original Wineburger
Drinks were just as good as the meal they serve French press coffee and fresh squeezed OJ
They were really good and got you nice and thirsty for some good beer
Their house wines are wonderful the beer list features better than average offerings and the prices are reasonable
But the so-called amazing drinks we kept hearing about definitely didn't find those
The drinks on the other hand are very good and sweet just my liking
Four Peaks is an excellent brewery nice brewers excellent beer good food but some of the servers suck
Honestly we have yet to order a bottle of wine or even peruse the wine list l One of the reasons this place brings us back so often is the oh-so-delicious bruschetta
I don't feel right calling this converted house a bar; it's more like a laidback casual but elegant place to kick back with your buddies or a date while sipping on good beer or a nice glass of wine
The bf had the house beer which was pretty good and I had a glass of cab I want to say 75
was extremely knowledgable about the beers and without being asked brought samples of a few the hubby inquired about so he could sample them; this after the hubby had ordered a pint of one he recommended
The food is very good the drinks are excellent one can sit in or out at the bar or in a chair or on a couch high table or low whatever you want is the name of the game here
Well we did have some apps & some drinks & they were wonderful - so much so that we decided to head back after the movie for more

For god's sake ask for the specially prepared peppers on your burger baby methinks they are stewed and dang they're good

But I think the beer here is still high-quality and the very pleasant vibe make it worthy of five stars
Decor is pretty cool great booths and they have a full bar and extensive drink menu with pretty good HH options
It is perfectly located perfect size prefect crowd amazing beer selections and you can have Pei Wei delivered to you

For 2 burgers a couple drinks an appetizer and a side the bill was roughly $60
Given it was good coffee and tea but 20 minutes to get a drink on the table is silly
Fun to people watch and sit outside * I assume a great selection of beers according to the menu but I don't drink beer so I can't give you a review on that * Friendly wait staff * Reasonable prices for what you get good portions Absolutely going to try and get to the Yard House more
As we ate and enjoyed our wines Alexia  the belly dancer began her moves
I really like the vibe at Next and the cubano coffee drink is delicious

That aside as long as they can bring me good beer on happy hour prices I am sold
I'd describe it a hole-in-the-wall wine bar - which is a good thing
Service was excellent friendly and very knowledgable about the menu and wine list
The service was on top of things and took good care of keeping my drink full
Went for some wine and appetizers with mother in law from California
From the time we ordered at the counter filled our drinks up with one of the three fresh brewed tea options while slowly walking away and starring at this crazy futuristic soda machine and sat down at a table we only had to wait about seven or so minutes for our healthy meals to arrive with their delicious aromas
The dry goods and wine selection seemed worthwhile
I LOVE your endless supply of fruity delicious and strong drinks
Also the staff is super nice and the store offers many flavors of ice cream as well as sorbets cakes and drinks
The Beer battered green beans and the sweet potatoes fries were also very good
Also my water glass never got empty which to me is the true test of how good a restaurant's service is
Seriously the food I had here was great and every other drink is good but every sip of the carrot juice felt tasted like my body was rejecting a stomach transplant
The drinks are made so stiff that if you drink more than 20 dollars worth you'll be dead
It's a crispy crust with just the right amount of chewiness and flavor
The DC Ranch location is beautiful what a great place to sit outside with a delicious pizza and a cold beer
Perfect place for a date or to suck down some good food and beer with your buddies
It was a work day so we didn't get to sample any of their wine list but the food was delicious
The sushi is really good the drinks are to but the ambiance is paramount
The wings were kind of small and didn't have a ton of meat but the flavor was good and the drink was made well
Some of my other favorites include Paradise Bakery a terrific Apple Store with excellent customer service and Christopher's Fermier Brasserie with its wonderful French food and variety of fine wines by the glass
The wine flights and the food that followed were amazing
Atmosphere is excellent especially sitting in the beer garden a great place to hang and throw a few back
They had an amazing selection of tequila and drinks I order a Victoria even thou it wasn't on the menu
This place by far has the WORST quality sushi I've ever endured I don't care how cheap their drinks are this place blows
I didn't partake of the beer or wine but it's always a good idea
We enjoyed a nice glass of Malbec before ordering our entrees Roast Leg of Lamb w/sides of Greek potatoes and Greek salad and Shrimp Santarini w/sides of roasted beets and Greek salad
Harney & Sons teas are always worth noting since few places do high quality bagged teas and they have quite a few options for the tea drinker
They have delicious drink specials for a decent price
Their buns are delicious and their beer is extremely cold
My drink was pretty good but what surprised me about this one was that I had expected the drink to come out of a gun
The service is good with cocktail waitresses coming around often with soft drinks
I noticed that they have a good happy hour menu and half priced bottles of wine on Mondays which I'll have to check out in the near future
Some tasty mochi desserts a few bottle of sake and all in all it was a very enjoyable night for my compadres and I
All this and 2 drinks for less than $60 and excellent service
This is a good stop for a burger and a beer
They have a really good brunch that I've been to as well with a Bloody Mary Bar where you get the liquor and the glass and get to choose your mixer veggies etc
The food is good but I have to say I usually fill up on a couple of drinks and wind up forgetting about the food
Good food a bit limited breakfast selection their on line menu had more options but we had been waiting so long to just get our drink order we didn't waste more time asking questions
With regard to the bill - it was around $50 including a 20% tip - keep in mind that we had no sides no drinks and shared ONE appetizer between the three of us
But the wait is worth it and if you're not enjoying the company of your dining companions in the meantime enjoy great bar drinks awesome original art on the walls sports generally on the televisions and great upbeat ambience that makes it a fun restaurant to visit
while drinking amazingly refreshing sangrias
I hate paying $10 for a drink but this one almost makes it worth it
There is a surprisingly good selection of sake here too
Now their 5 cent deals that they offer at all BevMo locations from time to time are really good but I do wish that instead of making you by the same wine at 5 cents that you could change it up as long as it is part of the 5 cent program and just make you pay for the one that is more expensive
Good strong drinks and good beer selection
It was tart spicy good balance of Clamato and beer
My wife and I celebrated our seventh wedding anniversary with the SWB's Wine Me Dine Me experience and we were thrilled with the service quality of the food dishes and the inter-activeness with the staff

Love and highly recommend Safelite Auto Glass

To help the not so intelligent beer drinker figure out what looked delicious
25 pints they claim to have over 200 types of beer and half priced appetizers
The service was friendly but I did feel as if our server was repeating things directly from the menu like a robot and he couldn't really make a good suggestion on what to try for food or wine
The servers are polite and the beer is delicious
I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys craft beer although you do need to be a bit patient when they are busy
However sparkly and shimmery the glass was in the setting sunlight plentiful shards of glass is not something I look for in a good hike
Needless to say he made our drinks really well and really strong our drinks were the perfect combination of preserving the integrity of the various flavors while packing a strong punch
The service was pretty slow and I wasn't really impressed by the beer list
This might be okay for young 20-somethings out to get smashed on $3 Happy Hour beers before heading over to the next mall bar across the parking lot but it's no good for elderly 30-year-olds intent on dinner conversation
The food was amazing the server was attentive without being annoying and the beer was perfect
I get the fun of retro beers as they have PBR cans too but focus on the good
Otherwise not worth the risk of shoddy service empty glasses and cold food
Two hours five beers an appetizer and two pizza's later we ended up with a bill for $50 plus tip
The drinks with each course were recommended as is if they were created in unison with each dish
When it is not extremely crowded more on that later the lounge area is an excellent choice to have a few drinks smoke on their patio and I have heard the food is pretty good too
Definitely good enough to deserve coming here even if you don't drink beer
Only lightly sweet and very snappy it was quite refreshing and a nice change from overly ambitious drinks that crowd out the flavors of a good meal
The bbq chicken salad you created was delicious and I especially loved the fun drink bar which let me make my own Italian soda
The beers are tasty- not four peaks quality but more unique flavored
Service can be a bit slow especially when it is busy but the servers know a lot about the beer and can easily recommend something new to you based on what you typically drink and like
Kincaid's makes the dining experience worth every penny with their food and drink both being top-notch
They have one of those fancy Coke machines that lets you create all sorts of drink flavors but I'm boring and got a Sprite
Service was good and drinks were filled promptly
Happy hour is also a pretty good deal with one dollar off all drinks and half price appetizers
All were delicious and were fantastic recommendations that paired nicely with our wine choices
Hop on the town trolley as it loops through the area while you keep an eye out for the wonderful panini sandwich shop and the one-of-a-kind glass beads
Gina B was correct - maybe negative stars ----- I ate there once with my wife years ago ------ she didn't remember it ---- we drove by tonight ---- and I said why not ---- The waitress we had was really good from Guatemala ------- The food was average at best and probably less then average ----- it was not crowded for Friday evening - and it seemed it has a regular crowd ----- My wife had the fish ---- special ---- she commented way to heavy on the potatoes or fries ------ and my patty melt looked like it was just thrown together and the onions - way overdone ----- and dammit or darn it ---- I order a root beer and it comes in a can ---- come on Linda ---- and then the bill ---- Fish special - patty melt ----- two sodas ----- 28
Lustre offers an eclectic cocktail menu as well as the standard draft and bottled beers not only poolside but on a great rooftop with a pretty good view
The upsides are the cold beer Dos Equis & Negro Modelo on draft - can't argue with that and the extensive menu that includes a pretty delicious salsa trio and some tasty fish tacos as an appetizer
They most annoying part of our Breakfast was that good friends of the owner and server were seated at the table next to us- while the two payed more than enough attention to that tables needs for drinks/paying the check I sat there for a good 15 minutes with out Coffee or Water and a messed up order
The owner even came out at some point to wish us a happy holiday& introduce himselfAbsolutely everything was taken care of for us as expected in a good restaurant ushered in chairs pulled out napkins placed water & wine topped off without even noticing
From your small intimate yet eclectic setting to your amazing menu featuring Arizona grown foods and wines how my heart will long until my next visit
I want to make a special note they do serve drinks amazing prices but the wine I DO NOT suggest
The quaint interior friendly regulars numerous quality beers on tap and kick ass bartenders are all good but there is one key element that one and all seem needful of
The salsas were tasty which is something that is very important since I always start the meal by drinking some salsa
I've been drinking coffee for more than 10 years and my life would be bleak depressing and flavorless without coffee
We sat at the bar and enjoyed great conversation along with our rye bread and Warsteiner beers
I just enjoyed a fabulous wine tasting here
They had a great selection of wines and the salmon pu00e2tu00e9 was delicious
This place gets an easy four stars for being a good spot to catch bands grab some decent but appropriately greasy bar food and enjoy an always decent drink selection
My bands played here when I was younger I saw plenty of amazing shows here and I still try to stop in when I'm on that side of town for an easygoing time playing pool and drinking beers
I'll recommend this for a great day drinking spot so it's A-OK with me
Giligans possesses all the benefits of a good dive like cheaper booze in big bottles comfortable atmosphere jello shots games karaoke beer pong a midget bar lots of funny drink specialsfor cougars and people with a breathalyzer in their car  and an interesting crowd but it's not a scary dive like the ones filled with Hells Angel bikers
Moved to the area recently as was looking for a local spot to frequent with tvs drink specials and good food
All in all not a bad place to grab a bottomless beer and a burger during HH at good prices
They have a lot of different drinks to choose from and if you like mocha's you are in luck because they have a whole list dedicated to specialty mocha's which are quite delicious and unique combinations
I love this place and despite the somewhat high price of drinks I really feel it is worth it
Unfortunately only this synecdoche of Tempe is walkable the majority of visitors have to drive to get here not good for a bar-hopping/drinking-and-driving destination and the lack of amenities would still make it difficult to live and work here without a car unless they shop for groceries at the corner CVS
They have an absolutely amazing selection of American micros including some beers I thought I'd never see outside the brewery
The variety of cheeses are great to go with an amazing wine list the restaurant has the ability to get wines from Kazmerez Wine Bar b/c its owned by the same people
Very good German beers on tap as you might expect
The Pros**Great stadium seating**Reclining chairs**DIY butter station for popcorn with many seasonings**Online ticketing and ticket kiosks so you don't have to wait in line**$5 movies for show times before noon**Early show times for the early bird really early like 845 amThe Cons**Parking is hit or miss**When movies are almost out of the theater they play them in these tiny theaters upstairs and if you get a bad seat your screwed**Typical teenage workforce**Every once in a while they won't get a popular movie that is out and I have to go somewhere elseAll in all it's a great theater and there is a lot of good food and drinks in the Westgate area so it's good one stop shopping
This place is great for smaller parties who enjoy a good beer
Just when I was calling Hana to see how late they were serving someone finally came up to us for our drink order and appetizers
Our soup and appetizer came before our drinks
The waiter took our drink orders and and put in the appetizer
I particularly enjoyed the premium tequilla and wine pairings that they selected for the meal
I went with the roasted tomato salad which was huge and delicious if not a *leetle* bit lacking in the namesake tomatoes
I was most impressed by Chick's wine presentation
Some poor chump is going to waste $40 on a pizza and some $5 BevMo wine thinking he's dining on something amazing
We have only ordered drinks and appetizers so we don't know if they still stick rosemary sprigs in the mashed potatoes
I haven't used this place yet but I stopped in with a friend who was looking for some glasses and I was impressed
The beers on tap are on the pricier side provided they are a high quality selection
Guests and I only had appetizers and drinks last night so we'll focus on that
I love the music they play- it's just feel-good trendy pop but it puts me in to mood to eat drink and be merry
Not your typical pizza/wine bar menu turns out to be a good thing
The service was good-though our drinks were never refilled
The prices are really good and they have a good happy hour for drinks and appetizers
The cocktail list was uninspired and I don't recommend bringing a beer geek here but if you're into sharing some munchies and splitting a bottle of reasonably priced wine this and about 20 other spots in the valley is your place
It took the two bartenders about 5 minutes to acknowledge me the bar is not that big but once one did he recommended me a good local draft beer at the happy hour price despite it being about a minute after happy hour which was cool of him
Another good thing about DD if you save your receipt and do an online survey they give you a code to get a free donut with your next drink order
- The pricing matches the quality of the food & drinks
To start with we had a bottle of the house red wine which was good but not spectacular and an order of calamari which was just average
Really enjoyed the xx beer battered tacos
I give great customer service and when I'm paying pretty high prices for food and drinks I expect pretty good service
Basically I'd rather go to a regular bowling ally during Cosmic Bowling where I can listen to better music get a pitcher of beer and some good food for half the price
The wines are all chosen VERY particularly and the cheese and accoutrements are delicious
Unfortunately Club Forbidden is apparently not up to the challenge - blown speakers inconsistent drinks poor parking & a typically bitchy crowd makes this IKEA/Trading Spaces remake of a classic scottsdale dive bar not worth the effort
Jonathan the Owner and Barber offers you a cold drink when you walk in Amazing
The best part are  the drinks good margaritas and tequila shots and fun vibe
Worth happy hour visit for drinks but not worth going for the food
About ten minutes later our waiter finally arrived took a drink and appetizer order and disappeared
About ten minutes later our appetizer arrived followed by our drinks after a few minutes
My daughter didn't think her chicken Guedo burro was that good and my son wanted to get a refill on his drink which he figured was not allowed so he didn't ask
I was really impressed because one of my dining companions couldn't decide what beer she wanted so asked if they could serve her a flight and they were happy to oblige I'm not sure how she ended up getting charged for that but the effort was still nice
and They had some really tasty drinks both alcoholic and non
The service was very good and the drinks were delish try a raspberry mojito - mmm
The beer was really really cold which is a huge plus for me the food whatever it was was delicious and the service was excellent
However there were lots of herb spice and anise flavors that added wonderful points of interest and kept my glass tilted
The atmosphere expressly stating share food share drinks Sangria by the pitcher share words laughs and good times
Their wine list is the largest I have ever seen but our attentive waiter Bryan recommend the K Vintners and we savored every drop
Drink's are cheap tacos are good and the bathrooms aren't as scary as you would think
Cost to worth it rating 3Highlights- Beers ~113 on draft pints yards and half yards 2 pints worth available - Lemonade specialty vodka cocktail with a sprig of mint that was perfectly refreshing and not too sweet- Sweet potato fries thin and crispy with a drizzle of syrup- Spicy chicken sandwich blackened and on a flatbread roll which was thin yet dense and grilled- Jerk wings sauce was a wee bit spicy yet sweet- Patio tables and couches with misters- Bathroom from the hub 5 urinals and shelf to park your beer glass which he thought was awesomeLowlights- OC chain so not really getting the AZ experience
sounded good but their espresso is kinda weak so it didn't complement the drink
Good drinks possibly best chai I have ever had
Favorite Appetizer is the Stuffed Mushrooms and their brewed root beer is pretty good
The omelets are a little greasy but the food is otherwise excellent and they serve beer early which always comes in handy
Hitachino and the 33 beers were both good and the hot and dirty martini was more than worth the mile walk before the Sun's game
We had the chefs feature brat this month from Justin Beckett topped with root beer onions highly recommend and it was phenomenal
The beer brat was also good nice tart sauerkraut
but after everything else we had its not a wonder whyOur server was amazing as well she provided us with food ideas and always made sure our drinks were filled
On one occasion i went there with a friend and she asked me whats good here i simply statedask the bartender and the bartender proceeded to ask her what types of beers she drinks and then gave her some recommendations based on her taste
Most bars point you the the wall of beers and say any of those are good Also on that same night she had left her coat on a bar-stool outside and the bartender immediately saw that and placed it behind the bar
If it's duck-fat fries and Martinis that meet your fancy then I'd recommend Bourbon Steak
The Rusty Spur has that good old cowboy charm that just makes you feel like drinking a brew and riding off into the sunset on horseback
Since I'm a big fan of new American food good drinks and stylish atmosphere I thought Bloom and I would be a match made in heaven
*The two seafood appetizers Lobster/Crab Puffs and the Sesame Shrimp - the first is rich and really satisfying with a light drink and the shrimp are very fresh and flavorful with an Asian kick
I made anipa sampler of four beers ok I lie we made two samplers each  we tried everything that sounded good
I wish that this place were not so good - I have not been able to drink the coffee at my office in weeks
the carrot juice was great always love a place that offers ginger beer and the brown chicken stew was sooooo good
The wine selection is good and unusual the ambiance is unmatched   wity the beautiful outdoor patio and the service is outstanding Tim is a delight as a waiter and is a major reason we have been repeat customers
I enjoy sitting back with a spiked drink and listening to some good local music with my beautiful desert lit up all around
We love that they make all their drink mixers - housemade sodas it really makes the drinks extra special and delicious
The poolside service was a bit better or maybe I just thought it was better because the drinks tasted good
I had coconut milk to drink tasted fresh and delicious my wife had jasmine tea also very good
Good beer selection decided not to do a margarita though they boast a good recipe
The wine list is good and has some favorites and some different labels than I have seen in other places - so you have choices
If you want some great food and drinks on a current economy budget the daily 5-7 happy hr may be a good choice for you
Definitely would recommend for a quick evening drink before or even after a night on the town
So if you go and you find something worth drinking let me know
A Stella that was served in the appropriate glass finished off our Satuday Funday as the frozen drinks for $6 were very good
They have a vast selection of draught 28 or so on tap even a draught root beer for the kids bottles about 15 different flavors and a couple different variates of canned beer MGD Coors Light PBR and a couple of craft cans like Trout and Dale's
Along the way you are also rewarded with beer koozies 25 different beers and free appetizers 50 different beers
Great food good wine and a wonderful staff
Bright welcoming and fun I feel pretty comfortable here sipping on some delish flavored water or a complementary drink while watching some chick flick on the screen in front of me
They brew their own beer and I really like the Sunspot Gold very light and the HefeWeizen Wheat Oh so good
**The hot chocolate was just gross but the drink is an acquired taste and they got the flavor right
They're not made with some cheap mix and served in some martini glass but a classic good quality margarita that you just want to drink all night
The oil & red wine vinegar mix is AMAZING
So tasty I downed two big glasses pretty quick
The Tiki drinks are excellent and the bartenders pride themselves on mixing with scientific precision
For appetizers or pupus in Tiki speak the sampler platter that includes Barbeque Spare Ribs Crab Rangoon Crispy Prawns and Cha Siu Pork from the Chinese Wood Fired Oven that can be seen in its own glassed-in room near the kitchen is great for sharing
It is good to still see some of the old shops still there like Eyeglass Charlies Bookstar and Togos
They were still pretty good in this west coast location but the extra purchase of the beer cheese for dipping was clearly the key
Go for the pretzels and cheese excellent drinking food
After my visit here my current favorite and possibly the drink that has gotten me hooked to Starbucks is the shaken green tea lemonade with a packet of honey and 2 pumps of that good old syrup
which when compared to other airport Starbucks really isn't different at all BUT this one has AMAZING staff who's friendly and willing to make whatever your heart desires despite the long line of people they have to make special drinks for
I like this park's facilities; the off leash areas are pretty large there is relatively good grass there are doggie drinking fountains that are almost always functional and the doggie pick up bags are almost always stocked
Service drinks appetizers all get five stars
5 dollar glasses of wine and half priced appetizers
I'll be back for sure to try some of the other chewable additions and flavored drinks

The food is good and they have some great beers on tap
Everything from beginning to end was perfect - service ambience seating and selection and amount of food was incredible along with a very good wine selection
Rude inattentive staff confusing lay out ridiculously priced drinks and good food if they aren't out of it
The good You are allowed to bring in drinks and snacks
plenty of activity huge drinks and food that all seems like it's an appetizer
I've watched the company grow since the beginning and at least in the Tempe location it has stayed both an iconic experience of Tempe life near ASU and a provider of both exceptional coffee and tea drinks and baked goods
They have an amazing wine list on ipads for you to peruse
It was cooked in a white wine sauce with artichokes and capers and it was bursting with flavor
COURSE II -ZUPPA DI POMODORO ARROSTO ALLE ERBE e BASILICO No wonder it is the Queen's favorite Enjoy the flavors of Roma tomatoes roasted with olive oil & fresh herbs blended and simmered in white wine cream & shredded fresh basilOPINION - Rich and creamy this soups had a great flavor too bad you only get half a bowl
POLLO ALLA CACCIATORA Boneless breast of Chicken rubbed with lemon salt & pepper sautu00e9ed until golden then combined with pitted oil cured olives seasoned tomatoes sliced onion minced garlic fresh thyme sage basil & white wine OPINION Flavorful if you like olives
Found out the Horchata is way too sweet but delicious to drink alone so I shared with the boy
Bottom line Order your favorite drink one or two of the appetizers and split an entree
The beer selection isn't the greatest but they do have a couple good choices
I actually had to waive different waitress down to refill our glasses after they were empty for a good 15 minutes
Good place great drink selection small food menu reason for 4 stars wonderful service
The beer selection is harsh I mean really not good
I had a nice glass of Pinot Noir that was recommended by the bartender
Good variety of donuts and they also have croissant and bagel sandwiches and boba drinks which is very similar to Rainbow Donuts on McDowell
they did anyway and i had to fight to get a new top with out the mayo great beer selection good stuff on tapand the server was very friendly and attentive
if you are on mill check them out for lunch you'll get a good cold sandwich and a great beer to go with just be patient with the help
My boyfriend and I decided to try Boulders out last night because we wanted some good beer and it's within walking distance of my condo
I was VERY impressed by their beer list
I dug the old-school ambiance with the wood paneled bar we received very good service and the selection of beer was amazing - truly something for everyone
Also some yummy vegetarian options good choice of drinks
Now the place has increased the quality of fish they have fresh chopped wasabi available on request and a great selection of cold Sake
The mark-up was about 100% of retail but the wine was good
She recommended a Pale ale beer for me and a pumpkin cider beer for my sweets
lol There were a few nice wines to choose from on the menu and our waitress was very good
House wines by the glass were a good accompaniment
Two of us with wine and one dessert was $75 so a good value as well
Good place to go on a date or out with the girls for drinks
the little bar that you wait in next door is so precious and lit up with candles take a breather from our fast pace lifestyle and just enjoy your company wine and appetizer
the ghetto elements are gone and there is a wonderful wine bar with an even better patio
We put down a bottle of the Rose - it was very very tasty and drinkable
Great smell from the kitchen and a small little bar with plenty of good beverages and cold beer
Eba has an amazing selection of drinks and ways to prepare them
For a fraction of the price of the average degustation menu we sampled the gamut of appetizers and several drinks- well I had several drinks not the driver
We arrived on a Friday at about 6PM just under the wire to order a few drinks and an appetizer from the happy hour menu
The wine recommendation was great and the bruschetta with crescenza cheese asparagus prosciutto di Parma was very good
I kind of wished we'd won because 3 appetizers 4 entrees and wine came to $50/pp before tax and tip
Entitled Crispy seared Foie Gras with apple raisins pomegranate spiced Brazil nuts popover chervil and finished tableside with a spritz literally from a spritzer of cinnamon Ice Wine vinegar this preparation of duck liver would arrive as a linear stripe on a square plate and harkening the plating style of Michael Carlson the flavors would also compare favorably as the crackling exterior of the foie gave way to the melting interior and each bite lent itself to a new form of explanation with the accoutrements - most sweet many smooth and all interesting; particularly the popover stuffed with a creamy puree of liver nuts and aromatic spices
I was impressed with their drink selection
The ginger beer was good it had a nice strong bite to it
I love the Skeptical Chymist because it consistently delivers on the quality of food drinks entertainment and service
Super cool and fun staff the drink list is amazing and they  have an assortment of booze rarely seen in P-town
It's a place you can sit and talk and enjoy good food and drinks for a few hours which we did
I'm pretty happy with this place overall; drinks are good service is friendly atmosphere is enjoyable and I delight in the immediate neighborhood where I inevitably have to park
My drink was good but I was very disappointed in the pizza
Even without a Groupon the food and drinks are worth it
Service was good even though the place was packed for UFC and they had a bunch of beers on tap and never had to wait for another beer
i believe I saidIt's almost like the food does not reveal it's own flavor it's as if the cooks disguises them in oil and wine and it destroys the dish
The beers are pretty good although the portions are on the small side
Overall $20 a person including tip with strong drinks good food and extras to take home we were satisfied
I subsequently revisited The Parlor because while I don't think it's the second coming as many of my very good friends do it's still a very cool place to grab a beer and bite
No wait quick/good/friendly service good food and lots of good beer
Service was good was seated right away took my drink order came out
The bar inside offers just about anything your alcoholic heart might desire- with a killer happy hour of $5 beer pitchers great selection of brews to boot glasses of wine from the tap yes I said tapped wine but it's really good stuff and other delicacies
If you're in the mood for a really incredible place to hang out have a few drinks indulge in some delicious food and really just enjoy a laid back dining experience then the Windsor should be at the top of your must try list
The food and cocktail menu looks great and I thoroughly enjoyed my freezing cold glass of Schramsberg Blanc de Blanc at a very reasonable $9 a glass
While the rest of us had iced water I recommend not to drink when the ice has melted
Nobuo accompanies the great food with a good wine selection a one-of-a-kind Japanese beer selection running the range from lager to oyster stout including a great IPA and a good sake selection
The fried shrimp had just enough flavor to taunt me into picking up some shrimp and fixing coconut beer battered shrimp for dinner a few nights later
Excellent ambiance great service versatile space - patio and wine bar make perfect setting for happy hour and dates
The food was excellent and so was the wine selection
The food and drinks were a little slow getting to the table but they were worth the wait
We had quite the sampling of sushi appetizers and sake
Drinks were stiff and delicous and waitress was good and friendly
Friendly ladies behind the bar nice drinks and delicious dinner right at the bar
In sum the food is pretty good and the atmosphere makes this place an appealing restaurant to return to however the sub-standard service hit-or-miss drinks/chips can taint an otherwise good experience
After what I felt like was inhaling my delicious burger we had a apple cinnamon cookie with a glass of milk
We got a pitcher of domestic beer for $15 which I thought was a good deal considering the two of us drank two beers each from it
I highly recommend stopping by for a drink if you ever happen to pass a Dutch Bros
I started off with the Tamarindo drink which had a similar artificially sweet flavor to Thai iced tea
I am a beer snob and if you ask for a sample they will give it to you without concern they are in the business of quality beer and the food is great too
However the drinks were so good--he had the antioxidant cocktail and I had the sangria
Excellent wine - thankfully chosen by two friends who're native Italians
Strongly recommended to anyone into wine and a great setting
Just to note they have a wonderful wine list as well as very nice valet in front
The Lounge overlooks the city is amazing start here with a drink
After being seated we were immediately gotten drinks and given very delicious chips and salsa
When it arrived I was less than impressed with the size as the glass was the same size as a standard full wine glass
There we sat for another couple of hours putting away pitcher after delicious pitcher of beer when the hunger bug snuck up on us again
Even if you are not one to drink darker beers its worth a try
I highly recommend Phoenix Ale Brewery don't have high expectations in regards to aesthetics but it is all about experiencing the beer
the food was good the service was good the atmosphere on a warm spring afternoon was delightful and it was splendid little spot to let the dishes and the glasses pile up
You definitely get your alcohol's worth here more than 3/4 of the drinks were pure alcohol
Hotel bar was basic but the service was friendly; they had good beer and some pretty tasty happy hour snacks i
Anyways got seated by some waitress and she freaken took forever to get our drinks then moments later she came back with our appetizer which was the Otaku spicy tostada
They have an amazing beer selection and the location is quaint and charming
It was really close to my gate good food good drinks
All in all 4 glasses of wine 2 appetizers entre's and two deserts around $115
Good job TAW get a beer and wine license and a patio and you make me really happy
Dutch Bros is good solid coffee and their iced drinks are great
The iced coffee is perfection and if you aren't the coffee fan they have these blended drinks called 'Cool latta's' - I've only had the orange flavored one but sooo good
Started with the pineapple infused house sake - very light but tasty
Glasses of wine were okay which is too bad since all the glasses are $9+ but the pitchas of beer are a pretty good deal
Given that kind of vibe and the fact that they serve some good bottled beer this would almost be a place to meet some friends after work
But then I started thinking it might be worth it for those who wanted a nice relaxed casual spot for drinks ater work since no one else seemed to be there at the time
The first visit was on a lazy Mon afternoon We had way to much wine and ate like pigs  but we couldn't stop  everything was super amazing
My gf had a glass of wine and we ordered the crabcake appetizer to which our server replied Good choice
The location is pretty central to Phoenix and it's a good resource when looking for that odd bottle of wine you won't find in Safeway's or Fry's Food Store
They have a terrific selection a pleasant but small atmosphere to hide away for a time --- next to a glass of something and a good conversation with that special someone
I'm not even a beer drinker and I enjoyed the Yard House
Our server recommended an earthy red wine that J took advantage of and loved
If I lived in Phoenix you would positively catch me here on a Monday or Tuesday night for their amazing $20 house bottle of wine and bruschetta special
pleasant conversation with convivial company good food and drink in an interesting setting
So I'd go again for the nice chairs seating and ambiance but I'd stop at a local watering hole first to have a few drinks and good hot food
The wine was very good just that i can't remember the name of it PAlso we celebrated for one of the friends' birthday today
Their waiter was really professional when introducing the food and recommending the wine
I selected some white lighter wine that he recommended which was about $14 a glass I think MoMo was the name
Great experience AWESOME food and excellent wines left me happy without spending a fortune
Fork tender short ribs-More like spoon tender great flavor with the red wine reduction  and NO fat
The decor is cool I like the ever-changing local art and the sci-fi movies in the background when is drinking a moscow mule and watching Godzilla not a good time
The beer is cold and when you have a seat at the bar or table the service is usually good
That said the staff is very friendly and responsive; the grilled steaks at Hole in the Wall are delicious; the micro beer splits at Rico's are great; and the hotel is welcoming for kids and pets
The bartender was great her name was Jennifer an she made excellent drinks
Don't get me wrong this place isn't a total train wreck - I would certainly pop in for a glass of wine at happy hour and there are good deals to be had it's cheap enough for sure
Either way their drinks are delicious and you should stop by and get one
Also I'm not sure it's on their big menu but at one time they had a flyer up regarding coffee flavored drinks with ground coffee beans I've had the mocha and the hazelnut
The wines are well priced and there's a good selection range depending on what you're purchasing for
Food and drinks are good here and even more so during happy hour
I can tell this is going to be a fruitful relationship filled with beautifully unhealthy yet DELICIOUS food and gallons of beer
Very good $30 investment considering you get a three course meal commentary and instruction from Eddie wine 3 hours of entertainment and you still get to take the recipes home with you
Drink specials and appetizers are provided at each location
I had two glasses of red wine and both were wonderful
The house rolls were half off appetizers were half off and the drinks were half off as well
For about $90 after tip we got 2 appetizers 2 sides two entrees up to $35 each two drinks and two desserts
Drinks are tasty and reasonably priced in my opinion
a 3-star rating but that extra star comes as a direct result of the amazing selection of draft beers this place has
Beer lovers beware untold deliciousness awaits you inside beneath the ski decor and deers' heads
I had the passion fruit tee yummmmm I almost walked out with the glass I didnt want to put it down it was so good
On the way I get to watch salads being made as I eye certain ingredients and examine their quality through the glass of course
The Good the service the ambiance the drink menu great looking people the bathrooms the bread the desserts are yummo
Not so good the amount of ice they put in the drinks some of the food is not so great  example
Beer was good and that was pretty much the highlight
So if you are downtown and want a great steak skip Kincaid's and go to Durant's where they have servers wandering around always refilling your glass with Evian water for FREE and the food is insanely delicious
Over the years I think that the quality of their beer has gone downhill
Drink prices were good service was decent and we all had plenty to drink
Oh and my glass of sauvignon blanc was VERY good
The bartenders make awesome drinks including massively tasty midori sours
Service was fine throughout the meal once things got started but we sat for a good while without anyone taking our drink order or introducing themselves as our server to acknowledge our existence
The drinks were very good and our server was very attentive
They have a small but quality selection of wines beers cheeses prepared foods and a variety of other items
I was impressed by the selection of beer although small with an offering of Alaskan Amber Ale
Also I have been here for bloody marys on a Sunday and enjoyed sitting outside with some drinks
So many tasty options all at very reasonable prices--$5 got me the wrap a drink and my choice of chips a cookie or a brownie
We ordered two appetizers when we placed our drink order and then placed our food order when our drinks came out
Every course was excellent and the wine selection was nice
Great food excellent drinks and the bar is where it's at
Nice wine list very good cocktails and an atmosphere at least outdoors that was fab
Wally's happy hour is from 4-6p M-F with $1 off cocktails & beer and $2 off all appetizers
The food presentation is wonderful and the wine is fantastic
I've had several drinks here all have been good
2*-Red Wine Glazed Short Ribs $24 This wasn't as good as it sounded
So glad to know that there is a genuine coffee for coffee sake-brewed for the individual- take time to investigate your flavor preference for coffee-slightly industrial slightly minimalistic jaunt that is local independent and worth repeat visits-kinda place in the Mill Ave District
I still make the drive once a week over here to pick up and few things because their customer service is so good and they have AMAZING deals on beer
Don't get me wrong the restaurant was comfortable the food was good  and the beer was fresh
I immediately noticed the tasty dishes in the glass refrigerator at the counter and most importantly the rows of desserts tempting my taste buds
Their wine section is respectable enough and I got a good bottle of Pinot Noir at a good price with my Safeway Club card
As far as the rest goes bomb service solid sides & starters tasty desserts comprehensive wine list and great wine offerings by the glass if you like to jump from wine to wine during your meal
I am not a big coffee drinker but they do have a good assortment of teas and I especially like their chai
The staff are friendly fun and helpful the beer is good and the food is delicious
The only complaint I had was the patio seating wasn't very good for eating - great for drinks and socializing but we were posed in a constant hunch the entire time as we sucked down our food
A very cool neighborhood hang out for those who appreciate reasonably priced really fine wines and beers and tasty food fare and easy listening live music
I also ordered a 24 oz juiced veggie drink that was excellent
I had an agua de limon to drink and it was amazing
Their service was very good their drinks were good  and the pizza took like 10 minutes to come out
After a few drinks and an appetizer or two we're always ready cross the street to our apartment and cook
The selection service and prices at Total Wine are great and I'm glad I don't have to drive too far for good hooch
The wine list has a nice selection in price range as well as regions and we were given excellent recommendations for the flight we each chose $8-15 apiece; ours were $10
I like to understand what I drink so I took the liberty of pulling the wine up on the wonderful web
The drinks are very good wide variety just strong enough + they have flavor
The cornbread is a great addition to the meal and most of the mixed drinks are good
Usually any Z is located nearly a shopping district so I could see this as a good place to go on a shopping day or for some drinks
All were really good and the $20 bruschetta and wine special Monday & Tuesday nights 8 - 10 was a killer deal
They have a variety of cocktails which are a good deal because they let you keep the shaker with the rest of your drink in it it's like a bonus drink
The restaurant on the property is good I tried room service dine-in and having few drinks at the bar
Drinks are pretty good tho the bartenders know how to make em
Beer selection is a little on the weak side but the food is pretty good
Coors light or Bud Light Drinker BEWARE none of that swill is sold at the bar at Four Peaks just their delicious brews they make
As far as the beer goes there is a reason 4 Peaks won a gold medal in this years World Beer Competition its just that good
The drink they're most well known for is their margarita which I must say is pretty good
I love their Patron margarita and highly recommend drinking at least three of them and taking a cab home
I recommend their specialty drink its a Ginger Lemonade
They carry Mexican beers that I have never heard of before last time I had an Estrella and it was delicious
Beer list is good and the wines and liquors are decent
The food is pretty tasty and you'll find the normal bar fare here think burgers and fries and they are often having cheap drink specials that never fail to bring a smile to my face
The bill came out to $85 which included 2 drinks 2 kids meals that included their drinks an appetizer a teppan meal from the happy hour menu and a teppan meal from the regular menu
They also serve one of the best Prosecco wines very hard to find that of Prosecco Franco from Valdobiaddene the winery of a beautiful family and good friends of mine
The drink menu is inventive though inconsistently priced and makes good use of the building's former incarnation with lots of floral inspired beverages
If  The Vig Uptown didn't have amazing Vignature drinks with fresh squeezed juice I would probably would start going back to The Vig on 40th st
I was at first impressed when we stopped in for a round of drinks on my birthday
Overall a good people watching experience very loud and crowded with terrible service adequate beer and generic yet palatable cuisine
Last but not least the bartender pouring our drinks pours a definite stiff one so no worries on not getting your moneys worth
Maybe it's just me 'cause the waitress raved about this drink but frankly it wasn't good
To the restaurant's credit though the waitress was pleasant about it and substituted my drink for a strawberry daiquiri which was pretty good - sugar rim no whipped cream or strawberry garnish though
They were very friendly checking back on our table often to make sure everything was good and if we needed refills on our drinks
Let me assure you it is still a tasty drink
This is a good place to meet up for a drink and hang on the patio for a while to watch a game or catch up with a friend
I am going to tell you the secret to having a good time at AmsterdamPre drink
This is where the beautiful people converge on a Friday night to eat some amazing food and drink wine
We were constantly reminded that our outside drinks needed to be finished even though over half of our group were buying drinks and appetizers from the pool service bar
My biggest complaint is about the lack of good craft beer
Blue Moon you saw me standing aloneWithout a drink in my handWithout a mug of my ownBlue Moon you knew just what I would care forYou had a brew I would dare forFour ales I fell off my chair forAnd then suddenly the check appeared before meThe one I wasn't prepared forI heard someone whisper 'I'll driveAnd when I looked the moon had turned to amberBlue Moon now I'm relaxed after my stressful weekWith good times with some friendsWith some brews of my ownMaybe drunk yelping is not a good idea
The drinks are cheap so you can afford to have enough to make you sound good
The drinks are cheap so you can afford to have enough to make other people sound good
If you love good high alcohol beer on tap they are one of the few restaurants who carry Chimay on tap
Their mixed alcoholic drinks have all been excellent although pricey
As we're standing there sipping our Champagne of Beers and someone saysDamn that's a really good Jimmy Eat World cover band playing
I enjoyed all of the beers that I had a brown a red and a monkeyshine but my favorite was the brown for it's utty taste
It's not the cheapest place in the world but the happy hour was $3 for a pint of good beer so no complaints there
During happy hour drinks are $1 off and appetizers are half price
For six beers 1 margarita and 2 appetizers our bill was $34 so we were pleasantly happy
It took her forever to bring our drinks finally out and then when our appetizer came out we asked about the cornbread she said she would go get that
Drinks were ok they have a good vodka selection and prices aren't too bad
On the plus side Windsor has great sides and appetizers good drink list excellent service and always a good crowd
Sangria here is good and in fact I got really drunk off some chocolate martinis there a few weeks ago too
They already had me at Happy Hour drink and appetizer discounts but another break on the price is always welcome
If you're unsure or uneasy just send a member of your party next door to Bar Bianco for drinks & appetizers
Five of us two appetizers two bottles of wine five pizzas came out to around 50 dollars a person including the tip
The drinks were blegh and my buffalo chicken sandwich was made with sliced deli-style chicken meat with indistinct flavors from all the elements of the sandwich
Has a full bar with some good specialty drinks that sometimes take some time to make but are worth the wait
I think Thai Spices offers a good value for some great food and drink and I can't wait to come back
and some beer with food that goes good with beer
If you adopt alternate eponyms like Party Gator Magnus ver Magnusson The Roanoakley and Zizi Jeanmaire all the better as no one you meet on the river who is not a member of your immediate party will be worth knowing in land-form and thus your 'actual' name is a valuable keepsake so they won't find you on yelp and invite you to Dirty Pretty Rockbar or better yet Eli's
Luci's is a good neighborhood spot to buy your health foods drop in for a coffee or fresh made baked good or pick up some beer or frozen meat on the way home
I'm a bargain hunter and the drink prices are excellent
Their food prices are a bit pricey for me but considering how impressed by my drink I am I think it will definitely be worth $8 for a sandwich
+++'sDecent food bottled beer on ice friendly service good cooks fresh and filled condiment buffet fun to squirt your own ketchup and mustard from the buffet area free refills outdoor patio not too busy for weekday lunch time- - -'sChintzy du00e9cor no eye candy a tad overpriced for what you get yellow circus awnings drab atmosphere no wifiIn sum if you are in the mood for a hamburger a quick bite to eat and are in the vicinity of a Fuddruckers this place delivers
but two drinks and an appetizer and I was uncomfortably full
For a man who only drinks scotch and water I was impressed he left his comfort zone
It was perfectly quiet as we enjoyed our wine ever notice how a little traffic noise invades so much outdoor seating
And the sommolier has a really good manner--helpful not pretentious made picking wine enjoyable not a test good diverse wine list too
Still worth going though just to enjoy the breezes with the people who like wine--My kind of people
well if you ever needed an excuse to drink that's a good one
speed and quality of drinks they where slinging even though there was a line to get to the bar they still where personable I even saw them help take pictures for someone when they had a chance to breath
Some of the folks enjoyed some adult drinks one was called Blue Winter
All in all we had a great time and enjoyed the food drinks and service quite nicely
I do not like overly sweet drinks but both of my drinks lacked any fruit flavor which was odd considering the laundry list of ingredients in both
The waiter recommended a garlic and wine seasoning be sprinkled on the wedge salad
Definitely not the best sushi I've had in town but the drinks are good cucumber mojito
It's unfortunate we won't be able to experience this hip chic high-end bar which had excellent service GR8 food and fantastic drinks
They were busy so it took a while to get drink / appetizer orders but it wasn't unreasonable
A friend of mine and I just wanted to stop in for some snacky items to go with wine for a light tasty dinner
I did see they have pretty good drink specials and the place was quite busy so someone must like it more than I do
I mostly just go here when I want a good beer and don't want to pay $22 for a 6-pack of hand selected beers at Total Wine
The wait staff is very good at The Herb Box and they work very hard at anticipating drink refills
They have good happy hour drink and dinner specials
Drinks are stiff and there is an excellent selection of beers on tap and otherwise
Service- Every time we went there it was busy and we received very good service and our servers were knowledgeable about the beer
For now I say it's a pretty restaurant with good stiff drinks
Most of their beers wines and alcohols are priced a good 20% less than just about anywhere else; such as Bev Mo your general grocery stores AJ's and other liquor stores
If you can swing a car trip just for your drinking pleasures or can plan it for your way home it's worth coming here to save the extra $
Their bottled beer selection is also very good with the classic domestics along with a dozen or so top notch imports
Wine- Surprisingly good wine selection with a good mixture of whites and reds
The wine list is plentiful in both quality of the wines and quantity to choose from
I never get soft drinks here but their freshly blended Horchata is AMAZING and is probably my favorite horchata in AZ
In the wine room you will find an excellent selection wines and beers and an always helpful and knowledgeable staff member should you like myself need help making a choice
The softdrinks are big and you get refills which is good since they are $2
We started out with a wonderful wine recommended by our server she let us taste 3 kinds before we chose what suited us
You can go for just a beer car bomb or their tasty pasty
It's got a lot going on but is very refreshing to drink I highly recommend this if you're not looking for a sweet drink
95 as our appetizer and a big ole $5 Thai beer
Their Pale is very very tasty but don't construe this as that their other beers aren't also very good because they are
The old timey way they make drinks is very cool and the drinks are delicious but I have waited now 35 and 45 minutes each on different nights to actually get a single mixed cocktail
The beer and wine were flowing for sure there was a pretty good selection mostly Irish of course and the prices were good too
It seems to be a nice place to hang out and eat some good food with a nice glass of wine
If I Iiked beer I'm sure I would have been impressed with the beer list -- it's pretty extensive
They have a good beer and wine selection as well so it could be a good hh spot
I feel the wine selection is great my martini was perfect and took the edge off of a long day at work and the pork tenderloin was very tender and delicious
I would not necessarily go back for the food specifically or recommend it but if you just want to hang out and drink it's a nice little place
She made great recommendations and she totally took good care of us - making sure our food was good and that our drinks stayed full
Not worth the drive if you are going to pass other craft beer bars like the Watering Hole Boulders Papago Hungry Monk Cuoco Pazzo or Yardhouse meh
The food was amazing and the drinks were delicious
The bartender was from heaven the drinks were STRONG and GOOD
We arrived early for the antipasto appetizer and drinks in the bar
They serve beer and cocktails and have a good selection of wine
I tried the 'Duke Special Sangria' as well as the wine-tini both wonderful ask for them next time you are in
If you are looking for good food avoid Majerle's If you want to watch sports and drink this is a good place to beAnd it's nice that they turn music on during commercialsI really don't understand how Majerle's food is as bad as it is
Also the have some really good beers on tap and a couple of big tv's behind the bar
The drinks were good and had decent prices
I would also recommend going to the bathroom before you get a few drinks in you
I enjoyed the crispy shell and the chewiness of the egg
The atmosphere is always awesome the Bellini's are fabulous must have drinks and the food is wonderful
She maintains a permanent scorn on her face and when she finally hands me my corrected drink I say thanks have a good morning

-Takeaway Cool for a good beer afterwork if you want a great brewery with BOMB food go to Four Peaks or San Tan
We had 2 meals 2 flavored drinks and 2 deserts and it cost less than $25
My friend said their drink special sweet tea and vodka was awful but their draft beer was good
I had the same wine as last time and I still cannot remember the name of it but man it is good maybe the reason I can't remember the name is because I had too much of it
Our bartender was awesome joked around with us talked wine with my friend who worked at vineyard for years and gave us some great recommendations for Riojas that he thought we would enjoy
Z Tejas has some amazing food and drink options to suit any palate
Our group went across the way to one of my favorite places Nobuo at Teeter House and had some drinks and some appetizers
They don't take reservations anymore and they don't do takeout although I did order a pizza to go and with there always being a huge wait I think he's got a good business going where you eat and drink while waiting at his other place next store Bar Bianco
Four Peaks has a good selection of beers on tap - plus a decent seasonal selection
The food and drinks are good but not worth the trouble of our tag-team effort
Sorry to be so critical but I like it to be clean where I eat - good food and drinks - I'll go back next time I'm in the neighborhood
There's no signs of Ikea or strappy sandals around only flip flops good food & tastey drinks
The first visit I was impressed by the beer selection
Can't wait to get back for more good beer and great patio weather soon
Yes the martinis will run you $11+ but they are well worth it
They have a great selection of wine $5 on HH the service is always great and the food is tasty
Once it gets later this place totally fills up and people dance drink and have a good time
Place is still a good place to go out to and drink since they have 2 for 1's but I think it'll take more than that if I'm going to spend the whole night there
They seem pretty dedicated to having a good rotating beer selection
Their rotating wines are pretty good as well and I have found that most of the servers do a good job in suggesting a wine to suit your palate
I love the art that goes into brewing beers and I think those large silver shining beauties are amazing
All in all it was a fun time and I really enjoyed the 8th Street beer
I was looking for a place to grab some good food and a couple beers before a concert so I checked out Yelp and it did not lead me astray
The variety of beer on tap the good appetizers the young lady offering free samples of cheese pizza and
Afterward I had a drink at the bar with a friend and once again we received excellent service
i hope it grows into it's space cause the beer is amazing
The server was very slow and never asked us if we wanted refills on drinks forgot an entire appetizer order and had to be found to pay the bill
Mellow Mushroom has an excellent beer selection including several craft brews - including Orange Blossom from Papago Brewing Co
Apparently all appetizers are half off during happy hour too which is great if you get the munchies while drinking
The accompanying wines were very good though they were all served in the same glass
The food was good the service was okay but the experience was slightly hurt by the silverwear and glass problem
Had drinks and appetizer's with my woman here this afternoon
Finally we were served water of which our server asked out drink orders and appetizers
I think the first time I must have really been a good day for them--or perhaps it was the 2 drinks I had This time we had a gluten free pizza and a salad
He was attentive stopped by to fill our drinks often checked to make sure our food was good brought things out all at the same time and was pleasant to deal with
OK so I really just went for the company but I happened to have 2 glasses of wine and a delicious dinner while I was there
Gives off an amazing rose scent and is like drinking liquified roses
The place caters to families the food is always good they have a full bar and this one also has an acceptable tap beer selection
The wine I had was pretty good but they didn't have the one on the menu that I wanted so suggested the wine they'd replaced it with
Our drinks took forever our hummus while very good took forever and the fact that we were so ignored that we never even got silverware made the dinner unbearable
As for the food the wine the event and the company - excellent all the way around
However you can't ignore the fact that they have more beers than you can count and the waitstaff actually knows enough to recommend beers based on what you like
I'm not sure I'd ever head back for a meal but appetizers and beers are a definite go
My recommendation  any kind of wheat beer and the tower of onion rings
on a side note I was so happy to find a local place that has good boba / pearl tea drinks
I stopped in to pick up some fruit some bakery goods and a drink while waiting for the hotel shuttle to come pick me up
The drinks were good Southern Peach gets a thumbs up from me and like everyone said the fish and chips are YUMMO
I recommend Moto Happy Hour to friends all the time for sushi on a budget - the California Spicy Tuna and Spicy Yellowtail rolls are all half-price and you can grab a 20oz beer for $3

My favorite beer is their Epicenter but all the others are good to
Margarita not very good but the Red Wine Sangria was wonderful
We opted to have the farmers feast I had the wine pairing and the wonderfulness began
My reasons for going to Coffee Talk have changed over the past decade but the atmosphere and quality drinks and pastries have not changed
Really thought I'd like this place as it's a good location nice outdoor patio and looks like it could be a fun place to have dinner/drinks with friends
Whether I'm hungry for a salad or a plate of fresh wings to accompany my craft beer the food is really good
If you've got tasty organic beer you've automatically got extra points in my book
We were impressed with the wine suggestions made by our server at dinner
I love how the building is in retro condition the music is fabulous drinks are tasty and potent and the pizzas are really good
Highly recommended for the beer selection and from what I understand didn't experience it a good happy hour
One big problem the wine is not so good
We liked the atmosphere but the wine was not good after the third taste so we decided to take off
Although a little pricey $15 pp sandwich+drink it's worth every penny
I didn't mind sitting outside on the picnic table with some appetizers and beer from Bar Bianco next door good set up in there
Otherwise I'd just stock up on appetizers and drinks next door and call it a night
He made an excellent wine recommendation and helped us choose the apps for our seafood tower
Wine and food aside I can usually overlook shotty service if the atmosphere and food is good enough
The coffee drinks are delicious too and since they're made with Ethiopian coffee the taste is very unique
We sat at the sushi bar and had the following- yellowfin tuna-shrimp -California roll-New Zealand roll-sake SangriaOverall it was a fun and tasty experience
Cute casual Mexican place with good drinks
Servers and hosts everywhere ready to suit any needs whether it's refreshing your wine glass chasing down a particular meat for you or preparing an amazing desert to surprise you for your anniversary thanks again Thomas these guys do it all
you can great an amazing meal their scallops are awesome here just for me it has been for the great patio restaurant bar ambiance for a few apps and drinks before heading out or somewhere for a quick drop in
i don't come often but whenever i've gone it's been just good ol' beer drinking folk and/or the heavily tattooed crowd and not skinny emo hipster tattooed
likegood meat and potatoes food like bangers and mash and englsih beers on tap like bass and such
There fried appetizers are ok and at half price maybe worth it but anything fried after a few drinks tastes good
Drinks there are amazing from the presentation to the taste and definitely the amount of alcohol in each drink
with over 100 beers on tap your pallette is never deprived and the knowledgeable friendly staff that appreciates a good brew
Speaking of which I'm a fan of the kilt lifter but the other beers are good as well
Take a sake shot here and there then drain everything down with a good glass of Saporro
Good wine list nice ambiance I just think some more and better choices on the menu would help
The wings have a little bit of kick but there is a small but good beer selection to cool off the pallet
There was honestly more flavor in my glass of water than in my chalupa
Coffee is excellent from what I can tell- mixed cold drinks are delicious
So if you have kids who like to drink you might have a good time here
I noticed Tommy V's happy hour menu served Monday - Friday from 11am - 630pm a little late in the game it includes a solid variety of $5 wines and discounted appetizers but I plan on returning soon to check that out
The food is fantastic and the beer list is suprisingly delicious as well with breweries such as Dogfish Head
The sides are too awesome in their taste and quality and i suggest the Lobster mash or the Maestros Mash potatoes neither of which will leave you hungry in their own right but often wanting more  Wine selection is great and the atmosphere is top notch but topping it with some of the best servers in town makes this one of my favorites for entertaining
Def worth a stop if you're in the area whether its just for a quick drink before a movie or you're having a full meal
even the taro coconut drink with actual tapioca inside was so good refreshing and mixed perfectly
They are a great addition to the Scottsdale scene chill good beer great food and great bartenders
I ordered the turmeric drink and it was SO GOOD
They had a good happy hour with cheap beer and apps
Ive never been a fan of Teakwoods food but they usually have good drinks specials
Again I'm sure I'm butchering these courses but it's from my hazy wine memory and just trust me they were all good
i love it because i can wear flip-flops a t-shirt jeans sit outside and drink good beer
As we were getting settled in and reviewing the menu which changes seasonally as do the wines the 9-top was receiving their appetizers stuffed mushrooms wrapped in prosciutto served with a taragon cheddar sauce
The chef made great wine recommendations to accompany our dishes
The drink really was the only thing that was a little high priced the pizza and appetizers were VERY reasonable- low even
No Peter Piper does not give away free beer you dunce but if you go to a party here there's a good chance you'll get some for free
Now comes one of the parts that I absolutely hate about eating out other than rude service or incredibly awful food-- is that the two groups that came in and got sat after us actually got their appetizers drinks and meals before we even got our appetizers
I think I would come here if I was in the area and wanted a nice place to get some writing done but it would not be my first thought for a good espresso drink
The staff are incredibly good at keeping your water glass full- a necessity when trying those spicy entrees
The orange sugar coated rims adorn the sweet and flavorful mix of fruit and white wine again wishing that would never end as well
I recommend trying their Inebriator Stout and the Victorian IPA if you like craft beer or your tastebuds could use a wake-up call
The pies take a while to make so now would be a good time to order drinks as well
Good food good beer and the server was excellent
A place that has good microbrew beer and lots of good non-bar food options
Wasn't as good as I expected and drinks were more than you would normally pay at happy hour but they were premium or top shelf like cabo wabo etc and the two drinks I had were so good that they kind of made up for the high price
Total cost for 3 appetizers and 4 drinks $65 without tip
The margaritas and a lot of other drinks come with interesting and tasty accents like wedges of grapefruit and sour gummy worms
The Kilt Lifter is their beer and it's good
Good beer good food good friends and good eye candy
We started with the appetizer canoe and drinks
The drinks were wonderful - I particularly enjoyed my Roy's Island Mai Tai
We looked at the beer list and we were pleasantly surprised at the quality of brews
I got the shark bite drink it was good but not very strong
Grey Goose Martini's - $6Well's - $3Nice House Wine Options I believe $4 or $5Bartender was very pleasant and attentive recommended a pizza dish that was not even on the menu and it was absolutely fabulous for $12 and fed both of us with 2 extra slices leftover
Their selection of Arizona wines will change your mind about the potential for good vino in the desert
Decided to start the night off with a glass of the cabernet they had to offer and my god soooo delicious
Our first course was actually their Sun Devil Cask Ale which was a delicious beer for those who like a hoppy and bitter ale
If you love good beer like I do and want to chill with some friends while playing pool or listening to some live jams though the live music stopped at 9 when i went then check out Boulders on Broadway
It's my one-stop place to shop for a big party or just when I'm itching for a good bottle of wine
The service was good our waiter was very knowledgeable about the wine and beer offerings
The quality and variety of beers try the beer sampler platter they offer especially Kilt Lifter will keep you coming back again and again
Their beer list as well as the prices on the beer are pretty good
Instead our beers appetizer and entrees came out basically all at once
The staff is nice and make pretty good espresso drinks in the times I have
This coffee lab is exactly that; you can see their passion and precision in how many scales and timed instruments the use to exactingly craft a delicious drink
There's so many flavors of drinks in this thing
The only negative is just a pet peeve of mine from my beer snobbery - good beer served in an ice cold glass
Also recommend splitting the $20 bottle of wine
It had a good balance of flavor but again I don't want to be drinking vegetable oil by spoonfuls either you know
All of their cocktail related items are delicious not the sippy kind the shrimpy kind Something to drink
A group of us came here for drinks after First Friday and relaxed on the porch with pints of brew and good company
Anyway their beer selection is good and the food is tasty
The appetizer entree and drinks were pretty good but we had 2 1/2 yard drinks  which made it hard to have the plate right in front of us
$3 for sake and $4 for the vodka  Sake was unfiltered and slightly sweet - we really enjoyed it
Drinks are kinda rough on wallet but I really enjoyed them
every drink I have had have been delicious except one and that is why SideBar lost a star
note to Yelpers make a reservation After the hostess told my boyfriend that he smelled delicious we decided to hit up the bar for a few drinks and admire the floor-to-ceiling memorabilia
The 2x4 jenga the gold fish races the midget bar the little women who runs it is actually a really hot little person the wheel of drinks the plunger all amazing
Tons of options for wine flights which we really enjoyed
This was three huge veal shanks that filled the entire plate with a homeade lingini pasta with ruffled edges like lasagna noodles and this wonderful dark rich tomato/wine flavor sauce that was just amazing by itself
It poured two glasses of medium quality wine
Finally got in to Smash looked like good beer selection although I had the 1/3 lb classic and the vegetable fries carrots and broccoli spears
We each got a beer and enjoyed on of the last cool evenings
I had a IPA which is quite good I the tried their oatmeal stout it tasted water and the malts were a bit too roasted for a beer that lacked body
One odd thing they offer is a Tower  for $21 one would assume it would contain at least two pitches $11 worth of beer however it does not it really has just 1
For $10 you got about 2 glasses worth as they bring out the shaker which was nice
For a place with so much seating I was impressed with their drink specials
This is the place to lounge around on their beautiful patio with a glass of wineor three and amazing small plates
Plus the staff actually know their stuff when it comes to their wines and what to recommend
Pro'sPizza had a great bubbly crustIngredients were freshService was goodGreat wine selection tons of affordable botles Con'sThe menu has no pizza suggestions margarita meat lover whatever just cheese and then you choose your toppings and pay for each
For ladies less inclined to drink beer but want to try something new I'd recommend the white ale
From lightest to darkestKolsch - Light beer good crisp flavor
Beer bread is like a spongy tortilla apparently but the sandwich was tasty so no complaints and hte fries were nice and crunchy
I had a couple of different beers - they were very strong in flavor but I actually prefer MGD on tap over all of these expensive beers
Good flat course on-time start HUGE on-course support fun fans along the course including those offering beer
So as amazing as the shopping experience was I was very glad to have had a chance to discover one of my favorite beers Tatonka Stout
There's a good selection of beers on tap/bottle and there's a special drink/shot for every day of the week
Excellent brew selection beer flights are amazing
While I found the chicken to be overly salty something Terry mentioned to me before ordering the cucumber dipping sauce was good enough to drink
Fun and entertaining place to drink and have a good time
Service was amazing my glass was never empty
Overall if I want a drink and an appetizer in a fun environment I will consider Secreto's if I am in the area
pretty good for apps two drinks and two entrees
The drinks were tasty but served in tiny glasses and way over priced
I was really impressed with SanTan's food and beer
The good  Great music reasonable drinks that are not weak by any means a very diverse crowd the urge to dance the night away only a $6
You really can't walk out of here for under $10 unless you only get an appetizer and drink water
The food is very good the beer is even better and the atmosphere is super-cool
We upgraded our dish to the combo so we ordered fries option we chose which were really good too and had unlimited refills with any drink at the fountain
Awesome drinks for $5 and a small but delicious menu
I have almost always had amazing service at 5th and Wine but had to refrain from giving 5 stars because of the service I have had twice with a specific waitress and sometimes the live music tends to drown out any conversation I would want to have over a glass of wine or dinner
If you can get there for happy hour there are $5 glasses of wines $20 bottles and deals on appetizers
I was pleasantly surprised that Taste of Tops has a great selection of beer and helpful bartenders that make spot on recommendations for what you're in the mood for
My wife had a hard cider that she liked a lot and we also tried a coffee/beer combo that was pretty good
Taste of Tops is a must if you're a fan of good beer
We sat up at the bar to have a couple drinks and some appetizers
At least we had brown rice after all that fried goodness The space is very reminiscent of 5th and Wine in terms of furnishing and decor but slightly darker
The drinks were tasty and strong after 1 mimosa I was gooooood
I ordered the same thing I did last time Bacon Cheeseburger side of fries and a drink to make it a good comparison
We sampled the watermelon beer had a cappuccino which was excellent and got a few salads and sandwiches for lunch
They have good wine and beer at unbeatable prices
Tacos + Shots + Beers + Dancing + Great friends = GOOD TIMES I will be back - if i remember how to get there
Always good to have hot sake with my sushi
On the way upside my girlfriend got the red wine sangria and it was delicious
Their food and drinks are not only really beautiful and unusual they are so amazingly delicious
can be slightly spendy if your on a budget and plan to drink but I always find it to be worth the money
Standard selection of beers including good ol' English standbys like Newcastle and Boddingtons on tap
The pizza salads and dessert are all fantastic they have a pretty good beer selection and the wait at dinner is never more than about an hour
They have a very good selection of beers on tap and a fantastic selection in the coolers-- of which you are allowed to purchase and take home
The Belgian beers are on the pricey side but worth it to your average beer snob
I'm told the beer selection is good although when I tried to order something seasonal they didn't have anything
The drink was super bland no sweetness or mint flavor
Our fourth guest arrived and we ordered our appetizers Calamari and Escargot and ordered a bottle of wine for our meal
The wine is decent but not amazing and it's nice and empty here earlier on in the day
Three stars for the drinks - which were strong and tasty
Despite there being a full bar the bartenders have little knowledge of cocktail recipes - I would recommend ordering beer by the bottle
This restaurant has one of the best wine cellars in town and the right people to lead you in the right direction for a good pairing
The wine selection they have is pretty good and while they do not offer any wine flights they do let you do tasting sized glasses half glasses at half price
the wine was very good and bread before the meal was nice
The menu was pretty basic so it didn't take long to read that which left nothing to do but consider the sound quality for the thirty minutes that we waited for our drink order
There are plenty of wonderful French places Coup des Tartes Sophie's Bistro and much better cheese and wine places Cheuvront so why waste your time dealing with these asses
Both drinks were good with a good amount of booze to non-booze ratio
Now that we know Taco Felix serves good food for good prices we won't hesitate to come back during one of those unusual times - to get a chorizo/egg burrito on the way to an early morning flight to grab a mid-afternoon snack when most other places are closed or to fill our stomachs late one night after a few drinks
The drinks are pretty average with good decor and flat screens on the walls
The food is good the drinks are reasonably priced and the service is amazing
Overall Tapino is really a great wine bar and worth the drive to Scottsdale
Our bill was approx $57 which for three glasses of wine and splitting four plates was pretty good
Drinks were very good and our empanada's as our apps were OK
I would go back just for the friendly staff and crowd with the good food and solid drinks as a bonus
We  got our drinks delivered by another server and asked for the appetizer from her
Pretty cheap beer decent pizza and some good happy hour specials
They offered some good drink specials and all appetizers were half off
But they insisted that they would make it up to us - giving us free drinks free appetizer and a free desert
They also have a good selection of dresses tops and casual stuff like Juicy Couture as well as designer shoes and sunglasses
Another plus is going to the W pool deck to hang out and schmooze post sakeThe food was expensive and good
I had a hard cider that was really good--not too sweet just right--and my friend had a homemade root beer that looked really good too
Drinks arrived and they were super tasty
My sis doesn't drink don't judge every family has a black sheep but our great server Michelle recommended a great drink that didn't contain booze which my sis loved
If you want cheap entertainment go there but don't expect good drinks or food - just good old fashioned people watching
Like all other Yard House's they have a wide selection of beer and great appetizers perfect for sharing
We had a pretty nice evening and then they told me the coupon was no good because it was 1/2 bottle wine night
The good news is they have a wonderful beer selection with many seasonal specials
We enjoyed our glass of champagne and moved on and through our shopping extravaganza
Good service fantastic huge food and reasonable cold beer and margs
My guess is that the name was decided upon after many drinks and shots and somehow sounded good the next day after some aspirin and Gatorade or rather Red Bull
Waiting to order my drinks was not worth the wait
I would rather go to The Parlor ditch the long wait at Bianco sit in their green house patioand still have a great pie with a good glass of wine
Good service especially in Old Town beergaritas drinks and food's ok
But I had too many good times drinking there to hold it against them too much so just don't get the wings and go for a focaccia instead
Similar look bake goods on display on the way in muffins instead of pies and a couple of items on menu same as Coco's Sam Adams Beer Batter Fish n Chips
We had amazing wine and we decided to go with the Big Night Out which is a LOT of food and it takes a good 2 hours to eat your whole meal but it is so fun sitting close to that special someone while having a unique dining experience
---Cappuccinos will be enjoyed in house in their proper glasses
The happy hour is a terrific idea and I might be back just for the $4 appetizers and wine
My only real problem is that parking is limited but you can park down the streets which at times can get to be far away but if you can't walk a block or two for good food and beer then you suck anyways
Overall just a great place to sit and chill and have some good food and great beer
The pluses they have more amazing drinks than what is on the regular menu
The beer was good by Arizona standards
The server was great even though he forgot my daughter's drink and ordered her a cheese quesadilla appetizer and not the kids cheese quesadilla
It's a good thing they give you a big glass of water
The food is cheap and delsihcious and the drinks are a good price too
The reason that I am updating is that they expanded the kitchen remodeled tripled the size of their menu and now include Vietnamese favorites like pho bun and broken rice dishes in addition to the excellent bahn mi sandwiches and the best boba drinks in town
Having just moved to the area I have been searching for a location with quality food and tasty beer options with reasonable happy hour prices
I had the ahi wheat pasta and new moon drink both of which were good and delicious
Our service was excellent -- water glasses remained filled the waiter stopped by often to check on things salad and dinner dishes were removed promptly etc
50 each but the house wine was good at only 2
They have a fairly good selection of wines and alcoholic beverages although their selection isn't as good as AJ's
Have a very light dinner at home or wherever and then you can sit and eat chocolate fondue yumminess and drink good coffee
That being said though it's an excellent spot for a satisfying happy hour and I wouldn't hesitate for a second to order appetizers and drinks here at discounted prices
I asked the waiter what he would recommend he asked what type of beer I like and I said usually the darker ones
he recommended the Franziskaner Dunkel - an unfiltered dark wheat beer dark roasted malt with a smoky roasted grain finish
crunchy and delicious-Dragon rools eel crab and avocadoTop this deliciousness off with octopus nigiri and las vegas rolls washed down with some $5 sake bombers and you've just had yourself a HELL of a happy hour
Happy Hour is always a good time cheap beers and half off appetizers
The iced tea was tasty and refreshing but still sharing a meal with a drink each it should have been less money
I wouldnt recommend this place for anything more than a few drinks before or after an event downtown or as a stop on a pub crawl
Their wine list and menu alone should be enough to intice you into trying this cool new locale out but instead you get the added bonus of a warm and welcoming atmosphere excellent service and a hip
So their drink specials are not worth drinking since it will taste like watered crap
It used to be soo wonderful - being able to find Ballast Point Bear Republic craft beer at our doorstep
The beer was tasty about the only positive thing I remembered
I resisted buying the Guiness-flavored soap yup it's really made with Guiness beer
Generally they have enticing daily specials a good range of drinks to include teas and the same general quality of food as the regular chain restaurant
AND the food was excellent the wine selections were great too
We seemed to be in a miserable mood and was just not coming around enough and was not very good at presenting the food and drinks
Also I know she was not a sommelier but she was not too good at wine recommendations either
I had the toffee coffee drink and it was pretty good
I was really impressed with the decor atmosphere wine list beer selection food and most of all their acts to accommodate children
My Yelp friends know I look for a good wine menu and that influences my rating - they had a great selection for wine lovers and those new to wine
The mango flavoring was faint and there was very little salt on the glass
Great spot for a late-afternoon glass of wine with an appetizer
Drinks came out immediately and were all delicious
So Saturday night we pull up to this little spot in Scottsdale to meet up with the rest of the crew and sit and have a drink - I ask the bartender give me your best 2 tacos - so I get the carne asada and the mahi mahi- The carne asada was delicious it was tender spicy and just melted in your mouth- i instantly gobbled that one up right away- The girl sitting next to me advised me that the mahi mahi was the best she has ever tried at the restaurant
We started off with some Thai beers trying out a couple of recommendations and a variety of starters
Sure I just got a Chai tea as usual; my only drink but it was amazing
I think this is a good place to go for drinks or to watch baseball or basketball
so we ordered the artichokessoaked in a lemon-basil olive oil--tender a bit greasy the foie grascrispy with smoky-sauteed mushrooms and sweet cubed apple the clamsAMAZING--only slightly spicy with a kick of lime and cilantro nice and buttery with a hint of white wine and the butternut squash raviolia bit of a letdown--the squash filling needs FLAVOR--more sweetness more spice something
they were amazing with the Bordeaux Laborywhich was a very good wine indeed--not intense but with strong flavors of lead which were absorbed and weakened by the thick chocolate of the S'mores
While the drink was amazing what was even better was the quality of their boba they weren't too hard or squishy and they had the perfect taste
The drink we got a hibiscus margarita was as good as the other reviews claim - $ 8 for about a 4 oz drink
Happy Hour is also great - several good food and drink specials
For $6 I thoroughly enjoyed my burger wings and drink combo
In between the great hours drink specials and tasty pizza I will probably be back
After all it IS a good place to day drink
But he's good at it the food is relatively decent the house wines are serviceable and prices reasonable
I am a big fan of any place with a good beer selection but it doesn't look like I'll be going back to the Orange Table any time soon which is a bummer
So minus one star for the happy hour specials lack of beer choices  and the pretentiousness and the rest is all good
Which means LOTS of sunblock and you will need drinking water and if you can bring TP that might be a good idea too
The chrysanthemum tea is excellent and I recommend their bar if you're looking for a decent drink at a modest price
The wine selection was limited however everything we tasted was excellent
The service was really good they refilled our drinks and waters pretty often and helped us make our choices
A wide selection of choice meats smoked on site delicious sides home-made root beer and lemonade and a yard for the kids to play in make you feel like it's Sunday at Grandma's house
The pork empanadas are a must and the happy hour drinks were very good as well
Not only have they started serving wonderful Cartel Coffee from down the street but they are finally serving beer and wine too and while the beer selection is not huge the choices do not disappoint
The service atmosphere wine and food were all pretty good
He took drink orders and recommended 2 appetizer specials  Eggplant rollatini and Oysters with spinach ricotta and bay shrimp in an alfredo sauce
A few good bottled beers in their repertoire
Not conservative with drinks and the food was pretty tasty
I don't recommend coming here for the food especially if you're vegetarian but it is a nice place to enjoy a beer and hang out in a fun western environment
I recommend coming here after hiking the Peak or in the afternoon/evening to enjoy a beer and their lovely patio
The market features gourmet goodies kitchen accessories magazines wine and wine stuff even toys for kids and pets
Oh and the beer choices doesn't hurt towards a good review
BTW pasties are HUGE but never the less I managed to put one down with one of their delicious beer
They have some great wines in their selection and the drinks like the sangria are usually pretty amazing
com/food-wine/flavors-of-the-west/bringing-bison-back-00400000019838/Try adding it to your menu
The atmosphere and decor are pleasant and what I would expect when paying for such expensive drinks though they are worth every penny
After getting settle in our room my wife and I went down for a drink at the bar which is well stocked with a decent selection of top shelf liquors the drinks are in my opinion a bit over priced but good none the less
If good food and fair prices are your thing eat first drink first buy a group and spend $5
They recommended a smooth Italian red wine for us I think it was a sirah
Decent drink specials along with a menu of tasty appetizers
We bypassed the apps ordered Thai iced teas pretty good and made in-house as the glasses arrived with the tea & milk liquids just starting to intermingle a chicken/lemongrass bowl reported as refreshing and the beef stew tasty but tougher than I expected
Quality coffee drinks made so you can taste the coffee
Once an employee fits in they can be counted on to give you great personalized service and high quality coffee drinks
After getting our drinks we ordered some guacamole and chips as our appetizer
Some wineries and breweries were represented and one highlight was Mary Edwards with a very good Russian River Valley Pinot Noir conveniently located near all the Salmon
Live music and good wine helped round out our dining experience
We started with some wine I cant remember the name I ordered but it was a great flavor
I was not ready for the hospitality and amazingly delicious food/wine served to us by Tanzy
Even though we skipped appetizers any of the wines she didn't treat us any different
I know how good that inferno sauce is ;Turns out the owners opened a new place recently for American food wine and rock-and-roll Rhythm and Wine
Start to finish- five star resort service and food and I would know that's what I grew up dining on-So to start- beautiful decor huge wine selection higher end price wise but not bad at all for the quality and the menu
TurboDog is frighteningly dark-looking without the heavy dark beer taste think Amberbock if it was actually a good beer
From 3 - 7 they offer 1/2 off a small menu of appetizers sushi rolls pizzas and drinks
Sens also delivers great flavor in their drinks
Each wine is well represented with a label in front of them explaining the type of wine character and quality of the wine you are viewing
We wanted to return to experience a good meal and drinks in a good atmosphere
We spent 3 hours there and did not once feel as though we were being pressured to move on with our orders for drinks appetizer dinner and dessert
Most of their prices are pretty good but they have a couple of high prices hidden in there like a bottle of wine that goes for around $6
My Mom is a fan of the Coppola's wine and I described the flavors she liked
Easy walkable access to food and drinks before or after a game is just good thinking
Everyone else at my table enjoyed there food and the wings looked very good but after trying that chicken I won't be ordering anything but wings and beer
The drink prices were competitive & the staff was amazing
So not only is the beer pretty grand and the atmosphere lovely well only when it's not crowded - I like to go on weeknights but the grilled cheese and tomato soup is amazing
They serve at least 2 Korean beers OB & Cass and they're both worth trying out and each goes well with the food
I've been here for drinks and appetizers with friends before and finally returned for a dinner date
Speaking of cocktails they have a fantastic wine list selection of craft beers and I enjoyed a delicious vodka lemonade
It is my go-to place in Westgate for some good beer and delicious food
We had fantastic service I loved the proprietary wine selection the pinot noir was especially good and the food was delicious
Let me back up for a moment and say that they have a really good wine selection
We explained that we WEREN'T in a hurry and that we would probably have a few beers and ordered an appetizer and an entree
The beers took a while to come out and the appetizer came out shortly after
But a few bites into the appetizer the sandwich comes out and we've barely gotten into the app let alone we've hardly had a chance to touch our drinks
Drinks were poured just right and my girlfriend who's a sommelier was impressed with their wine selection
Come before six and drinks are half off and they serve little mini steak sandwhiches which are very good
The deal is you pay 5$ and get three drinks a 'hydrating' aloe mango drink which tasted pretty good an 'energizing and calorie burning' tea which was also pretty good and a 'filling but only 200 calorie' smoothie which tasted kind of like it came from a powder
So overall it was ok it just takes longer than I would normally want to wait to get a drink and the smoothie was not so good
Our bill was $55 for three sandwiches and one beer which wasn't too bad considering the quality of the food and the portion size
The the happy hour menu is full of delicious options the prices are fantastic and they also offer all of their wines by the glass for $5
The store has a good selection of wines as well - it's small but well stocked
The sangria was good more wine tasting than some sangrias
Yes the tables have glass tops and the place is a run down re-purposed looking space that obviously had seen better days but the food is worth the compromise
Really enjoyed the black sole with bone chips kumamotos with uni hamachi foie kimchi squash blossoms housemade cocktail with lemongrass and ginger tetaki with beets and my favorite beer Kohishikari sp
The power of a good burger and beer got to me
You can stuff yourself with some pretty tasty appetizers and sushi rolls or sake bomb the work day away for some wallet welcoming prices
-Good kim chi sold by the restaurant/fresh foods stand just inside the store in what would usually be a deli section-Decent foreign beer selection especially Russian beers
If you've had Thai iced coffee you can't wait to get the sweet milky goodness all mixed up to drink
They have a good beer selection one you would expect from an Irish pub
My girlfriends and I wanted to hit up somewhere close to home for some good food and drink
We enjoyed a bottle of wine some apps salad and wedding cake
Tab for two people for dinner and two drinks each was $70 too high for the mediocre quality of the food
If you are looking for something to do on a Friday or Saturday night I highly recommend taking a group of friends or a date and having a drink at Hanny's
The food is as amazing as the service and I highly recommend getting a corn pup with mustard NEVER ketchup and an Aiko dog with beer hot or as I am trying to get it renamed the Baiko
Good pilsener that almost pops in your mouthPBR - $2 I don't actually like this beer but it's $2
Way too spicy and not good spicy it's damn take this away spicy-Drinks - half the size of the ones at Fuego Bistro no good
Shame on me for expecting a good mixed drink at a sushi place but it was like 100 degrees and I just wanted a mojito
They have homemade root beer which is very tasty and leaves a smooth and flavorful aftertaste
We order up a bunch of apps and whatever bottles of wine the bartender recommends
Since the boyfriend doesn't drink he ordered food I sampled appetizers and wine
I love their food and tasty drinks but I would love them even more if it didn't take 15 plus minutes to be greeted and/or have a drink order taken after sitting down
I'm not a coffee drinker but do enjoy a good chai latte now and then
Went to the Vig for after dinner drinks the other night and I had a really good time
The beer is still ice cold and although they changed their prices recently they were super low for their re-model/re-opening thing they are still really good for happy hour
too bad as well since they have great variety of real tequilas and decent prices for good mexican beer like Bohemia and Negra Modelo
The champagne was tasty but the first couple of glasses were room temperature
If you're not into glorified Hot Pockets try one of their fresh-baked pastries with a drink off of their wonderful gourmet beverage menu including Caramel French Vanilla Coffee or Hot Chocolate Latte
The prices are really good for their drinks and the pours in the mixed drinks are generous
It is a fun little place with a large selection of wines at good prices
What really works about this place is that the food is as good as the wine you can order
You can stop by for a good late night bite and eat/drink stuff that you'd normally have to open a vein to pay for
We ordered a bottle of wine the brie pear & onion jam bruschetta appetizer and a grilled chicken panini sandwich
Excellent selection of micro beers from around the country and I have always found everything to be fresh and tasty
The happy hour was made better by their wonderful wine selection
Service is quite good as glasses with water and menu were handed as we take our seats
The service was good the atmosphere was good and it looks like they have a very eclectic beer list
To drink we all got the honey lemonade which was so simple but really excellent and comes with a free refill
For  not much I got a drink  plus a bean cheese and rice burrito with a fire roasted chicken leg and a chicken taco that were tasty and filling
Overall good quality food OK quality drink decent value for your money
Their mixed drinks menu is average although the Retro Cooler and the White Rabbit are worth mentioning as standouts
Both are tasty and guaranteed crowd-pleasers unless the drinker in question prefers alcohol-forward drinks or classic simple cocktails
Overall the food and drinks were very tasty and definitely worth going back for
It's only spendy because you want to do it up - appetizers drinks meals desert coffee
I'm not a frequent drinker but this will definitely be my go to purveyor when the need for fermented deliciousness arises
For beer I recommend trying the Kiltlifer
Its usually crowded but good food and beer tend to do that to a restaurant and the wait is comparatively short for a table
This place is quaint and friendly with a great variety of drinks and interesting appetizers both meat and vegetarian
The staff is wonderful great selection of drinks but the food is just
we've done D&B several times now and though it's been enjoyable it's always fun with good friends with drinks and games I find that it is a waste of $ and their food isn't even worth going in for dinner
I enjoyed some really cool beers amazing fries and I think the best steak sandwhich this side of Philly
The beers were good and the patio was cool
We weren't sure about the wine so the server brought us a taste - it was a delicious Wild Rock Pinot from New Zealand
They have great appetizers and one of the absolute best soft drinks which is an authentic beverage made of soda water lime juice ice and simple syrup
I've had better but Steve's still has really good drinks
We were informed we came during happy hour really cheap and very small portions of appetizers and cheap bottles of beer
And while we did get some good food while we were there it wasn't worth the ticket price but if the beer we drank was free then it could have worked
Wine selection is not good---when Mirasou is on the wine menu at such an upscale restaurant you have to wonder---at least I did
The Oggie was the favorite because once you added that red wine gravy to it the flavors just kinda
The Matador is a drink that seems to be unbeaten by any other place in town its a delicious mixture of cocoa and cinammon that is to die for
I recommend--not just for the show but for taste--the La Flama Blanca drink see my photo
Not as much of a table-side to show to the Old Fashioned but another tasty drink nonetheless
Half price drinks appetizers & house maki get the chicken gyoza - you're welcome in advance
They also have a not too shabby liquor and mixing beverage section every kind of beer or ale you can think of and all kinds of miscellanious beverage paraphernalia/implements and other goods
Throughout our meal my husband harassed the waitress for different selections of wine -- but she was a good sport
Highly recommend for atomsphere drinks and food
For Mill Avenue this is a premium spot for someone a bit older who is looking to get a few drinks and a decent quality meal
Plus the patrons are usually friendly beer people so you can strike up a good conversation
I feel like I'm 80 just saying it but the acoustics of the place are horrible and you have to yell to others in your party during prime time when the place is busy4 - food comes out fast but I have no idea why you have to wait 10 minutes for another beer or diet cokeLast night I had the short rib over creamy polenta and it was amazingly awesome
Their handmade root beer is so good it tastes like the old-time A&W root beer something special about it
Wanting a bottle of wine we asked our server for some recommendations
We asked our server about the St Michelle if he liked it and he said no he didn't like it but recommended it since we were looking at Washington wines
We were discussing what sounded good on the entru00e9e menu when our server came over to refill our wine glasses
We really enjoyed grabbing a drink down there and when they opened the doors around 6ish it was still really warm
Absolutely amazing and one beer I actually  grew a craving for
If you're looking for a sweet but dry dark beer try the Oatmeal Stout it's amazing as well
Not the most comfortable but I can see how meeting up with some friends and having some drinks can be a good time
We ordered our drinks and appetizer approximately 15 minutes later my beer showed up after I had to ask the waiter for it again
One of the $5 wines is a very good Albarino which qualifies as an exceptional bargain in my book
So they brought us out some wine from one of our bottles pinot grigio and it was good
I would not consider this Mexican food but they sure do make a delicious tortilla and a yummy margarita that comes with a shaker to top off your glass throughout your meal
He was amazingly knowledgeable regarding the food and the wine
Thought I was off to a good start getting new glasses
This place is not cheap but the quality of the food and drinks make for  good value in my opinion
I picked up one of each to add to the wine rack and was pleasantly surprised later to hear from friends that the two bottles were quite tasty
Tasty - although my colleagues kept teasy me about drinking a beer
They also have a good selection of drinks to go with your lunch
I love 5th during the week for a tasty lunch the egg Sandwhich or an evening where I can drink wine and have the Pesto pasta
Francis experience includes great atmosphere an extensive drink menu and wonderful food options
We ordered our drinks and the grilled cheese and tomato soup appetizers
I had a glass of their house white wine and enjoyed chatting it up with my friends and checking out the art and live performances
But I'm really picky about my drinks and hardly anyone makes a good margarita
I would love to come sit at the bar - have some drinks and the calamari which I hear is really good and take in some cool music
It made for a nice picture setting Although we didnt spend much time in the room since we were out exploring the city and all it has to offer we did enjoy the continental breakfast the hotel had in their beer and wine bar before heading out to Camelback Ranch for some Dodgers action  Breakfast was pretty good considering it offered more than the average amenities most hotels offer for free
I tried other drinks in the group and they were all good
i ordered another red wine flight server's choice and his selections were excellent again
Some of best tacos I've had came with a cold beer in hand while enjoying a beautiful day with good friends
I sat on their beautiful relaxing patio with a book glass of the Pinot Black amazing and 3 scrumptious bruschetta
Anyway I text my friends that I was right about Bomberos and they came to meet me for more wine and an amazing cheese plate
They have a thai beer in a large bottle that is pretty good
Its not a bar scene but more of a place to go and get drinks with good friends
After I figured before I hop onto the light rail back to my vehicle I'd stop in here for a beer a fellow co-worker recommended this place to me
If you're looking for a good ol boys pizza place with pitchers of beer  unlimited amount of soda dark wood and dart boards
I sat by myself ordered a glass or two or three of pinot gris and enjoyed myself while watching European soccer
To be honest we have these dinners mainly to visit and have fun with each other so the food is only secondary and for just having a great evening out enjoying wine good food and conversation this place was perfect
Wine Styles is a national wine boutique but it has a wonderfully intimate and personalized feel - not something you would expect from a franchise
Furthermore you can learn a lot about the wine's notes and flavors as well as suggested pairings simple by reading the descriptions posted by the bottles
As mentioned wines are separated here by flavor not by region
The appetizers at the wine bar next door are fantastic
My husband has been more adventurous and has ordered some of the other more interesting drinks and they're usually pretty good
The juice is fresh squeezed they make delicious mixed drinks and even more delicious espresso drinks plus they have an unusual selection of beer
If you are a first timer and hit up OT for breakfast the Mexican Chocolate Latte drink is amazing
The burger that has wine plus manchego cheese is amazing
It was a cherry sparkling wine  and tasted amazing with chocolate
His knowledge of wine was very good and he made excellent recommendations for the dish that I had selected
Drinks    A     Excellent wine knowledge and service technique was                         displayed by the waiter coupled with a good selection                        makes this a great place to enjoy wine Service   A     Good service as explained above *Ramsay Test  Chef Gordon Ramsay says that if you are going to make and serve a simple dish it needs to be executed with perfection
I had the Beet Salad and Diver Scallops for dinner and a glass of white wine unfortunately I just missed the Happy Hour but my food was pretty good as was the service
Good clean fun cold beer and good food - very hard to argue with
bread & olive oil and cheese or cheese and meats some bruschetta AND interesting wine information it's quite a good deal
Yes it's a cheap place to see good bands but I'll make sure to do my eating and drinking beforehand and bring a warm jacket
My friend had a pineapple margarita and then a glass of the Alaskan Amber Ale on tap good damn beer and  I had a mango and a chipotle pineapple margarita
I'd consider returning to El Chorro for brunch or lunch or drinks or just picking up sticky buns to go sometime but I wouldn't recommend it for dinner
Their happy hour is a noteworthy event in the summer they have $4 wine coolers that are addictive wine dash of liquor soda and fruit and a select menu of half off goodies
It's one of those places where the food and drink menu are both sooooooo long that they kitchen and bar probably have a tough time turning out good stuff conssitently
- was in a good sized wine glass filled to the brim and I think it had some mint or basil in it
He spent a good deal of the time ignoring me; I was constantly having to ask him for things I shouldn't have to ask for--such as a fork or a drink
Big Kahuna Cab/Shiraz Mix Wine - it costs three dollars and it is good
the drinks ARE cheap and strong the food is actually delicious
Sure they have a wide selection of products with some high quality wines here and there
After a $60 bill for three -- appetizer one espresso one bottled beer and three entrees -- we had to eat again at Denny's a few hours later since they were essentially the only other people still serving food in the area at that hour
The room also had a really good-sized patio for lounging smoking a cigar listening to music there's a really loud stereo hidden away in the recessed cabinets in the living room with speakers throughout the suite and drinking wine
Really this rating is completely based on service and maybe I should give it 2 stars as their drinks are very good but that's about it
Great drinks great drinks and good looking women behind the bar
That said the drinks were good and  probably why so many died-hards were hanging out drinking on a really cold damp Sunday afternoon
TFK has a good beer offering with an organic porter that tastes heavenly
I think they had more appetizers and dessert on their menu than wine
The wine was a good choice and reasonably priced
Potent well made drinks and delicious noshes from Elements can be found here
The service is generally good however and I like it a lot better now that they serve San Miguel Beer
The option to pick up wine at the Public Market next door and have the already reasonable corkage fee waived was a bonus as we had really enjoyed a couple of the Arizona Stronghold wines at a recent FnB wine pairing and thought they would pair well with the Jamaican heat
Drinks were pretty darn good too - loved the Pom Martini
It's a hot spot in Scottsdale see if you can make reservations but a drink at the bar and some rolls would be all good too
Oh and they have a very good beer selection - lots of local brews
Top it off with some wine and good company and a girl is very happy
I don't know enough about sake to know what the heck anything is but I do know a good martini when I see one
I've had a good experience with the food and the drinks and I still think it is a cool hip space but I find the service issues so disruptive that the Duce has dropped to my in a pinch can't think of anyplace else to go with a group list which is a bummer because if this issue were corrected it could be a great hangout
My beer buddy had the Sunshine from New Belgium also good
So my friend and I chatted enjoyed our beers and gazed lovingly at the refrigerated shelves of beer mecca
Though I really only go here because it's on the way home from other bars I frequent it doesn't dissapoint as a good last-drink stop
The food was AMAZING the drinks were strong and the service was fine aka busy
Lots of HDTV's and a good selection of beers on tap
Good place for upscale bar food and a cold beer while watching a game
5 starsDrinks 3 starsCleanliness -2 starsActual quality of people in the place -4 stars*FYI I never give negative stars but there are just no true ratings for what I experienced in that place
Amazing specialty drinks and the food is very good as well
The baked goat cheese app the reasonably priced drinks and corn polenta to die for its simple clean delicious eating
We shared a very flavorful hangar steak and some nice wines
I ordered a dirty martini to drink very good and the grilled chicken breast entree for dinner
I cannot say anything bad about the wait staff because our waiter was awesome he was attentive and gave me a great wine recommendation for both an appetizer and the main course had the same wine as Gabi after reading her review
I cant even get a $5 glass of good wine in small-town Payson for that price
The Jukebox has some good tunes the drinks are stiff and the pool is free
not to badly priced There beerbatered cheese is amazing on the pizza
If there were just a couple of fixes to the factors in that equation preferably the quality of food and the presence of pre-game drink specials it might become my venue of choice before a game
I'll be back it's a nice place to meet up with a couple of people for some good burgers and beer
The cup it came in was cheap and didn't keep the drink cold like its intended purpose but above all else it didn't taste good either
The beer was pretty good and reasonably priced at $4/pint
I recommend the Pescado Guerrero - a wood-grilled tender mahi-mahi steak with fresh shrimp scallops mushrooms spinach roasted peppers and sliced avocado in a white wine sauce
Even though we only had about a half hour the waitress made a couple spot-on recommendations Beef Stroganoff & Pork Chop - and after checking in on yelp we even got a free glass of house wine
Very good but if memory serves correctly you won't find any drink options for less than $2
This place isn't much to look at just lot's of concrete and a large number of TVs but it does serve good beer at good prices and is a great place to watch sports
I've also had fine experiences with the wine and tiramasu they have that can make a family or friendly gathering at a suburban chain a good time
I must say  that the happy hour was already started around 3pm forgot what hours they were good from but I believe you get a discount on the apps and beers were cheap like $2
It takes a good while for the food to come out and we don't really get much drink service in the meantime
If you order Kirin beer you can have an appetizer for one a dollar
This is a great way to stretch your budget especially when dining with friends where a few beer and appetizer orders can take care of appetizers for the table and ultimately pare down the amount and hence cost of the sushi order
I find this is a great place for groups since everyone can find something to like the atmosphere is wonderful especially in the cooler months and the food and drink is always good
The ranchera spinach was fresh tasting but didn't have too much flavor; the mole was good but the sauce needed to simmer longer to help smooth out the flavors and the Veracruz style with a tomatillo sauce and cotija cheese was excellent with gooey cheese and nice chunks of chicken and plenty of spinach all rolled in what seemed to be a housemade fresh corn tortilla all this plus soft drinks and 20+ percent tip for only $18 a piece can't be beat for the price in the area
Everything tastes super fresh and there are interesting flavor combinations all across the menu from the drinks to the chunky guacamole to the imaginative entrees
Both were dressed with olive oil and adorned with pickles and olives were wishing for a glass of wine to compliment the appetizers but they serve no liquor here
Once Sunday hits I just want to sit back enjoy a couple beers and a couple good games
Sunday is a special day for all those people that want to get out and enjoy some good food and drinks and hopefully some good games
Rico's has a great happy hour from 3-7 everyday in the bar area with drink specials and half off appetizers from the bar menu
That said the drink prices are good especially during happy hour the location is awesome and nothing beats sitting outside at Casey's on a nice afternoon/night
Happy hour is definitely worth hitting as the pricing per pint for one of the nice selection of beers was nice especially being in this portion of Phoenix where just to be close to the Biltmore costs more
The service has been consistently good so far the beer cold and the food tasty
The have some great appetizers and mixed drinks in pineapples as well
If you're looking for a place for drinks this is the place to go haven't been to a brewery restaurant like this before and it's amazing
We're also opening up a rock lounge next door called Copper Blues with over 60 beers on tap and a stage bar featuring the hottest bands and DJs plus a delicious menu created from our stone hearth oven
Keep up the good work that is served with a smile great beer and food with lasting memories
The boyfriend was impressed with the beers on tap and happy watching three games at once in HD
The service is wonderful excellent decor strong drink what else could one ask for
If your a glutten for good food can stomach dropping $65 pre drink for dinner and want to walk away with your belt buckle popping the tasting menu is a must
With never empty glasses of wine  My FavsSweet Corn RisottoScallops cooked to perfection with a parsnip puree mmmmmmmmAlaskan King SalmonCenter Cut Filet MignonBrussel Sprouts yes Brussel Sprouts Tempura battered with a sweet relish AMAZING4 hour braised beef short rib Talk about melt in your mouth  Red Velvet Bread Pudding I will go back just for this anytime I am near the QuarterI can't wait to go back to Tanzy for a full meal but I don't know how I will be able to top this evening of amazing food
Oregano's is always a great spot to meet up for drinks and excellent food
Its a good place to watch the game and get a beer
I've also recently discovered that they now have Boba drinks which are priced very reasonably and have flavors that I've never tried before
Here are the top three reasons why Sens is a kick-ass experience every time *The drinks are just good
My glass of Sauvignon Blanc hit the spot with my spicy meal the saketini with fruit flavors was good without being too sweet and the Spicy Mama never failts to disappoint
Before the tip including the margarita and soft drinks around and with the appetizer comped the after tax was a very reasonable $77
They serve up surprisingly good margs here and have quite a few options for beer
The wine selection however  is good there should be no problem finding something you likeTo boil it down we have a decent meal with a good wine selection in a super trendy place to eat
Excellent service they also had a wonderful Reisling by the glass -- hard to come by streamlined upscale surroundings -- all in all a terrific dining experience
I mainly went there for the free appetizers and sat at the bar and talked to Pamela while she served me yummy sweet drinks
My friend and I hit this place hoping for another good bar with great local beers
Another friend recommended this place and it was a nice spot for a cheap drink and decent food
Great wine selection and the staff is extremely helpful if you have any questions or need a recommendation
He delivered the fine red wine we ordered like a master sommelier and took our requests for appetizers patiently
Still we had a great time excellent service and some good food and wine
Whether it's the $5ish lunch special that includes a drink and a HUGE slice of pie or a delicious small this place has got the goods
My review pertains to this experience which included drinks and appetizers
Sushi bar Starbucks thanks for not helping my addiction wine concierge lots and lots of cheese amazing fresh bread stand etc
They also have 6 non-alcholic ice creams for those that want to bring their kids along but don't expect a good treatment from the lady behind the counter because she's too afraid that their glass decorations might get knocked off from the shelves
Our waitress comes takes our drink order gets it perfect drinks taste amazing all in the span of three or so minutes
Prices were really good and they had some good drink specials
The reception is warm and the wine selection excellent
My husband and I each ordered the wine tasting & appetizer
Chicken steak fish and shrimp all surrounding a bubbling green sauce that's so good you want to drink it
If you like good beer good food and good times this is the bar/lounge/restaurant for you
- As noted above we had a Groupon with a value of approx $175 which included 4 drinks 2 appetizers 4 entrees and 1 dessert
What i was impressed with the most was the selection of beer that they have
During happy hour all drinks were half off making a delicious brew of Rouge hazelnut brown an amazing $3
My recommendation is to try this place for happy hour and try a couple of appetizers off the menu with a tasty craft beer
They had a pretty good craft brew & import beer list both on tap and in bottles
We each ordered the iced tea to drink and were served a passion fruit-flavored tea that I thought was very good but beware if you're a fan of regular plain iced tea and think that's what you're ordering Adam Carolla would have been pissed
I've never tried the food but have had good service when trying to get a drink
So left Margaritaville and went to the yard house for drinks and hung out there for about three hours and enjoyed pizza during reverse happy hour
I'm sure there other coffee drinks are delicious and maybe if they run out of Mexican Mocha I will try one
Famous SamsThis bar is a traditional sports bar so if you're looking to have a quick beer or shoot a game of pool this is just as good as any
However if you're looking for a good spot to grab and beer and a meal w/a buddy you might skip this establishment
5-6pm is free sangria all you can drink wine along with appetizers
We had no difficulty choosing a wine from the excellent wine list
The place was mostly dead which was good so we wouldn't have to fight a crowd for drinks and a place to sit
The Sunday brunch comes with a chocolate fountain for goodness sakes a fad that should have died a merciful death about ten years ago
We asked for a recommendation on the wine and the waitress didn't try to gouge us
Our server Eric made our night special with meal and wine recommendations for our group of 6
It has a nice coffee bar and what looked like to be a pretty good selection of drinks
I can't even remember what I ordered though other than the delicious sweet potato fries POh they also have bottled root beer there too
I haven't actually been to the Happy Hour here yet but I know that the prices are fair and I've had a few of the drinks with dinner before so I know those are delicious as well
Great food good portions and affordable drinks
Anthony the brewmaster knows his craft and is creating some delicious beers
For those that are used to drinking cheap light beer this a good seg-way into a craft beer
The food is above average the drinks are pretty good
Here's the thing I'm willing to spend money for a good glass of wine
I ordered the scallops which were delicious and went perfectly with the bottles of white wine
In fact whenever I go to Arizona it slips into my mind that I need to drink a crawler's worth of it minutes when entering the city limits
Good house wine by the carafe we had the French Merlot
The pizza crust has a great contrast of crunch as well as chewiness which reminds me of the crust at Mozza in LA but it does not have the complexity in flavor of Chris Bianco's
They also have a good variety in the cooler ready to drink
The only thing I could recommend to them would be to double the size of your craft beer selection and I would come here instead of Total Wines
Beer prices are good but the call liquor is outrageous
Thank goodness Total Wine and More was holding its grand opening w/ a penny wine-tasting
Pop the Soda shop has introduced me to so many amazing drinks that I actually crave and can only find at Pop's
They have a good selection of wine and beer
We had a good time had some apps and a few drinks and the time flew by
The food is pretty good but honestly after a round of 18 anything's goods and there's probably fewer things in life that make me happier than drinking a cold draft from an ice cold mug that you can actually see vapor swirls coming off of after a long round of golf
Fun Saturday night music venue with good food & beer for only a few $
Good service Great Food Outstanding Beer selection
My recommendation is to go late night after the bar and have another drink with a great burger and fries
Not much of a menu for food or for drinks but a good place to hang out and lots of space for larger groups
The service is good- drinks were always refilled etc
If you decide to order the Collard Greens make sure that Tip is working because she prepares them proper with bits of swine for flavor as well as a bit of vinegar
I was a fan of the ice coffee with mint in it but I wouldn't recommend it to people who usually drink super sweet coffee beverages
With good drink deals $5 martinis $6 wines and good beer deals as well as $4 fondue for cheese or chocolate this really is a great first date place
The Drinks Good prices even outside of happy hour
I highly recommend a glass of the Manos Negras
Hava Java is a really nicely located locally owned coffee shop that makes superb coffee and coffee drinks provides great pastries and bagels and is staffed by friendly helpful good looking staff
Where else can four adults and two children start with miso soup and crab salad eat a gorgeous platter of sashimi a tempura appetizer sushi until they are filled and a scoop of ice cream PLUS have sodas and wine for $121 pre tip
What a pleasure to sit outside and enjoy wine and live music from David Axis of Ebel E and to hang with a good sized group of yelpers
I guess the only caveat is we never have a to-go box of the delicious food to take home ; Also if you like wine the owner has other bottles that aren't on his list and he prices them well
Had good chips/salsa took a few minutes to get our drinks then once we ordered food was out in maybe 15 minutes at the most
I love that they have Kona beers especially because not many places have the Koko brown on tap which is just too delicious to not try if you're a fan of coconut and beer
Ruth Chris why does your food have to be so average and underwhelmingThe restaurant is very nice inside and they have a great outdoor patio for drinks when it is nice outIf you go ask for Bruce he is the best server that I can remember having for any restaurant - was exceptional and I dine out at many high end placesHaving not been to a Ruth Chris in 4 or 5 years it was time to give it another shot i remembered the food being very average and being underwhelmed by the steak which was the case again - The steaks were cooked correctly I feel their steaks are bland especially compared to other chains like MasterosThe desserts were very good and the highlight for us both the sin cake very dark chocolatey and the bread pudding with raisensWon't be going back however the location and the service are fantastic so if you do enjoy Ruth Chris steaks you will be happy here - go see Bruce and he will make sure you have a fantasic time as we did even though the food wasn't up to our level of expectation
The fries themselves are really high quality - texture of beer battered fries with seasoning so it's crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside
Three stars for good drinks and really hot strippers
THE GOOD--large but not daunting wine list with excellent selections--Riedel crystal including the beautiful decanters--barman extremely knowledgeable flawless execution in every respect--_REAL_ Luxardo Marasche cherries imported from Italy for your Knob Creek Dubonnet Manhattan
- good drinks of course- local music performed on friday nights- drive-thru- free wificons- it's always a little chilly must come prepared with jacket
Don't get me wrong the pizza was solid had a tasty House Special and the beer specials rock local brews half off on weekends but I would never chose this over local staples like Oregano's or Nello's for good pie and beer
I orderedLocal Organic Greens Chinese Long Beans Toasted Nori Soy Sesame Vinaigrette $10Pan Roasted Free Range Chicken Garlic Mashed Potatoes Chinese Broccoli Lemongrass Pan Jus $28Glass of Orin Swift Prisoner Red Blend Zinfandel Napa $17The Organic Greens were very tasty
They play great music have good service and oh did I mention a beer tap at your table
The wine pairings were very good as well
Take your time and enjoy your servers recommendations and fine wine list
Tried the sheppard's pie and had a beer with it really good too
If you add fries and get a milkshake or beer your talking a $25 meal for a hamburger thats not that good
We just wanted to get a few appetizers and a few drinks
The HH menu is half off all the appetizers on the main menu and half off all alcoholic beverages including wine beer and the umbrella drinks
I ordered the tacos vivos recommendation from the lovely knowledgeable girl working there I also got an abundance drink which was made to perfection
Lots of nice big TVs yummy wings good drink specials w/ a great range of beers on draft though the two don't typically intersect so I was drinking $3 Mirror Pond Ale from a bottle poured into an icy pint glass enthusiastic if somewhat homer crowd I guess I just insulted myself
The drinks were good and seemed well mixed
There is something so great about Wine and small plates shared between friends over good conversation and laughter
Cold beer good friends warm sun and boys playing volleyball in the back court although it troubles me to see so many of them playing barefoot in what amounts to an oversized ashtray
They actually have some pretty good drinks for adults too
I ended up ordering another glass of wine don't remember the name and it was pretty good
Oh the beer Xingu Brazilian is like a sweeter Guiness delicious
We split a glass of wine recommendation by Bernadette stellar; the arugula and endive salad great esp for hot weather; and the daily risotto which was super good english peas ham marscapone pecorino romano and then because Susie couldn't resist topped it off with a creme brulee
wait which we spent in the bar w/ a good glass of wine
Both mornings we waited a good 10 min for anyone to take a drink order and another 10 min before we actually received our overpriced cups of coffee
Three rounds of drinks plus everyone ordered off their appetizer menu and the bill was $85
Gone are the plans for a beer dinner with pairings and quality dining
As previous reviews have stated there are excellent appetizer specials when you purchase a Japanese beer such as fried calamari chicken yakitori edemame and of course pot stickers fried or steamed for $1
I've been here several times now and the food is always delicious the wine selection is very good and the service is always terrific
took her WAY too long to take orders and empty glasses were left without refill for a good 5 minutes right in front of her it was NOT crowded or very busy  she had a blank stare on her face that screamed first time working in a restaurant
My big bro also had a German beer called Hefeweizen I did try a sip and as a non-drinker I found it delicious and very balanced
that chocolate drink i forgot the name that is sold by all the other fresh drinks is soooooooooo good and HOT so don't drink it straight away
This is where I take my parents when they visit and where we go when we want to relax over a bottle of wine and consistently tasty food
Again we enjoyed ourselves at their bar next door with their roasted pecans Awesome Anti pasta beer and wine
I would recommend this place to anyone looking to relax have a great beer and good food
They also have a very good selection of craft beer on draught only $3
Me and a friend enjoyed a flight of the on site brewed beer while watching the owner clean the tanks prepping them for the next batch
They offer several good beers their light American Lager is probably the most refined tasting local brew I have had and would be super good on a hot summer day although lacking in character for most occasions
PROS a portion of outside patio area was cordoned off just for us; ASU colors; appetizers delivered on cue and they were hot fresh and tasty; Trevor did a great job to ensure our 25 friends and family were taken care of--no one was w/out a drink all nite
I really enjoyed the original crew of Michael Germannand Rich really made this vino alley a chill place to drink and relate
Again after 5 additional minutes she arrived back and finally opened a delicious wine
The food and drinks are good and they have a great happy hour
The Cab was definitely not worth this price and I would have preferred the Barbera but figuring that I'd be getting my glass for $5 I went along with his suggestion
However as the other reviews point out the food that they offer is take-out food from another restaurant and as such we never bothered to order anything to eat as we don't go to a wine bar expecting to have such poor quality deli delivery food
I also enjoyed the La Jota wine by the glass was tasty with the burger
However the drinks are around $7 making the overall deal well worth it
Five dollar select appetizers- including the infamous boneless buffalo chicken dip as well as $3 beers and well spirits
My friends were already there when I arrived but I sat down and ordered a drink that was not only very good but on the table within two minutes
We pleasantly enjoyed our second time around in a booth with beers and shared a delightful ceasar salad and the soup of the day-brocolli cheddar I can't complain about this little airport bar/resturant since their staff was so quick friendly and the food was pretty tasty
Good for a keepsake special gift 1-of-a-kind conversation piece or create a memory
It was a wonderful coincidence that we happened to be celebrating our anniversary on the 5th since the restaurant offers 2$ glass of wine specials on the 5th of every month
The second thing that turned me off was when we were asked for our drink order and my husband asked which wines were included in the 2$ special the server proceeded to list the three wines a white a red & a blush but then added this at the end I do not recommend the red at all
Not dive in the way that angry looking people are having cocktails in the dark at 2 pm not that there is anything wrong with that but dive in the way of wow amazing beer selection comfortable surroundings a beat up dart board and it's OK if I spill some beer on the floor
The rotating tap selection is excellent and the bottle selection is even better to drink in or to go
After waiting that long for a menu we decided to play it smart and just order three appetizers and a beer
No one came by and asked if we wanted more drinks or even if our current drinks were good
They have happy hour and drink specials daily which is great as their cocktails are delicious and on the pricey side $9-$13
Be prepared to spend at least $20 each if you are getting drinks but it is worth it
I enjoyed the film with my beer although I'm not sure how the cocktail service would work if I had wanted another
I suppose it will become more clear once us Phoenicians get the hang of this new-fangled theater-bar I would highly recommend FilmBar for a date or just a group of friends craving an awesome movie-going experience with a great option to stay and chat over a drink after the film
Our large party would agree that the food and the atmosphere are still top notch as are the wines and that delicious homemade limoncello
The wine flavor isnt my thing and the well done thing isnt either
Coda and I had a light dinner and drinks here on New Years Eve 2010 and I have l been craving this delicious beverage ever since
I'm not one for chains but I am one for strong drinks good food and my awesome friends
Beer is always good and they have a decent selection - they need more local stuff though
Great wine selections excellent nosh options must try the ricotta dates pistachio bruschetta and a fun atmosphere
Now for the good part the food and beer
A little pricey for a hot dog fries and a drink but the quality is great service is good and the place is very clean
The service at Roy's was second to none though at the Blue Sage it took them a good five to ten minutes to clean out table top and bring us drink orders
The onion rings are good the burgers are delicious and the drinks are cold
Drinks were good had a perfectly made dirty martini albeit a little on the small side
He recommended his favorite and also whipped up fabulous for-the-morning drinks
We've been back several times and the servers know me by drink So far everything I have ate has been delicious
Keep up the good work on the beer but fire the guy that came up with your pizza recipe and start over
The espresso is very good and always nice wine and unique beers in bottles
My favorite sake nigori sake cold unfiltered sake which in in my opinion has a lot more flavor and is smoother and also hot sake for just $4
Our waiter was excellent he did a fantastic job describing each dish and making sure we always had drinks in our glasses and got us anything we needed
They kept coming around to fill our glass with water and to make sure the food was good
The food is good I had the SoCal Burrito w/ shrimp and the beer is even better
I'm a big wing and beer guy and both of these were prompt cheap and delicious
The food and drink specials are good and there's a different one every night
The joint has a nice atmosphere and good beers on tap though and they have Sayuri sake
Nice selection of draft beers all were tasty and available in 16 or 32 oz size
Both waiters I've had demonstrated extensive knowledge of the wine list and menu and made great recommendations
How awesome -- they had a sommelier on hand helping me select the exact wine taste quality price range that I was looking for
The Prosecco was delicious and came in a beautiful glass the kale salad was amazing though it was a bit more lightly dresses on the first go around which was in fact better the gazpacho was decent the squash casserole was cheesy goodness the farmers market salad was simply good all around and the flourless chocolate cake was soft and chocolatey on the inside but overdone-brownie-like on the outside
I was immediately impressed by the large retail wine rack and the large brick oven in the corner
The wine list was very good and featured an ALL Italian selections
I sampled 2 draft beers a local brew Four Peaks Kilt Lifter which was pretty good and an always reliable Smithwicks
I love that they offer fresh brewed iced tea huge cup sizes 3 different kinds of ice a million types of sodas amazing coffee drinks yummy individual iced cakes and cheap gas
The pizza which is NY style thin crust cooked in a coal fired oven is just the right thickness with some chewiness and good bite
I'm sorry m and s i was told how fab your happy hour was and i must say its not that great ok a burger for 295 sounds pretty good although i had the sliders 2 sliders w/fries 395 not bad i ordered 6 oyster off the reg menu 13$ the bar tender was not familiar with what kind of oysters came from where but did ask someone who new the oysters were good service was friendly but not that attentive to busy talking to each other my martinis were good
I started with a delicious glass of Sauvignon Blanc; my date had a Pinot Noir
or you could just go across the street to Whole Foods pick up a pretty good bottle of wine some awesome cheese and crusty bread and call it good
The drinks however - while good - were pricey
Our waiter also suggested Indian Beer and I can't remember the name of it but it was very good
I'd recommend having a drink here instead
If Dublin Dr Pepper sounds good to you this is the place to get it as well as a variety of Sorpanos-themed Italian sodas a gazillion different kinds of ginger beer real cola goddamn it's the best place in town
I'm still savoring the delicious red wine gravy that you pour over the pasty
For a topnotch meal with wine it was worth every penny to our group
It seemed initially we were on a path of places that aren't really known for good wines however interestingly enough the wines were fine and it was one of the best pairings I've ever seen in which the interaction of the wine and the food was drastically well done and clearly apparent
A frown came to my face when I asked how many beers on tap my good man
Seems like a good place to impress a date or perhaps a nice get together someone over a glass of wine conversation and tapas
I had been wanting to try the Whip Cream flavored vodka for quite some time and Chris mixed me up an orange-creamsicle tasting drink with it
This is a great place to take a few friends and just enjoy some good drinks and good company
I can't wait to go back and try the food and more of the delicious drinks from Chris
Along those lines the beer selection is amazing
I had a peach martini drink that was the special of the evening and it was strong and oh so good
We had it prepared Mike's way which meant it was sprinkled with petrified flavorless oregano flakes and dressed with oil and red wine vinegar
It looks like a cute place with jersey's hanging high on the ceiling--good atmosphere for a beer
Aaron the fantastically knowledgeable Sommelier had me paired with excellent wine suggestions with only a few hints of my picky palette
Can't wait to go back to try out there new bar bite menu in 2 weeks and take advantage of the locals' secret  1/2 off bottle night on Tuesdays from there amazingly huge book of wines to choose from
; 2 the yucca frita fried yucca plant very starchy like potatoes with some deep fried chunks of pork and garnished with radishes and cucumbers; 3 the ensalada drink a bright-yellow fruit beverage with finely chopped assorted fresh fruit- comes with a straw and a spoon; 4 the plantain with beans and sour cream a dish I wasn't sure about at first because I am very picky about my banana-type foods but it totally and unexpectedly works and is ridiculously delicious
I forgot what wine we had but it was spectacular and so was the cheese and fruit appetizer salad grilled fish with a sauce that was phenomenal  roasted artichokes and interesting dessert that was almost pudding like but lightly and deliciously vanilla-ly
It can get pricey if you start drinking more wine than you ought to be if you are driving so be wary of that but they do have a good happy hour price on wines and such
There is a good variety of beer and a full bar
I had been to Fez for drinks which are good but had never been there for food before last night
Although the pool is just beautiful when no one is in it  I've come for sushi yoga happy hour drinks and appetizers and after hours and every time I have felt it was a 5 star experience
However they come up short in terms of providing a top quality microbrewery and SunUp only shines as a good neighborhood bar that happens to brew their own beers
One can get a good beer just about anywhere but it would be nice to find a great beer brewed locally so here's to hoping SunUp comes up with a great beer
It has some of my favorites and I found two new wonderful wines
i definitely would not wait 3 hrs for it esp in 110u00b0 weather but glad we tried it and would recommend it to others esp groups so that you can grab some wine/drinks and hang out while waiting for your table
They have an excellent and extensive beer menu
This included appetizer of Baked Brie Scallop Salad Salmon Salad two tasters of wine at $23 for me $21 for date and then both of us had a second glass of wine
The Good- The staff were very nice and the drinks were flying off the counter
Epic failure number five was the sub-par meals that followed along with the flaming drink that is not worth ordering The food was by far the worst thing of the night which compared to everything else would seem like nothing
It was a great way for me to try several different wines but I must say they were all very good
The pretzels are delicious and are a great  filler/base when tackling the beer menu
The range of wines at Cheuvront is pretty good
Anyway the wine here is good and so is the cheese
I highly recommend this place because if you haven't done the wine/cheese thing you really don't know what you're missing
was friendly and on point i enjoyed the unique drinks Kiss & Tell was fun and orangey Gin Press was stiff and the flavors were well balanced and the food was good - just a bit pricey
They have a great happy hour with tons of amazing beers to choose from
Add in the drinks which were tasty and our bill was still nothing too crazy
The wine selection was excellent and it was served chilled
Not only is it a cool place to hang but they had some wonderful drink mixes and small bites to eat
Reasonable prices good service good selection of appetizers and drinks and a complementary Bloomin' Onion which was supposed to have been a taste
Dinner for two was around $50 plus tip for four appetizers three drinks and one entree
They have a very good wine selection and the best souffles
Turns out it is lots of veggies and LOTS maybe too much cheese rolled in a tasty beer bread wrap
I am to old for the bar/club scene and this was a great way to have a great time be able to have your friends around having a good time having some drinks and even shakin our booties to a few songs
Since I was not very hungry I only ordered the straciatella soup which was delicious and a glass of wine
The pretzels tasted a little stadium-ish but the beer is a good solution for that
Overall good food and totally reasonably priced but i would've loved to have a beer with my dinner
I will return to this fun and drinkably tasty locale again for perhaps appetizers and drinks most definitely the drinks and the atmosphere when I'm in the downtown area but I will here-for-to pass on further dining experiences
But I have managed to find good jeans and sunglasses
My water glass was never empty one of my personal measurements of a good restaurant
The people that make the drinks are skilled and everything comes out delicious
Drinks AHouse Margarita A+   Perfect flavor not too sweet or sour
They change the flavors seasonally and had just missed the pumpkin one They have a rotating list of craft beers on tap which was pretty neat
The beer selection is absolutely wonderful as well because there is something to cater to every taste
Disappointed in the quality and the fact that they charge you for refills of your drink and nickel and dime you for a small pre-measured and awful tasting side of ranch dressing or other condiment
Nevertheless check this place out for a good drink and great atmosphere
The juice drinks I wish I could remember the names were very good
My iced Chai tea was delicious - I'm not a coffee drinker but the tea was excellent
We had wings which were excellent ad a few pitchers of beer
Thank goodness Lo-Lo's knows how to make their namesake dishes and make them well
Once we were seated our drinks were refilled quickly and frequently and our order came out in about 10-15 minutes which I thought was pretty good for how busy it was a Friday night
The service was wonderful and the wine they recommended was right up my alley
We tried Happy Hour 1/2 off appetizers and $1 off draft beers
The flavor mixing softdrink machine is fun but gimmicky
They have an excellent wine list and the bartenders in the adjoining lounge are awesome
They either make our drinks perfectly or come up with delicious cocktails to try according to our tastes
We have gone here to celebrate special occassions or just to get away to a contemporary but welcome relaxed environment with excellent service and great food and drinks
wine bar in arcadia is what I compare it to and for about same price much better quality and larger selection
I always used to come for lunch and was never disappointed so thought it would be a good place to meet a friend for drinks and a little food after work
The sake was lacking in flavor the hamachi  likewise; the unagi had plenty of flavor but the flavor was from the sauce on it
I like nori and  'maki' rolls are more filling than nigiri style sushi; however the salmon in my 'sake maki' was also lacking in flavor
Added edit   Hana does offer sushi from 'wild' sakesalmon at the higher price of $10; that price is more than a little expensive and as I didn't try it I don't know if it has more fat/flavor than the 'regular' sake they serve
Parking can be a nightmare so try to get their early or better yet get a ride so you can indulge in the amazing selection of martinis
Their beer selection is not great but they do have some local artisan beers that are worth sampling Mud Shark Four Peaks are two that I recall
Dinner Appetizer Pizza and Root Beer for two under 20 bucks
Worth checking out as it's connected to Tops Liquor a store long known for retailing craft beer here in AZ
They also have great mixed drinks my favorite is the Creamsicle and they have a good selection of Louisiana beers
Proper service and table tending a wine list that covers all price points and some tasty cocktails make NOCA one of the most memorable dinners I've enjoyed a long time
First I had a $5 glass of Zinfandel that was quite good
We did date night with wine and cheeses and snacks and all kinds of goodies here the other night
You can get cheap wine and you can get the expensive stuff but it is all GOOD stuff
That was a good beer - plenty of flavor without any bitterness in the aftertaste
I also got a taste of the special Kilt Lifter that was aged in a bourbon cask and that was some darn good beer
We had there cheapest red wine and split an appetizer salad and pasta dish then each had a main course fish and lamb no desert
It is a Bistro and is very good and reasonably priced including some $20 wines
Apparently the beers though were very good and the next round that's what everyone ordered
Juicy flavorful perfectly paired with the suggested wine
Trendy downtown atmosphere with delicious cheeses and wines galore
We all usually grab a delicious glass of wine and don't mind the short wait at all
All the ingredients taste so fresh and the bread is equally delicious I have to admit I am picky about bread coming from San Francisco sourdough land I have to admit that all the food and wine fill me up so I have never tried their desserts but I am sure they are amazing as well
K and I met friends for happy hour wine and tapas-style appetizers
Wine was reasonably priced and the small plate tapas delicious
Having the ample parking lot of the strip mall near the HoHo the door guys were chill they do bracelets-not stamps-fucking HATE stamps-no easier way to stand out as a dirty girl at work the next day the bartenders fast my J&C was strong and not too scary priced 5 bucks but that is still cheap to my east coast drinking budget there was plenty of space some old chairs and sofas in the back a small indie drink stand that sold some tallboys a FOG MACHINE oh yea the sound quality was fine and the crowd was there to enjoy the mo show
I go to bars for good drinks and good food
They do offer some of the best Spanish wines by the bottle however and may be worth a trip to grab some rare vintage
I love these type events because the chef can experiment with new recipes and as a guest I get to try many new flavors and wines
I can say as a beer and wine snob of sorts they have a very good selection of beers
They feature delicious craft brew none of that yellow piss stuff college kids call beer these days
They have good drink specials and free pop corn
The drinks are good and their desserts are tasty and well priced
Aluminum GreensBy The RueThese guys aren't messing around My new favorite bar downtownSo many beers I want to poundWill leave you sleeping on the groundWhat a wonderful place to have foundI like my beer to be dark brownMy waitress recognized the soundOf my voice I was astoundThey will not except a Brittish pound Elvis sings a song about a houndMicheal Madsen's little brother is in the band Not really but they could go hand in hand He looked just like him a little more tannedIn first grade my friend and I would eat sandTo impress the chicks it tasted blandI wanted to touch their mammary gland My kisses are magical no one can withstandEspecially when I softly brush away that strand Of hair in your face I'm sure you plannedTo leave your underwear on the night stand
The design decor + ambiance will feel somewhat familiar as will the quality of drinks at the bar aside from much smaller martinis - but the food at Hanny's is a strange departure from the top-notch bar food found at it's sister restaurant in Scottsdale
There is a good wine list and overall it is a place that I like to sit with friends and hang out
We started off with drinks and appetizers
The prices are lower than just about any store but Costco and they have a very wide selection of very good wines in the $8 - $15 range
For appetizers and a few beers Four Peaks is great epecially if you get a seat on the patio on a nice day
The beer is cold the staff attentive & the Paddy Melt good
The food was good and the beer selection was pretty decent as well
This is wonderful as you can get a large blue coconut slushee drink off a couple of inches top it off with Malibu rum and have a little party in the afternoon
It's been really difficult for me to find cool places to drink at and dine at in north Phoenix if you know of somewhere cool please please please leave it in the comments for me but I had a good time at Blue Martini at CityNorth
The Espresso Martini is almost as tasty with Grey Goose Vodka Borghetti Espresso Liqueur and Irish Cream in a chocolate-covered glass
We went on a Saturday night around 7 pm and it was not that busy at all beautiful decor and a very romantic setting For those who were complaining about the lighting they might want to get their eyes checked it was fine The menu offered a number of tasty meals I had a flat iron steak and my boyfriend has the roasted chicken with gnocchi it was amazing  We sampled some different wines and had a great waiter Frankie he was very good never let our glasses go empty and had lots of recommendations for us we can't wait to return again
An absolutely perfect place to enjoy a glass of wine with good company
But I'm here to get some free drinks and possibly some high quality sushi
They have delicious drinks and appetizers I love the sweet potato fries and the crispy coconut shrimp rolls
Met a friend there on a Thursday and was surprised to find such good deals on drinks and their date night deal for $20 is awesome
good atmosphere lots of tv's and big beers
This would be a good place to meet up with friends and share a pie and some good wine
i've always liked ihop as a kid but now that im older i watch where my dollar goes and when i have poor service im not giving up my dollar to anybody with that said we entered this IHOP we were seated rather quick by the host our waitress came once asked about our drinks we never saw her again this was early sunday so myself and my family promptly get up and exit no one attempts to ask what's wrong the host was really the only one concerned but made no comment in fact she kinda looked as if that happened before this is not good IHOP
There was 25 cent beers of schwag Miller High Life well worth it
I hate when we ask for a drink recommendation at other places and we hear I don't know I'm not old enough to drink Or we hear I don't know me and my friends usually just order shots
Their wine reco's were pretty good and have a great list of wines by the glass
They also sell a good variety of wines by the bottle in their shop
Oh but there is one thing I DEFINITELY recommend I am a huge whiskey drinker only
Oh my goodness I seriously felt like I was drinking a raspberry type smoothie drink but it wasn't a smoothie it was just an awesome alcoholic puree that I would drink all the time
00 bottles of wine of which we chose a wonderful Shiraz
The salad simply didn't have flavor and was over priced at $15 and my beer was $10
i think the thai mai is around $5 and it's a pretty sizable glass with a good pour
Had the muscles in a white wine sauce as an appetizer
We were sat about 30 minutes after our reservation no biggie when there's good conversation and a wine list
A lot of conversation in other reviews seems focused on two areas The quality of service and the temperature of the beer
It gets congested in the middle where the bar starts and the drink prices are kinda pricey so if you're trying to get from the front to the back where all the action is be a little patient; good things come to those who wait
My friend got the bellini - VERY tasty and i got the Dirty Monkey - not quite as tasty but still good and one definitely got me buzzin not the intent of the drink just the effect
Would probably try a different drink - the inital taste of the DM was good but left a funny after taste
Casual good breakfast options good americanos and other coffee drinks and a cool lay out with the patio and large tall windows inside
Pool arcade basketball video games quality drinks at good prices very fast and knowledgeable staff TV's everywhere good crowds the occasional appearance from Dane M
Wednesday nights they have 1/2 of a bottle of wine and their house red is pretty good
I only had 1 drink  - i was being responsible - so we got out of there at $15/ person which i think is a steal to be full and satisfied with a delicious orange mojito - which appeared to be made with lotsa love
Highly recommend their chicken strips dipped in beer batter
First of all the cherry slushy cocktail is to die for it is so good and I am vodka soda drinker
I don't know a lot about wine but every glass that has been recommended to me by a server has been great
Even the wine at our servers suggestion who was awesome by the way was not good quality either for the prices
Off the top of my head Olive & Ivy at the Scottsdale waterfront has MUCH more flavorful bruschetta and an incredible wine selection
So instead I opted to pick the first thing that sounded good basically the first thing I read; the lamb and mint with the red wine gravy
I thoroughly enjoyed my Old Fashioned drink
He made suggestions about good drinks to try and was down to earth and helpful
Even though I was not totally impressed by the living room-looking speak easy it was still a fun and different way of getting drinks so I do recommend at least trying some of their drinks once because they serve different drinks upstairs from the ones down in the restaurant
Margs sangria and their specialty cocktails are all $5 beers are on special and there's a good selection of food priced for happy hour
It would be the same as getting irritated by a waiter suggesting the perfect gales of wine with your ordered or to finish the evening with the most amazing desert to end the meal
Price is good too my boo and I spend about $20 for 2 burgers fries onion rings and beer
The beer and wine selection is amazing but you're still better off finding a Total Wine because they'll have the same thing for almost half the price
This was definitely a fun experience and I really recommend it for someone who is interested in glass blowing but not enough to sign up to a full blown class
And this is why I adore Geisha the apps don't suck the rolls are yummy the drinks delicious and the atmosphere cannot be beat
consistent food consistently good service a decent wine list and a feeling of occassion
He also enjoyed iced tea with his meal which he was pleased was refilled without request when the waitstaff saw the drink was getting low
The food is good not great prices are very reasonable but I LOVE the beer selection
The staff can always offer a good suggestion if you are willing to try something new to drink
It is one of those places where the pub is a perfect setting for good friends to catch up and have a drink; they the staff don't try to entertain you that is left up to you which to me is a good thing
I've also heard that Fez's drinks are pretty good though I was there for the food not the liquor
They have a rotating beer tap that is usually something delicious and very enjoyable
Drinks specials are totally reasonable - had the Odella Red Ale which was a nice compliment to the artichoke dip appetizer which came with very fresh tortilla chips
She goes there a lot so it was her first recommendation to grab dinner and beers
They have a pretty amazing beer selection with some of my favorite beers available
and I would be willing to bet that those kinds of coffee drinks are also excellent at Sola
We enjoyed the throw back drink menu - Honey  had a Vesper and was pleased to rekindle his affection for the marriage of gin and vodka
They have a good selection of wine as well
Go to Postino if you want some really good food wine or conversations
He had a good recommendation for a beer pairing as well as our meal choices
The 2 pasta entrees desert appetizer soda and glass of wine came out to be $68
It poured two glasses of medium quality wine
To top off the miserable experience the food was below mediocre Over cooked the cole slaw was awful and we kissed any chance of our drinks being refreshed goodbye
Second run was a plain coffee and it was  tasty not bitter- I drink coffee daily and often find it bitter at a lot of places
get some good wine or find a friend with a taste for the stuff and have them pick you out something to bring they do not have any on hand and their food goes very well with it
Same thing with the beer selections and the appetizers
They have a great wine and liquor selection with excellent prices
It really shouldn't take nearly a half an hour to receive a beer and appetizers I had the guacamole and shrimp ceviche were were quite good
It's just a generic dive bar and one that's worth the visit if you've been drinking it's a random hour of the day and you want to continue drinking
I come here for the delicious snacks and the deliciously spicy ginger ale that tickles my throat and nose holes and inspires a need for fire-drinking
The sushi at Sake Bomber's is decent--its not over-the-top amazing and certainly not bad
Sake Bomber probably isn't your best bet for sushi in Tempe and certainly not in all of the Phoenix Metro Area but its a good place to go when you want to mix it up in Tempe maybe you've been going to Sushi 101 every night or for big groups
Drinks i like them sweet and they got them good and strong if you ask me
I have to deduct a point for service though the last 2 times we dined here it seemed to take forever to get drinks and the servers aren't very good at explaining dishes nor are they personable
Their drink pours are no joke and they are very good at remembering your drink of choice
Royal has knocked it out of the park on several occasions both in quality of my drink and in quality of service
I don't think it's worth a trip from somewhere far away there are great coffee houses all over the valley but if you're downtown I would go in and order a drink
if you're a party of 3 or more most likely you'll have to sit in the regular dining area FYIThe kicker is the amazing drink specials
The cocktails are mixed good and strong and the sake bombs use pretty good sake and your choice of Kirin or Sapporo
They had a good sized wine list and a few girly drinks
The drinks at the bar were very very good
Drinks are made well and the bartender is rally good about remembering what everyone was having I love that trait--- makes people feel special
While their drinks are quite good the prices not so much so we only go when we have some extra money and would like a nice treat
The food smelled delicious but I can't comment anymore on it since I did not eat anything but the happy hour prices were fantastic includes both food and drinks and it doesn't get too crowded
Its good to just get a drink and watch the game or to do a full-on dinner
The value for the money is very good - when we went this week the  four of us each had our own meals and dinner salads we split two appetizers the Kickbutt garlic bread and fried Ravioli  two desserts two sodas and three beers
We were greeted with a large wine selection and some appetizers on a back patio
But for goodness sake it's really not that complicated
I really enjoyed the decor here from the stain glass to the large ceiling lamps which contained hanging branding irons
Happy hour had good drink specials and i also tried the fresh cut fries which were just average as these didnt have skin on and were kinda stubby
While it may just appear to be another trendy gastropub in Arcadia it does provide good food good drinks and a fun vibe
Six good sized samples that will probably rock your world if you've got a taste for beer
I will say that I like CB&TL sugar free vanilla flavoring as well as their lemon FruTea drink - try it if you go it's refreshing and thirst quenching
But if you bounce so much that you shake the floor and put my delicious drink in danger of toppling or if your 2 week old unwashed neck bandana dips annoyingly close to my drink then we have a problem
Granted its always amazing they are always the most friendly people remember me and my drink without skipping a beat ever
When good people and affordable food and drink culminate together it's a 5 star dealio
Really good drink specials unfortunately had none as their specialties are mostly tequila based - not for me
Two appetizers three sandwiches 2 fountain drinks and 1 alcoholic beverage our tab came out to $60 tips not included
The shakes are an amazing must have and not to mention beer as well
You will leave this placed stuffed for about $11 per person that's including drink so if you want to go cheap tasty and all American go to Fat Burger their amazing
The snacks are not that good they were charging for drinks
The service is excellent the staff has worked there for years and is speedy to run around and refill drinks and clear dishes
Worth a visit for the take home beer selection
The food was pretty good- huge bavarian style pretzels are always great with beer
She returned with another updated check and we gave her the card for the 1 drink and a coupon for the appetizer
The size of the meal was very good and filled me up quite nicely and then some so I guess the food and drink was a good value for my money
Everything is great about this place great hangout with buddies watch the game and just need a good beer
The bruschetta is delicious there's a ton of it and the wine doesn't come from a bargain menu
After placing our drink and appetizer order we received our pita bread and drinks promptly and then
In addition if you order beer then you can take advantage of a 50 cent appetizer
My friend ordered cranberry sake which was cold crisp and flavorful -- delivered in a smart container where the ice remained after pouring
drinks were good i had a pain killer which brought me back to my days on St john's island
The server was attentive but not annoying the food was delicious and the wine was a bit disappointing for the second time in a row
Francis is excellent including the mid-century modern decor and ambiance but we'll also keep our skepticism about the wine menu
If ever in Phoenix this would be worth any drive to have lunch or dinner and a beer
Prices were incredibly moderate and for three beers and the two appetizers our bill without tip was $29
We all loved our food the house wines were really good
I got the ham bun - it was yummyMy SO got the reuben - he loved itThe beer battered pub pickles were excellentWe were really excited about the irish nachos
I was impressed with the menu and love the concept of beer first food second
She recommended a bomb of a tiny bit of liquor and about 1/8 of a glass of beer
Drinks were strong service was good at the back bar
We did not try any bar drinks appetizers or desserts
Our server was extremely attentive without being overbearing made good wine pairing suggestions and really made the experience worthwhile
Service is good and the beer is cold with a decent selection
The service was good we made it easy by ordering pitchers of beer and a few large pizzas
After being greeted by the amazing sushi chef didn't get his name we were brought drinks and we immediately started putting check marks next to all of the selections we wanted to try
The martinis are served with the shaker and you really get about a martini and a half's worth
Came here for a afternoon drink on Saturday afternon with the hubster and I decided to try the cosmetic martini only 76 calories and very tasty
Il Bosco has an excellent wine list that compliments the eclectic selection of wood fired pies including a refreshing Procecco that really hits the spot on a warm Arizona evening
My drink came out first in a huge fish bowl glass it was just as good as I hoped it would be full of liquor and fruitiness
Soon enough the drink comes out and it's a hit she loves it and all is good
I reminded her that she had to wait so long for her drink and she thought about it and said it was worth the wait
They have an excellent salsa bar and sell a wide variety of mexican beer and it's priced  sooo right
Their ginger beer mixed with their sorrell drink just might be my favorite new drink in the last 2 years its worth a trip just to try it
But the guys working at Sportsman's were real nice helpful attentive and really went out of their way to help me find a good wine for a certain occasion
They offered ideas of wines to try were prompt with service the Warmed Brie Panini Sandwiches and other appetizers were very good
We started off with sangria the 'aztec affection' cocktail and draught beer - all pretty good
The lamb shank was hearty fork melting goodness with a great red wine sauce
Overall this is a pleasant place for get togethers and have a good time with beer wings pizza and pizookie
Your meal will probably cost anywhere from $7-9 including a drink but it will be worth it
Things like the sprig of mint and a big berry in our water glass that was not only beautiful but delicious
The pasta primavera $13  was very good in a nice light garlic white wine sauce
I think the main reason why I instantly fell in love with this place besides amazing drinks is the atmosphere
it's a cool little spot for drinking and watching sports if you like in an excellent part of scottsdale
The bartender/cook greeted us warmly and quickly took our drink and appetizer order
The salad while bland was so good b/c it was so damn fresh and I put too much of the really fine wine dressing on it and almost felt my throat burning
Immediately I was impressed with the selection of craft beers on tap and stumbled into a couple Thursday specials that I appreciated
Once again the beer was tasty the place was clean the prices were reasonable but the service was intolerable
The sushi is creative and tasty and the drink specials rock
Fortunately their drinks are so good that even an I don't really care face could not make it any less yummy
The wine that was recommended was not very good -- which I wouldn't take fault with if it wasn't recommended
The beer selection is great with some very good flavors
Go with the regular cheeseburger the super really just two patties stuck together doesn't grab the wine as well and loses it's unique flavor
The entire experience was fantastic from the pours on the drinks the service to the amazing food
So I highly recommend Boulders on Broadway for a great beer but make sure you eat dinner somewhere else
They have a good selection of beer I had the nimbus imported domestic and local
Bottom line I probably won't go back for a full meal here but I will come back in a heartbeat for the wonderful cocktail and drink selection and the small plates which may be the way to go
I enjoyed the atmosphere and the beer was good
It came with a drink some pretty good steak a side of some balls of rice and a side of macaroni
We only had few drinks I had all mix drinks and stuck with the good ol' Vodka Red Bull
It was a good size drink meaning I got a whole can of red bull not just half hard to mess that one up
Saketini has great service wonderful chill atmosphere and a large food/drink menu
happy hour or reverse happy hour you 're bound to find something that will fill your belly with deliciousness and a drink that will warm ya up
Our service was excellent drinks are well priced at $5
I was gung ho to try a sip of the red Thai wine but strangely the waiter strongly recommended against it
In between our appetizers and wine we chatted with both bartenders and several people sitting at the bar enjoying our evening
As if these rare brews weren't good enough Papago actually brews their own beers a few of which are regular selections when I visit Oud Zuipers is a really nice Belgian Ale the El Robusto is just a great porter and my favorite the Coconut Joe a coconut-infused porter that's just about the tastiest thing ever and I can't even stand coconut in other culinary creations
Good luck finding a table if you show up after 10 and even if you do the servers are so busy that you might end up having to get your drink from the bar
However if you show up for happy hour between 2 and 6 pm you're almost guaranteed to get good service and something like a dollar off per drink which makes some of the beers a criminally good deal
If it's your first time in they're more than happy to suggest a beer based on other brews you've had or just a particular flavor profile you have in mind
I feel pretty comfortable saying that given the good drink list and affordable good food you should expect to wait for a table unless you like to eat dinner early
Attentive staff help with recommendations and keep your glass full
Oh wow - they serve espresso and amazing sounding coffee drinks too - very impressive but I'll skip those today since I'm avoiding caffeine while being prego
As mentioned by others the drink prices are average but they do have a pretty good selection for a music venue
Its easy to get in and out of and is in a good Valley location right off the 202 with Tempe looming as a pre-drinks destination
I don't mind paying more for a good drink but theirs were definitely lacking
Copper Star is a drive-thru and sit-down coffee shop that serves locally roasted fresh hot coffee frozen coffee drinks smoothies and fresh baked goods
Well the drink was certainly worth the price
He knew a lot about his wines the grapes and gave good recommendations on tastings
Honestly you can't beat this place for the prices Appetizer meal and a drink for $10
As always the beer selection was overwhelming but thankfully you can never really go wrong with a good waiter
They didn't have a good selection of draft beer at all weird for a place that calls itself a sports bar
I thought everything was either bland or hot for the sake of being hot - no complexity in the flavors
The gals loved the guacahummus  salsa and chips  a great start with drinks  we had wonderful entrees  like the special of chicken pasta and my delicious blue corn enchiladas which I would gladly have again
With our drinks we enjoyed a plate of freshly pulled mozzarella sprinkled with crunchy chewy bits of sorrel pork jowl confit and local dates
I especially enjoyed the selection of Santa Ynez wines we love Sanford
I think this place is worth a visit even if you don't eat meat you can have the cheese schnitzel and a humungous beer and feel like you're in Germany for the day
The best way I can describe this is to think of a wine pairing with a food that will make flavors pop
It was over done and the quality of the fish was impressive as the color was straight from a salmofan and there was very little salmon flavor defiantly not a wild sakeye
Drinks are also excellent - yes its a fountain server a la any other sandwich place but Zupas has Italian Soda syrups nearby that you can pump into your drink turning a coke into a Strawberry Cola or a Ginger Ale I have not seen this on soda fountain before into a Raspberry Ginger Ale
Drinks 1 magnum of red wine can't remember the name but it was good 2 bottles of cham-painnnnn
It had great depth of flavor and the red wine sauce was absolute dynamite
BWW is good for wings bar food beer and the game
I am compelled to write this review not because of the food and drinks although those were good but rather due to the best server I have had in probably all my dining experiences
Drinks are good and service is excellent especially if you are ordering food
I would really give Postino Central 5 stars but I feel that the wines offered by the glass are only worth $5 as they are offered during the day
But that's no good because you're hungry and drinking
We hadWatermelon juice with tapioca pearlsMilk Tea with tapioca pearlsFried Dumplings appetizerBeef noddle soup with Shaved NoodlesSea food noodle soup with hand pulled noodlesThe 'boba' drinks were excellent
Wine by the glass expensive and not worth while
I ordered wine and they didn't offer to let me taste it first just poured it into my glass and walked away luckily for me it was good tasting
But if you know what good pizza is supposed to look and taste like and you appreciate service that keeps your drink full the whole time stop by and order a pie
I wanted a Belgian beer but they were out so I nixed the beer idea I know I'm a turd I should've just had some  and got a Spanish Garnacha which was delicious
All in all good place to catch a few drinks and appetizers but not so much for a tasty hearty meal
Greetings placement balloon for kid all happy time to drinks good
Really excited that a new brewery has opened and they are producing good beer
If you like good pizza and great beer check out Fate Brewing Company
The service is awesome and it's a great place to chill among good friends and good drinks
Beer selection is solid although they could use a few more draft selections and the wine list is good
Above average food along with a good beer selection and friendly service gives Big Earl's BBQ and above average rating of four stars
Drinks were good your average $11 Cosmo nothing spectacular but nothing bad
The cocktail waitress was great chatty recommended some great drinks I can't remember what they were but the one I had was Grey Goose Orange and raspberries
They always have good specials and drinks different nights of the week
I can have an amazing meal with the best food I've ever had but if it takes 20 minutes for a server to come and just take my drink order it's going to affect how much I enjoy said food
The restaurant grub was above average and they had several good beers on tap
Pamela showed up to a glass full of potent and tasty margarita
I will come again to try the green tea mousse cake and the green tea drinks as people recommended here
The tasting was $20 and included 5 wines plus an appetizer
The salad was very good and I enjoyed all of the wines
I noticed some good drink special signs for nights other than Friday and Saturday
The food is good the staff is great and the beers are fantastic
You are looking at about $100/head including drinks not wine and it is worth every penny
I had two glasses of wine Grayson Cabernet which was really good and a Reisling I can't remember which one but I liked it
The service is always great it is reasonably priced the food and wine are delicious and the ambiance is wonderful
I really can't drink Starbuck's Chai lattes anymore because of how good it is here
They sure do know how to served a good drink too
They passed the water glass test and timing of courses had a good flow
The drinks were good and cheap and it's a great alternative to the usual scene
Art works everywhere including under the glass topped tables which I kinda enjoyed looking at
We just missed Happy Hour but it looks like there are some really good drinks and specials
Enjoyed an excellent steak dinner with wonderful wines available on their list
Ended up going the full nine yards including a complementary app bacon wrapped scallops all the way to a decadent brownie sundae enjoyed with some cordials glenmorangie for me and a generous glass of tawny port for my wife
While she recommended a nice glass of white wine she poured me a totally different one the second time
I tried two happy hour drinks The Mule and The Maid  both were excellent
I had a glass of Malbec with my Apricot BBQ feta chicken panini delicious and the thick potato wedges were awesome it hit the spot
I went with a group of 4 and we had a couple of bottles of wine and a plain pizza as an appetizer to share
if you do have to wait sit at the bar or by the fireplace; you can't complain once you have a drink in hand and the scent of the fire mixed with hot food and good energy
I ordered a glass of a house red wine on recommendation from the waitress and my husband got a bud light draft  both were discounted because of a HH special that lasted til 7
After a few drinks of mine I recruited a friend to come and try another flavor
Eager to try one of their signature drinks I asked for a recommendation from the server
The service was good tho and our server was attentive to drink refills and checked on us very often
I wouldn't really recommend a woman to come here alone or to have a lady's night outing here b/c you are about to enter the man cave of TVs beer darts and games-I am sure the guys would swarm you and your ladies just to have a lady to hit on
I got their version of a Mint Chocolate Chip milkshake which was delicious but so sweet I got a stomach ache about 5 minutes into drinking it which was kind of a bummer
Drinks nice mixed drink selectionOverall good restaurant made better by the ambiance and the fact that its about 5 min from all of our hourses
; The service is usually really good Gary and mother are a lot of fun and the drinks averagely priced
How can you beat a delicious charbroiled burger seasoned fries and a drink for only $5
Ok so this place has amazing service even better food a great wine and beer selection and has a perfect ambiance
THey do have a good selection of beers but the only sunday special is flat glasses of lite beer for $2 which was returned
We decided to take a seat outside and have an appetizer and a drink
In Zen 32's defense they do have+ A great location+ Very fresh fish+ Low carb rolls+ Possibly the best tuna in town+ Creative and tasty specialty rolls+ Good sushi selection+ Neat little complimentary sunomo type appetizer+  A really good drink menu yummy plum wine
For a bar that has a club type of vibe they actually had a good beer to drink
The Arizona wines seem to be just as good as most California wines
I'd go back again but avoid ordering anything off their drink menu without finding out the ingredients--who knew that Four Loko is a flavored colored alcoholic soda-like beverage that tastes like otterpops with cheap vodka
Our server was nice to comp the drink that I wasn't a fan of -- this is always a good move in the service industry
The bartenders are very knowledgeable so a seat at the bar is worth coming here if you are new to imbibing wine and spirits
To give them credit - and 2 stars - they had a couple good craft beers available a dart board pool table and beanbag game
Happy hour includes a couple $2 drafts and other drink specials as well as some half price appetizers which include a jalapeno bacon cheese burger
Starting with the drinks the fruit drinks tasted very off in flavor
I enjoyed the bottomless mimosas and appreciated that my glass was never empty
Good deals on sake bombers and beer which they now offer 2-3 kinds on tap
RecommendedFilet with mushroomsmartinisalso the chili was quite nice also
Pros Great Pizza Cheap Beer Waitresses that don't stank great appetizers decent prices perfect ora Great UFC bar you can even bring your mom and dad here Cons I'm not there with a cold draft in my handThe S
We waited a good 15-20 minutes for our beers
Great building good ambiance wonderful patio hope it's pet friendly excellent location and a good selection of beers
good product in my opinionmy most recent visit they had a special going that was any burger and a pint of drink for ten bones fries are also included
so 10 bucks is a good price for eat and drink
I have grown weary of all the so called wine bars around that boast more college students and second rate wines than actual good ones
When I walked in I felt overwhelmed  in a good way  about the great selection of cheeses and wines
They have everything from your mass-brewed American lagers/pilsners PBR Bud Coors Miller etc and a good selection for the beer geek/snob Sierra Nevada Stone Dogfish Head etc
I enjoyed my time here and look forward to going back to complete my beer list
The DJ was excellent the drinks were overflowing and very reasonably priced plus everyone was dressed up and extremely friendly
They also have free UFC fights so if you're into those types of things it might be worth a trip to not pay for it at another bar with equal amounts of average bar drinks/food
Just like Top's this place is a turn off for the BevMo crowd - It is not a booze CostCo with employees wearing name tags and peppy polo shirts it is a wonderful welcoming and friendly mom-and-pop business that nurtures beer nerds
Good Eastern Euro beer selection  Russian and Ukrainian selections are great for the Valley and the wine selections make me a happy frugal camper
If drinking water is contaminated how good could the water be that's irrigating plants
Maybe its not the best place to put something this good online but if you have a chance to check out the hush hush fight club type drinking lounge with 10 rules outside of Citizen Public I highly advise
Outstanding service amazing drinks and if I had to suggest something semi-laser pointer mind shattering AWESOME try the key lime pie desert
It's first class seats and service for a mere $15 for a movie ticket then add on drinks and an appetizer and you end up spending close to $40
Everything you want in a good drinkslinger
We noticed some of the tables around us just ordering drinks and a few appetizers as their entrees kind of tapas-like rather than ordering from the A La Plancha grilled on metal plate versus the A La Parilla from the bbq or hot coal part of the menu
From Crispy Spicy Tuna have to order it every time to the drinks love the Geisha a-go-go; the sushi is good the happy hour is great; have had everything to eat on the happy hour menu
I enjoyed the red wine sauce and the peppercorn but found the bearnaise somewhat disappointing
The drinks were pretty weak but the food was pretty good and the atmosphere is fun
Cover was $6 I think but well worth it since the drinks are fairly inexpensive from a city girl standard
Good value in the wine list attentive service
And really good selection of bottled beers
The big one with cheese is terrific and so delicious even beer like Michelob tastes good
I did not have time to sit for a drink but they have a selection of fancy and tasty sounding concoctions like the Peach Smash from 2 until 6 for $6
We paired our meal with a good wine and spent an hour and a half just enjoying ourselves
The outdoor bar is wonderful for the few times a year you'd want to sit outside in the long AZ summer for a drink
They have 8-10 flavors of popcycles plus some drink options and even a frozen treats for pups
With the fabulous drinks and pleasant wait staff good times are to be had here
Today for me here one excellent beer on draft
Breakfast burrito was amazing made with beer brats
Even though it seems pricey it' has good drinks clean tables friendly staff free wi-fi
But weak drinks bad food and poor service are not a good combination
I was both impressed and bemused when my waiter refilled my water glass apparently noticed my ice had mostly melted then returned with a scoop of ice to add to my cup
First time in the place had to leave to go buy wine as we didn't know there was no alcohol but still ended up having a really good meal until the end
The drinks were great and the service was excellent
They have a good selection of wines and house brews I had a hefewiesen and was pretty good considering I`m a wine whore
If not-the Biltmore is great and filled with history and wonderful diversions throughout the grounds-book an Ocotilla room as if provides multiple hospitality services including an extended continental breakfast and hot and cold apps with beer/wine complimentary and honor bar
Service very attentive waters & beers always full bartenders are great at making recommendations for beer when your being annoyingly indecisive about  which fashion  you plan to get inebriated
Bottom line if your not  freshly 21 and stoked about drinking a beer out of a yardstick then this place may notice be AS amazing to you but it certainly does not disappoint when your in the mood for some grub and beer
Pros Good place to WATCH sports lots of TVs           Friendly serversCons Food and beer
Special Catch was Grouper it was seasoned and cooked perfect with some greens and tiny thin multi color carrots on a buttery mild red wine saucethis dish was delicious
5 Guys is a little over-priced about $13 for burger/fries/drink but pretty good value for the money
Wines are available but as an afterthought and definitely not of the quality served at FO
The Porky $7 is filled with all that is good pork apples potatoes onions and sage and served with a side of red wine gravy
The problem with the gravy is that it's so tasty I'm not sure whether to dunk my pasty into it or drink it
Very very good and seats well with your stomach and a glass of wine
Our server was pleasant made good recommendations and kept our drinks filled
I had a good time the bands were great and the drinks were cheap
We had a delicious and very reasonably priced wine Primitivo and three starters  to share the deviled eggs with caviar Swedish meatballs and the ahi tuna carpaccio
The drinks are horrendously over priced but fresh and pretty tasty
Yes it's expensive - expect to spend more than $200 for a dinner for two including an appetizer bread complimentary a glass of champagne a steak salad and potato
You can go and wait hours at those hip pizzarias that cater to the $$$ but if you just want a great place to chill have a beer or a glass of vino and amazing pizza
Even the kids menu has been good my kid has tried the cheeseburger and the chicken nuggets they all come with drink and dessertIf you want to go to a nice restaurant to have an excellent time and great food I recommend you this place is superb and the service is always friendly
We ordered the spinach and goat cheese croquettas good gambos al ajillo good the pollo colonial the star of the meal some other items and the brussel sprouts with thyme way TOO much vinegar drowning the sprouts and no thymeFor dessert we ordered the cheesecake with figs in a red wine sauce - this was amazing and I would return only to eat this and the pollo colonial
I was impressed  how quickly the food comes out and they were very good about refilling our chips & salsa and drinks
The late night happy hour is awesome an appetizer 3 beers and 2 margs is only 20 bucks before tip you really can't go wrong with that
PROS Coffee quality espresso quality Barista skill Barista friendliness espresso drink menu is outstanding in terms of options and clever twists and Layout/design is SUPERBLY inviting and cozy and its perfectly lit mostly taking advantage of natural light
So by that time I was irritated and with over $100 of wine in the cart was thinking maybe they ought to recognize I could be a good customer
Always a few good draft beers on tap to choose from and the portions are quite large family style
Tender Sautu00e9ed beef tips garlic roasted potatoes roasted root vegetables including beets parsnip and even a little Brussels sprout sneaked in I'd never have believed this would be one of my favorite vegetables all on a rich port wine reduction perfectly executed and absolutely delicious
Good layout of the bar dont have to wait too long for drinks clean bathrooms with attendant usually free bottled water on the way out
But if you like a little place where the service is good drinks are strong food is great and the atmosphere is spot on then this is a great place to hang
Im not that confident in myself to go near a gay bar alone the free drinks are not worth it
They didn't have any coconut rum so our waitress asked for a different drink order in the end we decided to do a Long Island Ice Tea and adding pineapple juice since I originally wanted a Surfer on Acid in short it was so good that I could have had 6 and ended up on the floor but been a very happy camper
It's the realization that sometimes the best things in life are pretty simple cold beer good food and good friends in a slightly off kilter atmosphere
We ordered the crispy rock shrimp and braised leek appetizers which he paired with a nice white wine for us
Incidentally the Plungerhead red zinfandel is a good glass of wine
Try their own micro brew its pretty good if u like NON-bitter beer
The food is delicious the desserts are sinful the drinks are amazing
This was good but was served in basically a thimble it was the smallest glass of wine I have ever seen
The wine recommended was their chianti which tasted pretty bad they have a weird assortment of imported beers and like a couple other reviews the pizza had little flavor
They had tables set out where they were selling roast beef sandwiches I think with chips and a drink for 5 dollars and it was worth every penny
Finally I would add that the beer selection is quite good and offers several sizes of great draft beers from the British Isles
The drinks are good and so is the atmosphere
The decor is very cool-neat floral booths with plastic overlay beer taps at the booths amazing mural on the far right wall
We had a FANTASTIC server Ashley who was really funny and very patient with us our party kept rolling in and was kind of indecisive when it came to their drinks and the food was REALLY good
Great vibe awesome wait staff great location incredible food wonderful drink selection and a cool patio area
Whether you're on the go or you want a mellow atmosphere to read talk drink coffee make friends eat good food D'Lish is your new hang out
Wine list was small but adequate with a good spread
And I assume her dirty dirty dirty martinis were good simply on the sheer volume she consumed
You really have to know the bartenders for them to make you a good one with so many free drinks flying around and people not tipping when they get them they slack
It was just OK their fresh fruit was good the omelet bar was so-so service again was slow waiting for drink and salt and pepper they were missing bowls for the oatmeal
The severs we had at this MM were both knowledgeable of the menu and of their excellent craft beer selection
They claim to have an excellent selection of local craft brew which I agree that they have a better selection than most but where are the Nimbus Oak Creek and Beaver St beer
the second time was for an early dinner we were able to be seated right away and started out with a few of the appetizers and drinks
The pizza came as we enjoyed some of their great beers
We went across the lot to another restaurant and were treated to friendly service great food and good drinks at a real Happy Hour with happy people
The waiter even made me a special drink and it was delicious
You could taste some wine the sauce which really makes a difference--in a good way
Also as a side note their Ethiopian beer is surprisingly quite tasty; and it pairs well with the food
I don't usually drink  a lot of soda but when I do ice is super important and they have this slushed ice that makes the soda so worth the extra calorie and sugar intake
If you can stand eating among large families and battling traffic to refill your own drinks and condiment cups the Farm Grill is a good choice for the meat loving crowd
I noticed everyone else was drinking maybe that's what will keep this place going because I can't recommend the food or the cleanliness
I'd be happy to send this place some recommendations for tasty affordable wines if they like; but I don't plan on ordering wine there again
While I don't usually get very adventurous with my drink I have to say they make an excellent Old Fashioned -- and I seem to remember enjoying a really good Hot Tottie during the holidays
My husband and I agreed that this place could be really good as a concert venue that sells food and drink as it was a good place to see the show last night
I started off the evening with a delicious and refreshing tall glass of the one and only Guiness beer off the tap of course
The drinks however are impeccably good
We recommend the jap chae fried glass noodles with beef and veggies the daeji bulgogi spicy bbq pork with rice and the tofu soup with spicy bean paste--the little side dishes are amazing
I love City Scape but if you're in the mood for a great place with good beers and drinks either go to Tilted Kilt or Arrogant Butcher
The wine list is a little overpriced but on the whole we ended up with a $30 Zinfandel that we paid $70 for - a good wine but not really worth that price
I think the plate with the added ham and a large glass of orange juice was under $15 so not bad for the quality and if you really love a great poached egg
They snuck the Sam Adams Boston Lager onto their menu which I think is a wonderful beer but not appropriate in the grand selection at O
The drinks were delicious  although a bit sweet for my taste your girl friend will probably loooove them but not particuarly strong
The Marriott burger creme  bru00fblu00e9e drinks and fromage board was very good
This is not a place you can go and drink beers and margaritas or even get fresh guac but they serve some DAMN good tacos with amazing flavors
Wonderful hibicus tea and mint water are positioned where you can fill your glasses as you wish
The bar staff were chatty and friendly food was good and the beer selection was pretty great too
With all that mediocrity I must admit that the wine was delicious we had the Shiraz and the CabSav
We had the Oktoberfest and SunUp Ambers and both were REALLY good beers
The happy hour here and at all Flo's places is pretty sweet 1/2 off all appetizers table or bar and same with drinks
These folks have fantastic Happy Hour specials constantly actual good food a decent beer selection covered/misted patio with sports TVs and constant fantastic service
00 for for an amazing meal and two glasses of wine for two people
The Food was delicious the drinks were well made and the service was spot-onI ordered the Jumbo Crispy Chimichanga I have a bit of a love affair with chimichanga's and this dish did not disappoint
The sandwiches are great pizza is good and they sell wine
The drinks were pretty good but a little expensive but i'am in phx so i guess i should expect it to be a coastly night
Happy hour drinks are pretty good almost everything we tried was fantastic
As a lover of a good brew I really enjoy going to The Lost Leaf for a drink
It was recommended to me by the bartender and he had recommended three other stellar beers to my friend and me while we were there
Their drinks are usually pretty good and the service is awesome
Plenty of parking across the roundabout excellent drinks they make their own tonic
They provided a recommendation of Best Glass for the install
The service has always been so-so but the food beer and music have always been excellent
Most brewery's have either good beer or good food
Or should I say amazing beer and amazing food
The topper to the experience is that they had some only a few but good choices of beer on tap & offered a great deal on ordering a pitcher vs an individual glass
They excel at their namesake with tasty noodles and more offerings than you can shake a wet noodle at
While the drinks my manhattan and her mojito were quite good they were also quite pricey
If you pass on the drink it's still $4 but that's amazingly reasonable
Happy hour specials are fantastic -- $5 wines and $1 bruschetta per piece among other fantastic appetizer deals
As a new place it's important to generate positive buzz with quality food/drink great service and pleasant atmosphere
A good place to relax with a beer and watch some sports
Our waiter was cool even if he did use a bit too much hair gel and made some good recommendations for drinks to be paired with the food
Probably not my first choice if I'm in the area but good enough if you want some wine and appetizers
~ The day drinker $9 a magical grapefruit flavored adult beverage and the Irish Sour $ trust don't be afraid of the egg white
He did an awesome job of recommending a delicious wine for my enjoyment and my Mister selected his usual gin and tonic
There are some good beer and margarita specials some nights but the vibe gets so convoluted it's hard to drink in peace
But honestly if you love watching a game good beer and drink specials and want to nibble on some buffalo chicken dip this is your place
Fibber Magees is definitely a good destination for food and drink
The drink I got was very good a cucumber lemonade that wasn't too sweet
The petite sirloin was cooked as ordered rare but lacked flavor and again still had silverskin attached making the last piece memorable for its chewiness
The food and drinks are reasonably priced with a very good selection
It was an excellent tasty drink BUT where was the alcohol
We ordered our pizza and drinks; the pizza was good but there were still flies all over the place
They had a wine aisle with quite a few good reasonably priced choices and a meat aisle with plenty of sausages beef pork and chicken cuts
Enjoyed the eclectic atmosphere and the great adjectives my server used to describe the wine
also thought the wine tasting - 3 pours of either a flight of red or white - was really cool and a good way to try wines I would not normally shell out for a ful glass or bottle
I was fine with that since I only wanted an appetizer and a glass or two of wine
They have a good wine list I started with a chardonnay the Diamond T which pairs perfectly with seafood - a little pricey at $12
They also serve a very good root beer on tap the mac and cheese was some of the best I have had and I liked the atmosphere
Another super cool thing about JoBot is that they have late hours EVERY day so when you need a drink snack or tasty crepe you have a spot to get your fix
We chose not to have any wine that evening - perhaps that was my problem although we enjoyed the experience would not choose to repeat it
Tommy V's is a delightful twist on old town dining where fine wines come with a surprisingly  refreshing price and food pairings  are always fresh and so delicious
When I set out to go to happy hour last week I didn't expect Prince Edward Island Mussels and a most fantastic wine that our waiter recommended
Tommy V's has the recipe for success in good cuisine wine and ambiance
Before any food arrived I was already impressed with chic wine carafes dark wood chopsticks and unique ultra-trendy flatware
On both occasions I've dined here we passed the time with drinks and appetizers at the bar
I choose to sit outside since it was so nice and I was immediately helped and got a drink fast  good start
The redeeming element was the AMAZING pumpkin porter beer we had
Our server did us right by recommending this seasonal beer when we were ready to order something off the regular tap menu
The pizza was tasty the cheesy bread was yum and the drinks were kept full
I love what R+D is going for here swank some tricky mixing and top quality drinks
7 starsEve award wagyu pastrami--best pastrami ever sorry NYC delisCost to worth it rating 4 $150 for 2 including multiple glasses of wine shared app and dessert--quality of food is definitely worth that and have paid more for lesser mealsHighlights- Wagyu pastrami A-maz-ing
The drinks were very good and inexpensive
Beer was super good and prices spot on for quality and service received
The beer is tasty and I meet Rebbecca
The service was excellent our drinks were always full and the food timing was perfect
Our waitress also suggested that we try the blueberry honey wine which was AMAZING
For a chain restaurant Fleming's does it right; nice decor impeccable food excellent service and over 100 different types of wine
The additional support wait staff was very attentive so much so that when like the klutz that I am spilled the last sip of wine all over myself he quickly took my sweater to the bathroom where he blotted it with ice water and handed it back to me in a Fleming's handle bag and recommended that I take it to the dry cleaners and ask that they treat it with the spray that removes wine stains
The beer's ok priced no more or less than other places and it's usually a good time
I had some beer that was good and for some reason I enjoyed the tall thinner glasses it was served in
The drink prices are good two dollar beers and seating is plentiful including a nice little patio
Snacks are also good and high quality the Irish Chips come with two great sauces and are a great snack over many drinks
We tried a couple of their signature drinks and they were all very good and unique to say the least
It was good but I was bummed that they didn't have blue cheese olives which are my fav in martinis
The hike isn't too challenging but just enough to feel like you've gotten a workout and are totally deserving of a delicious sonoran brewing company beer from the steakhouse near the parking lot
So while I don't claim to be an expert on all things cool I have become a pretty good expert on great beer
Citizen Public House has excellent food and drinks
Their glass coke bottles are the tall ones so you get your moneys worth too
Now I have to be fair and admit that I am not one to hold my liquor and it probably didn't help that I had 5 glasses of wine before I went but the martinis here- although good are lethal
With the 2 meals appetizer and 6 martinis the total bill was still under 150
It was a good lunch a fun time and worth the drive from Chandler-and the beer was great too
My plate of ravioli mushroom appetizer and glass of house Cabernet came up to $36
SO that too me is not fresh squeezed and not worth $4 a glass
I swear I said I can drink this stuff its so good
The idea of the Cornish Pasty lends itself to a diverse palate and the desserts the beer selection even the coffee here is very good
Overall I think Rula Bula is worth it for happy hour drinks and apps but not for an actual meal
The place offers a wide variety of blonds ales stouts and everything in-between as well as specialty beers you don't usually find in most bars 3 Philosophers never heard of it before so good and all the Rogues
This is a BEER BAR I don't remember if they do have other alcohol or wine and I really don't care because I was just so interested in the extensive and potentially delicious selections
Then came another moment which sums up this amazing restaurant - I was offered fruit accompaniments with my glass of regular water
I'm not a wine drinker but I'd say about half the store is their wine selection so I'd assume its pretty good
10-Cane is a delicious and I can drink it like water and b is usually between $30-$40 at other places
Their wine selection is wonderful and the staff is extremely knowledgeable
Each time I go I learn something new about wine and have had the pleasure of tasting some unique and flavorful vino's
We purchased a Groupon for a wine flight and appetizers
The wine selection is amazing here but it would be nothing without the educated considerate polite and helpful employees
If you haven't been in yet and you love to lounge drink wine and listed to good music-GO HERE
We shared a order of hummus for apps which was really good especially the pita bread and I ordered a Four Peaks cheeseburger with pepper jack cheese which came with beer battered fries while my friend got the 8th Street Ale chicken strips
The drink was deliciously sweet and the pie was spicy
I usually don't like flavored wines and I loathe wines that are too sweet
And I usually don't like apple flavored drinks
-rotisserie chicken enjoyed it with the green rice and paired with a great white wine
5 starsCost to worth it rating 2 $18 for a wine flight; overpriced to supplement the viewHighlights- View high level where you can look down upon the buildings of downtown Phoenix- Rotation effect trippy but fun
But they have a wine bar next door and it is TOTALLY worth the wait
TIPS-* Try their breakfast on Sat/Sun* If eating dinner order some of the veg NOSH and don't be afraid to get a couple to try the 3 pair is the best deal* Pizza's are all very good* The meat/cheese board also yummy* Extensive wine menu
Our server recommended fine cocktails and told us about a beer on special that I loved photo posted
Comfortable vibe friendly staff good beer selection ample parking reasonable prices nice patio and from the photos a big hit with our local newscasters
This unique little Japanese tapas and sake bar serves up specialty fare at delicious prices
$5 pitcher of landshark beer was good
If you want a great burger and don't want to take out a second mortgage on your house then go to The Original Wineburger on 19th and Bethany the burgers aren't as fancy but just as good or maybe even a tad better
This Monterey County wine has flavors of cherry strawberry red currant notes and is well balanced
The food was really good and who can complain with $2 beers and a nice patio
Finally our drinks came and they were not very good and quite small for the high price
I would recommend that you eat outside of the stadium and save room for a few drinks when you get inside
I'd recommend hitting the Wendy's across the walkway first then bring it into TdT and order a beer
Tuesday is half priced tequila all day long which is a tremendous value for happy hour along with discounted Beer/Wine and appetizers
00 and they get a fairly good sized pizza I think it's their medium and a drink
Haven't been to this location in a while but it had always been solid good food great service awesome beers
The good news is the beers are still awesome
They have a pretty good selection of champagne and wine
A few minutes passed by my delicious cab arrived I love the wine glasses there
It was happy hour so we got some good deal on appetizers and drinks
I would recommend Don & Charlie's just for drinks at happy hour
After you pick up your favorite fruit drink head over to the grill for some carne asada street tacos but only order two because you'll want to save room for the seafood bar where you will find a deliciouso shrimp ceviche at a very reasonably price
BEERCrappy airport selection Bud/Miller/Coors with FAT TIRE being the most flavorful option
and the drinks are more pricey than they should be for the flavor
I'll admit to drinking the extra broth it was just so good
Theirs is good enough to drink with out the foam
One caveat I'm an Americano drinker by default and I don't like when places recommend nay insist you get the iced coffee alternative instead
In their liquor section they have anamazing assortment of Eastern European and Asian beers and wines
the bags/sunglasses/jewelry/gloves/shoes/scarves - all pretty good usually love the styles but again with the price to quality ratio i rarely buy
Good selection of wine by the glass and beer but their signature drinks were not printed on the menu which was a miss because they have great Pear margarita's
You can guy a $17 bottle of wine there and take it to go good deal or pay $35 for the same bottle to drink it at the restaurant
When you first walk in there is an amazing tall wall of beautifully showcased wines - all kinds
The wine the ambiance the service the FOOD - we had a wonderful and memorable dinner here
In today's environment of zero tolerance of drinking and driving for millions of good reasons its good to have a phone number programmed in your cell phone that is truly useful when you've had a little too much to drink
Overall drinks from 530 - 7 is recommended strongly
Mmmmm the orange blossom beer is worth the trip every time
I think this place is a good hang out spot that has a wonderful and large beer selection and great food
Everything from the nachos to the beer battered fries to the beer bread is good
The food is really good and the drinks are strong so you feel like you are getting your moneys worth
Bar service at the wedding was very good and they had a huge selection of beer wine and liquor which is always nice
They have a pretty good wine selection at least for this occasional wine-drinker and a great beer selection for a grocery store
*definition of soooo nice and helpful She answered all our questions regarding level of spiciness and confusion over which entrees included noodles or rice patiently and with a smile; suggested one of the most delicious fried banana/ice cream desserts I've ever had; and one time she realized we weren't finished with our beers when our tightly packaged food was place on the bar so she spent five minutes undoing the tie to poke holes in the to-go boxes so the steam could escape and not make our food sweaty
Papago Brewing Co's Orange Blossom beer is SO GOOD
The beer was excellent as well - thanks Four Peaks for a wonderful evening
They have every flavor of midlabel Pinnacle I believe Vodka you can think of and serve up spritzers in pint glasses for 7 dollars
Our server was excellent -- she was attentive without being annoying and kept our glasses of iced tea full -- which was a good thing after being at the pool most of the day
We ordered a nice bottle of red wine the dolmeh for an appetizer Paul had the lamb kababs and I had the  Eden's grill chicken
Typical bar fare with certain dishes spicy beer cheese fries that will stay with you and not in a good way
On the other hand if you eat before you go and are merely looking for a place to kick back and have a beer or three while watching the Dbacks or Cards or play trivia then Hazelwoods is an option worth considering
The burger and fries were tasty and the beer was cold
I've been many many times and the service is always good the food is always consistently good and the drinks are not expensive and are potent - I like that
After a couple of minutes an older man whom I can only describe as either the manager or owner with a pseudo-faux hawk hairstyle piercings black hipster glasses took our appetizer order which we promptly gave and asked to be brought out before the meal as we were still checking out the dinner menu
It is a good place go to watch a game on TV and have a few beers
It's definitely worth the drive into Central Phoenix - all the more because it's within a few blocks of Trader Joe's Total Wine & More Duck and Decanter and about 2 dozen other great stores where I can make a beautiful little shopping spree out of it if need be
The service was spotty at best and the wine was good
Plus good drink pure coconut juice with coconut bits to chew on
the flight of three chardonnay wines we ordered contained one that tasted very good one that was very rough and tasted like instant head ache and one in between
They did have a good beer selection and all of those besides the super cheap ones were $5 each
We had a round of drinks my sangria was really good DH and a jack and ginger which he liked and our friend had a lemonade cocktail which he enjoyed so he had another
And the Chihuly glass installation was wonderful
Great place for a non-hurried meal good wine and good prices
I cant say enough good things about ol Tops Liquors they let me bring my 70 lbs airedale terrier in the store for christ sakes
I started visiting just to pick up the Tammie Coe coconut cupcakes amazing then would get espresso - very nice - huge cups for a little drink fun
The basics like refilling drinks smiling addressing people as sir/mam apologizing if items are forgotten are basic elements of good service at a fine dining restaurant yet it was lacking here
Very nice happy hour prices and good drinks
Their BBQ sauce is very unique only wish they would have it on the table but I would drink it then and they came up with a new mustard based Carolina sauce which is scrumdelicious
The bill was less than $20 for the pizza appetizer a glass of wine and a glass of beer
we had sangria and the house red for drinks both were excellent
Two stars for cheap drinks and good music though
The brussel sprouts were also really delicious they were lightly charred and caramelized with a delicious white wine and mustard glaze
The service was friendly and I really can't wait to come back with another bottle of good wine in the near future
It seems like everyone has that one dive bar that they're just in love with where the bartenders know you and hook you up with a free drink or two once in a while where the ambiance is nothing to write home about but somehow it always manages to provide a good time
5 hour wait whereupon i generally drink wine for the durationwhich might be part of the reason the pie is so good the limoncello at Cibo generally floors me just as well in a quarter of the time
Anyway the drinks were prompt and I'll just say it That's a pretty fucking good lemonade
After looking at the menu we decided we would just have drinks and share an appetizer
I did enjoy a good Vietnamese beer but I don't remember what kind it was
- super friendly staff and excellent service- fair prices- great daily soups- good lattes- yummy baked goods baked on the premises- free wi-fi- very accessible meeting location for getting together with friends- very close to the library great for grabbing a book and settling in with a drink to read for a while- very clean restrooms a girl's gotta go after settling in with a drink
Although the menu is a bit on the pricey side the bites they offer are quite delicious and go well with a glass of champagne and deliciously crisp cucumber and lemon water
But if you are looking for a decent deal and to have a drink and good enough sushi this is the place
their smash drinks are amazing and i'm partial to the s'mores one
1 Wine - I had a Cabernet - It was good but not spectacular
The refreshments are good and food and drink prices are not inflated and more reasonable that those at the sports stadiums
A server once recommended a blueberry lemon drop and it's been my favorite drink ever since
Absolutly LUV the neighborhood nites special @ M&T - combine that with happy hour = an amazing deal and a fabby nite out GR8 drinks good wines by the glass - o and did u know kids eat free 5-6
Good beer selection also a good list of signature drinks that I plan to try on my next visit
We had a night of drinking ahead and he kept our water glasses full at every turn which is something any good bartender should do instead of only focusing on the alcohol
The food is good the beer is cool the atmosphere is so-so
Maybe if I went back at happy hour Mon-Fri 3-6pm or Thurs 10-close and got cheap beer and half-priced appetizers I would feel different as they were in my book pretty overpriced
Have something to drink and some appetizers and if you feel like staying and eating more the food is just right for that kind of night
The Cabanas looked cozy and comfortable and the drinks were good
My drink was kept filled without me having to ask for it and I think everyone else at the table enjoyed everything they were eating
Service was very good also my glass was never empty
And again I'm not hating on the AYCE situation but when you charge almost ten bones for it with no drink included give me some flavor
Fundamentally the drinks are never very good
Food and drink aside any good cafe needs good atmosphere and this one blows everything I've seen out of the water
Recommend yellow tail and salmon nigiri / spicy ribbon rollTry Orion beer did you know the US versions of Kirin/Sapporo/Asahi are all NOT brewed in Japan
I enjoyed a great lunch complete with tiny birds and a glass of white wine
These aren't your Bevmo wine tastings where they try to sell you the flavor of the week
The berista's are good and the drinks are real good
I enjoyed the beer and wine garden and the fact that there were multiple breweries represented there
I'll definitely be returning to 5th and Wine for more of the bubbly and to try their wonderful looking menu
Delicious beer which happily can be found at a lot of places in Phoenix
Pros  The bartender who made my mojito was on point - she was smiling provided quick service and the drink was good
The pasta had a light red wine sauce my mushrooms were swapped by the chef for lovely sweet peas the rabbit was done as a confit in such a way that it almost became a chunky sauce for the pasta and it just tasted so good I couldn't stop eating
You're going for good grub and a bottomless drink cup
Some of us arrived a little earlier so we had drinks at the bar while the rest of our party arrived; I started with one of their delicious martini's
But then again I'm not there to socialize or drink I'm there to hear good music
This guy stocks beers that are actually interesting hard to find and really worth the trip
Overall Blue 32 is a great place to come for good food and drinks while you're watching your favorite team
The food is good the wine list is okay but as usual it's really just another chain restaurant
This appetizer is very light and healthy and almost reminds me of a seaweed salad- Spicy noodles w/ pork - Very good and included more veggies carrots broccoli and cabbage than Pad Thai although I prefer the Pad Thai flavors over this particular sauce; also a good sized portion and plenty for two to share- Coconut ice cream w/ fried bananas - DELICIOUS; this was decadent and an amazing combination of flavors; the fried bananas were light and fluffy not greasy and a perfect balance to the ice cream which had chunks of pineapple; my dining companion felt that it could have used more coconutOverall it was a great lunch and they even continued refilling our drinks as we sat there and talked for about two hours
The food was great drinks were yummy- I had a blue curacao martini that was so good
I know that sometimes a batch can fly out faster than expected and I still enjoyed the other beers they had available
It is also a great place to grab a glass of wine or one of several amazing cocktails day time or evening
The Im-port mixed drink was very unique in flavor and almost sweet - reminiscent of a dessert port
I'll let it slide though because he was so good otherwise and brought us tons of other yummy food and drinks quickly after we placed the order and I applaud him for that on such a busy night the end of restaurant week this past Sunday
The by the glass wines are usually very good although they mostly will be ones you have never heard of
The pretzel was tasty but the beer cheese was no better than melted Kraft cheddar edible but very uninspiring
The service isn't particularly good - our bills got mixed up it took forever to get our fries and you could sit at the bar with an empty glass for far too much time
This was totally baffling considering the level of food and drink quality associated with the Phoenician resort and the steakhouse itself
' - this has become a trigger to me and immediately puts me on the defensive the first thing I want to hear is 'can I start you out with a drink or appetizer
The only drinks on the specialty menu had tequila but the das boote was recommended as a particularly girly drink
With as busy as they were she still had enough time to explain some beers to me and give me some great recommendations
I enjoyed the Strawberry & Pecan salad the Coca Cola came in the tall version of the old bottles glass
for 2 Keg sized martinis a bottle of wine an appetizer and 2 steak dinners
Okay when is a beer a value at 4 dollars I mean  seriously being that I just paid 6 bucks for a brat that's pretty pathetic I'd at least like the decency of having a good size beer to help wash down the piss boiled frank I just overpaid the crap out of for
To sum it up the value beer is tiny and the only one worth buying IMO is the 9 dollar 24 ouncer or even better the 10
Finally the third family order one adult appetizer and a beer
Our bill came to $57 which included three sandwiches an appetizer 1 beer and 1 soda
grilled chicken panini mahi mahi sandwich Haagen Dazs malts a few very good wines fun beer combinations
Overall the inside is one of the best part of the airport with a good amount of places to eat and drink and alright walking between the different gates
Pretty reasonably priced and the food and wine is delicious
Both appetizers were delicious and the portion sizes were small enough for the sauvignon blanc wine pairing that went with both of our appetizers
Both paired wonderfully with the selected wines and the vegetables worked into both dishes in such a way that they both had a good clean flavor to both of them
Know how Starbucks isn't so much a coffee place as an oversweetened flavored coffee drink place
They had plenty of beer on tap and like any good sports bar
We had a good time but if I were to ever go here again I would probably just go for chips drinks and appetizers which I could get somewhere else anyway
My first stop is at the bar to indulge in there wonderful martinis and if you are lucky Tammy will be working
Or maybe I had too much beer and this review tainted with sexual innuendos is worthless
The atmosphere was very relaxed and there were others nearby sharing a bottle of wine or just finishing up their lunch with good conversation
Almost thirty bucks for 2 sandwiches one salad and a drink is a bit extreme especially when the crusty bread was hard as a rock and the salad completely lacked in flavor
Listen if you're looking for the typical Scottsdale bar cheap drinks thrown together by a busy bartender who doesn't get that pouring heavy isn't the same as pouring a good drink or you want drink your way Burger King style go somewhere else
Very personal service some good conversation and excellent food and wine
The server reply oh yes it's good you tell me we make our flavored drink here slush
She first looked pissed probably cussed under her breath and than insisted that they ALWAYS make their flavored drink in their restaurant slush
As for the drinks GMT was good; Honeydew BMT was way too sweet and undrinkable
They have an excellent wine list and a hoppin' bar scene
So I took my date out last weekend for a real sit down dinner and fine wine and it was mostly good
I thought the wine and food were fine the booth was a good spot
I have been here twice now and it's a good place to come have a few beers
The service is good and friendly and prices are very reasonable around 5-7 per beer
Drinks are excellent and fresh and the staff has always been friendly
They have a good happy hour from 3-6 and then a drink special every night fro 9-closing
The sides are wonderful the drinks are what you'd expect to have if sitting on a wraparound porch in the antebellum south
There are two things that keep Maizie's from being five star in my book1 - It is so warm that I felt like I was having early onset menopause2 - They are in an unfortunate location if you are going northbound on Central because you have to flip a biatchHere are the things that make Maizie's pretty awesome1 - $3 Burger Night Monday2 - $3 Beers during HH3 - $5 Bruschetta that is freaking amazing4 - Awesome bathroom with tasty smelling orange lotion5 - Cool looking bar6 - Big open windows7 - Cool Aesthetics8 - Kung Fu Girl Riesling9 - Friendly accommodating staff especially for our large party10- Lot's of options for everything Food Wine BeerI really liked Maizie's a lot and I cannot wait to be back
99 doesn't include drinks like King's does but TOTALLY worth it
Three of us a bottle of wine and appetizer the bill was less than $80
we found that if it's too crowded inside then it's easy enough go outside to the awesome patio area to enjoy our beer and goodies
Prices on drinks are great they have a good happy hour and I have never been disappointed by the food
We enjoyed a stroll throughout the property post entertainment dinner and drinks and I was impressed with the layout of the property and the many resort/spa options
So even if I enjoyed drinking straight corn syrup as opposed to gay corn syrup which is FABULOUS this stuff was entirely off limits for me
Takes awhile to get a drink from the bar but that's a good and bad thing
We enjoyed pouring our own beers happy hour prices are very good
Happy hour from 5-7 then reverse happy hour from 10-midnight featuring great discounts on craft beers house made sangria select wines and amazing appetizers
The table right next to us had an amazing server who brought them two orders of drinks in the time it took to get my water glass refilled
They have some tasty food and all of the wines I had were great and all of the many many others looked fantastic as well
My best advise is find a few dishes you do like and stick with those  The beers here are good but not phenomenal; it would be nice to see 4 Peaks expand as a brewery with new beers
His place is small and cozy he does have some servers that can occasionally need a kick but the food and some good wine will erase that thought pretty quickly
We had missed happy hour but still indulged in the margaritas $8 and wine as well as appetizers
I had looked over the wine list before ordering my marg good choice and they had glasses starting at $6 so it is surprising the house wine was over twice that
Will definitely be again and we recommend reviewing the wine list before ordering   If your going to spend $13/glass it may as well be something you love
Go to the bar and have a pre dinner drinkeat in the bar if you can Order a good bottle of red and some meat
Backhanded though it may be I think it was his way of admitting that he couldn't think of a reason to sneer at us locals as we enjoyed our wine and cheese
I've always enjoyed sake especially nigori but have never given Shochu a try
The drink prices are reasonable and I highly recommend this place on a sunny afternoon
After ordering our drinks we decided to splurge on an appetizer so we started out with the Queso Fundido
Their website lists which beers will be offered cask-conditioned during the coming week and it's well worth planning your trip accordingly
Crispy beer-battered and made with real fish and served with damn good fries
Nothing better than a good buritto and a cold beer @ the ball yard
Seasonal beers are good but I have never had a great one
All the drinks are good including the Jasmine iced tea the Ginger limeade and the Vietnemese iced coffee
The hotel bar/restaurant isn't worth the free drink coupon
I tried the wine burger which is slowly grilled with red wine sangria topped with Swiss and sauteed mushrooms annnnnnnnnnnnd its amazing
As you can imagine at a strip-center type chain restaurant it's not exciting although the staff actually seem to have a good idea of wine pairing in general for those who are new to wine
We had some fun cocktails with mango flavor black cherry mojito and martinis
The happy hour prices looked pretty good $2 hot sake $3 beer $4-5 cocktails
Decent crowd overpriced drinks teeny dance floor good selection of d'bags to giggle at
tried it and did NOT like it' *I did ask #3036 to recommend a white wine with my dish - he was a bit befuddled i don't think we use that word enough
$15 for sandwich drink and chips is too much money to spend on a lunch that while very delicious still left me a bit hungry at the end
The wine list is spartan but that is a sacrifice you'll have to make for their good healthful options
Stop by Hana Japanese Eatery in Central Phoenix for simple quality ingredients prepared lovingly and skillfully by a knowledgeable staff and remember something else important while they will tempt your palate with a plethora of flavors and gladly fill your belly the restaurant is strictly BYOB so if you like beer sake or wine with your meal you'd better bring your own
The minimum is easy to meet with a drink and dessert - and worth every penny
I feel that this would be a great place to spend some time with good wine and good friends
The staff was all really nice and made a good stiff drink so no complaints there and they had a lil area in which the ones whom thought they could dance could rock it out to say the least
The tasty seared ahi taco inspired this haikuI walk across sandAnd find myself swelteringIn need of a drinkThe salty rim callsMy dry mouth is quickly quenchedAs Richard brings chipsThe local spouts offAnd teaches new crude phrasesAs the staff shakes headsMargarita threeThoughts of a supposed friendprompt melancholyThen regulars laughthe seared ahi taco arrivesculinary hug
Both the drinks and the service were consistently good
The wine selection was good and for just a wine drinker and by no means an expert i appreciated the server sorry can't remember his name listening to my likes and dislikes and then choosing the perfect wine for me that was impressive
We had the crabcakes and shrimp san remo for appetizers 5 glasses of the Emerald bay house chard$5 a glass not bad two entrees and a snickers cheesecake desert for $148 with tax
huh no ok lemme try again one of those type of deals  I order my drink and she makes this huge ass like 44oz Bladder buster drink and its $11 or 12 bucks good deal but she didn't mention the price or how huge it was
I didn't even get close finishing the drink so not a good deal that night
Their coffee drinks are also pretty good although I have to ask for a bit less sugar
We sampled a few of their specialty cocktails on happy hour great drinks at a good price and had the 'tender belly' bacon fat heirloom popcorn
Just because it's 801 or 701 and it's busy doesn't mean you can't do the honorable thing and do a customer a favor by offering one last drink or appetizer at a happy hour price
Service was good I think the waiter kept pushing drinks on us haha
However it is all worth it for the bocce ball court and the quality of their drinks and food
For an additioal fee you can add a wine pairing to each course which I highly recommend
Quady Elysium Red Muscat Dessert Winepaired with chocolate pate with olive oil and sea salt Amazing likely our favorite item amongst the coursesI cannot give this place five stars due to our long wait time and the very small size of the portions versus the price
I chose the # 62 which was pretty good and I even tried a boba drink which was also very good
Would love to go back to this place to try the beer and maybe appetizers
My friend recommended the Blueberry Hill drink Vodka blueberry mint lime soda water
It's worth noting that for my second drink of the evening I couldn't resist the Paper Bag Special for $1
About to go run amuck in the city just didn't know where to go a friend and I wanted good times cheap drinks and to flirt with boys
Roasted Pernil pork creamy jalapeno corn and a delicious glass of white sangria with pear--what's NOT to love
Chris and Kiefer were nicer than they needed to be and the food and wine was delicious and priced ridiculously well for what you get
I highly HIGHLY recommend this place if you enjoy any kind laid back wine induced entertaining nights
The combination of Japanese-inspired tapas plus an uber-awesome bottle of sake recommended by Nobu created the best tasting evening I've ever had
Ask Nobu-san to recommend a bottle of sake and take a taxi home
We were excited at the happy hour options and enjoyed a couple $1 beers
Tonight was actually our second night at the Brat Haus - the first time we went for a few beers a game of washers and to try the bavarian pretzels - they were absolutely delicious that night  so we decided to go back
He said that it was peppery and had no beer flavor and he didn't enjoy it at all
The happy hour drink menu was a good size and variety of cocktails beers mixes and specialty drinks
Requisite pho dishes are good and the fresh coconut soda drink is a delightfully refreshing
If you are a local Greasewood Flat is a great place to go on a weekday afternoon to get a good burger a cold beer and have it somewhere other than a chain burger joint
The bacon was crisp and the Jalapenos burnt but in a good way the Wineburger was great
Carly's is a small bistro offering an excellent beer and drink selection along with your typical bistro fare including wraps sandwiches salads and some appetizers
Now in this great atmosphere that they've created at TMI is a plethora of wonderful food and drinks
please read moreWeekday mornings--business professionals and older retired gents in shorts and polo shirts enjoying morning coffee and the ahem viewWeekday lunch--biz pros who didn't eat there for breakfast but work with-in walking distanceWeekend mornings 8-9am--locals who know how good the food is and don't want to wait for itWeekend mornings 9-10am--sun-burned tourists especially bad during Spring Training weeks expect kids so over their parents that their eyes may be permanently stuck in the back of their heads Weekend mornings 10am on--Snotsdale hipsters ASU co-eds Affliction t-shirts over-sized sunglasses trucker hats Coach bags flip-flopsOkay so this was more about the atmosphere than the food which is worth putting up with the above for
I highly recommend this restaurant for food drinks wine list and local residents
They had live music and plenty of tasty cold beer
The original plan was to get dinner but the wine fries and good conversation were enough to fill us up and take us to the end of the night
'Iced Tea' - Bacardi Limon Lemon & Mint 'Wrath of McGrath' - A Shiner Bock Beer with a Shot of 100 Proof Smirnoff Jalapeno Vodka drizzled over it & a Squeeze of LimeFor an appetizer I tried the Cockles and Craw Fish with a roasted garlic butter sauce with kaffir lime
Firstly they have delicious drink options
In all we both had our entrees an appetizer desert and 4 drinks for under $100
This year I've been to The Great Arizona Beer Festival and the Arizona Chicks with Picks Music Fest both of which were amazingly fun and relaxing
In all the ambiance especially if your outdoors is great the food is good even admitting I'm not a big Italian cuisine fan and the prices are very reasonable meal + beer + tip = just over $20
Good place for watching games & having a beer at the bar but not recommened if you are going for dinner
I have yet to try their root beer and their desserts but I can imagine they are both very tasty given than everything else has been enjoyable
I was in the mood for some sushi and hadn't been here in a long time but remembered good things so we popped in for some happy hour sushi and drinks on Friday
The drinks were were strong and affordable though I recommend asking for a particular tequila if you're ordering a margarita this is a very specific issue since they specialize in martinis and I happen to be a tequila fan since the well tequila isn't one of my favorites
The wine list is good not great  the food is good and yes it is cool the setting and all that shit
But I have to say that really turned out to be not a bad thing as our server was excellent the food was excellent and the wine was smooth and wondeful
For the price the wine tasting is well worth it
If you become a Su Vino Club Card Member they will send you coupons for free wine tastings so it's definitely worth it
Even people who don't enjoy wine will find at least one flavor they like
Summer Rain is very refreshing and fruity perfect for someone who doesn't know wine well or just wants something delicious
We went across the walk way to The Rose and Crown sat right down and had wonderful beer and fish and chips
Cory gave us a Wine 101 which was super entertaining down to earth and a wonderful learning experience all at the same time
Assuming this summer shandy was the same as every other summer shandy I've had beer mixed with lemonade I agreed to try it on the waiter's It's amazingWhat I was given haunts me in my dreams
I took a date here as we both heard good things about it and both of us were craving wine and pizza
a great little mexican place to hit up for some drinks and good food
After ordering my drink which comes in a take-out cup and I ordered iced-tea not the famous Horchata which seems well worth trying you get a basket of tips and then you can go hit the salsa bar which has at least a dozen different types of salsa
True the view is spectacular and the drinks are very good
Wine and cocktails were good and most of the food was as well
When you finally reach the summit however the view is worth every single step up that godforsaken trail
This bar was kind of dumpy smoky and definitely not filled with pretty Scottsdale people which is usually right up my alley but they didn't have much good beer and like I mentioned the karaoke was painful
It's fun the food is good and as I said before you can bring your own beer
Happy Hour goes from 4 to 7 and you get a dollar off beers and 2 bucks off appetizers
Hubby had a glass of prosecco that was pretty good but too dry for my taste
Food is par - I would recommend this place for drinks only
We had some wine and a couple appetizers while I destroyed my wife in bowling snicker
The food is always good and the drinks are among the best in the valley
Getting buzzed on delicious drinks early in the day followed by shopping is a great way to spend a Saturday or Sunday
Beer Pretty good selection on tap and bottled
Don't think i'll be going to a Hooters again for a while For an overpriced beer and hot girls I prefer going to a place like Tilted Kilt where at least the food is good
The drink specials are really good the mixed drinks are tasty my fiance loves the Rancherita
Always wanted to come here for dinner its a BYOB place and nestled right next door to AZ Wine Co a fantastic wine shop complete with tastings helpful staff and an amazing selection of wines
However after he took our order of a couple of beers and a couple of appetizers he lost his friendly demeanor
The appetizers and beer were tasty and a little pricey but not worth going back for
If you have an open mind and you want truly beautiful people a good atmosphere good music and great beer
They manage to make mochas and chai lattes that don't immediately send people into insulin shock if you like those drinks which is worth any stars off from weird indoor seating layouts
We were immediately greeted with a glass of champagne and a Yelp goodie bag I was most excited for the silly straw inside
Despite having about as many restaurants per capita as is physically possible Old Town offers up a pretty meager selection of wine bars and good Mexican food but that's a topic for another time
Luckily 5th and Wine has upped the ante since taking over from Fine's Cellar and is quickly becoming one of my favorite spotsThe good-Perfect for just drinks appetizers full meal large group date night etc
-Fantastic bruschetta and appetizers pair well with the vino-Good wine selection and price points-Fantastic HH specials with $5 glasses and $20 bottles-Excellent service-Live music on the weekends nice patioThe bad-Appetizers are definitely their forte entrees have been hit and miss-I had a prime rib bbq sandwich that had more salt in it than the Dead Sea
If you do eat here order just 2 appetizers and have drinks
I took the server's suggestion and tried the beer bread steak sandwich which was essentially a cheese steak with onions and peppers served in a delicious homemade beer bread - kind of like a moist soft chewy tortilla
And I really liked the wine our server recommended --an organic red from Spain
I hope to sit outside and enjoy delicious food and drinks with friends soon
Rent a pool table order some food and drinks and you're good for hours
Here are some of my favorites some have meat from before I was a vegetarian*the medchilada a giant burrito wrapped in lavosh no longer on menu but they still make them upon request at this location* the hummus I like half roasted red bell pepper and half cilantro jalapeno this explodes with flavor and is a great starter for non-hummus consumers* tsatziki they have the best tsatziki ever omg just the right amount of seasoning I could drink this stuff* gambas con ajo jumbo shrimp swimming in a delicious light red sauce served with a pesto cheese covered pita* MTB mozzarella tomato basil with evoo and balsamic huge slices and very fresh* grilled vegetable salad huge and covered in yummy veggies thought it would be weird to have hot veggies on a bed of salad but oh-no-sir this is sooo yummy
It tasted like chiles and a splash of rice wine vinegar- no other flavors present
A good after work place to grab a drink or watch the game with friends but do yourself a favor and grab some authentic mexican that us Phoenicians are blessed with when it comes time to eat
Great fast service with good drink and wine selection
Open up another lane for goodness sake 2 is obviously not enough
Despite the fact that the sushi bar stools are for midgets and they gave me a dirty wine glass it is quite possible that the sushi chefs at Celsius fed me the most wonderful sushi I've ever had in Phoenix

Armitage has a large selection of wines and the staff is knowledgeable with recommendations
The Happy Hour here is usually pretty decent with a fairly large offering of appetizers for cheap and cheap martinis as well
The beer is cheap and the service is good
I couldn't even recommend this as a meeting-for-a-beer-before-the-game spot as the set-up is awkward when you do not have access to a table or stool and you likely won't so while standing up in the bar you often feel like you are in someone's way -- either the patrons fighting for elbow room to gnaw their sliders or the pitifully eye-made wait staff expediting that woeful fare
I went in here to pick out a gift and ended up emerging 2 hours later with not only my wine gift but with more knowledge on wine and feeling pretty good after indulging in a tasting as well
That`s how I ended up staying for the tasting and getting a worthy intro on four different wines with a cheese plate delish
Adding whipped cream on top made it a bit too creamy of a hot chocolate and lost a bit of the chocolate flavor so without whipped cream this was a great way to have a warm and sweet drink

We found a table right away and I ordered the IPA it was delicious and icy cold as a tap beer should be
The pints were only $5 so that was a perfect price for some great beer and I really got a good vibe the server was very good and friendly and overall the Roosevelt had a kind of laid back feel to it
Excellent drink selection and awesome crowds
The bar has two sides the live music side seems more sketchy whereas the beer/whiskey room is well lit with a good amount of seating and two bar sized pool tables

Based on the recommendations from a few local Yelpers I decided to stop by this joint to have a few drinks
I like how they have a good selection of jellies to put in your drink if you aren't tapioca inclined
The steaks were very good and we always stick to the simple steak and salad formula when we go to Drinkwater's BTW is there really any other cut besides a bone in Rib-eye
The service was very good as always and the drinks salads steaks and sides arrived hot or cold as necessary and on time
Drinkwater's  I know it's Mastro's now but old habits are hard to break is good place for a simple steak and salad

I ordered the Monkey Knife Fight beer can't pass up a beer with that name and it was also really good
So from now on straight to the bar for some drinks down the street to one of the many fabulous Phoenix restaurants for good
The wine selection is also really comprehensive and they have a whole area of local wines some of which are quite good and wines under $10 which is a great resource for entertaining
Spitfire really impressed me tonight and proved that it's more than just your typical neighborhood beer bar
My bartender Brendan was friendly knowledgeable and recommended a great beer for me Grand Canyon American Pilsner which is brewed in Williams but which I had never tried before
All in all we were very pleasantly surprised and so happy to have another high-quality casual and comfortable restaurant in our area -- especially one with 18 beers on tap and many others available
Beer is super expensive at $10 and over so I'd recommend enjoying yourself in the parking lot before the show
Liquor is very expensive - nine dollars for a drink - so I recommend ordering beer
I asked the bartender to recommend a red wine with everything and the cab he chose was perfect
oh yea and the menu is pretty decent too- sorry i get a little over excited about good drink prices
We ordered the house wine recommended and also cheaper by the glass than other featured items
We were a party of 8 and we had separate checks too but never did our waitress get flustered with us I have to say service was good and friendly our drinks were filled and we were taking care of instead of bringing us separate checks we were told we would be rung up at the counter that was easy for us
Our bill came out to over $25 with an appetizer and pizza this didn't include tip and we didn't get any drinks
The beer was pretty good although the cream ale could benefit from a nitro pour and their order on the sampler is wrong arranging them by alcohol content rather than IBU's
This is one of my go to spots when I have vague cravings hmmm I know I want something that is good with a cold beer cheap and spicy or when I just want to pick on a bunch of stuff
They forgot our appetizers brought wrong drinks etc
It felt like it would be a good place known for drinking like casey moores but features a menu that reads like it's a restaurant
The service is always good - there is usually one of two guys working the espresso machine and they are both great - super friendly make good drinks and they make those good drinks fast

For the appetizer 14 pizza and two drinks it was only $23
My wife got an wonderful drink that paired with the house guacamole and the braised pork belly perfectly

In Short Good food and beer at a reasonable price and a quirky atmosphere
It goes without saying that their collection is amazing but then again anybody could have a good stock of wine and spirits
We wandered in for a drink at the Red Room on Saturday night and were thoroughly impressed by the acoustic cover band playing that night
Good mixed drinks good music - live dj and cool crowd
And the other star goes to the drinks and desert cake with ice cream which was the only thing I enjoyed
Obviously a lot of thought went into selecting an modest array of quality wines that were also kept affordable
Well let me tell you not only does it have good beer and a young crowd their sandwiches are spectacular
It's young which appears to be a lot of recent graduates or people that just love good beer and good food
Set aside a good 2 1/2 - 3 hours for dinner drinks and conversation
Our server was visibly and audibly having a psychological breakdown unable to handle a party of 10 with appetizers and drinks for each person
The food and drinks are decent quality and moderately priced so in any other situation I'm sure it would've been three even four stars
We still had fun and the old fogies outside enjoyed their drinks in peace
They have beers from South America and some non-alcoholic Ecuadorian beverages that are very good
At one point he called our waiter over to have him fill their water glasses whereas a good manager would have taken care of it himself
I realize it's not royal treatment but a glass of cold water in that heat is almost worth its weight in gold
We shared a glass of the carminere/cabernet blend since it was before 8 and then upon our server's recommendation opted for a bottle of the ganacha when the time struck

The big short rib was placed on a bed of fluffy mashed potatoes green beans and a wonderful red wine herb reduction sauce
The cocktail I had some martini concoction involving pear liqueur and sake was pretty tasty
that it might be a good thing if we swirled the bottle to mix in the ricey sediment so 3/4 of the way through the bottle we were drinking - or rather not drinking - a gritty milky mess
I have found that the wine selection has a few good choices to complete the pizza or if you are a pizza and beer person the beer selection is average
They have a nice drink menu- personally i recommend the pomegranate martini as it is delicious and strong
If your looking for a good coffee shop downtown hit up JOBOT the people are friendly and the drinks are a million times better

Few of us were drinking that night but we managed to have a good meal

Drinks that had sat un-refilled since our appetizer was served were topped off without warning and she walked away again our napkin-covered plates still waiting to be picked up
We also tried their Coconut/tapioca drink which was amazing and more importantly for me not overwhelmingly coconut tasting
For a drink I recommend trying the horchata which although it was from a fountain tasted delicious
and then of course all the appetizers drinks and deserts
My father said that the wine list was excellent
While my drink something pink and fruity was pretty tasty the sugar rim was ridiculous
I am a boring latte drinker I admit it but good coffee shouldn't be adulterated with flavorings and whipped cream
I'm not even much of a beer drinker but I'll occasionally let one of the wait staff recommend something light and fruity for me
which is a delicious beer out of K-zoo Michigan
It was a very good drink but NOT worth the price tag
They have a great variety of beer and other liquor to keep you satisfied more than a nights worth

The beer selection is very eclectic with a good selection of draft/bottle bears
I'd like to go back in the evening and have a few drinks their drink menu looks excellent
Went for the start of restaurant week and it was excellent started off with drinks at the bar tequilarito-I think and then dinner and dessert
The most expensive entree is $15 and the drinks stand-alone are $5 so you would need to have at least 3 drinks to make this a worthwhile deal but it is brunch
No one bothered to offer us drinks and it was quite irritating to see tables who arrived after us being served appetizers
When our waiter came he did not even apologize for the wait and we gave our orders drinks appetizers and pita sandwiches
However the second glass he recommended and I drank was double the price
EVERY single thing that I ate at Don & Charlies was A+We ordered an appetizer of shrimp de Jonghe sautu00e9ed in wine topped with garlic bread crumbs and it was perfect
But they are open late so it is a good place to stop for a late dinner or drink
All in all a great place to grab a excellent burger and cold beer
Fifteen minutes more we get drinks and I really wanted an appetizer but didn't want to be there all night and realize i was glad I didn't order their appetizer prices are entree prices
True Food is worth it for the drinks alone
If you want a good beer selection go to Roosevelt's or Lost Leaf
Id recommend these TMI people take a little class trip up to Total Wine on camelback and stock the fridge with some bottles of good stuff
The homemade Tirmasu -light with perfect layers of sponge cake soaked in coffee liqueur combined with sweet whipped cream mascarpone cheese coffee cinnamon and cocoa powder was also divineThe wine list was small but original not your typical run of the mill or popular California wines and the cappuccino was excellent
I topped it off with a huge glass of iced tea and I was full for two days afterwards -If you're looking for a really good deli this is the place
This place seems like a nice little neighborhood bar My buddy lives down the street and goes here a lot they didn't seem to have a lot for a beer selection compaired to some other Tavern's in the area but the appetizers and food are good
As soon as I sat down the waitress came by to gather my drink and appetizers
Run out of strip-mall a Korean Chef named Paul runs Yen Sushi & Sake Bar and creates some of the most interesting and delicious sushi I have had the pleasure of having

My favorites wereSeabass & Mushrooms - baked in parchment garlic-butter sake soySoft shell crab sandwichesYellowtail Ceviche - miyoga  sesame seed shredded taroEverything we had was delicious though I sat out on the Pork Buns too full at that point though I heard they were delicious
Although Press makes a good cup of coffee and they have a wine bar it frankly won't be in my regular rotation
I also enjoyed a brew from their beer garden
I only ordered drinks but caught a glimpse of some of the food and peeked at a menu and the food looked and sounded good
Drinks are full flavored and although their menu is limited they have something for pretty much everyone
I had the something punch to drink which was really good love the mixing of the fruit juices
It's the kind of place that isn't really pricy but it adds up between the four of us our bill was $100+ but that was also with apps and drinks so it's really worth it
I'm awarding one star in addition to the minimum one-star rating because I got to drink cheap beer by the pool in 90 degree weather for 10 days and there are a few good places to eat and two dollar stores very nearby

The specialty coffee drinks are quite good too
We went on a Saturday night around 7 and it took about 45 minutes to get seated but we enjoyed sitting at the bar for a few drinks

laid back and had a good selection of beer; I like to support local establishments that are not part of the corporate giant; and I really like going out in the downtown Phoenix area
and the shortribs-which was good but the red wine sauce was very rich and the wasabi gnocchi definitely should have been left out altogether
They seem to have a good wine collection and other food items other than pizza
I ordered a fabulous glass of wine I wish I could remember the name to recommend - I do remember it was white and from Argentina
Sat at the bar and the service was pretty good got a beer quickly but then had to ask for a menu
I finished the rice and beans and enjoyed my cold beer and good service but left bummed
The menu is changing always fresh and full of impressive flavors with a wine list to match
Good selection of beers and cool bar area
an excellent selection of Italian beers decent wines scotches vodka's
They were all very good for their respective beer types
with my meal I had the Vanilla-Peach Italian soda over vodkathe vanilla was far too strong it tasted as if there was Tuaca in there or some similar syrupy liqueur but I quite enjoyed the whole peach in the bottom of the glass on to dessert he had the chocolate layer cakevery very rich and decadent frosting and I ordered the strawberry creme brulee--absolutely mouthwatering
it was heavenly with a glass of the Juno chardonnaywonderful honey undertonesall in all I'd definitely return to Switch
Entire meal for 2 -- one appetizer 2 meals 2 alcoholic  drink and nothing else -- $135
The teppan is a little pricey the sushi is consistantly good they also offer the all you can eat sushi and the sake selection is ok very average
They had cocktails and I had a glass of white sangria -- it was pretty good not fantastic
Very good value proposition for Happy Hour 1/2 price appetizers beer specials
We sat down and ordered a btl of wine a beer and two appetizers
There appeared to be a good wine and beer list which I will most likely opt for next time
Local chefs - if you're going to serve southwestern fare for goodness sake do the tortilla some justice

It is a diamond in the rough and it consistently transports me into a lively Irish pub filled with authentic decorations and very very good food and drinks
Great selection of drinks and good happy hour prices
Got our drinks which BTW were not that good
They have a full bar with some really good deals during happy hour so I took advantage by trying one of the mixed drinks they had listed
Beers were ordered and they've got a good list with 40 of which on tap and a basket literally small shopping cart of sweet potato fries came out with ketchup and a house made aioli
The drinks are also good they have an extensive menu to choose from
They have a good selection of drinks as well
we got spring rolls and Pho and some very  tasty drinks
But I didn't feel the food or drink were priced appropriately for the quality
But they are speedy with getting the food and drinks out despite how busy it is so it's all good They have a great beer selection of course  If I do get a beer I always like their Peach beer
Too good not to order a must just don't order with a martini it won't work with a heavy gin or vodka drink
No beer no wine just really good pizza
The texture of the banana muffin cupcake was crumbly and tasted stale almost frost-bitten; the milkshake uninteresting almost like the third-of-a-glass that's sometimes forgotten and then returned to but now too far-gone and not worth having anymore
And they're honest with their recommendations too unlike some restaurants that will say anything about a bottle of wine if they think it'll help sell it
I've never tried it but there's only been crumbs left when we got there both times so I guess it goes good with beer apple martini's or whatever your choice of drink may be
although I enjoy my bloody marys I really dont know how to make a good one but with the assistance of several employees who were happy to help I enjoyed a darn good drink
Everytime I've been my friends and I always grab a seat on the couch and munch on some appetizers while enjoying a beer
As for the drinks they've got a pretty good beer selection and their wine menu is pretty decent
Consistency -- nice people excellent food reasonable prices wide selections of wines & soft drinks seating indoors - outdoors - upstairs

I had a better chance to look over the wine list and I was most impressed with NOCA's seclection of Leonetti from Washington State

Our server was attentive and we had other servers checking on us refilling water glasses bringing out food and just making sure we were having a good time
The soup of the ramen tastes delicious creamy and you just want to finish drinking the whole bowl of the soup
One of the waiters recommended me white wines with a patience and kind face
Wine  A wonderfully large selection of various wines - including a nice bright Reisling that I decided to try
I could completely forgo the food and solely sip on that delicious drink
To sum up I will be back and definitely recommend this place but if you want to drink margaritas with some of those awesome shredded beef tacos I would stick to Happy Hour because the prices are pretty steep
Customer service was good server took my beer/glass - without asking me if I wanted another
Oh and did I mention that it is moderately priced lunch under $10 dinner for two under $40 with drinks appetizer and desert
We each started with a glass of wine which we really enjoyed- from there they gained no more stares
The food is pretty good but it's all about the beer
I would highly suggest going during happy hour at the bar if you're going to drink as drink prices are cheaper and appetizers are half off
The only possible negatives were that my Kir Royal raspberry with sparkling wine was not as tasty as I would have liked and we had a couple of people who don't eat pork and in certain dishes such as the Egg Strada they could not swap out the pork for chicken sausage because they were already mixed the quesadilla was swap friendly just fyi
The food is tasty reasonably priced and they have a decent selection of beers
If you are looking for more of a Lounge hang out with good drinks and live music -with even a small dance floor --check this place out
They had some interesting liquor behind the bar I'd imagine they have a good drink repertoire
It's got a cozy atmosphere along with an excellent beer list and a small but good menu
The music is really chill the decor is top notch and the food and drinks are very good
Some really unique and delicious beers on tap
If you want a great place with a fabulous atmosphere awesome beers they have Drifter on tap and amazing food go to Hula's

Our cashier guy was very friendly too and an excellent barista who made an excellent drink
Happy hour has amazing prices with drinks around $5 and near full meal sized appetizers around $10
They had some great choices for wine but all three of the entrees we ordered were dull and flavorless
or if you want a good drink other then wine try their bellinis and mimosas
Good beer list good food great location if you live downtown
The drinks where amazing and lot's of specialty drinkscucumber special
Food was good but a fantastic wine list with a great variety to pick from
Namely- No BS- Very few frills- A good bar in the back- Big portions like whoa I need to undo my pants and possibly crap my pants sized - a plethora of drinks not pinata like El Guapo would prefer - funky crap on the walls that makes me giggle
We ordered the stuffed mushrooms stuffed with meat of course as an appetizer the bauernplatte combo a GIANT BEER a one liter mug of their darkest the Optimator and for dessert a slice of black forest cake
Our server initially brought me out the wrong beer which was sorta funny because I had asked him for a recommendation and it had to have passed through his head as he was lugging this huge mug to my table
I did taste it before I sent it back and it was good but when the Optimator showed up all was right with the world I kind of get excited when I walk into a place and there's beers on tap that I haven't tried and even more so when they turn out to be amazing
I don't think there's anywhere else quite like it in Arizona as far as the menu the ambiance the fantastic beers and the aforementioned GOOD TIMES
The drinks are pretty good; they used to be better a couple years ago
I have been here countless times since my last review and found myself here for a quick drink and some appetizers last night
Aside from its ghetto-fab exterior and the half-decent drinks you'll find at the rooftop bar the Clarendon is an excellent place to stay for anybody passing through Phoenix
A funky deco job complete with Arizona license plate room numbers glass elevator although all you see is the shaft wall a gorgeous fiber-optic illuminated swimming pool and rooms that seem individually designed by a swanky reality television show producer make the entire visual experience really worth checking out
I'll frequent this place more often but know that 3 drinks or 2 and an appetizer is gonna run me around $25
Windsor is one of the best spots in Phoenix if you are looking for amazing food great drinks awesome atmosphere and possibly the best staff there is

They have a good wine selection and the staff seems to know the wines fairly well
The crust was kind of on the thin side and had a delicious chewiness to crustiness ratio
I recommend the delicious baked macaroni and cheese and the martinis are excellent
If you want good food and drinks this is a good place to go just be sure to sit far far away from the bar
They had a good selection of wines and some you don't normally find on wine lists at every other place in town
The wine was good and we both liked the service and atmosphere
The burger is decent but the drinks are why I think it's worth going

Thirdly they have darts and foosball to play while you drink your delicious free beer
I have yet to have any beverages from the bar but I'm sure that based on the quality of their food the drinks are amazing as well
Sat at the bar and enjoyed some wine and appetizers
Two beers and the sandwich ended up $13 just for me which is a pretty good deal when you think about it
But I would definitely go back and would recommend it to those who like their beer
They have a great variety of wings which are all really good and they have some good beer on top plus they show pretty much every college or professional sporting game taking place around the nation on their dozens of plasma TVs
Who knows where it will be when you go but it's a decent sized space a big bar and a good amount of seating so you'll definitely get your drink on even if you don't get your groove on
I am not a coffee drinker so I cannot attest to what JoBot allegedly best but the crepes were delicious
As a Michigan native I was pleased to see JoBot stocks Faygo Root Beer and was happy that I could enjoy the sweet nectar of my childhood to wash down my tasty meal
Good wine pinot noir from Oregon at 15 a glass
For goodness sakes why is that such a difficult request

Dark atmosphere good food good variety of wine
They have the bomb diggity Starbucks with my Starbucks peoples they have a good deli good meat department great bakery dope wine selection and just generally kick the crap out of every other grocery store I go to
These went nicely with our beers they've got a great list my mother's martini which she seemed to enjoy and my brother's gin on the rocks he says they carry a gin that is very rare and delicious but the name didn't stick with me-sorry
Good drinks weren't enough to save Kincaid's for me
We had amazing wine and food and I cannot wait to come back for happy hour
This past Saturday We went to the lodge at about midnight for some late night snacks we ordered $30 worth of food and drinks
1 I have had better hummus2 I hate when the sides that come with the entree are better than the entree itself- this happened here3 I enjoyed the wine more than the food and when my tummy is not happy well
Service Our server was attentive and recommended we add another drink before happy hour was over I appreciated this
Id rather be drinking a Bud $1 PBR or a really tasty Jack and Coke
It comes in a cute glass container and the flavors are divine
The drinks are priced good and they have some nice breakfast specials too
For me no cheese and sub black beans instead of potatoesAlso they give A LOT of food I usually can't quite finish the whole burrito by myself so you get a bang for your buck um FINALLY an airport restaurant that doesn't follow the code of shitty and overpricedAlso the coffee has a nice flavor not the normal burnt black that I actually LOVE and it comes in one of those taller glass mugs I would prefer a regular mug but I guess it makes it look nicer
I had the Sorrell drink it was really good but a bit too strong of a taste for me to go with my dinner
We ordered a very good sake from their extensive sake menu to accompany the meal
There's a good selection of beer and wine and an almost impossible-to-choose-from selection of pizzas
We tried some great new wines we'd not had before and he suggested the Pickled Red & Yellow Beets served with black olive tapenade whipped ricotta and toasted sour dough baguettes as an appetizer
After being to Zinburger last week and having tested out a lot of great places in the area we will for sure keep this place on our list of fun burger joints and are excited to returnOh and happy hour is 330-630 so half off appetizers and we got some great beer specials
You'll find not only the traditional really good Mai Tai's but also drinks with a twist try the Juan Ho
Several months ago we hosted a lemonade stand for a client serving glasses of flavored lemonade
Loved the Ginger flavor but both the drinks were syrup sweet - which was not what we were hoping for - we like our citrus to have some tang
They had an extensive wine list that we also both enjoyed
The soda list is impressive although I opted for a traditional root beer float oldie but a goodie and was very happy with their classic take on it
i love the tart lemon flavor and i don't feel guilty drinking it either
Nice modern ambiance in the restaurant good selection of pastas pizzas wine martinis and other drinks in the menu
Amazing servers really know their business and can recommend wine pairings and their favorite dishes
Time and time they trick me luring me in with the promise of a delicious blended fruit drink
I love some good wine and I realized that a lot of other people in Phoenix feel the same
The happy hour is always good with $5 glasses of wine
Drink-wise I'd recommend their house margarita and red sangria but skip the specialty cocktails as they are pricey and did not impress
If anyone knows me they know I can not pass up a good glass of wine
We met friends on a Sunday so we waited in the bar had good service getting a drink while we waited
Nice wines cheese for all you cheese lovers salad nicoise awesome empanadas very good and I could go on
We ordered two of the beer towers and some appetizers
After getting a few beers from the pretty bartender she was actually really really good-looking hottest girl on staff setting a false precedent for what the talent would look like we made our way past shady regulars at the bar with their necks crook'd to the lounge finding a couple of tables near but not next to the center stage
The food is really good the wine is really well priced the beer list is interesting enough for beer lovers or novices and the patio is great for dining with children
The drinks are great good combinations with fresh unexpected ingredients
My favorite items are the quesedillas burgers feta and hot sauced topped homemade potato chip appetizer and the excellent selection of beers
DO ITWe purchased items to make Yellow Curry Sushi Crab Puffs and enough snacks and flavored Sake and Wine to have a party
Nice wine selection and the popcorn was good
Honestly the appetizers and drinks would have been enough to feed my family of five
Currently the discount is $ 2 off all drinks and $ 3 off all appetizers
Scale of 1-10 single visit5 Food5 *Drinks*6 Service8 Atmosphere6 ValueI'll go back because it had a quirky-factor that I liked and b/c I need to try a burger to really gauge the food but there were no drink specials sorry cheap domestics doesn't cut it and my overpriced Frito Chili Pie wasn't good
The wine is also amazing all the workers there are totally down to earth and really want you to have a good time
My advice if you're going to hit this place is to grab a seat at the bar order a drink and an appetizer have maybe another drink or two then move on
However the crowd here was much more relaxed so I think this is a good off the beaten path stadium where people aren't quite as rowdy and instead are just there to have a couple beers and a good time in the sun watching baseball
The experience started off with the shrimp scampi appetizer - large shrimp served in a light lemon white wine butter sauce with just the right amount of garlic
I ordered the tequila drink ha who woulda thunk with grapefruit and it was *delicious*
the wine selection is good the atmosphere is charming and delightful and the food is amazing delicious and so very reasonably priced
seriously one of the best places in PHX to get drinks food and quality times with good friends
It's a decent sized glass so I feel like the value is good
I left with a full belly and a six pack of some good beer
I love their strawberry drink its not really agua fresca because it's a little on the thicker side but still tasty
There are at least 20 different varieties of gelato each flavor laid out like a work of art under that glass
It has a great atmosphere good drinks and good food
This place is pricey but definitely worth a visit at least once also it can be more affordable for meeting a friend if your'e just doing drinks and apps
You are a micro brew with delicious beer that once boasted fantastic food
I used to feel welcome; it was my neighborhood place to go for a few beers and a delicious burger but it seems that I must search out a new place to frequent
Excellent lunch specials here; $4 buys you two slices of pizza and a drink
The 'tacos' were actually very tasty and the beer was good as well
The cons are that there are on a few good beers on tap which does thankfully include a cider
Amazing job Lindsey Yelp & Tanzy This was one of the best events for this year the moment my plus 1 and I walked in we were greeted with a flute of champagne and when we were seated the wine was free flowingOur server Jill was amazing answered all our questions offered great wine pairings to go with our food made sure our water/soda cup was never empty very personable and you can tell she enjoyed her job told us when we come back which we will to ask for her and she will be our server I am all for that
Along with the free flowing wine Tanzy offered us a sample of a Christmas drink they had maybe it was just for the night not sure but it was a mixture of pina colada & mint mojito very delish it was smooth and tasty
They have tons of tv's decent food and a pretty good beer selection
For vegans vegetarians or meat-eaters this is definitely the place to go if you want hearty food a good cider or beer and a hip place to eat
For those of us that work in the downtown area this is a good place to stop for a drink after a long day in the office
Cheese Crisp- Good Flavor but hard to chewThe service/waitress was kind of rude and wasn't very attentive even on the aspect of a glass of water
Some good local brews but mostly domestics and beers you can go down the street and get at Applebee's for half price
They're pretty good about getting you drinks and most of the staff is pretty friendly
Another quick tip - if you 'friend' RnR on facebook you will recieve daily 'code phrases' that will provide excellent discounts for the alloted timefram usually 1/2 off wine or martinis or hh specials all night long if whispered to your server
The wine tasting was pretty good with my favorite being the one from Bigi called the Orvieto Amabile
But our server was clearly making a good effort to keep us there by giving us a round of free drinks and a free appetizer so we stayed
While the drinks were good the appetizer was boring and cold
With that in mind the food is still good and the drinks are fairly reasonable
Drinks are around $5 and appetizers are between $10-$15
My table ordered roasted veggies to share which were delish and I got The Hangover Cure to drink which was tasty as well
the beer bits are a little bland and the pizza while very tasty didn't really leave an impression on me
The flavors were diverse and satisfying the quantity generous the service friendly and personable from our server to owner-chef Esther who came out to greet us and the price before drinks a very reasonable approximate $10 for a very satisfying meal
You can't go wrong with great beer and good food
We ended up paying $30 for the two subs appetizer and two drinks and tip
Three dollars for a pretty good selection of draft beers is almost unbeatable
drinks were good as well and servers were really helpful
I love that the drink choices include sasparillo flavored teas and creme sodas
After we were seated drink wine and appetizer orders taken we relaxed and began to settle in
I thoroughly enjoyed my wine mac & cheese a little spicy and topped with cornflakes and cheese fritters
All in all I would recommend drinks and apps here
So after a movie or some easy shopping Kabuki is a good place to go to have a couple of sake bombs and a few light apps
] I asked Ian his suggestion again and the first was a good wine that I've already had
I love a good rum drink no doubt but I don't like the idea that I need three drinks to have a full run of the menu
Oh yeah the martinis are large cold and good
pastrami sandwich was huge as you get fries and a pickle for about 6 bucks i got me a little wine trifecta the calamari were tasty as and the basic salad was on par
The counter register is for take-out orders duh They have some good beers on tap too
There was quite the crowd Saturday night which made it loud but it had a very fun atmosphere and is definitely a good place to go for wine with friends
We actually had two people serving us and received wonderful recommendations and information on the food and wine
ID recommend going on Thursday for half off wines
For drinks she had the Rum Cider another item she thought was good but not great
After thoroughly examining the menu and choosing our drinks our appetizer and our entrees we had still not even seen a waiter or even received glasses of water
He apologized for our wait took our drink and appetizer order just as our waiter showed up
The only mild detractions due to my girlfriend only considering her entree and drink to be good rather than great and the minor attentiveness issue when we were first seated
Drinks are at a reasonable price and my margaritas were tasty with enough alcohol to get the buzz going but not so strong that you make a face on every sip
Overall too expensive for their cheapened recipes 2 beers 1 drink 2 1/2 off appetizers and two meals was $80
They have a wonderful wine list too - extensive and not outrageously priced
love the atmosphere food is OK beer was cold price is a little high for what you get menu is too big quality of food is OK
This place is good for any type of meal and is even open for drinks late at night No
Their selection of beer is focused and somewhat limited but still very good choices for any palate
The last time I went with a friend we had an appetizer a total of three beers and a glass of wine and two salads for only $35
We started with the Calamari for an appetizer and a couple of drinks
They serve beer in these huge mugs that are super tasty
The rest of the people in my party enjoyed various mojitos from the drink menu and no one was disappointed
I would recommend if only for after dinner drinks and dessert
it's a simple thing but what impressed me the most was how my water glass NEVER went below half-empty
There were only about 5 other people in the place which is good because I like to have my choice of seat and don't like to wait for drinks and service
Their beer isn't my favorite but it is very good
That's great if you and a friend or co-worker drink the same flavors
I could drink that delicious concoction by the gallon
On top of all this the unparalleled drinking specials 32 oz steins and $3 car bombs every day make this not only a wonderful place to eat but a perfect spot to pickle the liver as well
The beer selection was good but you can get half of it in a store
The beer was good though but thankfully you can get that at a dozen other places throughout the valley
I've had margaritas on a couple of my visits and I stand unimpressed so I might pass on the margaritas and go for a cold bottled beer instead
I love all the appetizers with the exception of the beer bread things
The drinks we finally got were amazing
It's a place worth going to when you're looking for dinner and drinks or an alternative to the usual dance clubs in Old Town
There was a tour bus of people staying at the hotel and I wound up having beer and cigarettes outside with a couple of them until about 400am-good times
Friendly staff good food and beer are enough to make you overlook this
Good pizza toppings you can get wine by the glass
*Happy hour has some good drink specials
However if you're not super hungry and you'd like a great glass of wine or wonderful cocktail for happy hour prices mid-day is your time
Beverages - good selection of affordable wines and specialty drinks
The selection of drink flavors and burger toppings is certainly not lacking
I recommend that if you decide to go with shots of beer stick with only the cheapest beers on the menu so you pay only $2 per shot
There is simply MUCH better options to sample good craft beer in Tempe e
Their beers are so good that I carry two of them Kilt Lifter and Hot Knot at my own pub in Laveen/Phoenix
But with these beers it's totally worth the walk
They had pretty good beer and the pizza was greasy but tasty
The wines were reasonably priced and wonderful as in all the arcadia restaurants
If you like home made pasta flavorful sauces great wine and all the other elements that make a great Italian place - this is it
I have never cared much for beer so this is the closest that I get and was very excited to try it for the first time here by recommendation of one of my friends
While I'm there let me pick up a selection of beers from around the world I hear Holland has some good brew browse the allegedly specialized food items and take a quick peak at their assortment of candles smell-good bath things and kitchenware
As soon as our waiter discovered we were not going to order an $80 bottle of wine or a $60 seafood appetizer he disappeared into thin air
Being a brewery the beer is really good
If you're out drinking and looking for fun this is great but if you just want a bite to eat and spend some time with the family it's not so wonderful
Some of the fancier drinks were recommended but we were content with just plain old lemonade
The various bartenders I've met here are all very good and honest about the wine list
I recommend trying the flights the wine is all higher end yet affordable so you're going to spend a bit of money anyway why not try a few
excellent drinks order the coconut water and it is srved in a real coconut that you can scope the meat out of and the two piece musical outfit added great music to chill but definetly not overwhelm
Great place to go to enjoy some good food bar foods and drinks
The dough was tender with no off flavors from old fry oil or chewiness from sitting around and the icing had a nice sugary snap
They serve excellent beers from local breweries and elsewhere
All in all they have a good selection of food for pretty good prices and the beer and wine selections treated us well
They ask you how your golf game was or if you enjoyed your drinks
reservations for 630 and after 2 appetizers 2 entree's and a bottle of wine with a second ordered we were all but escourted to the bar to finish our wine
So you end up getting $35 worth of food/drinks for about $20-25 with tip
The drinks are inventive and delicious with adorable names
Quality Coffee Free WiFiDrinks offered in real dishes not just to go cupsComfy seating as well and great work spacesYummy baked goods***extra points for fresh organic fruit being offered***While I'm not a regular here this is clearly the spot of the neighborhood locals
My husband and I enjoyed a splendid glass of wine here before dinner at Sea Saw
A re fill on a glass of my iced tea which I set in purppose at the edge of the table empty while staff kept going by acting like it they were very busy also we waited a long time to get our check the food was good overallMy experience at the Frank Lloyd Wright location was very much rewarding and pleasant the staff was very joyfull and attentive to detailfrom the moment we enter the door we were welcome and seated promply by the host and told that Tony will be our waiter which he did an amazing job starting by introducing himself and accomodating us with anything we needed our glasses of iced tea were NEVER empty and check on us in a timely matter I end up taking food home and a container for my iced tea provided by Tony over all service was EXCELLENT Tony you are awesome we will be back again for sure
This location has no citrus besides lime so keep that in mind if you want something in your beer or waterFor our food choices we went withspicy wontons - great flavor and like other mentioned could use more filling - but definitely worth eatingsesame tofu - great light batter good sauceslime mint beef - not something i would do again - not bad but not carpaccioshrimp wrapped in bacon - how could that not be good
kid standardFor the adults they have a fairly good wine list full bar a good choice of cappuccinos and flavored coffee as well as some really good specialty drinks like the seasonal gingerbread martini
Service was good to excellent nice wine selection steaks were also good to excellent
Fries are golden brown and you get a good size drink with the specials
We even saved the sauce for further use Also enjoyed some happy hour drinks Italian creme soda is a great drink and I enjoyed a glass of Colores Del Sol Malbec and Paso a Paso Verdejo
I wasn't too impressed with the drinks/bartenders the night I was there
The food is always top notch aside from one busy Saturday night the service has always been pretty good the drinks are strong and you cannot beat the environment
I loved all their different seating the vintage cash register and even one of the coolest bathrooms I've ever been in but if I'm going to pay nearly $5 for a 16oz drink I want it to taste amazing
It tastes like fruity deliciousness but it's not a pansy fruity drink the BF likes it too
I think good ol' Ben Franklin said it best  Beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy
my bad]Next up is the beer selection which while not as exhaustive as the Lost Leaf two blocks down is quality
They have a huge menu of specialty martinis and other cocktails that are all pretty darn tasty if you ask me
I started with one of their artisan-crafted martinis which was delicious large and filled to the brim
The other guests unanimously enjoyed their meals as well as the drinks and appetizers
Overall not really worth the $50 tab and we didn't even order any drinks just had water
You have to sit around the bar area to get it on the deals but for half-priced wines it's totally worth it--even if the weather was perfect outside
Nevertheless enjoying a delicious French Bordeaux for the price other places charge for cheap house wine sorta makes you feel like you're getting away with something
I also tried a crisp white wine from an Arizona vineyard and it was surprisingly good
Had a good variety of drinks and food and their specialty house drinks were what we tried and they were good
Not a very expensive meal good place to stop in and enjoy some drinks and apps
I was excited because they rave about how good the food is and the drinks are cheap
A group of friends and I sat at the bar and had good service great wine they have a very eclectic wine list and the food was AMAZING
an Italian eatery where local wines are flavored and where people come to have a great time with friends and eat home made dishes Friendly charming and warm Cibo  makes you feel at home eating with your mamma
Wine list is reasonably priced good selection
Good food good wine happy staff reasonably priced
Food's good drinks are expensive crowd watching is awesome
My wife and I each did a tasting which appears to be a bit expensive at first 5 1 ounce glasses for $10 but after sampling 5 more actually as we shared and talking with Maureen for about a half hour and learning all about their wines and how they started the business it was well worth it
The wines by the glass are good and the app selection had decent variety
Our server saw I couldn't decide on wine so he recommended the Novy nebbiolo which was really great - one of the best wines I've ordered at a restaurant lately and affordable too
But I do think this is a great fun place to come for dinner with good food and great drinks
Other good things nice patio area that's really indoors for hot PHX days fireplace area a bocce ball court the fact that it's in a repurposed 1950s bank building with a retro feel and the Vig Rig on weekends they will pick up/drive home if you want to drink a bit
Their food is always very good and the drinks never disappoint
Typical dive bar skeevy and sketchy and that's why they offer good drink specials
I love their patio location DC Ranch is niiiccceee wine selection happy hour and appetizers
If you really want to do it right I recommend arriving around 11am it's busier once the football games start bring some friends and your board game of choice my friends and I are partial to Apples to Apples spread yourselves out on a roomy patio table and settle in for a day of cheap drinks and lots of laughs
I would definitely recommend Corbin's as it's a great place to relax to have a couple drinks and/or dinner
The drinks were strong and the staff is EXCELLENT
The port served at the end was drinkable but far from good
I ordered the moscow mule vodka ginger beer and lime juice the other night and it was delicious
My husband and I went to Devils on Friday night for happy hour the martinis & appetizers were 2-4-1 so 9
This place is wonderful -- great drink and food menu
Where to begin the gin/blackberry drink with the naked lady swizzle stick was both tasty and entertaining nice added detail with the stick
I order the usual burger and drink with a side of potatoes and the burger was very good
Get there early if you want to have a good time free of stilettos and sunglasses worn at night
For me I like to know these things when I'm in a lounge type place I normally go for the dirty martini's or specialty drinks so it was nice to know not to order them as they wouldn't be that good
A few chuckles an hour wait sitting in uncomfortable seats in a too warm room with bad food and drinks is NOT worth the $100 or so we spent on the evening
Have had a lot of good meals and drinks here
While I can appreciate the appeal of having a disinterested gay hipster server who is probably really good at bullshitting about wine I found the overall ambiance and service sort of off putting
The boyfriend and I waited a good ten minutes before someone came over to take our drink order though I noticed the server eying our table long before then
The burger is worth it for five bucks on Monday the fries are awesome the drink specials are mediocre the atmosphere I found a bit stuffy and unfriendly the menu is all over the place with no solid direction or theme and the totally modern contempo art deco bullshit bathrooms make me roll my eyes while I pee
Four stars for the good service cold/cheap beers and good hours for happy hour
Garlic Fries and Flatbread were good but drink menu was limited because they were out of mint and 1/3 of their cocktail menu uses mint
We got an assortment of beers and appetizers - all were good especially the rock shrimp the bacon and cheese stuffed potato bites not the real name and of course the pretzel fondue again
Overall the food and drinks are ok but the service and ambience make this a place i commonly recommend to checkout
I've been in a few times over the years for a drink or a snack or what have you but today I decided to go pick up a sandwich and I was super impressed
I had the bone in Fillet and it was AMAZING my girlfriend had the Arctic Char and it was great we split a side of sautu00e9ed mushrooms that were very good and huge quantity and the drinks and dessert were great
The wine flights are good but the pours are inconsistent and not as hearty as in some places
Our drinks finally arrive via someone other than our original serverwho was MIA for at least a good 5 mins or more we were finished and waiting for our server to get back to ask for our tab
The wine selection is really excellent  with offerings for all budgets and tastes
Also I had my first FUZE drink with my meal also recommended and I loved it
The wine was all really great and it came with delicious little pairings for each different glass
I would recommend the Chirashi C sashimi option which includes two pieces each of sake hamachi and unagi as well as other accompanying elements
I only had a cranberry slush but the consistency was the same throughout my drink regular ICEE's will become more icy with less concentrated syrup flavoring and the tiny ice particles added to the refreshing factor
*The aforementioned drink I bought was not that tasty
The bartender and drinks were amazing too
He personally recommended several beers according to my specs and I walked away happy as I would be with a box of Samoas or a hot Krispy Kreme original glazed
It was the perfect stumbling ground for some much needed and delicious sustenance between drinking
Accompanying my dinner I also enjoyed a glass of sparkling wine
HH got you a good choice of beers for $3 and $4 plus we had a card for a free pretzel and I loved it
I am unsure how to commiserate with everyone else's reviews because when I stopped in at 1130 for the supposedly excellent happy hour I was seated immediately and water was dropped off my drink order taken and then promptly received
Also they have really unique and delicious mixed drinks both alcoholic and nonalcoholic
Not a huge beer menu but definitely a solid selection and good happy hour prices $4/pint $10/pitcher
Overall a nice white tablecloth wine good first date kind of place to go
Have ordered the granola croque madam oatmeal and a variety of espresso drinks and all have been tasty
This place gives Cartel a run for their money with good drip as well as espresso drinks
It does have good strong drinks though
We found the food to be delicious [roasted eggplant oregano chicken caprese sandwich a glass of malbec]; the server was knowledgeable courteous and professional
Went for drinks and appetizers to help benefit Friends of Animal Control and Care and was not disappointed
I would definitely eat and drink here again and I would recommend it to friends and strangers
The staff here is very knowledgeable and we like their recommendations especially on their wine selections
Whether I'm in the mood for a cup of coffee a full breakfast lunch an afternoon snack a sweet tooth craving a delicious pizza or a bottle of wine; LGO is my go-to spot
Wine We asked Alberto for a recommendation he produced a bottle of vintage 2000 Italian red wine sorry can't remember the name
We were given good service good drinks and good food
-good service-wine list-full bar indoor/outdoor-patio-valetBoth times I have been there I ordered and Iced Cafe Mocha to go for the stroll home
Randy had found a bottle of ginger beer imported from Australia that had a wonderfully refreshing true ginger taste
They aren't good as a primary supplier for a heavy tea drinker
Happy hour is good and drinks aren't expensive anyhow so drinkers celebrate
She recommended a sauvignon blanc wine which we decided to try not knowing that it was $52 a bottle til we got the surprise on our receipt
Salsa and Chips - Flavorless and in short supply as we waited for our mealService - Slow on refills of drinks and in food delivery - Isn't Mexican supposed to be quick
Friendly greeting good service better happy hour and $5 large sake bombers ALL day long
Given the good location I'm sure Dave's can survive I just hope the beer improves
I don't eat sushi but damn do I love to drink copious amounts of alcohol oftentimes mixed with other types of alcohol to create delicious alcoholic concoctions in my belly
We were feeling pretty good after finishing this drink between the two of us
4 stars for good relaxing atmosphere great service good tropical drinks and good food
I ordered the carrot juice drink that came highly recommended by the waitress
3 Wedding - friend of mine just had wedding reception here spectacular - they use Santa Barbara Catering top 3 in the Valley - AMAZING and the room was all glass sat on the infinity pool that merged with the lake
I would recommend avoiding specialty cocktails though I have not tried other drinks on their menu
Plenty of flavors to choose from and I could go here for drinks and wings
Plus they DO have a delicious drink -- their Chai Charger -- basically a Chai latte with a shot of espresso
Other things you can eat from thererotisserie chicken--still the best I've foundfrench feta cheese--creamy and delicioustheir kirkland whole grain bread--no hf corn syrup and 5g of fiber per sliceall of the meals in the back that you just throw in the oventheir pecanstheir strawberriestheir winestheir kirkland vodkatheir buttercream cakes OMGtheir big ass bags of mexican cheese blendsetc
My friend went with the southwest chicken clubIt came on sourdough and wasn't a subThey don't serve beer it isn't a pubJust a good place that makes good grub
The sales people were good but I think I will try to go to different location possibly in another state when I am visiting that state to get another pair of glasses
I usually go for the happy hour drinks because the specials are good
I hosted a large work event on the patio with heavy appetizers and drinks for about 40 people
The DJS ALWAYS suck this clearly should be flattened out into an empty warehouse loose the bling or whatever you were trying to do get a badass techno DJ like Donald Glaude or Tiesto put in a booming sound system cheap drinks and amazing lighting and START OVER
I can eat drink and dance at Margaritaville and not be worried about having a good time
Maybe it was the beer light reflecting off the gases of Jupiter but this was not a tasty cut of meat
The beer selection here is very good but rely's heavy on the Rogue and Four Peaks breweries
The food held its integrity in the packaging and was 95% as good as if I was sitting on the Pita Jungle patio enjoying it with a glass of wine and about to head to the Gelato Spot for dessert
The drinks are different in a good way
This place has an awesome vibe to it great food and wine and good service
The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable and they are great at recommending new wines
Maybe learn how much beer to order or be okay with not having 31 'flavors' at all times
Their menu is very easy to read and give those no too educated in the was of coffee a good description of what each drink is and how it is made
I enjoyed the beer and the food was average but definitely homemade so I would say the quality is good a little bland but nbd instead of ketchup we got some tomato blend
We got some drinks and appetizers at the poolside bar
Strong drinks good wine Kiltlifter on tap
This place can get pretty loud if there is a band or music but overall this place is great and I highly recommend going for a bottle of wine post dinner
The shot was good but by the time it was cool enough to drink had lost quite a bit of flavor
The mall has several amazing resturants inside and out and a great place to get drinks as well
The beer prices are good and i reasonable
Annnnnddddru00e9u00e9u00e9u00e9u00e9u00e9u00e9 for goodness sakes
The wine the server recommended pairing with the pork chop worked wonderfully
We enjoyed our drinks and chatted for a bit before heading out
In the case of Bianco you probably get to do some of this waiting in the sun or with a delicious beer from the bar in your hand
Food was Ok never saw the wine pairings so we bought our own which was good decent selections
I haven't had any coffee drinks yet because I can't get past how delicious my coffee is
The service is always pretty good and they all are encyclopedias of beer/wine/liquor knowledge
I took one drink gave it back and asked for more flavoring
Bloom has an amazing wine list and everyone enjoyed the wine and champagne we ordered with dinner
It's a good thing my drink was expertly made and my steak had great flavor otherwise I would have knifed the Affliction t-shirt wearing d-bag in the next table just on principle alone
The wine selection is good and relatively reasonable in price
My bone-in ribeye had fantastic flavor and was much larger than my wine and martini filled stomach could tackle
Nice beer list friendly and attentive staff good food cool vibe everything about this place is great
i know that's my issue but there are plenty of other coffee shops in phoenix and tempe that have impressed me with their actual drinks and atmosphere
The drinks selection is good the food is a little better than regular bar food
You sit in a fun environment order drinks and food from the menu and just have a good time with friends
The drinks were good and the service was good as well
I ordered a strawberry lassie to drink with a Market BLT based on Yelp recommendations
I think that Metro is good for drinks oysters and a decent dinner
Its worth mentioning that while I was browsing my son decided to start throwing a fit because I would not let him play with the drinking fountain
He gave me lots of good info about care for my new glasses and really went the extra mile to make a good impression
Check this spot out if you're in the mood for an iced mocha and soon enough we all will be ready for sinfully delicious iced coffee drinks once things heat up
Definitely expect to wait but if you've got good company you can hang out in their waiting area - the coffee bar - and get yourself some drinks to start with and just chit chat
Once you rise over this point you are at an area that is shaded for much of the afternoon and into the night due to the shadow of the sheer rock face next to the trail so it is a good place to stop for a while and grab a drink of water
We found out we were there during happy hour so we ordered drinks and appetizers
The drinks were good and unique and the crunchy spicy tuna appetizer was also good but that was where it ended
All in all it was a good portion of food and it came with a drink and was a pretty good value
Also probably not a good idea to rely on the mythical creature that is supposed to read those post-its and pour coffee into a glass he doesn't exist
My general first impressions- Awesome outdoor patio and live music- Good Sunday HH 1/2 price bottles of wine- Food was ok- Kind of a cool hipster crowdSo first off we had a couple of bottles of decent wine
Hummustzatziki   served w/flat bread selection of olives a couple of pork belly selections I had the lamb burger I ordered medium it was served a more rare but was still good the did offer some higher priced entrees and there were other selections of burgers and sandwiches thus the name gastro pub  they had some good beers on tap
There are fountain drinks  bottled drinks good assortment of water and non alcoholic beer and loads of sugary add ons within tempting reach right at the cash register-brilliant
Since I don't eat meat I can only attest to how good the beer and the veggie wrap is
Its good for a beer on a pub crawl or to sober up for a couple of hours b4 2am
If you go here before a game I'd recommend sticking to the beers and then getting a hot dog at the field
Other than that the food and drinks were amazing
I don't cook and even I was impressed by their big selection of cheese meat pasta wine and sauces to buy
Sure you can get some of the regular stuff you get at other grocery stores like Stouffers frozen dinners and Oreo cookies BUT why would you when your senses and your shopping basket are already overflowing with so many gourmet ingredients artisan cookies and pastries wines fresh high-quality meat and delicious prepared foods
Do you want to be a pub that serves beer and semi good martinis or a great gastro-pub that serves both great food and drinks
what most impressed me was how knowledgeable some of the girls were on the beers and their recommendations
If you live in the south Tempe Chandler  Gilbert area and are looking for good eats and good beer in a warm friendly environment this IS the PLACE
I also picked up some Jamaican ginger beer that was good and spicy -- perfect for a Dark and Stormy
With great food good wine selection personal attention I cannot find anything that was not positive
THe music was loud the crowd was pretty good looking and the drinks and food were great
They also have delicious drinks with lemonade root beer and other perfectly sweet ingredients
One of the employees recommended some beers to me as well
I like trying new beers and those were some quality ones I bought
I think this is an above average restaurant with nice wine prices good and sometimes great
Sure the place has atmosphere and a good drink menu but I prioritize the eats
To drink I had a prickly pear Margarita which was wonderful
Anyway the four of us enjoyed each dish and the lightness of the flavors but it is easy to rack up a $160 tab with only four alcoholic and two non-alcoholic drinks by ordering 9 plates and two desserts
After a leisurely period of enjoying the appetizers and wine our attentive waiter came by several times to check our glasses and update us on the arrival of our meal
The owners wife was our waitress and she kept our drinks filled and was constantly asking if everything was good or not
The room the wine tasting was held in was arranged to provide good spacing and flow
Coolest drink pretty to get is like those punch drinks that have a glow stick in it with dry ice so it fogs up --- 3 flavors to choose Fruit Punch Apple Martini Lemon Drop
We had a couple beers small selection - but we found something we really liked and a glass of wine reasonably priced tasty The service was fine the prices fine
We found a table and enjoyed their excellent wine list until my husband got hungry and we decided to stay for dinner
This place has good food great beers and a really fun atmosphere
If you ask the server to split the salad they charge $2 but if you split it yourself there's no chargeI also ordered a glass of white sangria which was just fairly good
We really enjoyed sitting outside under the trees on the picnic tables - it reminded me of some wineries I have been to
Not to my surprise the experience was exceptional the staff was hands down friendly confident in the chef and on track with recommendations including a delicious pairing with a bottle of chilled sake
We ordered raspberry beers which were delicious and had appetizers the wings which were baked not friend and stuffed portobello mushrooms which were outstanding
The drinks and apps are amazing and $4 Long Islands on Thursdays are right up my ally
Good wine and beer selection sushi stand olive bar deli with ready made good sandwiches and a pretty robust nutrition/health food section
They do have some very good beers but the huge tap count is just not needed
First this place starts on a great foot by letting you buy wine next door at about wholesale prices because all great food has good to great compliments of wine
add to that the fact that they have 99-cent 0-calorie Vitamin Water and 99-cent tropical trail mix as well as really great pricesand sales on beerwith a fairly good variety--always a few interesting offbeat brews for cheap and you have a fantastic little market
It took at least fifteen minutes to get my first drink and then over half an hour for the appetizer
Besides the amazing assortment of sports artifacts I especially like the Cactus League Beer List which pairs a beer with each city that has a team in the Cactus League
I'm not really charmed by the ambiance or impressed with many of the menu items--and their beer selection is really lame too
He recommended beers we both really enjoyed and my boyfriend a beer affectionado was really impressed with just about every beer in the 8-beer flight
The happy hour prices for drinks cannot be beat and they have a wide variety of appetizers for half price
Apparently it means delicious fruit salad drink
We planned on relaxing here with an appetizer drinks and a late lunch
Practically had to yell for our waitress for a second round after having empty glasses for too long until we realized it wasn't worth it
This isn't really a place for dinner but rather some good wine and maybe a cheese board or two
So with appetizers and drinks the per person price was closer to $45-$50 than under $30
The wine list was pretty good for a Thai place
*** I only had a bottled beer but I will return for an actual specialty drink as I hear they are amazing
We ordered a hummus appetizer and ordered some drinks
It was absolutely amazing and the prices are pretty reasonable for drinks
Not all of them drink so they weren't impressed by the awesome wine selection--I had a glass of a delicious White Knight and not all of them quite understood the concept of tapas
The drinks while pricey are really good
everyone who works here is awesome and the drinks are good
Zach our waiter was right there to offer us drinks and appetizers
It is not the best sushi I have ever had however I go here frequently with girl friends for happy hour because the sushi is good and we can get out of there full under $30 each including beer and/or saki
I recommend trying the flavored wine it is surprisingly tasty
They have great deals on appetizers and drinks
Good to remember that Total Wine is only a block away for a stop prior to coming here
Food = GreatAtmosphere = GreatService = So SoWe were told we had an hour wait and went to the bar for drinks and appetizers
The wait staff all work together so there is always someone around to answer a question get you a clean plate recommend a good wine etc
We waited for them to open take our names and then we headed next door for drinks and appetizers
Always ask the waitress on what's good since they have beer of the month choices
I think it's a summer special but lately Monday's have been happy hour til close with $3-$6 full-size apps and $5 glasses of wine- seriously there is not a better deal in town with this quality of food
They have a fairly good wine list and an appetizer list that just never catches my eye
99 - goodI tried a glass of their red sangria $4 and was pleasantly surprised by how good it was
They also have a nice wine list and tasty home made lemonade
that has very tasty food and a few nice wines to chose from
Great food good service STRONG drinks interesting and lively ambiance just an overall amazing experience
We also enjoyed the cooked breakfast in the morning and the complimentary drinks in the evening
We enjoyed a bottle of sparkling wine with our dinner
The appetizers and wine by the glass are only $5
And an amazing wine selection to choose from
This is a happy hour where you can eat a couple healthy high protien items and drink a glass of good wine all for under $20
I suggest starting with one of their amazing martinis or mojitos to reduce the pain of the bill
The ambiance is out of this world the food is to die for and the beer list is as good as it is long
The Kids Meal seemed a little high at $5 till I saw what she got--about ten little mini corn dogs she only ate two though she liked them just eats like a bird huge pile of excellent fries and drink of choice chocolate milk
I love the homemade lemonade that comes in huge glass and I am told the sweet tea is very good too
For drinks I had the unsweetened Thai iced tea for the first time and it was really quite good
The Prickly Peartini is probably one of the best drinks I have ever had it was not too sweet and not too tart just delicious and refreshing
duck fries whatever  The drink selection was amazing and the server was even nice enough to give a starving chickie some pretzels I would definitely go there again though
They still have the amazing wine selection absolutely delicious bruschetta get the tomato jam and goat cheese heavenly
It's a good relaxing time w/ friends and family ignore the drunks unless you plan to drink also
I went out earlier this week and I had a good time there but it's not a restaurant it's a good place to have some drinks and karaoke
The honey beer I forget the official name was very off in flavor when I drank it at home it must have been sitting around for some time it was bad
Sundays are industry night and all sushi rolls and appetizers are half off as well as every drink in the house
The prices were good and the fact that we came within happy hour time brought  the already low drink and appetizer prices down even more
A few of us got the Grilled Shrimp Risotto and they made my mom something that wasn't on the menu at her requestThe service was excellent and our server did a great job suggesting the right wine for each person on the group
I was visiting Scottsdale and searched high and low for a trendy Sunday brunch restaurant that had good drink specials and fun music and Yelp definitely took me there
I recommend going early for drinks at the bar
Things I have tried that I would recommendedChicken Tortellini chicken spinach pink sauce which is a vodka sauceMushroom Ravioli with pink sauceButternut Ravioli in a garlic butterCalamariAntipasto SaladThey also have a decent wine selectionThe servers have always been prompt and attentiveWhile this isn't a place I would drive and seek out if you live in the neighborhood it is a great weekday go to and has made it in my rotation when I don't feel like cooking
We'll definitely be going back to the Vine due to proximity and good drink specials
I agree with one of the other reviewers that this is way better than the GAP event that is part of the Scottsdale Culinary Festival because there you have to pay for food and drink in addition to the entrance fee and so I spent way more money there last year but the quality of selections just does not compare to Devoured
The quality standard for the people who live up here in Cave Creek is obviously very very low but El Encanto is a really a place to bring your Aunt Sadie when she comes to town for a charming drink or two
The atmosphere was cool the pizza was tasty and decently priced and the 2 pitchers of Amber Beer I had consumed were also excellent
The service was amazing and they had great drink specials although I did not partake because I had been drinking earlier at RnR in Scottsdale and my stomach needed a rest
Go here for A great country-like setting great sandwiches good service and nice drink specials
Yes the drinks are pricey but that's to be expected it's worth it
After all It is JUST a simple sports bar with plenty of HD screens in good angles beer specials and very good wings
Drinks were a hit too I had champagne-so you could plan for a Kir Royal and nice appetizer at the bar or stay for dinner
The Raj IPA and the Kilt Lifter were two beers that I really enjoyed and I'd recommend to any beer drinker =All in all the place had a brewery feel to it the food was your normal pub grub and the beer was good
This was the only place near by I considered an option for stealing a delicious beer during lunch which at the time was 6pm to deal with the hell that is Big Box Office Land
The beer selection isn't fantastic and their prices are east coast range average which is pretty lame but I always enjoyed whatever I ordered
The drinks are a lot more affordable the entrees are somewhat cheaper and most of them are pretty tasty
We chose to do the chef's tasting menu with wine pairing it was pricey but totally worth it
The wines were delicious also although I got pretty drunk by my 3rd glass and course meal
I chose a champagne and berry drink which was tasty and unassumingly strong
com Taking up the old Coronado house that formerly housed the Lisa G Winebar The Main Ingredient Ale House and Cafe offers high quality salads sandwiches and other assorted snack goodies at an incredibly reasonable see one of the best deals in town prices
The waiters will break the souffle and pour that grand marnier creme onto it for you with much relish and that sauce is so good I could lick it from the bowl and drink it from the little saucer by itself
We went here last night for a late dinner and some beers and had AMAZING service
Granted unless you get all $8 a pint beers you are not getting the full value but you do get to sample many good micro and craft brews
Great low priced fares from Allegiant good service resonable food and drink option and it looks like they are expanding for Spirit Airlines to join this fall 2012
When I asked the hostess and manager to get us some cocktails or appetizers while we waited-they brought out one glass of champagne total for 20 girls
They serve good drunk food even late at night have a great selection of beer as well as bar games to play
The service was fabulous we had more than 4 people attend to our table throughout the evening and our waitress was very helpful with wine & food recommendations
Good to know info They have a menu on the bar from the Bar across the way Ice House Tavern where you can get a discount on your drinks if you take your food to eat there or if you want you can grab a few togos from them and Two Hippies will let you drink 'em in their joint
That said if you want fun people/cougar watching and throw back a few glasses of wine or cocktails sit in the bar area and have a great meal with almost as good service as any other table
Drinks appetizers and deserts were all 5 stars
We also got some wine a Buca Chianti and it was also not worth the price tag
The meal starts with their trademark warm sourdough bread as good as you get in San Francisco and on this night New Years they were offering complimentary glasses of champagne nice touch
They have a wonderful happy hour menu from food and drinks but this is defiantly a place that you need to plan on dining for a while
The chocolate mousse was good but served in a wine glass so it was a pain to eat
Short Ribs in red wine reduction lived up to their fork-tender description deep in savory goodness and lying on a bed of better-than-Grandma's mashed potatoes
My husband and I got the sampler and our wonderful server gave us tastes of others including their home brewed root beer
I asked my buddy where I could acquire a delicious dark beer last night and immediately was told to get to the Yard House because they serve at least 100 different beers from all over the world
Wines by the glass really big glass are half off and there are good deals on the cocktails as well
The guy and girl who were working on the morning I decided to give this place another shot were better than the other baristas I had encountered before but they were so chatty with each other and with my friend I waited a good 4 or 5 mins just to tell them what I wanted to drink
I was finally able to order my drink after a good long while of listening to her talk about vintage aprons
They have a pretty extensive drink menu including some tasty microbrews
I always try to support local places and I LOVE that they not only brew their own beer here but they don't forget about having delicious food to accompany the beer
Here is what we all ordered and ALL of it is highly recommended the Fish and Chips huge pieces of fresh and crispy fish with deelish beer battered fries Fish tacos tasty grilled mahi mahi with a side of well seasoned black beans Aegan burger apparently the BEST burger my friend has ever tasted we're getting it next time
I highly recommend this place good food good drinks and an all around great time
Oh and the past few times the drinks haven't even been worth it
Get a bottle of wine and one of their appetizers cheese dish is good but small
Also I highly recommend going in the fall or spring on a really nice night so you can sit outside with your wine
The wine is a beautiful deep red with a full-bodied smooth flavor - which went well with my entree the prime hanger steak $24 cooked medium well
Not a bad price to pay for great food great wine and quality time with friends
The cost of the $9 wine did NOT cover the appetizers as that was part of the convention agreement
Our water glasses were more empty then full had to ask for refills on chips appetizers came out literally at the same time as the meal WE GOT ID'd just a mini annoyance
Cons - The home made rootbeer is not as good as A&W but you may like it more than me
I walked in found a seat and was promptly greeted and had a delicious beer in my hand within a few short minutes
The service was top-notch and our server made excellent wine recommendations
I appreciate his taste for good food and drink
Wine - pretty good wine selection and a good price by the bottle and glass
I was surprised when she was entering our order into her pad the other servers were bring our drinks and appetizers
Our server was amazing and gave great suggestions for the menu and for wines as well
but bottom-line they have great food and a wonderful wine bubbly and beer selection
would've ordered a glass of port too but I wasn't impressed with the choices
It was a bit more than we expected but we did order 3 drinks total an app 3 entrees & dessert so I'd say that it was worth it for the amazingness that is Fez
A surprising fave was the cheeseless pizza which had a really richflavorful tomato sauce and went well with the wine we ordered can't remember the name but it was a local wine [who woulda thought Arizona has good wines
I would just recommend going for drinks and maybe split an appetizer
Here's the quick rundown-Plenty of paid parking for $5 on the lawns west of the fields-Wide concourses with plenty of tasty ballpark grub beer stands and ice cream vendors-Three dry goods stores-Ample seating plus neat lawn areas in the outfields-Shaded seats on the west side of the field good to know if you're uber pale like I am-Free sunscreen stations no excuse to turn into a lobster here fantastic idea there
for  a much needed happy hour and i enjoyed that five dollar wine we both had whites
tasty food and nice place to enjoy HH drink for sure
My husband purchased a groupon for this place the groupon was good for 5 wine tasting and an appetizer
One other good thing about this place is that they bottle their own wine and also you can having a bottling party yourself
The beers are good if you like good beer i
The service was great and they have a wonderful drink menu including a beer list with local beer and a couple IPA's to choose from
The drinks are good creative and tasty a little on the smallish side for my taste
An amazing list of delicious drinks on the wall behind the counter
Hidden House pricing on the specials is pretty good  the wait staff is cool and they serve beer
If you can handle not being able to hear the person with whom you're dining in exchange for really fresh sushi and good drink deals 50% off plus 75 cents then try it out
the guy sat drinking his cold beer - that made us feel good to know there were good people willing to step out & do a good deed
I really enjoyed every single one of those drinks they ranged from a really smooth relaxing drink to some with a little more kick
good wine and beer selection at affordable pricing
This Picazzos location has screwed me twice now on their unhappy hour half-price appetizers and $1 off glasses of wine
Happy hour drink prices are good but not a steal - $5 well drinks margaritas and wine $3 bottles of beer
Soups salads and panninis are all delicious and make it worth coming even if you can't partake of their fantastic wine list
Served in a good sized glass jar it offered a throwback to days when lemonade tasted good and not just sugary
The time before last I had to show the server how to open a bottle of wine which he spilled on me and tonight we were brought the wrong appetizer and then had to wait at least 30 minutes to get the correct one
If you are hungry/need a drink and got time to kill before your flight JR is definitely a worthy place
The beer garden was a brilliant addition and 100% of the profits from it go to support Community Food Connections the wonderful organization that keeps downtown Phoenix from being a true food desert
at 98 South last night for drinks and appetizers
If I happen to be in the neighborhood and the wait isn't obscene then I would swing by for some appetizers and maybe a beer
We're huge fans of standup comedy so we'll keep going back to the Improv for more and more but I just wish they had a good beer available in the balcony area
Its reasonably priced with 8 bucks a glass - ps you must try the moscato its sweet but amazing
On an extended business trip I went to Cartel every single morning and they always impressed me* really friendly knowledgeable staff who takes pride in the brewing and origination of the coffee* the barista offers great recommendations based on your tastes as if you were ordering wine with a meal
Beer was tasty of course and I got the Green Chili Pork - delish
It is different to be certain and while I am not a fan of everything on the menu I do appreciate the smaller portions and the excellent wine list
Their food is pretty good but I wouldn't really classify this as a dining destination - this place is about the beer
I've had pizza beer bread burgers appetizers and wings and they have never let me down
So we got a wonderful bottle of wine for only $17
There is plenty of seating so it's a good place to hang out after work and have some drinks
I also thought the waitress was very attentive and quick to serve additional drinks and bring appetizers
Tickets were $17 bucks with a two purchase drinks/food minimum we went to the 9 show which was drinks/appetizers only
They have a wonderful outdoor area with a wine bar and tables for use during cooler weather
I ordered the white wine flight only because the first wine was Kung Fu Girl Reisling - I was impressed the tastings were 3 oz each which is more than most places provide
Really attentive and gave great recommendations on local beers the restaurant stocked
The restaurant also has the Last Drop Bar attached and people are there to drink and have a good time
The drinks and bar service are always good
Like its name Jalapeno Inferno Bistro Mexicana has a correspondingly large food menu & drink menu and it was all really good
We got no drinks for appetizers and the meal was $21
But when it comes to specialty mixologist ingredients and an amazing beer selection I stalk the aisles of BevMo
But as far as burgers go give me a Original Wineburger I like burgers that have flavor are juicy and on amazing freshly baked buns
It happened to be Happy Hour at Padres which meant reduced price drinks and appetizers
However halfway into my meal my glass was dry and it sat that way for a good 10 minutes
I go to the 8th Street Ale as my beer of choice but the RAJ IPA is also excellent and I recommend trying it if you see it on cask
It's just too intertwined with our local culture to be worthy of less from me
Good drinks are a total loss in such a tiny space
50 and the wine is $8-12/glass but the drink is worth the money
My review should honestly be two lines 1Good strong delicious pricey drinks that you should enjoy; and 2 tiny cramped space not good for large parties or too many patrons
To cool the heat we enjoyed a tall glass of Thai iced tea
Although I've never had very great service here kind of slow and unattentive everything I've had on the menu has been excellent and they have a longer-than-normal beer list too
The server was very knowledgeable about the menu pasta and wine and made some excellent recommendations
I started the evening with a Cosmopolitan which was not only excellent but was preceded by the waitress' very impressive walk over to our table Cosmo in hand which she performed without spilling a drop of the drink which was almost sloshing over the sides of the martini glass
My last drink of the evening was the Merc Mojito and as my sister is so fond of saying a restaurant is only as good as it's worst Mojito
Alas they make excellent drinks and a relative works there so I gave it two stars
Ok to start off with I'd like to say that the beer and food were both good but I have to give this place 1 star because the service was absolutely abysmal
There are certain things that were just bad-the desk clerk told us breakfast was from 6-1030 when it was 630-10 and we get downstairs at 1010 and had to go until lunch on empty stomachs-the door to the bar from the pool was broken automatic sliding door so we had to pry it open every time we wanted a drinksome things were okay-clean rooms-quiet area but kind of far from downtown which is were we had to go every morning-outdoor seating by the poolsome things were good-waterfalls in the pool-fridge and microwave in the room-beach volleyball court it averages out to 3 stars
She also recommended various drinks besides the Mimosas
HH is from 5-7; $5 wines $20 bottles of wine We ordered a delicious bottle of Syrah for $20 normally $29
We ordered the Santa Cristina Sangiovese 2009 for our wine selection which was excellent looking at reviews of this wine some really liked it others said ho hum
I'm just going to Buffalo Wild Wings next time they have a $5 cover and a drink minimum but it has to be worth it
When our drinks arrived mine was frothy and delicious
I highly recommend trying this drink if you want something refreshing but not froo froo
But I'll be damned if the drinks aren't delicious
We started with the calamari and the beer bread with beer cheese for an appetizer
I had an awesome red beer then a pilsner both very very good
Friday night and Im wanting to go somewhere with a cool atmosphere and some good drinks and mabey some good food
Im not sure if all the good reviews are from people that got sidetracked from the atmosphere or if they dont know food and thought they were eating something special or if they had to many drinks before the food
We ate out on the beautiful porch of this amazing house and although we don't drink we were welcomed and enjoyed the experience
We all had a couple drinks and some of us had appetizers
I am not the best sushi critic being that I am vegetarian but I think they have pretty good veggie rolls and edamame  I mostly enjoy the atmosphere and the drinks here
The restauraunt seemed to have a lot of good options for wine as well
$35 later pretip we were gorged on two glasses of quality Arizona wine and 8 count em 8 tapas
My strawberry margarita was pretty good and Hubby got the most exotic beer they had- Killian's
Food is good but in my experience their beer makes the meal
It is casual with really good food but plays loud top 40 music with great drinks
The service is good - our waitress remembered our drink and heat-level preferences after our first visit
The only thing bacon-y about it was a skewered piece of chewy bacon climbing out the top - good for display but perhaps they should consider cooking it first or maybe working the flavor into the drink
Looking back i probably should have stuck with water although the Ginger Beer was rudimentary for palate preservation as you meander through all of the various flavors of this cuisine
Service is always excellent - we generally end up talking to our server for awhile when we're here blame the 1-liter beers and they're always really friendly and outgoing
At 830 we asked if we could get some appetizers and drinks while we waited
Good drink menu too and hostesses are always friendly
The have really good happy hour specials too half off apps dollar off wines and beers and the beers and wines they carry are pretty good
But some friends had heard good things about Sake Bombers so we decided to drink away the week there
also they have a root beer float flavor that's pretty tasty if you're into that
We were a party of three so sat at the wine bar inside and each ordered a glass of Chilean/ Brazilian reds that we very much enjoyed the wine-tender allowed me to taste like it was Baskin Robbins so I could find my soul mate vintage
It was a good tasting tea and a very good selection on my part as an alternative to soft drinks
Flat screen for watching the D'backs and some good beers on tap along with Happy Hour specials makes this a great place
I can only compare it to Kabuki's drink menu only with what I assume to be higher quality
Drink was tasty service was bitchy
Further for those of you that spend hours on end in coffeehouses THEY HAVE FREE WI-FI -DThe coffee flavored coffee and tropical ice tea are good I personally tend not to stray into more interesting coffee drinks so you'd have to check those out yourself and the entire selection of both food and drinks is very reasonably priced compared to corporate coffee
Review for the Scottsdale Road locationThe Spotted Donkey is a semi-upscale Mexican restaurant with absolutely delicious food and great-tasting drinks especially the signature margaritas
Good Service  lush wine selection yummy tidbits
They are not a 'wine bar' but the selections are well thought out and very tasty
Also know that the wine list is lengthy and very comprehensive but in an excellent way
The wine was excellent and was so fragrant and inviting that Melissa's purse had to have a taste
She loved the food liked that they didn't hesitate when she special ordered her Rigatoni with a different sauce she liked the atmosphere the mixed drink was potent my lasagna was very good and we loved the side of meatballs we both ordered
All in all I really liked Terroir--good wine good food and laid back  atmosphere
TONS of beer and alcohol selection great menu and wonderful service
OK 1 more thingI spent an entire summer drinking my way through our kegs of Weihanstephan Korbinian a seasonal beer that is very good but VERY hard to find alas
Whether you prefer the Dunkel or the FrancisKaner they are all delicious glasses of Heaven
However the Coconut Joe delighted me - it's coffee/coconut flavor is delightful and it's a thick beer so it makes me happy
The wine and cheese plate that was sent at turn down service was delicious - they had humbolt fog my favorite goat cheese ever
After spending minutes of sifting through books in the used books section and in the inner part of the library I definitely was craving something delicious to drink - and I was reasonably satisfied
We loved Hazelwoods because it's a good place to watch a sporting event the food is good the wings are good but not hot enough even the suicide are like medium and the beer selection is good
The cook was drinking espresso and watching Good Fellas when we came in
Amazing stonework and beautiful stained glass
Whether it be for a beer with friends or to watch sports on the weekend I would definitely recommend checking this place out
$5 for a smaller pitcher of good beers on Sundays - great deal
Servers would awesome with recommendations and making their unique drinks
A tasty hoppy beer that will get the job done
The beer selection is really great and the mugs are worth a smile
They have a decent selection of good bottled beer including
The excellent variety of beers on tap including Strongbow cider yay
I've made a lot of friends here customers AND employees and I've consumed MANY amazing beers here
My cocktail was strong and poured professionally Sazerac and the beer selections were also good went with the Lagunitas IPA
Honestly if the burgers were as amazing as we expected them to be we wouldn't have made a bit of a stink about the beers
The cheese selection was good as was the drinks
And the drinks are made with the excellent crushed ice chips that i love
Now the food is good the beer is cold so that's worth three stars at least
Both were stellar as was the antipasto appetizer and the house red wine
It seemed strange at first putting hot peanut dressing on a cold salad but wow that dressing is so good I could drink it
We ended at Fifth and Wine who had some amazing apps for us to try
Most of their drinks are definitely worth staying for their large is served in a glass the size of a beer mug
They have some very good martini's I'm a gin drinker and they use tanqueray for their martini's
We enjoyed drinks and a terrific flatbread appetizer before finally succumbing to the server's constant barrage of dinner offerings
The menu has interesting salads apps main dishes and the wine was delicious as well although I'm not sure what it was
When we arrived my colleagues had already ordered wine and the pretzel appetizer
We added a little wine a little beer music and good friends and it was a party
The drinks were amazing too - we ordered the special margarita and bloody mary and they were both great
No offer to comp our drinks or an appetizer no apology
Recommended DrinksI think I've tried at least 2 other drinks from their menu but I can't remember what they were called
At TJ's you can get things like good table wines Italian-made pasta gourmet sauces and interesting cheese at prices that allow the masses to see how the other half lives
Only little tweaks were the bar ran out of some items which proved the items were good I guess and some of the drinks cocktails could have been a little stronger for the price
I tasted one of their Frescas drinks and boy was it tasty; it was called Santa's something
They have pretty good drink prices and daily specials
Oh well the drinks and food were good service was good atmosphere was good and the value of our dollar for what we received was great
I have also tried both types of cake lemon and rootbeer and although they were both good I would have to say that the lemon is the clear winner
Overall good good good service good beer
The house wine was good and the desserts were definately worth saving room for
OK Good glass of wine specials all day for $5 had a fabby NZ Sav Blanc
I would like to try 1 more time - they do have some really good specials for lunch and different days have specials of the day such as 1/off bottles of wine - on a monday I think
Plus we have already given you a good break on the prices of your drinks
I remember the food being delicious the vibe being cool and the beers being cold
The decor aside the food and drinks were very good too
That wont be hard since the pizza is so good and such a good value you can stop in for the lunch specials which I normally pick up either 2 slices and a drink for $4 or a slice drink & salad bar for $4
Although the food wine and atmosphere are all good sadly I must say I have been let down
I really would love to give the place four stars because the food and wine are certainly worth it but due to my traumatic experience its just a-ok
Happy hour is something like 3-6 with half off most appetizers and like $2 off drinks
The key to this restaurant is atmosphere and good drinks
They also have two different flavors of Chimay Beer
But if you do choose to check this place out I recommend going for drinks and not the food and be prepared for the stereotypical Scottsdale scene
Everyone was there to have a good time and people would be enjoying a beer while waiting for seats
Even in England I'd never had such flavorful beer battered fries
The antipasto plate was average the pizza was tasty but nothing special and the wine selection was decent
Yep this place is quite European in terms of the minimal service and wine with lunch but the food was excellent
I also have to mention that they have a great wine selection of course if you know Cowboy Ciao or Kaz which are owned by the same guy and their cocktails are good too
We had a nice wine recommended by our waitress that was reasonably priced and very good
An excellent choice of spirits beers and smartass bartenders that are masters of hilarious attitude make this place a hit
I had water to drink and thank goodness
50 half off certain appetizers and well drinks for $2
The kisras and hummus are good the tilapia is nothing extraordinary but good and drinks with the 'well' vodka svedka are all good
The Thai Basil is their signature dish and certainly doesn't skimp on its namesake fresh basil and thick flavorful sauce
The wine list is extensive and there are always helpful recommendations for any palatte or budget for that matter
They have an excellent beer selection and the staff is knowledgeable and has given me good recommendations for beer to try
There were definitely some green chile sliders some garlic shrimp a couple tacos a tasty flatbread pizza thing a couple beers
We enjoyed the food family style with some beer
On the plus side our server was very good as was the beer
For you kids out there they also have regular ice cream which i haven't had cause I'm an adult and adults drink their calories on top of the alcoholic flavors so no ones left out
The service at the beginning was pretty good we were seated right away and we were asked for our drink order right away as well
I had only one glass of diet coke but at least my sister was able to order a beer which it looked like they had a pretty good selection of
Regardless of that though it's a good place to have a nice dim-lit dinner with reasonably priced bottles of wine
The drink prices were high for the quality and the size
i'm not the biggest fan of beers but the beer that the bartender recommended to me was really good
The patio is excellent for beer drinking and hanging with friends
I drink lots and lots of water and a full glass of water when I'm out is my barometer for a great tip or a good tip
Kokopelli has been one of these consistent wines we tend to lean towards sweet whites and find they offer some derivation of almost all or our favorite varietals reisling muscat sauvignon etc The food has always been consistently good and we were thrilled when we heard we were getting a Kokopelli in surprise after visiting the surprise location we were pleased to find that the same consistency and quality carries over from the chandler location at my last visit I ordered the fish and chips which were severals strips of tilapia wiht crunchy tasty panko breading
The meal was really good friendly staff and just a fun place to chill and have a good meal and a beer
But anyway we split of bottle of wine that was delicious
Now to the description and ill be honest i really enjoyed the iced coffee the drink was made pretty decently this is no sour tasting coffee
Late at night when the hunger could no longer be quenched by drinks my wife and I ordered some sort of a pizza thing that was reasonable priced and sized and was actually tasty
I had heard good things so I was really looking forward to some fun with good friends and good beer
There's not really a lot of good deals to be had but beers are relatively well priced even when not on happy hour
The wine shop next door is such a good idea
Both were excellent as was the selection of wines
The beer was good the atmosphere was exactly what an Irish bar should be the band was REALLY good
The decor of wine barrels on the wall is nice and comfortable a bar in the center of everything with a tv which appeared to have a good selection of alcohol
As we sat down a friendly waitress came and took our drink and appetizer order
She brought the drinks but she never brought the appetizers
I get they're probably doing the Groupon thing perpetually to draw people in who want to buy the ridiculously-priced food and drinks $12 for a crabcake appetizer but if you're like me and just want to see a movie in a theater this is a no-brainer
Friendly bartenders cheap drinks good-looking crowd great music
My drink was absolutely delicious a cherry amaretto mocha and my husband and I split a yummy homemade brownie
I was impressed with the size of the glasses of wine they are not stingey
It is a low-key house-turned bar that serves solid food executed extremely well alongside beer and wine that has obviously been selected with care by fans of things that taste good
Overall it was a good dark cool divey place for a pit stop with a good drink selection
AMC Esplanade 14 in the Biltmore area of Phoenix underwent major renovations turning its 14 theaters into chic dine-in auditoriums where viewers reserve their seats and get restaurant-quality service as they fill up on food and drinks while watching the flicks
The servers try to take your full order from appetizers and drinks to dessert all at once so they keep the disruptions during the film to a minimum
The prices were good - large hot sake for $2
Didn't get a chance to try out their amazing beer selection will have to try that out the next time I'm here for a show
They could use a few more flavors for their coffee drinks though I like butter rum and butterscotch if you;re reading
We looked at the menu briefly and ordered our drinks an appetizer a soup and two main dishes
If you are looking for a fun place to have a beer this would be a good place to go but dinner or lunch I would not recommend at Murphy's Haus
We decided on drinks a beer for the hubs and some tasty tempranillo for me and ordered a large salad and a pizza to split
Humble Pie a nice place to relax and unwind with good drinks and food
I love the layout the decor the staff the coffee and bar drinks their baked goods - at least I did until I tried the cookies
They were not cheap $1 a piece and not particularly large but I believe in spending a bit more for small business's sake and good quality
I'm always tempted to order a beer from the craziest looking tap but I find that the bartender is the best person to speak to for recommendations to suit your taste
More like a gastropub with a lot of good beers
I've been to The House a couple of times now and the food and drinks are good however the hostess is just down right rude and needs to find a new job where she doesn't work around people
I'll be back to check out their happy hour they advertise 3 dollar beers and 5 dollar appetizers
Not only are the sake bombs excellently priced but there is a little buffet free of sushi egg rolls and some meat dish
I am not a huge wine drinker I love it but I don't know much about picking out a good wine and I am often on a budget
00 2 items off the cheaper appetizer snack menu alsoThey ahve what is probably over 50 beers on tap if your a beer drinkers this place would be a good stop
There was one point where  the waitress got busy and a few drinks sat empty for a minute but I was impressed that the manager was walking around throughout the time and caught the dry drinks
It's on the back wall and you watch them throw in oranges and see the delicious nectar drip right into the pitcher that fills your glass fills but probably not refills

And the specialty lemonade drinks were good
The food is very good for a Brewery Bar and of course there is the beer
Their mixed drinks are just okay in the end not worth what they cost
Nice atmosphere good baked wings decent beer selection
There are a ton of good choices for beer on tap and bottled and overall it is a great spot
we each had two drinks a pear martini which was excellent and an even better white cosmo
They also have a great wine selection appetizers and it's definitely the best Pad Thai that I've had in Arizona
The drinks/elixirs may sound like medicine but they were very tasty especially the ginger one and I LOVE ginger
With the 2 drinks we got out of there for about $60 which is a bit pricey but so worth it considering the taste quality and service
Everything was good until the end of our meal when we asked to take our $50 bottle of wine home
Service was good our server Mike did an excellent job checking up on us and refilling are drinks and making sure we had everything we needed through out our meal
In general Delux is OK the food is descent nothing to rave home about the sweet fries are worth coming here for and the beer selection and bar is great the seating is cramped if your a big guy like me you will want to sit on the patio
Very good beer nice atmosphere and nice employees
They have good drink prices especially when they have specials going on
First the good Friendly bartenders and cocktail servers that do their best to make sure you always have a drink when you need one
The root beer cake was good but not as delectable as we thought it would be
Their selection of beers isn't staggering or anything but the food there is actually pretty damn decent and they have a fair number of appetizers to choose from that aren't too heavy
At this point I don't need much additional info but you might so they do have the full compliment of other tap beer and some bottles that you would expect and is needed for a good night
For UFC good viewing seats are limited but i have found no reason not to show up 2-3 hours early start eating and drinking and avoid cover while getting the best seat in the house but that is me
The Pacifico beer that accompanied it however was just wonderful -  I'd comment on the other dishes we had but they are variations on the theme above
My drink was good I stayed with a safe bet I have had before
Sunday is AZ winery special which is a nice touch  must try the Pimms cup cocktail excellent
it's not really close to our house but i can see us heading back there my wife really enjoyed the food and the impressive beer selection might make it worth the journey
Thanks to the excellent service my water glass was never more than half-empty which allowed me to push forward to the end
Their specialty drinks were only $5 and they are great quality
Beyond the wonderful drinks the food was to die for
An appetizer 6 drinks and 4 entrees came to $66 so the price is very reasonable and I just adored sitting outside under the trees
A huge beer and a warm pasty the casual atmosphere and aroma of the mouth watering red wine gravy all blend into a wonderful dining experience
Pascucci serves chilled blended coffees hot coffee and a variety of espresso drinks not as big of a selection of Starbucks but when the quality of brew is superior this was the last thing on my mind
I sampled a few flavors of gelato sugar free vanilla and chocolate--both were decadent flavorful and didn't have an aftertaste of artificial sweetener while I debated on my drink order
All were really good and reasonably priced as were our glasses of Malbec
For a place that doesn't hit any of my usual culinary hot buttons ethnic superb quality fine wine list creative
The wine pairings were also amazing and that's coming from someone who rarely drinks reds
I only come to a bar to watch the game have a couple of beers and eat good food
For bar food Four Peaks has the best nachos awesome grilled chicken beer bread tasty artichoke dip and a great house hamburger
We would go after 8 pm because they have great sushi appetizer and drink specials
Birch Beer I think is much more tastey than rootbeer but all in all Joes is A++ To have Joe's in your neighborhood is great good country BBQ
I would recommend this to anyone drinkers or non drinkers alike
For beer I went with an Orange Blossom I normally do not enjoy this style of beer but it's really good
but it's so small that people end up dancing wherever and count on getting bumped in to by enough posing muscle heads and drunk girls that $10 worth of your $12 drink has been spilled on someone's Tru Religion jeans
Our waiter was excellent drinks were refilled the bread basket was kept full and the food came out hot
I had 3 glasses of Chianti the grilled veggies and the little-neck clams with plenty of bread to sop up the delicious buttery wine sauce and the check was just $25
They also had a beer pong table and a flippy cup table Those are huge bonus's at last call the people over playing flippy cup something had happened to make a couple guys jump on one and beat him down there wasn't any real security that I had saw but it got broke up pretty fast and cooler head prevealed altough they kept churping at each other and the got that got jumped on had a pretty good gash over his left eyebrow
I have never had a good time at Charlie's without drinking enough to forget I was at Charlie's
The service has been very good so far with friendly bartenders and servers who are pretty prompt in delivering the drinks which is no small feat given that each one is handcrafted and unique
Many of the drinks are outstanding but I definitely recommend the Brown Derby bourbon-based Queen's Park Swizzle rum-based and the Rising Sun tequila-based
Drinks were really good too hand crafted by the bar tender
A good date place with a small but expertly prepared menu but easily a $60 night for two if you each have a meal and two drinks
The drinks are good full flavor and not watered down
The only positive aspect of Enotria is that they have a good selection of wines
1 star3 Once the waitress took my order she brought my drink and appetizer quickly
Although I prefer the beer at another local brewery this place has amazing food
I had the stuffed mushroom burger which was amazing and I couldn't get enough of their beer battered fries
Excellent beer and wine selection and the prices aren't too shabby either
I dont know if its the quality of the food the atmosphere or the great selection of beer here but Dean and the rest of the people over at the Cornish Pasty Co
The guys ordered beers and us ladies had non-alcoholic beverages so not sure how their Margs are but as I could see many people ordered them so they must be good
They have a very good selection of sake and authentic appetizers
The drinks are damn tasty at SideBar
The coffee is tasty and I never drink straight up coffee
Had an amazing dinner 7 course tasting menu with the enhanced wine paring
The staff is super nice and comped me a swig of a most amazing fresh pennywort drink
for a wine tasting event at Bacchus a couple of weeks ago and we had a wonderful evening out I know I just wrote a couple of weeks ago
When I'm in the mood to drink I love their mojitos -- they are all amazingly good
If you come during happy hour you can get the Goat Cheese appetizer for $5 then Pork Chile Verde dish for $8 and share a house white wine carafe for $12
Considering the size of the burger and that it was AZ local beer from San Tan brewery I was pretty impressed
Although from a bartenders perspective I recommend to drink at least 5 to get your moneys worth
The place was pretty empty but the drinks were good and the staff was nice
If you're looking for a place with excellent customer service a full bar I didn't know Bomberos had only beer and wine and awesome very fresh ahi tuna on a crispy wonton you may want to turn south to the Corbin's lot when you see it and skip Bomberos
We ordered wine appetizer salad dinner and a to go dessert
They were serving hot cereal Skillet scrambles baked pancakes and hot coffee drinks along with all the other goodies they create in their 65' Airstream trailer turned kitchen and cocktails from behind the bar of what the owner told us used to service Chicagoans before during and after prohibition
Customer Service was AWEFUL on a scale of 1-5 food was 1 drinks were ok the only good thing was the atmosphere which is NOT going to change my mind about going back there I've had much much better fish tacos @ Rubio's & Baja Fresh for fraction of the price & didn't have to go to dinner somewhere else after leaving which we had to do after leaving Tortilla Factory
The beer and wine selection are above average and the pizza was excellent
Anyway the wine list was fabulous we had a delicious Sangiovese and the entrees were decent
If you don't believe me then leave it for those of us who do -- the number one non-alcoholic drink to be had with good pizza
Overall I dropped about 175 bucks for 2 people without drinks but well worth it
Prices were good - I think my meal which was a lot of food and included a drink was about $15 including tip
Their beer selection is pretty great - I had the Something Something Union Jack IPA both times and my GF greatly enjoyed her sangria
A Good Place To Day Drink as their motto goes and never look back
The patio is perfect for getting together with friends after work and enjoying some yummy appetizers and good drinks
Amazing wine list fantastic pizzas with unusual toppings and gnutella crepes for dessert
Frequenting the Biltmore as much as I did I found a nice refreshing atmosphere where the people watching is as good as the new drinks featured on the menu
There's not much I can complain about here - I was treated nice the seats were comfy and the drink was tasty
I enjoyed a glass of Gewu00fcrztraminer while a variety of libations went down easy around the table as well including mojitos and beer
Wifey doesn't drink much so I had some of the house- recommended cabernet
Large beer selection and full service bar good for a few during happy hour and great place to bring your friends
once again I realize that most places in the area seem to concentrate on making tasty lattes and mochas but I'm not a fluffy drink kind of guy
So perhaps Amsterdam the country is as famous for their amazing martinis as Amsterdam the club
One of my favorite things about Sala Thai is their mocktail drink selection including several fruit flavors Thai iced tea Thai coffee and I believe they also recently added Boba style drinks
Anytime anyone tells me they like good beer I bring them here
One of the servers recommended that I try the pink lady drink
Was there for dinner on Monday and whilst there wasn't many people in there we still had to wait about 10 minutes to get our drinks and another 10 to order the appetizer
We are kind of coffee snobs and the drinks were wonderful
Overwhelming variety of unique delicious drinks
The only good thing was that the drinks were strong and the staff was friendly
I also found out that I am not as good at pinball after I have been drinking
The sauvignon blanc wine I tried was really good and reasonably priced at $8 for the glass
heard the margherita was good from my brother and the beers my father had were refreshing for him as well
They also have a ton of drink specials from the tried and true bottle of domestic brew to funky flavored sangrias
They also serve up some tasty cocktails and have a nice selection of beer
We only went for happy hour but wine was 1/2 off certain apps were half off and the gravy covered fries were freaking amazing
We had so much food with a fantastic wine and wonderful service
Have the wines in stock that you advertise as specials and for Pete's sake make sure they taste good
The wine list was actually quite decent but the basic house wines were just-ok California large labels =  And the dessert wasn't good
I was impressed and glad to see that as AG sauce is my preferred brand and has lots of flavor and isn't hot for the sake of hot
Happy hour boasts great drink and appetizer specials
Too long didn't read version If you go to this Cracker Barrel make sure you get a good server and if it starts to take more than 10 minutes to get your drink order taken you should consider leaving before you even start
I've been to Jade Bar a couple of times for drinks and I've always been really impressed
They have a built in GPS system on the carts which helps speed up play and the drink wagon is fully stocked with all kinds of drinks and good food
Hopefully I can find something to drink soon that is good or I might have to start looking for another coffee shop
Not some blended drink worth 500 calories
Obviously service was amazing as our group was never left with an empty champagne glass for long
The bad part about the venue is that if you want to drink you have to stay by the bar to watch the show and there's not usually a good view
Everyone's food looked good especially the Wine burger
I almost wish someone would find a way to fuck up peach tea so I could judge how good all this tea I've been drinking really is
Four Peaks' beer is really good and getting it on the cheap makes it even better
But what makes inexpensive good beer even more enjoyable is when you can have it with equally-good food
You would naturally assume the same would hold for a brew pub that is known for their good beer
Four Peaks has you forget that old adage as their food manages to be as good as their beer
The Beer is good most of the food is ok but I have a big issue with BJ's
They know their cigars and damn it they know how to make a good drink
their coffee drinks are amazing and you can just smell the quality when you walk in the door
I spent most of my time at the South Pool where service was excellent thanks Vanessa for always being right there and remembering not only my drink but those of my friends
Also I tried the lemon and fresh blueberry vodka drink it was so good
Right from the beginning you know this is someplace special as before you even enter the gardens you come upon a wonderful man made rock formation with three incredible Chihuly glass sculptures titled Desert Towers
My recommendation is make a day of this take your time look everywhere take photographs have lunch at the patio cafu00e9 drink lots of water you are in the desert put on some comfortable walking shoes and enjoy the show
We started sipping the wine while waiting for our appetizers
Awesome-The staff is pretty cool-You almost never need a tee time you can show up and they will usually fit you in no problem-No dress code a huge plus while playing in the summer-A pretty forgiving course wider fairways-Cheap hotdogs in the snack area and they pump the AC pretty cold in the lounge-No doglegs on the course I fucking hate those-They don't seem to give a shit when you smuggle your own beer on the course-No punk kid cleaning your clubs 2 seconds after you are done playing so you feel obligated to give him a tipThe Con's-A good portion of the grass is fucked up
Good quality cheese minimal sauce and a few good beers are on tap Pilsener Urquell paired well with their food
Mojitos are good martinis are good mojito martinis
The pasta part was just ok- Beignets really good crispy small balls but more sweet than savory cheesy- Peanut butter chocolate pie my fave dessert combo which I liked a lotMidlights- Key lime pie I'm a big fan of key lime but in this version the flavors weren't distinct enough so I'd call in just okLowlights- Menu on website doesn't match menu at the restaurant so hub was disappointed on no prime ribFood was fine and hear it's fun for drinks so might try going there sometime when I'm in the area
For rill you have not lived until you've had a yogurt-flavored snack drink from Japan
I took a fresh new look at the wine list and chose a wonderful little Pinot Noir
They had a decent wine selection and good food
Great tasting pizza incredible crust great salads and desserts good beer and good service
Good wine and there always quick with the fresh bread to start the meal

This drink makes Starbucks taste like water and ever since I can not bring myself to go back to Starbucks not that their coffee was good anyway
Classic lime mojito - very good if not just a bit sweet but see point about drinks below3
The beer selection was absolutely amazing
Given the excellent beer menu I will definitely be back
4 stars for pretty good food great ambience and nice wine selection
they bring you a drink and you pay at the register so I don't have much to say about that good or bad
Mediterranean platter is also very good hummus babaganoush with feta pita triangles and rustic bread as an appetizer or small dinner with your drinks I got full of this huge platter
The flare of this quaint spot is definitely found in the bottom of a wonderful glass of the exquisite pinot noir
The food was all pretty good and it looks like they have some good drink and other specials
A good restauranteur would offer to transfer the drink to one of their own glasses so she could still enjoy it
We were told the drink/appetizer happy hour specials only apply to the bar area
I might stop in and give it another chance if I were nearby to try some appetizer and drink specials
There were a few things on the menu i'd be interested in trying for entrees the small plates/apps were meh and having a few delicious cheeses with wine and friends on their patio would definitely be a fun evening
They have a good but not huge beer selection
The drinks while pricey are pretty darn good
Sundays are my favorite--$5 glasses of wine select speciality drinks and specific appetizers are also offered at a reduced price
But if you really want top quality food and drink no one in the valley beats Whole Foods
The wine was very very good however I forgot to note what type of wine it was
They had a great seasonal beer and my pulled pork sandwich was delicious
I will at least try anybody's pizza pieSome are better than others but very few are truly badSo when the Beautiful Carin and I wandered over to Oregano's the other night it was with the anticipation of a pretty good pizza and a pleasant atmosphere to enjoy it inWe were not disappointedThe entirely reasonable 20 minute wait went by quickly with free pizza slices to nibble and frequent refills for our drinks while we sat comfortably and listened to the musicWhen we got our table
Any kind of their malts ice cream soda fountain drinks italian sodas are all made to perfection and with the variety of flavors that they have it's crazy how right on they are with the flavor
After the first half a dozen or so it felt like I was just forcing the plain dry pieces down my throat for the sake of getting my monies worth
Nothing beats having wine beer cheeses meats bread olive oil amazing friends 75 degree dry/warm weather in March and BRUSCHETTA
Good stuffLots of good beerMost people who work here are not douchetardsMost people who hang out here are not douchetardsThe cheese plate was big and deliciousGood jukeboxGood patioI think they have darts and crap inside but I was too toasty to rememberThe badOne bathroomSo yay for The Rose and Crown
The food is pretty good but the beer is why you go
The wine was nice and the nectar grande mojito was delicious well balanced and had quite the kick
It's absolutely fantastic to have a good place to go on Mill Avenue to be around other like-minded wine lovers i
The bruscetta and pizza are pretty tasty but I need to go back and dig a little deeper into both the wine and food menus
It was easy to drink and the flavor of the hops came out
Their food is usually fresh and their drink selection is good
$4 was a steal in my opinion compared to the quality of the food and the drinks
The tea was fresh-brewed and delicious and I don't think my glass ever got more than half-empty
The parking is in the back like any respectable dive bar should be and the good ole boys that drink there during the day are a fine bunch a fellas
The beer honestly is good not great 4peaks IMO is at least 2x better again being nice but I respect a local presence and craft beer so I cant knock them for trying and building a successful brand
A friend joining me had the wings the wings were actually pretty good but they were wings and wings are gonna be good in a place like this especially after some beer so I feel that we should take that for what its worth
As a self proclaimed beer aficionado this place has pretty good selection of bottle beers ranging from microbrews from the states and more harder to get European beers
99 is a pretty good deal if you pick standard 12oz bottles of on-speciality beers
My husband thought it was a little pricey but I think three people who were drinking ordered an appetizer and had three entrees for just a little over $200 was pretty reasonable
Yes it's so dark in here that you won't want to bother trying to read their bible of a wine list - just ask your server for some recommendations
There's live music or a DJ on a nightly basis so you not only get wonderful wines here but a fun atmosphere
However the latin lover drink was delicious
Great meat and produce good beer prices and even cool gift items & flowers
They have a pretty good beer selection
During the week they have 1/2 off sushi and drinks but I did not mind paying regular price for how good it was
Bartender makes a perfect martini and our favorite waiter recommended a new very good wine
The beer selection is amazing and the food is really good also
Atleast they had good beer and a cool place to go out with our without the family
This place is saved more for the after-bar; after I've had a good meal and nice service after I've had a drink or two and when we're not quite ready to go home yet
If you are looking for a downtown coffee shop with good coffee drinks a wide variety of music playing in the background free wireless access and a reasonable breakfast and lunch menu give this place a try
I you haven't had this Czech beer I highly recommend it
The flavors are good with med complexity and it works well with milk drinks too
It is an all-around good blend for both straight shots and milk drinks and I have made this my daily beans
Expect to pay at least $25-30 per person with one drink and a shared appetizer to go along with one of their lower priced entrees
We HIGHLY recommend Zing for the food atmosphere drinks something James whipped up special for us and all at a cost that made it a tremendous value
I'm not going to spend a ton of time talking about the wine but it was good
Their house draft beer is also quite tasty
They pour a good cup of coffee including espresso drinks and the scones are another favorite of my wife
Sushi Drinks Good Looking people are just the start
Seriously best value food fun drinks and quality food in all of Scottsdale
We had 2-3 glasses of wine each and 3 appetizers cheese place salad and meat plate
The service is quick and friendly the decor and seating are perfect and the food & drinks are delicious
I had a small Chipotle Chicken salad and a small tortilla soup and that was a good amount of food- with a drink for only $10
The happy hour is solid- specials on all drinks and half off all munchies appetizers
We each ordered 2 drinks a piece which I have to say Eddie V's makes a damn good dirty martini and their blue cheese stuffed olives are to DIE for
I drank a King Fisher Indian beer and it was pretty good better than most American bottled beers
Excellent service - over the top actually with about 5 different people stopping by the table calling me by last name and filling water glasses on time serving and taking away food immediately checking in to ask if all was OK
Ok so I'm like a huge beer guy and for the longest time have been disappointed that arizona has no real amazing breweries
That was true until I took my good friend from England in and sampled some of there exceptional beers
What a charmer she is ;For good food a beer or two and the ability to watch a game if its on and great people watching this is a fun experience
Only potentially redeeming store experience comes from chatting with the creepy middle aged employee with glasses about immigration or political discussion for trippy wannabe Minute Man ranting but it isn't worth risking damaged canned goods sour milk and stinky meat these days
Unassuming from the exterior in a strip mall with such high end boutiques as Enterprise Rent-A-Car and sharing a zip code with a cowboy tourist targeted bar that features bull riding of the non-mechanical variety Binkley's is a tiny destination restaurant that seems slightly uncomfortable with its surroundings and we were equally slightly out of place with our sinusoidal experience not for control freaks- Greeted by name due to party size and expected arrival time being unique resulted in feeling like VIPs confused by their own fame- Sending away the sommelier a bit dejected when we unanimously declined wine- Realizing our head waitress was a bizarro version of a friend from back home- Opting for the highest end 5-6 course tasting menus $82 - $89 wine pairing $40-50 extra like non-confused VIPs but skipping the foie gras surcharge +$14- Being thankful of no collective food restrictions or allergies to impede chef creativity- Impressed by a nearly endless train of experimental amuse-bouches- Processing that we were 3-4 courses in without seeing anything we ordered- Recalling that some of us were no stranger to this dining style when it's called omakase except then there's no illusion of input into the majority of the meal- Hitting our stride with the hot appetizer including a superb soft shell crab course- Enjoying the best black cod I've ever eaten in a sea of unusual but not quite as enjoyable candidates- Starting to feel full around the penultimate course an amuse of chocolate souffle - Understanding without bitterness that soda refills were not free $2
Our waitress was friendly but when we asked her for recommendations on sushi appetizers and wine she couldn't give them to us
The ambiance was good low lights with a very nice wine selection
I guess that's fine of that's what you're looking for but the only flavor stand out seemed to be the wine-flavored gravy
Wear a good pair of water shoes there is alot of glass and fishing hooks on the ground and some in water
Being that White Russians are my favorite drinks this one definitely hit the spot and I found it much much more delicious than the usual White Russian
You'll spend a pretty penny on the best sake but its well worth it to pair with some terrific eats
We started out with the Bruschetta Caprese appetizer and drinks
The waitress was good about keeping my water glass full
To go with we had to have the Mai Tais which was a good drink IF you are not well acquainted with the best Mai Tais they have served for 30 yrs at the  Halekulani or the Kona Inn
We were neither over or under whelmed and said how nice it would be to kick back on the patio some night for drinks and try a few appetizers that were unavailable to us on the Saturday menu
The Italian and European groceries - pastas grains baked goods olive oils wine- and the Italian conversations you hear while sitting at their antique tables and chairs makes you feel as if you were in Italy
Our bruschetta was unbelievable and our wine was delicious
then you just drink your margherita and you're good
They usually also have beers from around the world which is a huge hit with my dad for a really good price as well
The fries were pretty good but again greasy for the sake of being greasy
the only thing you are good for now is an overpriced beer and overflow from the blue moose durring spring training
The beer is reasonably priced  and is very very tasty
The drink specials aren't anything to write home about but the food is worth the trip
There is a list of a couple dozen whites and reds though so oenophiles will be able to enjoy their pizza w/a glass or a bottle of the good stuff
Great sandwiches beers all reasonably priced; a small but worthwhile selection on tap bigger selection in bottles and cans great dog-friendly patio great ambience inside and out small selection of starters and salads
The beers were always full the food was served without a delay and our guest was impressed and that is exactly why we take clients there
We started with happy hour appetizer wine and mojito
For a special after-dinner drink the Chartreuse VEP $16 is an exquisite beverage and worth the splurge
The service was very prompt; was informed of the specials they had margarita Monday's - $2 dollars off any margarita drink and our food was pretty good
The bartenders are cool and there are good amount of beers on tap
She kindly hurried me out a replacement Pinot at a $12/glass price point I forget the name - Glos something and still wasn't impressed though at least it wasn't terrible
My stay at the Saguaro was really great and i would recommend this property to anyone who wants to have a good time in Scottsdale and stay in a hip cool property and still have some money to spend on drinks
I asked about the installation the cleaning the quality of workmanship she assured me that the repairman would do a good job certainly include clips and that the work and glass is guaranteed for life
Good french fries and free refills on drinks
Overall a good spot for a post-work pre-dinner or post-dinner drink
Get the drinks though because their sake flights are delicious
From what I understand from the attentive bartender is that Flos offers a happy hour Mon-Friday with half priced drinks and appetizers
The warm weather enables the front of the cafe to be pretty much totally open nice garage doors and though that's not something that would work too well in Michigan in the winter I have a feeling the the wine selection and food quality offered by Postino would go over famously here in Ann Arbor and elsewhere
For what I had I found it disappointing and at $11+ a drink tax and tip it's not cheap enough to be worth it
The burgers are good wings awesome and beer
Beerbread sandwiches are always excellent fish and chips bavarian pretzels french fries daily specials I really haven't had an item that I didn't like
If you think cider is too sweet but like fruity flavor this is your beer
76 I got a little bacon cheeseburger fries and a drink I refilled at least 4 times to make myself believe I got my money's worth today
Also they have a great wine list = Since they have recreated their menu the prices are excellent too nothing was over $30 and the average price is $15-$20
If you're looking to do some drinking they have a nice full bar with lots of Asian imported beers and some excellent and unique specialty drinks
On top of all this they give you a 10% discount with an ASU ID and they stay open late enough for some good late-night drinks and appetizers on the weekends
I tried a couple drinks up there and they were delicious - unlike any cocktail I've ever had
The wine selection was nice but not anything noteworthy
We went for happy hour and while I thought that 1/2 off appetizers was a great deal I felt that the $1 off margaritas and 50 cents off beers was a little on the stingy side
the staff is on top of things and we got a great wine recommendation from Cody
I asked the waitress for a mixed drink recommendation and she went off on how great the Seasonal Buck tastes
They did have good drink deals and the piano players were great
My wife and I stopped in on a Saturday afternoon for a glass of wine and we hoped some small bites of appetizers
My wife got the mussels in an excellent wine sauce
The have great happy hour specials; a good place to go after work for a beer and some food
The key lime pie was pretty standard and the mimosas were heavy on the champagne which I guess can be good but threw off the balance of the drink
Our server Kai was great and I think on a Fri or Sat night this would be a good place to grab some drinks or dinner
95 to drink and it was commented to me that it wasn't very good in comparison to other places
Warm savory broth that you want to drink fresh ingredients fresh add-ons like basil and bean sprouts and the noodles were well prepared a delicious
5th and Wine does have an extensive bruschetta menu reminiscent of Postino; we chose however to order sandwiches and paninis the selections of which looked quite tasty
Although the pour wasn't super-generous it's a good way to sample from 5th and Wine's very balanced selection
Not a new place but their house wines by the glass are great quality for the price $5 and their premiere beers on tap are 32 ounces and only $3
In the end the beer was served properly and very good
because the place is pretty classy and has good food and decent drinks
Both were delicious and refreshing not sickeningly sweet like some specialty drinks can be
We shared a few apps that were pretty good but i enjoyed the drinks more
They have a cooler with all the beers they sell and about 8 beers that rotate on tap including a good variety of 10%'ers
They do a good job of keeping the tap full of very different-tasting beers and keeping my palate in rotation
Pizza was very good but the wine is way over priced
The wine selection is not of wine bar quality and the atmosphere does not allow them to charge as much as they do for the wine
Excellent unique beer selection the *best* pretzels I've ever had and an interesting selection of sausages
I had a few glasses of a New Zealand white wine which was very good and my husband tried the Bees Knees before moving on to dirty martinis
If you want a place to relax fine wine and flavorful nibbles I highly recommend the Living Room
It has good food and good beer and also is associated with some good memories here
He pushed the specialty drinks even though we knew what we wanted to drink he pushed the appetizers even though we didn't want any and - the biggest issue of all - when presenting the hefty bill he gave us the pitch for the 'Landry's club' - sign up for free and get points discounts blah blah
For a family of four with drinks an appetizer and 2 desserts
Not quite sure that this place would be able to pull off good drinks and excellent food I let my eyes wander around the space that was created
Nothing super special but the Bees is a good solid choice for food or drinks when you don't feel like thinking about where to go
a bit unnecessary haha we ordered bruschetta like 4 orders sliders delicious hummus delicious annnnd a bottle of wine
Our server was prompt and got us drinks right away as well as an appetizer order
I would take any person here even if they dont drink the menu is unique and delicious
the food is consistently good nice drink selection wait staff are always happy helpful and friendly
The services the food the apprezitiers the drinks and the staff were excellent
Their happy hour is $5 vodka drinks $6 wines and half off all appetizers except for the steak tartare
I usually only drink about a half cup of coffee a week because I don't like the bitterness but this coffee was so good I drank a full large paper cup
They also sport delicious Asian beers and an array of China Mist Bottled Iced Tea
We had NY style pizzas lots of drinks appetizers and I am sure were just plain loud and roudy through all of it
Their sangria is really good and their beer selection is slim but offers local beers which is a plus
Half price apps and good beers WERE the norm back then
When I'm drinking there at night the service is really good too
I ordered the Strawberry and basil with sake cocktail and it was excellent
Scuttlebutt Brewery and Diamond Knot BreweryThey also carry cans of beer that I haven't seen beforeeasier when we go camping  good beer Four PeaksTons of local beer
Decided to try gandolfo's out because I got a coupon for a free 1/2 sandwich salad and drink plus I love a good deli
They have a pretty decent beer selection they had my favorite Sonoran White Chocolate ale and my boyfriend had something he loved on tap called the Bell's Two Hearted Ale but apparently it's an amazing IPA
VERY VERY chocolatey and too much food after an app a sandwich and two beers but it was definitely worth trying
I was convinced that it was amazing after 5 hours of drinking back in the day so after moving to SoTemp for my professional career I popped in for lunch takeout quite a bit
The drinks are overpriced however the bartenders are very good looking and the DJ spins very generic music mostly rap and R&B which might be somewhat fun to dance to if there were enough room to do so
*Fig Prosciutto & Brie both our favs*Sun dried tomato gorganzola & walnuts we actually ordered the artichoke but got this by mistake but we both liked it - and I'm not a huge sun-dried tomato fan eitherI can't wait to go back and try more wine and more of the delicious sounding food
MM has an excellent beer selection which is great for self proclaimed beer snobs like my BF and  I
For the life of me I cannot figure out how someone would drink a Girl's Light when there are so many more fantastic tasty beers available
You can fill up on appetizer goodies and have a beer or two for a reasonable amount
I was equally impressed with the large beer selection they had - everything from Chinese to Indian to Mexican  beer - brews from all over the world
the drinks were weak and the food wasn't particularly tasty  with the exception of their avocado eggrolls& margarita flatbread
Teakwoods is a nitty gritty full-on sports bar with cheap beer and amazing fried goodies
Good but bring your glasses for the tons on mini TV's
I initially enjoyed the service and the wine I ordered but then it all went downhill
we ordered a few bruschetta boards and a sandwich we just wanted some food to snack on while we enjoyed our wine
Good beer and great kid's menu even if the pizza has gotten very small -did I mention the fries
I love working out at LifeTime and then destroying all the good I did by eating and drinking here
If you are 21 and don't know what good food is but want to drink with your friends in a loud room this is your spot
they also have this amazing drink - the ultimate gin and tonic
They have good prices on glasses of wine and beer as well - that being said we always return to the orange slice
It's a fairly unpretentious place with good beer and a friendly staff
I've enjoyed the scootcher beer and double IPA
The wines are all South American and we did a tasting of 3 chards which were all inexpensive and surprisingly good
Good wine list and all of the entrees our group had were well liked
They also have some good wine options at very reasonable prices
Over that time my friends and I developed relationships with the wonderful servers there who always remembered our names our favorite dishes and who were always willing to recommend a great new beer from the extensive ever changing list
The drinks we got were strong and pretty good
Good place to grab a burger and a beer but doesn't go the extra mile IMO
I highly recommend the coconut shrimp something Cocado Mi Bandido and the wonderfully strange mango drink
The caramel pudding is heaven in a glass jar the idea is very inventive I love it Also the Blueberry cheesecake is really good as is the warm chocolate cake with caramelmy favorite mix and they all come in the nifty cute jars
00 with a drink and a side which seems a bit steep but oh so worth it
Good wine list lots of menu options and awesome service
I didn't have a drink since I was already battling falling over sleepiness but I thoroughly enjoyed the food and the break from the air-conditioned mall
Hit Happy Hour in the bar for the half price drinks/appetizers
I started out with one of their draft beers not too impressed so I switched to San Tan on the next one
If you have time and money to burn it would be a fun experience to drink next door for a couple hours then eat some tasty fresh pizza
with all of us wanting to drink Margarita's and have appetizers and then some tacos
Definitely a fun place to stop by for a good meal a good drink or if you want to have a full on fiesta with you and 50 of your closest friends
I ordered Miss Katie's Pimms Cup clearly one of the most girly drinks on the menu and I really enjoyed it
Good beer impressive local selection and really exciting food
i'm pretty sure by the end of the night my wine was a little watered down but i guess that's probably a good thing since i had been drinking at the oasis pool all day
It was nice to relax outside and enjoy the beautful day with a delicious drink
So good in fact we finished our first glass and ordered a second
Drinks were as expected nothing good or bad about it
We sat down and got our menu's it was the dinner menu and WAY too expensive for us - we thought about leaving just then but decided to order drinks and an appetizer oh yea no drink menu so I guess you have to wait for the bill to see how much the drinks were but then the waitress who was very nice suggested the lunch menu - much better but still priced a little high
But we enjoyed the Gallo Blanco had a great service great drinks and tacos
Also I think their coffee is delicious it's the perfect strength and it's all you can drink perfect
My favorite part after eating hot pot is drinking the flavorful soup afterwards
I'm a casual girl from the NW so if you're looking for a casual locale cheap but good tacos homemade smoothies and a beer head over to Two Hippies
The drinks there were pretty good but it was a pity the crowd was not there
The pizza offerings are all original and tasty like nobody's business especially with one of the great bottles of wine that they offer
This is a great place to get a beer and appetizers
For example unlike four Peaks all their beers are good
However unlike Four Peaks all of their beers are just good and they have no great beer to compete w/ Kilt Lifter
I also recommend their coffee drinks - they have a great mocha
Bartenders make excellent drinks and are very friendly and fun to be around
Needless to say we'd all had a few too many drinks last night and we needed a good greasy spoon fill your tummy type of meal
It was delicious and I love that they bring you a chilled glass about halfway through
During happy hour drinks are half off so you wont feel bad throwing back that $11 martini or 5 and their HH sushi and appetizer list is extensive
They have a good selection of wines and the staff can be helpful if they aren't preoccupied or busy
There was not much worth drinking for under $45
I had another flavor that was awesome as well but I can't remember what flavor it was for some reason I've had a couple of beers
The atmosphere was good drinks were reasonably priced and the food decent
This is a good stop for travelers to grab cheap food and enjoy some drinks
We ordered 2 appetizers and drinks for 4 of us
For $5 I got a huge glass that was very delicious and strong
It's totally worth it to splurge for the drinks though even if you're normally a water drinker
After being rushed out of the place so they could close down and get home we went to another local bar and realized we weren't offered the 8pm-10pm Happy Hour discount on our drinks or appetizers
We each had a latte and I thought they were alright very drinkable lattes but they didn't have the most flavor of any latte I have had
They also have a lot of other good beer choices on tap at reasonable prices
fantastic place Mario and Peter owners are awesomeFinally adding this review to my yelpI went there last night this isnt really last night it is few months ago - it is still excellent not too and it was excellent - The beer list they have is fantastic and Mario who is a part owner was behind the bar and it was good talking to himArrived just at the end of happy hour they have $1 off draft beers for happy hour and half priced glasses of wine and there was a certain amount off well drinks but i don't recall what that isThey are going to be working on their mixed drink menu they wont have that ready to go for another week or twoStarted out with Schneider Aventinus Doppel Weizen BockGermany 8
2% which could be my new favorite beer it is a unfiltered wheat bock amazingOne of the nice touches is that they have the proper beer glass to go with each beer they have on tap in the appropriate sizes and the largest karmeliet glass i have ever seen and they have a lot of imports on the list so they are doing great in the strong ale category - which is my favorite type of beerAs i was looking at the menu I asked if they had foie gras because i saw a picture on their facebook page and Mario told me they always have that as an off the item menu and it could be prepared however I would like it - which sounded great to meFoie Gras torchon with toast points honey comb apples cherries - also had a lemon tuille and some micro greens as wellThe honeycomb was a very nice touch because it got the sweetness however the bonus was the nice texture it added to the overall My friend ordered Heirloom Tomatoes and Gioia Burrata and i got a taste of that it was a great salad and had small bread sticks and fresh pesto on it as well very light and refreshing - just the thing after foie gras for my main i ordered the crispy half duck it was confit duck style the skin was very crispy and it was a huge portion - the duck was very good the crispy duck skin fat had lots of flavor with it - and i was happy to have confit again since i still dream of the chez dumonet duck i had in Paris this summer - my only change i would have made was the side items it was served with i would have liked dauphine potatoes - with that said it was the best duck i have had in AZ and i was happy it was not just seared duck breast My friends ordered the spinach Gnochi Black Tagliolini Mediterranean Sea BassI tried the Sea Bass which was was very good with the skin on crispy and crab on top the pasta dishes all looked amazing although i didnt get to try them i will certainly be trying them on my next visitrubee while i was there quite a few people ordered the crispy ribs - they looked great and everyone said they were deliciousSeems like there will be specials each day as well based on what looks good in the market everything coming out of the kitchen looked great - finally a place with an awesome beer list and delicious food - looking forward to seeing what they do with their cocktail list will certainly be back and it is nice they have parking
It's not the small plate happy hour it is the awesome wine specials it is the amazingly cozy bar downstairs it is the rotating mind-blowing fish specials it is or the prime rib it DEFINITELY is
Come here for*   Amazing sweet tea*   Crispy buttery texas toast*   Perfect Chicken fingers never dry or greasy*   The most awesome creamy peppery sauce that I could drink out of a cupThat's it
The bartender was good although I asked for a drink with Ketel One Red Bull champagne and grapefruit juice and he gave me one with Ketel One champagne Chambord and pineapple
One glass of wine one appetizer and one roll = about $25 with tip
They also have stiff drinks in large amounts at reasonable prices great food and good enough service considering how busy they always are
1 appetizer 2 drinks 2 entrees and 1 desert for $20
and had some really good local arizona beers
I also noticed that some of their wine was bad the waitress went through several bottles before finding a good one and they don't seem to be keeping all their wine/beer in stock as some of it was unavailable after ordering off the menu
The San Tan is a great place to grab a good beer and some good food
I was the driver so I didnt get to have any real drinks but I did have a sip of the three different Shochu's the hubs ordered and all were amazing
They had a really tasty non alcoholic drink that had ginger in it that I ordered and it was bubbly and tasty
A good drink ran Rada about 5 bucks and The hummus sample plate was a buck and additional pita was not even 50 cents more
Years ago I dropped by on my way to work for a bagel & drink they were fast and good then
Elements does have a beautiful view and I would whole-heartedly recommend it for drinks with out-of-towners
The goodReally nice and helpful staffFree parkingClose to lightrailFree shuttle within 5 milesBig pool and jacuzzi with lit up waterfall at nightFree wifiOnly have to walk across the street to eat and drink at FEZThe badParking is a walk from the hotel entrance when hotThe bed was not the most comfortable even after realizing we could adjust the air levels
I'd also be careful of their wine list - very high and not as good a list of wines as the prices would suggest Souverain Sauvignon Blanc retails for $14-16 per bottle FGS
cold beer amazing chips mind blowing salsas
The food was good but if I remember correctly they had little to no draft beer
- Excellent soft drink selection if that's your thing
rather a nice neighborhood drinking hole with an excellent staff welcoming owner and an outdoor patio that seals the deal for me
The service was wonderful our waiter was fast with the drinks and bread great for suggestions I ask even when I know what I'm getting to test staff and above all he was friendly the whole time
How could I tell it was such poor quality glass that you installed for me
I took the car back to this shop immediately after the marks and explained to them that although I understand it is not their fault that my car got dinged but it is very unusual that the marks would looks like that only poor quality glass would not be able to withstand the very small rock my car took
good eats good wine and excellent customer service
They offer iced green tea that is really tasty and have a small beer/wine/drink menu as well
We ordered drinks appetizers and desserts READ - $$$ - and yet all our server was looking at were the more expensive LOOKING tables
It must be something they put in the drinks or maybe it's the 9th drink or maybe it's the good company
Drinks were flavorful and I really appreciate the time and thought they put into cocktails
The Pho is excellent not $11 excellent but if I can drink my cabernet with my pho
Went in for happy hour tonight and really liked my experience -Robust beer and wine list half price at happy hour and reasonably priced regularly make TMI a worthwhile stop on the way home from work
If you're an olive fan get the bowl of house-marinated olives for $3 -- they are intensely flavorful and are a great compliment to your wine
Highly recommend for a casual drink dinner or a get together with a large group of friends the main space is very nice and can accommodate larger parties
Happy Hour is decent 1/2 glasses of wine and some appetizers
My bud had picked a tasty delish dark beer to go with the hot italian sausage and from there I am now in like
I had heard nothing but good things and was pleasantly surprised immediately walking in the door to find that they had 20+ quality beers on tap
A good sized meal for two sans drinks could ring up at $30-35 which is a good value for great food
The atmosphere is trendy and fun there are a ton of drink options and the food is quite good
The drinks and specials are quite reasonable and they have a pretty good selection of beers on tap
The thousands of wine bottles that adorn the bar the leather walls marble floors hundreds of pieces of artwork and 6 foot handmade chandeliers just made it an amazing environment
25 a gallon Tequila almost interchangeable for both drinking and fueling purposesRoom service spa workout facility restaurant and the pool are all first rate and the people watching is wonderful
Beer prices were $1 off so that's a good sign
They had $3 off all wines by the glass which I must admit was a pretty impressive selection and they had a decent list of appetizers that all cost $5
To be fair the doors were all opened by the time we left and WHAT a difference this makesAfter bellying up to bar our drinks were taken and we were off to a good start
The wine is good I'm no expert so it all tastes similar to me but they mainly serve australian wines and many selections of them
What I was impressed with is how light and crispy their crust is  with a bit of chewiness to it
for a drink they have a new coke flavor wave which is always fun and there is a bar that is connected with free popcorn which is a big plus for me
We stuck with the basic blend but will definitely try one of their unique sake flavors on our next visit
I ordered a medium rare steak and my girl ordered chicken tempura we both were extremely pleased steak is how I grade restaurants and my steak was cooked correctly and meat was of good quality with a very nice sake list so good rating from me
They have a good wine selection but we haven't tried it yet as my coworkers and I go there at lunch
The beer selection is amazing but so is the rest of the menu
Also good points;-Huge beer selection over 100 micro brews and domestics-Over 15 wines-SAKE-Muli types of organic wine and  beer-Live music-Monthly rotating art-work for first Friday all money goes to artist if paid with cashThis is a great place to take out-of-towners
Decided to kill time by grabbing a glass of amazing La Spinetta Moscato d'Asti next door at Bar Bianco
There were some beers that were stronger than 10% and they had unique flavors and they were quite strong
They actually have good beer on tap or available in cans and bottles
The drinks were very good and that is what earned them the extra star
They have a good selection of wine & beer and the food is pretty tasty and reasonably priced too
Good things  They have all night drink specials so if the game goes past happy hour its not a big deal
Their food is pretty good and drink prices are fair
Over the last several months Steve has suggested variations on my standard drink - all of which have been amazing
Yes it's true that I would have been happy eating anywhere on the night of my birthday while getting wined and dined by my bf but it just so happened that I was taken to City Hall so it was a delightfully tasty night
As for the drinks there are two times where you can seriously get your money's worth
They also have AMAZING DRINK SPECIALS  I had a two dollar mimosa this afternoon
We had to wait about 25 minutes before getting seated but it was no problem because our server brought us drinks while we sat and enjoyed the live jazz music
Throw in the house salad more delicious and well-crafted then it needs to be a basket of bread to soak up the mussel butter so you don't look like an asshole slurping it with a spoon and a glass of bordeaux or two and call it a night
My coworker and I both ordered off the appetizer menu we had a salad lettuce wraps sparkling water a glass of wine and a beer and the total bill with a 20% tip came out to just under a hundred dollars
Also it's Sakana's order a drink and appetizers are $1 Yah
Next time I'll get the ceviche which looked amazing served in a gigantic margarita glass
We ordered sauteed mushrooms and we got some of the most wonderful spiced and wined mushrooms we ever had
Pair that with a good $2 beer and I was a happy girl
The macaroni and cheese or ruben sandwiches are both amazing with a delicious draft beer
The sushi was pretty good and the drinks were good
I would have given only one star but the martinis are pretty damn good
The boys enjoyed their martinis hard to mess those up mom also enjoyed her pina colada & my sangria was pretty good too many seeds from the blackberries though
Since the prices are a little higher we decided not to get any appetizers smoothies which looked great or drinks
To get appetizer and drink specials you HAVE TO SIT AT THE BAR
Service good but not even close to worth the 50 bucks we threw down for the meal for 2 people and 2 drinks
Seriously food is good drinks are strong and reasonably priced and usually they have a scary ass clown lady that will paint the mexican faces white and the white faces Mexican
we had a foodie event that was way discounted so we were drinkin up the free mojitos and partaking in delicious appetizers
If you have any questions about wine all of the servers are excellent at recommendations
He quickly delivered our requested glasses of wine and took our appetizer orders
The wine list was good but I though there could have been more choices with the beautiful wine cabinet they have in front
but it was made with red wine and it was quite good
The food and drinks are good and decently priced for downtown
We were enjoying their delicious beers when the manager came over looking for my boyfriend by name
The food was good but the beer was better
The wait staff is very attentive but should have told me the happy hour specials as I was alone with my computer and ended up paying full price for a beer and appetizer at a dead time of  the day
I ordered a red sangria which was okay but had a strange flavor of figs or dates so I'm not sure if it was just made with old wine that had turned and took on a prune juice flavor or if that taste was intentional
If good food excellent service and bartenders that mix drinks strong enough to knock a bull elephant to it's knees aren't enough for you then perhaps all these and the lure of a mechanical bull will do the trick
I recommend this place to anyone who likes well-made light lunches with a good cold coffee drink
the owners are from taiwan and they're super cool i'm guessing you shouldn't  practice your japanese on them or you might just learn to say a lot of bad things in koreanthey have okinawan beerpretty good and reasonable sake selectionlamb chops
After a few more minutes of waiting and not seeing a familiar waiter we did something we've never done at a brewery/alehouse/taproom before We walked out still thirsty for a quality beer
If you visiting our great state of Arizona and you decide to come to Old Town Scottsdale please stop in and just say hello and they will treat you to some pretty DAMN good Root Beer
First round was the wonderful mason jar drinks Strawberry lemonade was sweet fresh and thirst quenching our muddy waters made with sweet tea and porch lemonade were good enough for three refills a piece
Ate the omelette was very good but found two more very long black hairs intertwined in the fries
Patrick's day; while the kiwi chunks were excellent the major flavor was melon which I am not a fan of; if you like melon this would be a very good choiceAnother great option is the aquitas drink
On a good note the bar on the inside is pretty cute looking and the drinks tasted fairly good
My favorite were the fresh right out of the oven pretzels for sure however the brat I ordered was delicious especially with the root beer onions on top
I visited Phoenix this weekend and enjoyed an incredible happy hour La Paloma which is El Jimador Reposado Grapefruit Soda Fresh Lime and Salt and another drink which was a play on a margarita
The drinks were refreshing and tasted of quality ingredients
In fact when the Quarter first opened up and H & M arrived my sister and I made it a girl's night out and after several hours of shopping at H & M enjoyed wine and dinner on the patio at Brio
I've had some of the best martinis at this place and they make some delicious and strong specialty flavors
The 3 hot sauces were very diverse and flavorful - not cliche hot for the sake of hot
The drinks & guac/chips which were good arrive 15 mins after we placed the order & our dinner which was fair arrived 2 mins after that
After ordering our drinks one of which was my daughter's homemade citrus soda which was absolutely delicious we began to look over the menu
To her credit our waitress kept our drinks full and she processed our check/payment quickly and she was chirpy and smiley so good for her
All in all I would say this is an outstanding bar whether you want to go and have a few drinks hanging out at the bar or enjoy a delicious dinner at any number of tables or some more private booths
This was before the grounds were as nice as they are now but we enjoyed going into the large steel shed and trying several of their olive oils not too different an experience from some of my favorite small wineries
This place is great for out of the ordinary food items and they have a good selection of wine
Sake Bomber is an amazingly beautiful restaurant that is perfectly situated just off ASU campus
We selected a good bottle 90 points WS and when we asked the self-labeled wine guy about it he said I actually can drink that
The drinks are amazing any which one you get I usually go for something with VodkaI love the filet its amazing
They have a good selection of beers and the staff is very helpful
Drinks were ordered and arrived swiftly at which point we ordered the entire meal including an appetizer
Booze wise I had the Fudo Myoo Sake which was quite tasty and my friend had a cocktail with strawberry juice in it which was delicious
Plus points                       for a well-executed sweet potato hash and kale saladDrinks     B   Tasty strawberry cocktail - which tasted a bit watery to                       me but otherwise good
The drinks and food were all super good and the lanes were so classy
Great Irish knick-knacks on the walls and a good variety of Irish beers
Full bar good beer selection a DJ that was spinning decent lounge-like tunes and very attentive and cute staff
The food here is solid the drink menu is pretty decent the ambiance is nice menu is good service is eh
A great beer but not quite as good as other Belgiums
I went yesterday and the waitress talked about 1/2 price appetizers drinks well drinks etc
I went with some friends and we ordered drinks and appetizers
The busy part is probably a good thing though because that means their food drinks and service are always awesome so people come back for more
But I was really impressed by their wine and their cheese selection
Like another reviewer I was a bit confused on the drink service and I ended up choosing delicious but too expensive and large bottle of Orangina
Hanny's would be a lot of fun for drinks music and people watching and while the food was good I don't think we'll be doing dinner again based on the service
I recall that they have some tasty martinis on the menu but most recently I enjoyed a glass of Cakebread Sauv Blanc - you can never go wrong with that
I'd love to see some different wines on their menu - maybe a good Australian Sauv Blanc or some good white blends to pair with the spiciness of the food but the Melbec that we had was just fine
They have a good beer selection and I was able to get a lovely bottle of my favorite - pinot grigio
The menu is typical of wine bars serving salads sandwiches and burgers but the detail and flavor they place on thier entrees is great
Drinks are delicious and unlike some wine bars they have a full bar
95 You can purchase a bottle of Good Wine here at the market price and drink it here with no additional charge
Suzie's a great place for their lunch specials they have good posole and beef tacos and I remember they only cost like 6-7 bucks for lunch throw in a 1 penny beer and you are ready to go back to the office a happy man
Then we ordered alcoholic drinks she couldnt even make them herself and the woman at the bar i did not catch her name but she was very slow and not very good
It's in a prime spot has great bar food it's way better and a good drink selection
Parking is tough but we found street parkingThe prices were very fair and I had a beer and the wife had a mojito which was very goodWe also had coffee after dinner and it was delish
Somehow with the disgusting 2-stall girls' restroom no parking high bar prices no good waitresses and pint-only beer options this place maintains it's hipster popularity as the place to be in downtown Tempe
One of the best drinking experiences with a girl I had a slight crush on in good while
There were a couple of other items on the menu that looked interesting it's close to home and they have a very good drink selection
Water Glass Harmonica needs to be at this amazing museum
I had the traditional being that I've never had a patsy before and it was simply amazing beef potatoes and a red wine gravy that made my mouth go um what the hell just happened
Also a nice rotating wine list pretty good for a pizza place
Dr Wilson is a trustworthy physician and I can put up with one or two unpleasant ones for the sake of excellent care and the other awesome people who work there
more wine delicious chicken specialmore wine tiramisu
I had been here a few times before but only had appetizers and drinks
I ordered the same thing I had on sunday - white wine blend and bruschetta soooo good
The bartender very smart and good looking lady made it a point to remember every ones name so we wouldn't have to keep telling her what tab to put our next beer on
Go relax have some good food and drink with some very nice people
I love beer I love places that have good beer I love places with beer people and I love making lists
The house beers are very good particularly the Scottie a hoppier and less sweet than usual Scottish Ale going at 8
4% ABV and their Ridgeback a Double/Imperial IPA 10% ABV is an excellent example of an often tried but rarely done well style of beer
They also have 2-4 taps dedicated to quality guest beers
The service is top notch -- friendly informative great for recommending beers and places to get them and if you are nice and become a regular they may even play the movie of your choice
Great belgian and german  beers to choose from and some excellent USofA selections as well
About 7-10 minutes later a waitress finally came to the table to verify our drink and appetizer order why
All I need is a well-made and high quality pie friendly and comfortable surroundings a glass or two of a nice cab or syrah and friendly service and smiling faces
They did a nice job with the decorating and the drinks were cold and good
From our glass of champagne to the goodie bag and everything in between
The staff at Tanzy were great-helpful friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and delicious wines
I would recommend this place for a good place for someone looking for a nice place to grab a drink and converse
The iced coffee drinks are delicious and although I haven't tried any of the food options I've noticed they have a nice breakfast menu
Not many bartenders make old fashioneds or singapore slings anymore and I love the fact that they have a variety of old drinks plus a huge list of good scotch and other spirits
This place is a must go if you are some beer starved party animal ASU student but as an adult who is one step beyond the let's get blottoed for the sake of getting drunk this place isn't really worth visiting
The beers really aren't that good compared to Four Peaks/Papago/Sun Up/San Tan or any of the other brew pubs around
Prices may have gone up a tad and portions were downsized but the food is still tasty the patrons are still trendy and the drinks still flow like the hoover dam
Our waiter come up to my guest and I who both had empty drinks at the time and said Good
When I first moved into my place in Tempe I took a good look around the neighborhood and I saw a Thai place a coffee shop of death A decent taquieria Ted's Hot Dogs and SakeBomber Sushi & Grill
I think I have sent a few back actually and once our waitress agreed that it wasn't a very good drink
I'd recommend Humble Pie if you want to drop in and have a quick beer and a snack but not for much more
And it doesn't help that they poured a strong and delicious drink
Sounds like Aunt Chilada's is good for sitting at the bar drinking and eating chips while you listen to the band
Germain elderflower liqueur sweet & sour Persian cucumber juice lemon peel rocks which were both good not too strong but a good refreshing drink
Pros - Pho was tasty and cleaner than most Pho places           - Decor of the place was very chic           - There is a bar for you drinkers           - The banh mi were HUGE and came with garlic or sweet potato fries           - Nice outdoor patio for when its cooler outside           - The head server was very helpfulCons - Price was a little more than most pho places Pho $10 / Rolls $3
They play great music make strong drinks and have amazing food
We usually love going to Westgate Center to get a drink and appetizer and window shop a bit before going to the movies
Ordered meal and it arrived correctly although no beverage refills were offered until a good way into the meal with empty glasses
All in all great place to go to grab a glass of wine and some good food especially after hours as they are open from 5pm to 2am
The drink selection is good but they don't have a blender so don't expect anything slushy
The drink menu consists of martinis of all different flavor combination and are quite popular
Oktoberfest here was fantastic as the weather was mild and the beer was tasty
We found it nice to wander south to Press Coffee Roasters a local owned and operated shop must go picked up a mid morning snack bagels pastries drinks of all sorts staked out a seating area and enjoyed until the water works started up
Finally I had to get someone's attention to come and take our order and it wasn't even the guy who took our drink order We waited for a good 30 minutes for our food which is fine but then it came out cold
The progression of the courses and the pairings with wine were amazing
The drinks and food were good and the prices are reasonable
lots of good wines and the beer selection is random and changes often
Don't have a palette or interest in wine types so I can't talk about the wine quality
Overall though I had a good time and thought the combination of wines and cheeses I had was good
He also said you are not drinking to make me happy you're drinking to make you happy when we asked him if he had recommendations which I thought was weird at best
I can't really describe the furniture since it was pretty dark and it didn't offend me in any way-it just blended in with the background which is what a good lounge should do when you are enjoying drinks with friends
The drinks tasted great so good that I would have thought it was alcohol free if I hadnt known definitely on the weak side
drinks were good food was mediocre but the atmosphere is what made the event
On the plus side they have some good beers
At the beginning my lady and I were early so the waiter got us our drinks and continued to make sure we were good to go
Chips and salsa drinks water and the delicious cornbread they all came very fast and it didn't take any begging on our part
With 3 drinks dessert and tip we spent roughly $130 well worth every penny
Love the many options of beers on draft and have met some good people while enjoying the beers at the bar
This location was the second stop on our Friday-night drink/appetizer tour of Mill Avenue restaurants and we decided just to focus on their margaritas ordering chips and salsa just to have something to munch on
From my brief glance at the menu the food looks pretty standard and Americanized but given how good our drinks and the service were I'd be willing to go back and give Z Tejas another try for a meal
Drinks are good not great but reasonably priced
That comes with chips and salsa two burritos two tacos and two drinks The carne asada was very good
The drinks were strong the food was good and there were always plenty of ASU guys around to talk to
The wine we enjoyed with our steak was a nice red from Napa called Argus
Good but not quite drinking the punch on this one
the beer selection was good and i have no complaints about the price
The drinks when we could get service and ambiance are pretty good
The food is pretty tasty the drinks arent bad
50 well drinks are also an awesome way to compliment your tasty appetizers
oTotal cost 1 drink 1 appetizer 2 curries plus rice dessert
I like the Turkey Bacon Bravo or the Turkey Cranberry with a side of their excellent mac 'n' cheese and a drink
The barista was friendly and my red eye coffee drink was delicious
That was nice and allowed me to make a good wine choice Beuhler estate cab
I had been to Durant's once before for drinks and several people at work recommended it for dinner so we tried it
the food and drinks were delicious and the atmosphere is sexy yet comfortable
There was a 20 minute wait so we went to the bar to wait and have a drink and an appetizer our table came up around 15 minutes later and we asked the batender to transfer our bill  I left him a tip on the bar he said he couldnt transfer alcohol
He gets up and goes to ask the manager where our food and/or server are and hes told  you got your food and you guys have drinks so your good right
He forgot some of our appetizers a glass wine and dessert orders
He apologized and comped us our undelivered appetizer wine and dessert
The margarita came in one of those giant martini-styled glasses and it was really good
We got a good bottle of wine for $30 which was perfect for the two of us
It has a great atmosphere good food good drinks and reasonable prices
What a cool concept quality brats and great beer all around
It is totally worth the few extra dollars for a clean comfortable seat with full service drinks and food
The wine is cheap as you could hope for certain soups in funny shaped cans are worth the drive and gmo fearing folks can shop in peace
Had the House Salad Old Monkeyshine Nimbus beer excellent Tuscon AZ brew and the ilTagliere sampling of meats cheeses and veggies
As I sat and waited for my lost friend I enjoyed some wine and delicious freshly baked bread
They run amazing deals like GroupOn $5 for a movie ticket and soda I don't recommend anyone drinks soda with HFCS but I digress
Overall it's worth a go a bit pricy for the food/drinks but enjoyable none the less
I confess I have never eaten here except beer cheese which I think was goodtoo drunk to remember
Ok but here's the rundown great German beers served up in awesomely large glasses if you prefer and decent alcohol selection large dance floor good music occasionally really great owner and wife team
I can appreciate giving drinks cutesy names & mixing interesting flavors that people normally wouldn't' think to order but what about actually listing simply latte or Americano on the menu as well
Good burger; Good beer; Kind of dumpy on the inside but I think that was the whole point
If strong drinks aren't your thing I highly recommend doing this because the second drink was way better than the first but packed the same punch
We started off with some delicious rum drinks at the bar while waiting the 20 minutes for a table
The drinks are strong the decor is wonderful the food is great and the serve is prompt
Thank you for the ample selection of themed snacks and drinks to match the themed films that are screening what a wonderful and thoughtfu touch
On another high note the wine pairings were absolutely wonderful and the sommelier was both informative and wonderful in not only introducing each pairing but being able to provide excellent alternatives when pairings didn't go quite well
Very reasonably priced too- with appetizers our meal came to $20 we didn't get drinks though
Like everything they do the food is always excellent staff is personal and quick and the drinks aren't bad either
sampled several top notch martinis the smoked salmon app good chicken burger and sweet potato fries
super nice big main lobby with live music and a fire acres of pools that include a beach and a waterslide and amazing drinks poolside next to a bomb golf course
the restaurants are good but most of your day you will spend by the pool sipping on great frozen drinks while occasionally finding a small pool somewhere you didn't know existed
Nice breads some excellent local beers on draft
*extra-virgin olive oil sold in something like a 2-liter pack for about $25 I try to only use olive oil when oil is needed*shampoo/conditioner they always have Pantene and get better brands in random rotation*a great wine selection wide range of choice & price*frozen strawberries massive bag about $8 and wonderful for smoothies
Their lunch special is a particularly good deal - you get a choice between 3-4 specific meat dishes a choice of wontons or egg rolls a choice between different rices or chow mein and a drink for $6
Best French onion soup on the planet and a most fantastic variety of beer plus good cocktails if that's what the doctor calls for
No cocktails or draft but for atmosphere and quality of beer selection lost leaf is by far my favorite place to meet people in dtown phoenix
I told her I was impressed with the beer menu and thrilled they had Saison Dupont on tap that evening
If that's your choice the beer list looked pretty good
The wine selection is good plus the glass is filled more than at other restaurants
Drinks are pretty good and you even get a glow stick in some of the specialty cocktails
By night 32 Shea is the perfect place to grab a glass of wine and some amazing bruschetta or the dinner of the day with an delicious craft beer or even a lavosh pizza and a mint lemon drop martini holy yumminess
The bowling is cheap as dirt the drinks are cheap as dirt and the restaurants food is VERY good
light healthy flavorful and a good glass of wine to boot
Staying on trails is good advice for anyone but if you bring a dog WATCH OUT for lots of broken glass on the sides of the main path
Our experience had it's high points*Our extremely sweet server love those glasses*The ridiculously good coffee*and the novelty of eating in a shoe box
I'd recommend both the beer and the mixed drink
After a good 15 minutes a waiter walked out and took our drink order
Along with a bottle wine good company and you're good for the night
I highly recommend getting a Snack Pack - a smaller burger or two piece strip small fries and small drink and saving room for desert
Kids meals are wonderful here you get your choice of burger 2 chicken strips or corn dog choice of applesauce or fries and choice of drink
The beer selection is excellent with tons of imports in bottles and on tap
So I start off with a glass of velvet devil merlot and a three meat meatball appetizer that consisted of pork veal and beef with ricotta over cream polenta
Figuring this was not a good sign I specifically asked her to have a waitress come to my table and bring me a glass of water and Corona
Not when I wanted good food or quick efficient service but when I was meeting a few friends on a leisurely weekend afternoon to drink a few beers and watch a game
There are good specialty drinks like mojitos and cadillac margaritas and the beer selection is nothing to shake a stick at either
The drinks here are great and the baked goods are even better
See ever since I took a trip to Tuscany a few years ago I am always faced with yearning for the freshest prosciutto the perfect cheese and bread and a wine to wash down the salty meaty goodness with
if you can find drink specials at a time that suits you maybe its worth a look
If you're in town and want to kick back with some good food drink and ice cream make it a Windsor/Churn night
They have a cheap but good wine selection
All things considered the food and drink are amazing
We were puzzled that the sake we ordered was served cold as we're used to warm sake Our server who was awesome and a ginger I might add explained that warming of sake is usually done to make the lower quality sakes more flavorful
Their Platinum margarita is delicious I liked how they gave me whatever they couldn't pour in the margarita glass as well
Overall kind of fun for a casual drink or maybe a good place to have a couple drinks before you go out somewhere else
My friend and I went for happy hour and I was very impressed that all of their wines were $5 and the bruschetta was so cheap
Or drinks were quickly brought to us and or appetizers then sushi came quickly after
In addition their beer and wine selections are quite tasty
But the staff is great the drinks are perfectly chosen and the music is generally pretty amazing
So if you are looking for a good quality tea to drink at home at your leisure you shouldn't have any trouble finding a tea blend to your liking
The wine list is nice and the service was good too
So the value for the drinks there is worth visiting
I am not a huge beer drinker but the peach beer is delicious
The drinks are reasonable and well poured and the bartenders are good people
Locally roasted and internationally award winning the beans are top quality which you can tell with the first sip of any of their espresso drinks
My wife had the buttermilk roasted chicken along with a glass of their creative and delicious interpretation of sangria
I may not go back but I recommend that others check it out purely for the unique venue and good drinks
they actually have some pretty good drink specials from 4-7pm for happy hour
Service was good drinks were refilled and the bill was brought promptly
I highly recommend this place for a drink dinner or taking a date
The outside is great I mean bocce ball wasted at 137 on saturday is awesomely dangerous and they have this vig rigg which will take you home for free so so def anyway go for some drinks and throw heavy balls at smaller white ones you'll have a good time
I also enjoyed a tasty Ethiopian beer called Bedele
Good food good drink good times - HUGE portions at very fair prices
Our drinks were good as well as the wings
We ordered a bottle of wine that I am not even going to pretend to know what it was called but man it was pretty tasty
The menu has some gastro pub favorites  unique takes on classic dishes and then burgers fries appetizers desserts wines beers well drinks fluffy purple things
I would recommend drinks-room servicemoscow mule food- meat/cheese
that wine was SO good that I've bought it from Whole Foods 3 times since visiting Jug
anyway definitely going back there monthly for their wine-tasting Thursday nights as recommended by the chef
They have some great deals on basic sushi and appetizer choices and can someone say sake bombers
Okay if you are a fan of mushrooms you are missing out on the pot of gold at the end of your fungi rainbow   This soup has it all wood ear crimini king probably even some of those good old fashioned white buttons too in a rich slightly thick broth with a hint of wine that truly brings it to another level
And it took a good 15 minutes to get a water another 15 to get my drink and another 15 to get my order in
The drink I got was a honeydew melon margarita which sounded good on paper but didn't really deliver
Dad enjoyed his wine had 3 glasses & I loved my cocktail so yummy
I wouldn't recommend the wine actually Bears distinct hints of 3 Buck Chuck
The drinks were good - I had a pitcher of white sangria and some wine
Both have been pleasurable experiences with surprisingly good food and drinks yet it is pricey
Over all well worth the price we got out of there just under $45 including drinks
I think everyone should at least give them a chance if you like divey bars good drinks and yum-bar eats
I went into this location the other day and they have a really good selection of products and they also have a huge drinks cooler possibly 25 different types of drinks
The service is always friendly and prompt the drinks and food are just as good as I expect every time I come in and the store has nice comfy chairs in addition to tables--perfect for hanging out with a friend reading a book or typing a paper
The port wine reduction helped with the flavor
Our group was fairly big and they were able to keep our drinks full and our food came out in good time with the size of our group
This place has it all nice bartenders who pour a mean drink good jukebox cheap prices pool/darts and this place has had a patio where you can take your drink out for a long time-even before the ban
Good place for a drink or two after work when you don't feel pretty enough for Cobalt but not quite slummy enough for Cruisin' 7th
AZ has the most delicious drinks that for the most part are all concocted in pint glasses shaken and poured into rather large martini glasses with ingredients that include but are not limited to; fresh cucumber and mint hand squeezed juices fresh sweet and sour orange juice ice cubes cherries that aren't soaked in formaldehyde and an arrange of spirits so broad that first time patrons usually walk in with their mouths agape
Pretty extensive bar selection lots of good drinks but I mainly just do beer/sake here
The reverse happy hour really is a good deal especially when I just want to go out and grab a few drinks and some food with friends and not deal with any Scottsdale BS like you would encounter at a place like Sapporo
The deals on the beer are not the best but they quality makes up for it
Usually there is a Belgium seasonal high gravity beer whose flavor and alcoholic punch is are to beat
For happy hour beers are $1 off mini pizzas are 1/2 off and most appetizers are $2 off
Right off the bat the Happy Hour is fantastic; 100+ beers on tap including some of AZ's finest and a couple amazing international brews
It has a great musician on weekends pit fires are going and everyone is enjoying tasty simple food and reasonably priced drinks around picnic tables
I was really disappointed in this place I love hot wings and beer I thought it would be a good spot
Everyone had fillet's but me of course I mainly had apps side's wine and desert ; I did try the seared ahi tuna it was ok I wasn't too impressed with it though
She failed to mention the dinner specials until we had finished both drinks placed our appetizer order and already decided on our meal choice
They have a very extensive wine list and their cocktails are delicious as well
It was good though and i thought it was a unique and fun drink to try
during this course I finished my Riesling and tried a glass of the Super Tuscan a rich red wine that smelled of butter with plump-fruit flavors which grew subtly bitterer on the back of the tongueI finished that wine with several bites of Jamie's tender juicy Prime Beef Rib-Eye--I'd been craving steak for agesfor dessert we had the complimentaryvanilla-infused cotton candy
They don't seem to care that much about the quality of the food perhaps because it's reasonable to assume that you'll be drinking and distracted anyway
The cedar plank bruschetta is a wonderful accompaniment with their wine selections and can be customized to taste
You really can't top their beer selection well over a 100+ bottled beer selections and a good amount on tap
Beers hot dogs and sodas are outrageous but they have something of monopoly on goods and services once you go inside so there isn't much that you can do about it
The total including tax and tip for our party of 4 was just under $150 and that included 2 appetizers a soup 4 entrees 1 dessert and 1 bottle of wine
Anyway we had a few drinks and some appetizers
They have really good beer on tap too -- nothing else quite like a 32oz
No draft beers just bottles without a glass or mug wine was good according to the wife
I give The Mission 4 stars as it relates to the drinks and appetizers
But in the meantime its got a good vibe and excellent after work hang out just invest in the appetizers and drinks
With a shared appetizer two entress one cocktail 4-5 glasses of wine and shared dessert the tab was $180
For beer drinkers they have a limited tap selection but they are all good craft beers
Everything is ok to good such as the drinks pastries and tsoynamis
00 before drinks or fries -- but the quality is the cause for the price difference
It was very quaint with tables lit by candles - a wonderful place for drinks and conversation
Good place to get loud spill beer and hang with college age people
Give yourself some time if you plan to visit just sit back and relax when your server does get there they will be friendly the wine will be good and the bruschetta will be delicious
The beer selection is excellent and I love that you can buy singles although I worry that Total Wine is going to have them beat in no time both in selection and price
We made the best of what we could knowing that we would be able to get drinks to help us on our way to a good time
I really enjoyed the Drinks too I would suggest the Babaloo Bul it's an unsuspecting mix of sugar red stripe and lime juice maybe it's totally refreshing and was a surprise
This bar has everything it needs to be a huge hit a great rooftop bar with a pool view of the city a city vibe delicious cocktails trendy furniture friendly staff and did I mention delicious drinks
Both recommended wines were perfect they were friendly and funny and best of all
I was enjoying the medley of flavors on my plate and in my glass maybe a bit more carefully than my other 6 friends at the table so when the server cleared all of their finished plates and left me the only one with food in front of myself i was furious
I will say that the Vig has great sangria tasty specialty drinks and I've always had good service
The agua fresca cocktail was too sweet for my taste so I moved on into a wine recommendation of the Pillsbury chardonday with my appetizer/dinner
Oh how good beer is when you first wake up
I got a kid's meal which comes with your choice of a main dish a side of any choice small drink free refills for dine-in and a frozen custard with 1 topping any flavor/any topping
Good sake selection for happy hour prices
*Portions = wonderful so much food/person*Area = not too desirable*Drinks = I ordered soft drinks not knowing that there were no refills
They run a little on the sweet side so I'd recommend a cocktail to start but then stick with wine
I suppose it's considerate of them to have a wine bar next door that patrons can wait in but it just made me pay more money for appetizers and beer to pass the long wait
They have an excellent selection of beers and I got a 14 oz Kiltlifter for $3
I've never been here for lunch or dinner usually just happy hour for drinks and some appetizers
ok kid this is not my first dinner out port salute trader joes yes it is good but I have had it as well as I sucked my martinis he did become more tolerable  we did end up with the in house made chorizo a couple of nice cheeses and yes in house pate which was very good we split a beat salad the mussels  I also ordered the open face lasagna but by the time it got to us I was full so we ended bringing it home I will say by the end of the night we had an enjoyable experience and I got use to mr cocky who all and all was a good  wait/bartender
Fine the waitress said she couldn't close my bar tab after checking with the bartender while she was getting our drinks and she didn't even ask my name to make a good attempt at pretending fine it was an hour and a half wait to get fries after ordering them fine the onion rings came out cold after waiting one hour fine the ham/egg/cheese sandwich came out cold probably sat at the window for a bit less than an hour fine the med-rare burger came out med-well fine when i tried to leave to eat at local bistro they offered to comp my food if I left that I never received I went back as waitress said food was almost done my big mistake fine they comp'd desert I didn't want that came out undercooked and had to  wait again for them to make a second attempt fine they dropped and shattered a plate on one of the guests at our table
There is a good selection of low cost quality wines with some differences from TJs
Highly recommended if you're up for some spice or a drink in a cool location definatly not your typical Scottsdale bar
I've been here a few times before and enjoyed the beer so I thought I would bring in a growler to take some home tonight
not only does this place have an amazing selection of beer wine and liquor it also has one of the comfiest friendliest fantastic bars down stairs
The cheap stiff drinks the variety of locations and the quality men and music make BS West one of the best Phoenix has to offer
We got to try the Thai lemonade really different mixed with tea and ginger Thai iced tea tasty and the awesome Thai mocha dessert in a glass
you get a little bit of each beer and it's wonderful
Awesome beer is served at a bar setup that is conducive to good flow and meeting new people
White tablecloth good cutlery big wine glasses open kitchen spicy dishes presented with flair - I'm impressed
When we went back the next day i again had the biscuits and gravy somehow resisting the urge to ask for a glass full of gravy augmented with wonderful rye toast and my companion had cinnamon french toast
The server must refill your drinks and many times these guys disappear so you may have an empty drink for a good 20 min
Postinos is an excellent place to grab a glass of wine and a light meal
We sat at the bar ordered drinks appetizers and entrees
They do have a nice selection of good beers on tap no Aventinus though
I'll certainly return price wasn't all that bad and the drinks are pretty good
The quality of My Wine Cellar seems to have decreased over the past few years since it reached its peak around late 2005
While their pizza is quite tasty there is a cap on the amount of pizza-and-wine dinners one can have weekly which was about the amount of time I put in there over the past few years
The sherry wine sauce was delicious and I love the mushrooms
The best part was that our server was able to recommend wines for each of us that we had never tried before but really enjoyed
Good wine list several beers and I had an awesome glass of Sherry to cap off my meal
My water glass never reached empty and that is always a sign to good and attentive wait staff
It was reasonably priced $11 for the quality of the wine and was very good
I wouldn't pay $10 for a large glass of a delicious cocktail never mind a dribble
so I get a text to meet at this spot and I put the name and address together and im like wtfmakes no senseim inso im thinking some wannabe swank mockery of a white trash bar/grillWrongI was shocked and overly impressed by this restaurant/bistro 70 decor spotthe food is orgasmicly infused to take you way back to comfortable times and drinks that will blow your mindthe lemonchella blew me out of the waterone its just like my grandpa made and twoBig in az
With delicious soft tacos salsa beans amazing prices 3 carne asada tacos rice beans for around $6 with penny beers- say what
1/2 price sushi appetizers and drinks on those days
The flavor was very artificial and the drink was very watery
I asked why they would not just replace the drink with a different flavor and she responded with a smirk that it was my fault because I ordered it
delicious sandwiches salads and an amazing beer list
of wine with an eleven dollar cracker is good eats  then this is the place for you
Parking can be a hassle and drinks aren't always the cheapest but its good to be able to choose from a full bar and not just beer and wine
They were about 45 minutes away from closing which we assumed was ample time for a drink and an appetizer
Cuba libre is a perfectly legitimate cocktail just as legitimate as the mojito I ordered which I will say was excellent hence the two stars instead of one When it was clear we weren't going to accept the flight of rum she was trying to force on us she walked over the the man at the bar yet again who laughed at our pedestrian choice of drink
Overall great beer although selection never changes great food and a excellent atmosphere if you can get a spot outside
I think I was really impressed by the food once out of six visits or so and the rest of the times I just enjoyed the atmosphere and drinks on the patio with family or friends
If you go have a ginger beer - its sooo tasty
Rather than list everything I love about this place I encourage you to get a DD hop on your bike or take a cab on down to the Papago belly up to the bar grab the beer list or consult the usually very helpful bar tenders and prepare yourself for some good food and even better brews
The pool table rates have gone up in the last few years but if you spend a good amount of money on drinks they waive the pool table fee
We were impressed that we were able to be seated quickly and got our drinks and order in before several large groups
ok all good for storage but you DO NOT serve the wine at 55 smarty
I always feel good about myself when I eat/drink something organic
We toasted to a good meal she with her Martini Glass and I with the extra 'tini in the cap of the shaker
Another good note is that we came for my friend's b-day and they give you a beer glass of a beer on the b-days
We had some drinks and some food and a good time was had by all
They also offer a good variety of bruschetta so it would make a great place for happy hour if you just wanted a drink and a little bite to snack on
The server stopped by shortly later to take or drink ordersand we put in for the drunken cheesy bead appetizer due to happy hour ending shortly
The drinks were very tasty and strong without tasting strong
Slinging the lattes and mochas are a few gents not new to making an awesome cup or glass of java and if they are you'd never know because the drinks are not only delicious every time but consistent from whoever makes them
My only recommendations would be try to find more lighting during dinner and start making your own organic wine
Drinks are self serve and I like that they brew their own ice tea - it's the good dark teeth-staining ice tea that I loooooove
Our tab was  $25 for 2 dinners we had coupon worth $12  and 2 beers
It is very strong in the citrus flavour but the berries at the bottom help balance it and I really enjoyed the drink
We normally get a bottle of wine The Keg has a good standard selection with fair prices taking into account that you are paying for presentation and atmosphere
All in all I would definitely recommend The Keg to anyone who would like to enjoy a wonderful evening of good wine and great steaks in a modern atmosphere right here in Tempe
Second we have a seat take a look at the menu and the server greets us by the way nice server but kind of spacey he takes are drink orders and recommends a few dishes
Needless to say both drinks were delicious according to my girlfriend for whom I was purchasing the drink
I give Sonora Brewhouse a solid recommendation as a spot to drink but bring plenty of friends -- the place can be empty on a Saturday afternoon
Could be a good spot for after work drinks when you're just in the mood for a few drinks and something to snack on
The bar is tended by Micah Olson who is a sweetheart and the drinks especially the rebel son are delicious
As per previous reviews Papago has an amazing selection of draught beer that rotates constantly and I believe there were at least 10 new taps of 25 or so within our week between visits
The beer that Papago brews was fair with the Orange Blossom being actually really good
I'd recommend the tasting flight so you can sample 6 beers - for $9 a great deal
Great Happy Hour deals on wine and some appetizers
My drink miss katie's pimms cup pimm's #1 ketel one vodka muddled cucumber ginger and sprite was amazing
The happy hour here is nothing mind blowing but def worth checking out $5 for a dozen wings and a few bucks for a 32oz domestic beer make it a budget friendly dinner before 7
while the beer selection is amazing I stayed true to my roots & went with a PBR but you can find a brew for any palate
the water glasses were kept full and my house margarita was very tasty although maybe too small because i sucked it down in maybe 3 slurps of the straw
Friendly staff wholesome ingredients inventive topping combinations and a tasty slice are enough to keep me coming back and two slices and a drink and a drink always seem to cost a buck or two less than other downtown pizza joints
They have a small but good wine and beer list
They have a drink bar for beverages mostly just a soda fountain - but they also offer Crystal Light and an assortment of flavor add-ins to make your soda italian  So here's the breakdown on the meal
The green one was so good I wanted to drink it
Drink Besides the Irish staples they have a good selection of Single Malt Scotch
4 stars- Chicken crispy and well seasoned but not too greasy tender meat inside- Cornbread sweet moist mongo muffin with crispy edges- Waffles like that you can get them cooked with pecans in the batter though wish they'd make em a bit crispier- Fried okra I always order this when I see it- Fun drinks 4 different flavors/colors if kool aid and super crazy the way the southerners like it sweet tea- Atmosphere dinery slick red booths- Service very friendly and food came out quickMidlights- Mac and cheese I didn't care for the sour creamy taste of this particular version but my cousin loved it- Red Velvet cake we're a fan of this type of cake but this rendition was just ok
Drinks appetizers and desserts were all awesome
but for drinks and appetizers during happy hour which runs from 3-6 Mon-Sat they are closed Sundays
You can get some delicious appetizers and desserts to accompany the dozens of wines they serve
2 Drinks The Gin Press and the Karma with Thai chili infused vodka were both good
It wasn't as good as its drinks service or atmosphere
It's got freaks on the dance floor a good crowd that's usually pumped to listen to some good tunes cheap drinks and fast bartenders
We ordered spring rolls for appetizers a couple of beers and entrees
We ordered another beer and the appetizer- potato chips and an onion and sour cream dipping sauce
The food is standard steakhouse fare the same delicious steaks have the ribeye  la carte sides and a good wine list albeit a bit Napa-heavy
My beer batter chicken strips were tasty but it was the garlic cheese beer bread that was the best part of my meal
Thank you for the recommendation friends but I will only ever be back for the martinis
I have eated at other TK's and its the same Hot girls crummy food cold beer it works out in the neighborhoods but downtown there is no real bar crowd so your food needs to be good
I had the short ribs tacos which were quite good and my drinks were great as well
Not the biggest beer selection I've seen but for a such a small independent place I'm absolutely impressed
Enjoyed the 50% off Sunday Night special on Arizona wines -- surprised my out-of-town snobby parents Arizona wine
Anyways once we finally got our drinks they were delicious
Good team a new decent beer and a place to hide yourself from the unrelenting AZ sun talk about a hole in one Golf reference
The happy hour wine selection was pretty strong and I enjoyed our bruschetta appetizer quite a bit -- alllllmost as good as Postino
The bar is definately a dive but with the midget bar average priced drinks good seating everywhere there's always a reason to get a little carried away
We received our drinks and appetizer in a flash
But alas I had 2 different wines through the course of the night both on recommendation from the servers and both decent
Beer selection was excellent liked that they use the proper glasses for each tap selection
the onions were caramelized well and their natural sweetness came through I usually like a more beer stout onion soup dealio but after a day's worth of flying this was perfect
I would recommend checking this place out when you can have a few beers and enjoy the patio
They had a pretty good beer selection and they carry many more beers on draft than just light beers
Gilbert needed a place that was nice laid back good food and good beer
Service as real good I really enjoying talking to servers who know about the menu but also the wine
The wine selection is not only fun inspiring and delicious but also beautiful
So folks the bottom line is if you want a place for quality imported meats and cheeses for your next wine party don't go to whole foods come here
The aroma and a sip suggest a romantic wine gentle with a good dose of berry flavor and a touch of spice
Between the four of us we split two starters had four creative wonderfully prepared entrees ranging from pork to fish to vegetarian choices enjoyed a great bottle of wine had two cups of coffee and split a delectable dessert four ways come on now
I was actually quite impressed with the wine list and the bartenders were very attentive
As before we started with some Retsina white wine and the antipasto appetizer which comes with warm pita wedges
Good sushi great beers interesting appetizer selections including the justifiably famous Hot Rocks
I ordered a full glass as i munched my salted feeder-corn-looking appetizer and selected from the menu full of great descriptions of the dishes and even several photos to help a gringo like me
They serve their sodas in HUGE glasses so that you don't have to wait for refills because you typically don't need one The pricing is a bit high for what you get in my opinion - their prices have gone up $3-$4 an entree over the past 7 or 8 years and the quality has stayed exactly the same
Beer is cold service is slow but very good
Looking forward to trying some of their other tasty food creations and drinks at my fabulously new food crush place
The fish was nothing to write home about and if you're looking for actually delicious fish & chips and not just a cheap Tempe staple you'd be better off going to Rula Bula or 4 Peaks which have fantastic beer selections to boot
The wait staff was attentive food and drinks great so I highly recommend it and I plan to be a regular
For curiosity sake I did try another horchata in Mesa and while it was good you could taste some graininess
Food was good price was OK but made it great was the 1/2 price promotion on a bottle of wine that they were running on Sunday nights
I've been here a few times and love the beer and the pizza is real good
Well a lil above just because the beer is really good and they brew a lot if high percent brews
All in all it's worth the visit because the ingredients are mostly very fresh the portion sizes are a good value and the beer selection is great
We didn't get any drinks nor appetizers just two entrees and water for $80 and to top it off the portions were SMALL
As for the beers of course there should be something of interest for just about anyone There is a pretty good beer selection from your ales ipas and lots of local flavor
It was quiet the staff was nice the drink selection was fair and the good was rather good
Between that factored with the good food and decent drink offerings I think they've found a new regular
We ended up with a nice fresh salad of mixed greens and other veggies like tomatoes and carrots with a really good Italian dressing that had a perfect red wine vinegar bite foccaccia and cheese and olives from the deli case
The big surprise for us at Defalco's is what a good wine selection is displayed on the racks in the store of domestic and imported wines at a big range of price points from inexpensive to deluxe offering something for every kind of wine buyer
We had fun browsing through those and picked up a wonderful Italian wine to take home at under $20
Its not pretentious the food is yummy and the drinks are tasty
My fiance' and I go to split appetizers and a few beers every few weeks
rrIt's a nice little corner cafe --- good for a quick but tasty bite at lunch or even a leisurely afternoon Quality beer on tap and it even looked like martini service - but no I didn't indulge ;-
If the delicious food and $5 drinks and happy hour appies weren't enough to win me over the service made it a slam dunk
The $2 Stellas are offered all day all summer long so they say so if you want some cheap drinks and good panini head over to Carly's who won't disappoint
Really really good homemade pastas and an extensive wine list filled with great choices
A friend recommended their red wine blend to me but didn't know what it was called
It's a simple face wash that does what it says and doesn't leave you smelling like an orchardDrinks-- Their juices are all amazing especially their unpasteurized orange juice but it's not cheap
but seriously I even served this beer to a female guest the other night and she was totally impressed
The patio has a relaxing atmosphere - very loungy and good for sipping wine in the afternoon
We spent a good two hours here and although our bill for the food and bottles of wine came to under $100 we paid $150 - our waiter even told us we paid too much
Were looking at the basics Customer service Food Quality of beer and variety especially when it comes to a brewery and ambiance aka mood or vibe of the restaurant
But their service no matter how busy it gets is on point with a smile Food is amazing paired with their beer quality of beer is the best in the southwest and the vibe is always laid back-good times
-Brick house Wings with the Stout BBQ sauce are like black tar heroin Desert All are delicious & Genius -Oatmeal Stout Shake-Stoutamisu-Ice Cream Cake Beer -Kiltlifer My favorite beer on the market-Pumpkin Porter A seasonal also my ^-Hefenwiezen-IPA-Hopknot-Oatmeal Stout
after a while of checking out their digs and studying over the menu and drink/food specials they had for weekends we opted to go for the order any regular appetizer and get you're first beer for $1 deal
The real reason to come here is the beer; despite the fact i didnt try any entrees or their delicious sounding kobe beef burger- i'm gonna go ahead and stand by my sentiment
I had a delicious chef salad and a side of their beer bread
the bartender was super nice poured stiff well-made drinks and gave us good service
The Beergarita is also amazing so if you're trying to get buzzed quickly this is the drink for you
I had the drunken geisha drink it was good my mom had some run conconction called the Fog Cutter that she liked I also thought as another reviewer here stated  it had too much ice but she thought it was fine
So I agree with the other reviewers good for drinks probably not for food - I only say this because I asked the server what she recommended for appetizers/food and she was very vague didn't seem enthusiastic but she was very specific what she recommended for drinks
They have a good wine list but the wines I've ordered in the past have been tasteless watery so I stick to the stellar cocktails
Unless you are into loud awful music and bad beer this is not a good spot to go to
I eventually walked in thinking that a few drinks and some good company would change the way I felt
In SF and Emeryville Trader Vic's is known for being a classy cool spot to go get good food and even better drinks in a funky environment
Everyone found a wine that was to their liking and that plus the food plus the good weather made for a very relaxing evening on the patio
Their happy hour may be one of the best-kept secrets in town - specials on beer/wine and a large selection of delicious tapas - all from $1 to $3
Lots of patio space for pre-dinner drinks and appetizers while everyone soaks in the view
I think the cost of their regular menu is about  $40-50 per entree and with that in mind I'd say this would be a better spot for drinks and a couple of appetizers or even after dinner drinks
The bulldog beer-garitas are giant and delicious
I tried the Chef's Wine Dinner one night $25 four courses with wine pairings and enjoyed a motley mix of chowder red fish headcheese dirty rice cola braised beef cheeks and liver and trotter patu00e9
The specialty drinks are delicious and the bartenders always make them with pride
There is also a really quality diverse beer list
Shane the bartender eased us into the menu both drinks and food and made some excellent suggestions
The food was delicious and the drinks were well made
I was so impressed with everything and the service provided that after I left here with a co-worker on the afternoon we found out about it I immediately came back that night with my girlfriend for dinner and drinks
The strategy here is to offer the latest trend in a social international bistro lounge showcasing fine wine luxury spirits excellent meals with sweet in-flight entertainment
Elements gets snaps forSuggesting on the bottom of the menu that people turn off their cell phonesA decent wine selection including good by the glass options perfect for the lonely travelerHaving foie gras on the menu since it's all but disappeared most placesThe views do indeed seem to be goodYou can sit at a 'community table' to meet fellow lonely dinersBack to the story the restaurant isn't so much off the lobby as it is *in* the lobby
We start with an appetizer and drink working our way into the weekend specials
The bar service generally isn't very good and you can expect to wait a while to get a drink
Then I realized that it was practically around the corner from me and the beer was supposed to be Four Peaks-quality and I changed my tune slightly
We went on a Sunday not too busy in there and I decided to sample the beers which were pretty much standard micro-brewery fare good stuff
highly recommend it if you're looking for a great place to take a date or chill with some friends out in the patio over some wine
Very good but at $3 a bottle a little pricey especially where I tend to drink a lot of soda when I eat lunch
The cheese selection is great and the staff will recommend what goes with your wine
You can eat inside or out and I suggest you sip on your first glass of wine or beer to let the cheese get to the right temp that the flavors come out and BAM
They have at least 10 big-ass flat screen TV all around the place the rest are good sized CRTs I counted almost as many TVs in the place as there were beers on tap
Maybe I will go back and try their tacos but I am thinking I will keep it as a good place to sit on the patio eat chips & salsa and drink a good margarita or two
Olive and Ivy has a better than average happy hour with good food and drink specials
Not only do they have a great wine selection they also have a good selection of beers from Arizona Europe along with other domestic options
After that was served 2 bottled beers and delicious tacos
That being said the drinks were good the atmosphere was comfortable yet trendy and the service was attentive if self-important
They have an exceptional wine list which is what I recommend
We really go all out and each get our own appetizer drinks main course and dessert
Good atmosphere overall for a laid back drink
They don't serve fountain drinks  They had great customer service and the cuts of meet were good
As I took in the small grocery section filled with tiny jars of delectable jams and other assorted gourmet goodies and my eyes greedily explored the glass counters filled with tantalizing displays of freshly baked muffins cupcakes and cookies I felt like I was coming home to a new best friend who would provide me with sustenance whenever I visited my brother in Phoenix
Other recommendations include the spinach salad with blackened chicken the daily specials like the buffalo burger or camarones a la diabla or the steak sandwich on beer bread
5 stars for its great local vibe and cheap and tasty food and beer
I guess the beer is the only good thing here because I ordered a mimosa that my server recommended to me
Really good drinks very knowledgeable mixologist not bartenders
10 minutes for your drink is expected but well worth it
He was so impressed with everything especially their beer and we couldn't thank Tim enough for his wonderful attitude and lovely approach
I specifically say a cafe because that is where the french go for good food and wine at reasonable prices
Yes they forgot the straw for my drink but I definitely recommend
Our server was great and was wiling to make some recommendations to us although she could not talk about wine or pairings
Cowboy Ciao didn't seem to be  the server could not talk to the wines or offer up pairings and the stemware they served the wines in was bargain basement quality
The tiki glass was cute a little too Disney/Macayo's for me and way too strong with no actual flavor
The duck chiatarra with vegetable ragout had a very flavorful red wine and earthy flavor with baby carrots and mushrooms
The Dr's just need to slow down not be in a rush and at least glance at the chart to see if the baby is a girl or boy for goodness sake
The ONLY reason to go here is for ridiculously good beer specials 241 or half off -i think - depending on the day and lots and lots of TVs
We ordered two drinks that were both fruity and delicious 1 of which came in an adorable tiki shaped glass
And if you're looking for a quality drink to go with your food Half of Delux's menu is alcohol
It was hard to make a menu choice here because everything sounded so good and you could see all the fresh salad fixings and side items in the glass window display
I had a Pink Lady drink which was very tasty
I've now had there regular coffee and some of their coffee drinks and I can say they are excellent
The prices reflect the quality of the food and the servers are always right on the money with wine pairings
There are plenty of Italian men running around serving people tasty plates of food and wine
I love to walk the aisles and see what's on display cookware dishes jewelry auto accessories baked goods wine fruit books clothes
Jeannie isn't a beer drinker but thoroughly enjoyed her on tap wine
Our beers were tasty and the spam sliders were the perfect late night snack
I didn't have very high expectations for this bar considering I went to another bar opening down the street world of beers and left unimpressed
But I was pleasantly surprised by Handlebar not only for their selection of beers but for their wonderful service
He then went on to recommend the perfect beers for us; he explained each beer with great detail and was very convincing
The Ranger is good beer but I wish WISH WISH they would get Four Peaks on tap
Now if you are a beer snob or wish you could be one this will be your brewski haven because you'll enjoy some delicious options
I don't know what type of beer they used in the brat but it gave it a unique flavor
Price- The prices are good for any drinks purchased by the glass or bottle
Make sure to stop by on these nights for some great drinks at good prices
Come to Sun Devil and go downstairs to get some really good beer on tap plus great specials on wine pours and flights of craft beer
Between the inviting pink chairs where I haven't yet had a drink the delicious food I couldn't get enough of and an outdoor patio with fire pit that looks like a great spot for day or night I'll be back invited or not
You can imagine my surprise then when the sake sashimi I had was some of the freshest highest quality fish I'd ever had
After I finished my beer I had to try the Red Head in Bed which has Ketel One Citrus a splash of sparkling wine lemon juice simple syrup and muddled strawberries - so tasty and refreshing
Our waitress came shortly after and took our drink and appetizer order
Sexy martini's the smoking lemon drop martini complete with dry ice the chocolate martini with it's own chocolate covered strawberry or the quintessential dirty martini a truly outstanding wine list and great free bread and the pretzel bread is the best you'll find outside South Philly make for a good ol' time
For $45 we could have had a much better meal at many other Valley Italian restaurants  The service and wine were good but that hardly matters when the food is not
We would recommend this place for a nice night out our check with wine and gratuity was right at $200
My brat was good I got a beer brat with sauerkraut relish and spicy pickles
I mean you can't beat a good beer and a brat
We just had beers and a few appetizers the happy hour specials are a great deal but the bartender wasn't as friendly or attentive as he certainly could have been taking into account the empty bar
Their drinks and appetizers are half off from 4pm-7pm and my bill for drinks and dinner with friends is typically $20-$30
We asked her for recommendations from their extensive beer list and mentioned we preferred to drink local
My husband had a beer that was brewed in Tucson he's a Wildcat so he wanted to give Tucson some love and he really enjoyed that as well
The bar was packed and for good reason - the bartenders really know how to make a drink
They have delicious authentic mexican drinks as well and I tried their mango-chile and rum mixed drink it is a must if you like the mexican candies it tastes like that but blended in a cold alcoholic concoction
I can tell this is not a particularly popular place which may actually not be a bad thing; but definatly a good place to drink with close friends espically if your from CHICAGO or know anything about Chicago sports teams
I sat down and my server was good about getting my drinks right away
So for $18 you're really getting 2 very high quality drinks
Although service was good and the place was nice looking and obviously the wine was spectacular
PRICE For the prime rib meal an appetizer and a drink it'll be over $30 for sure
and I have to admit I thought about drinking the extra broth too - it was that good
The drinks are stiff and the water is tasty
I also had one of the gin martinis off the menu which was very good
However get there when the front glass is open and you have an amazing view of what the day can offer
00 glass of wine which was good not outstanding the price point should be lowered to $10
I will say though that the natural refresher drinks are really good
My girlfriend and I had a great time at the show very close and personal venue great sound quality AND the bar areas are properly staffed so I didn't have to wait in line and miss the whole show just to get a drink like many other concerts I end up seeing
Went here for our company dinner/happy hourWhat I liked-friendly staff pretty quick to serve drinks n food-good bar-very clean and plenty of seatsWhy no fifth star-the food seemed about average-for a clean place kinda has an identity crisis
In fact I've been waiting with beer-baited breath for some time now for this place to open even following the building process on their Facebook page because it is a great downtown destination for a quality beer after work
The special drinks look quite tasty but I have not indulged
The wine bar is next door and will give you the chance to sample some good wine
The servers are knowledgeable the food is good and the drinks are very well poured
I ordered steak and eggs a classic which was like 7 or 8 bucks in the back of my mind I knew there was a hitch but instincts aside I was still hyped sadly like most things in my life disappointment  The Steak basically was badly seasoned deli roast beef stacked over my horribly cooked eggs my plate was over flowing with watery steak juice it really should have been served in a bowl it was gross I mean gross the coffee drink was good kinda girly and the decor was aiight
The wine list is extensive and they have appetizers that nicely pair with the wines
We sat in the bar and the staff was awesome the wine was great the food was delicious and affordable
$16 glasses of wine or margaritas just made me think of other places I could enjoy a meal as good if not better and either bring my own or pay less
Their burgers are great breakfast is wonderful and the drinks are very tasty
I came here for a few drinks as part of a Light Rail pub crawl/birthday night out and a good time was had by all
I've never actually eaten dinner here because the happy hour food menu is enough to fill you up but I think I've tried almost all the items on the happy hour menu and I would recommend every one Ahi tacos guacamole green chile pork stew big ass burger seared ahi lamb chops and fondue and the drink specials are all mouth wateringly delicious
They have a good selection of beers bottle and draft
They have 30 taps and 2 casks all devoted solely to good beer both local and imported
Their own beers are great but you also really get some treats and amazing beers on their other taps -- it changes weekly so check out  their website http//www
Everyone I know that's eaten the miso soup rates it above average There's a wide variety of rollsappetizers and drinks that are reasonably priced out-with happy hour
Cheap drinks good jukebox free pool a pinball machine and darts
Total bill for the 4 of us with 4 appetizers 3 entrees soft drinks and 4 alcoholic drinks was $99
The wine list is good with a nice variety but the pours are pretty chintzy
The atmosphere is comfy the staff is nice and the drinks are good
Overall its a cool place with a cool vibe and I would recommend it just for the drink specials
luckily all good things from Michigan are slowly creeping over here Jimmy Johns Bell's beer and next we might just see Coney Island's popping up
I remember coming here a few years ago and really liking it so when Deal Chicken had an offer for $15 for $30 worth of food and drinks I grabbed one
As not-great as this place is the value is certainly there the service is good & they have beer
The happy hour is also good with a lot of those favorites available cheaper with good drink specials as well
At quadruple the flavor and double the alcohol content compared to domestics this beer has a certain yeasty earthiness that's surprisingly not heavy or thick
I asked the barista what she recommended as an ice blended drink
They definitely carry a lot of Irish beers and ales which my friends tried and enjoyed
Tasty for certain but I prefer my beer to taste like well beer
There's a smokin' happy hour here until 630 where you can get lots of good eats and drinkies for super low prices
Worthless waitress who knew nothing about the otherwise impressive beer list
They also have an amazing selection of wines cheeses from all over the world and fantastically educated people to help you find exactly what you are looking for whether it be blue cheese stuffed olives St
They have amazing food especially good appetizer options for group events the wine selection is wonderful and the service is the best I've had in Phoenix hands down
Lola reminds me a lot of Lux in terms of the food and drink selection and quality however the atmosphere is a more urban than grunge and the furniture is cleaner and does not have holes in the upholstery
Good for a date night birthday party or a quick drink and something to nosh on
They made a pretty good peach beer and I don't like fruity beers
The fries were good they were beer battered if I remember right
95 and two drinks nope sorry I only had three meals-So the owner looks and all he says is good thing you looked yeah thanks I just saved myself $10
The drinks are strong the patio's dreamy the inside smells like beer rot and Casey's usually leads to good conversation and an adventure
Drink prices are good and they have specials like PBR power hour one dollar Pabst Blue Ribbon beers for you culturally-impoverished sorts
A good place to study/meet/or just get a good drink
The micro beers are pretty awful however and I would strongly recommend skipping them
The service was friendly and overall I have enjoyed stopping in here for a beer or a bite to eat
Aside from the amazing sake list cool atmosphere and good service the food is not only fun but delish
They have a good wine and beverage beer and cocktails too list
Their happy hour specials are good and easy- half off drinks and apps
The beer was cold and the Wild Turkey was as good as ever
They serve good beer and serve $3 car bombs all the time - if you don't like the food it's easy to drink until you do
If you're not a drinker the lemonade is tasty too
With the exception of the Justin port the wine selection was average and not a good value
I used to live in Porland and this bar reminds me of that scene; good beer laid back vibe and stellar pub food
The breakfast burritos and stuff are good and they have some pretty decent drink specials
I don't order fuffy-drinks like mochas lattes blah blah blah - I just want a good cup of strong Joe
The drinks here are HIGHLY recommended
Also though the wine parings are wonderful if you are on a budget skipping the wine is a good way to trim the bill
I mean good tasting drinks not frosty beers not stiff rum and cokes
it also has really cheap strong drinks and really good djs who i've found to be even better then those who play at french kiss
This is a great place to go and get a good for the money meal and a drink
I am aware that if you want a quality burger you will pay for it but when my wife and I get a burger each a small fry to share and two drinks and it comes to 20 dollars something is wrong
After being a frequenter of Carly's for the past couple of years I'd gotten used to sandwiches that were tasty but lacking filler and a happy hour that only consisted of a dollar off beers
The area was in need of a good sandwich and salad shop with tasty beers and wines to rival it
I had a pretty good buzz going on at  this point so I chose not to view these incidents as potential red flags and instead lingered to finish my beer
We came here for a drink and although it's expensive $30 for a glass of wine and a specialty drink the view is absolutely amazing at night
I love that they have all different flavors of Emergen-C fountain drinks available too - this is the only place I've seen this
I don't think you will meet the love of your life there and you probably won't meet the love of your night there - but if you want cheap drinks wet t-shirts and a good place to people watch this isn't a bad option
I do find their wine selection to be pretty good
They have a good selection of food and beer
I appreciated the dipping sauces and the hard to pronouncecured meats and delicious cheeses that our waitress was sweet enough to repeatedly pronounce for all of us approaching our 3rd or 4th glass of wine
You can pick from five martinis 5 wines by the glass and 5 appetizers
I'll admit that I like the girly martinis over classic ones so both of the ones I had at Flemings were right up my alley and I really enjoyed them
5 stars but I'm rounding down to three because the happy hour deal is good for food not so much for drinks and nothing I tried aside from the crab cakes makes me want to have a full dinner at Flemings
He recommended a great wine to pair with the lobster and made sure we were well taken care
Both beers were good but we liked the vanilla seasonal so much we bought a to go 64oz Growler
Huge portions of delicious pulled pork perfect coleslaw ice cold drinks plenty of TVs and friendly staff make this a fun place you should try
Nobu also knows his way around wine and we were impressed with a Turley red that went down very well with his Kumamoto Oysters with Uni
The tickets came with free drinks dinner buffet and an excellent view of ice and the Coyotes crushing the Sharks
Tried the family meal that came with 50 wings sides and drinks had traditional wings bone in to the boneless options and they all tasted good the flavors we ordered were Teriyaki Mild and Parmesan Garlic
Well worth a browse and if they happen to be closed never fear you can fill your eyeballs with fascinating sights just by looking through the ample glass windows or venture over to etsy
Definitely recommend this bar if you're looking for a lively place to have some drinks
Other than that I really enjoyed my wine - rieslings and a sauvignon blanc noshed on marinated olives and mixed nuts and enjoyed the company of random Yelpers
Overall pretty decent food good desserts the drinks are a little hit or miss
In addition to the aspects that haven't changed like serving the best espresso in the Valley combined with one-of-a-kind baked goods and the best quiche I've ever had in the mornings Lux has a brand new space and now serves dinner wine bottled beer and some pretty amazing cocktails from scratch my margarita was made with egg whites
The bar area was packed and people were enjoying their drinks and some light appetizers
We began the meal with drinks and appetizers which were good
Finally good taps and food in the Tempe marketplace for the craft beer kind of person
The drinks are good however a little pricey
Great food great drinks and amazing decor  Hanny's had me at hello
After drinks and appetizers we opted to be seated and we sat at the ceviche bar
They have random specials everyday Tuesday night- bottle of wine and an appetizer for $20
What impressed me is they let us grab drinks at the bar while we were waiting for a table
We took a seat at the large bar and started with a glass of tea which was pretty good
The glass sculptures are amazing and you HAVE to try the Prickly Pear Iced Tea
Start with a glass of wine then choose a couple of appetizers like the Brie Toasts or the stuffed mushrooms
The beerGreat selection of cheep beers so choose what you like for a good price
Over the course of several hours he whipped up three amazing courses with wine pairings demonstrating how to make each dish and answering questions
The food was amazing the wine was perfect and the company could not be beat
The drinks came quick and we placed our food order of many appetizers
Dessert was so delicious I would go to Cowboy Ciao just for after-dinner drinks and dessert
That being said their drinks are unique strong and damn good
Overall we still like the place and it makes a nice every-once-in-a-while lunch for people who work in the area and a good place to grab a few drinks on pay day
It's some drink that they have that I would not recommend to anyone
I enjoyed a decent selection of tunes friendly chats with a diverse patronage and a tall hot South African Rooibos good tea selection for us tea drinkers
sounds good to me; especially once we move to Old Town and won't have to worry about drinking and driving
If you're looking for a cold beer and appetizers this is the place
Maybe the best plan if you wanted to experience it is to go for drinks and possibly appetizers listen to some music and then go across the walkway to Yard House to eat
There's a row of colas a row of root beers a row of fruit flavors
I would return to try out another torta and perhaps one of their delicious looking drinks
myself & another friend arrived 5 minutes after happy hour ended we had to workmy friend whom was hosting the get together walked up to the waitress as she approached the table and said these are the two ladies I mentioned The waitress was quick to tell us  happy hour was over I thought here we go I order a drink and appetizer and said you see it's only 5 minutes after can't you see if our drinks would be apart of happy hour still our friends are ordering quite abite
They have bocce ball in the back patio which is always a good time especially after a few drinks
We really enjoyed the pool with lunch and drink service
They have an amazing selection of beer and one of the best burgers you can get at a chain restaurant
Drinks As a fellow Yelper mentioned Spinato's serves crushed ice akin to the wonderful Sonic ice
My recommendation stick with the wine as the size is normal
Starting with the drinks we enjoyed the sangria the negro modelo on draft and fresh watermelon juice for the kids
Drinks are good not much on draft but definitely a place where a majority of Scottsdale can get a taste of a variety of Mexican beer
Good selection of beer I dont drink wine but there is plenty of that too
Our server was fantastic and had great wine and menu recommendations
The Happy Hour is quite excellent as that is when I showed up with almost half off for most beers
Now they have a good selection of beer and wine and the atmosphere seemed friendly for a night with a friend or with your family
Their salsa is excellent as well and their beer selection is modest but they have something for everyone
So with that said the sushi was good the beer was cold and the company I was with was great
had a fish burger and sweet potato fries that both arrived cold a waiter who vanished constantly but good drinks
Off and on I've had a dishwasher soap like residue flavor issue with their glassware especially when they first opened
The Good  They have an awesome selection of beers
He allowed us to taste some wine along with some of his recommendations
The drinks that I had were also delicious
I love trying martinis  and the sweet karma - a mix of lychee vodka and guava juice was amazing
We ordered drinks and an appetizer while we waited for our late friends to arrive
I tried a glass of white wine - can't remember which one and this brandy shot thing - that was really good
Lunch-to-go - wow - yummyBakery items such as bread and cakes are goodSome pretty ok wines I prefer the higher end but stock up on the others for those who visit and implore MORE of what I just gave them
Beer Torino - I don't drink/like beer but tried this and it is good
I've been known to come in and just have wine and order the bowl of olives for dinner they are that good
I can't review the food because we just had a couple of drinks but the bartender was very nice and the space is amazing
The stout was a few hops away from being an IPA a little too much for me but the tea was very delicious after it cooled down from its molten plasma form to a more drinkable liquid
The two beers that I had were decent but not amazing
Not impressed and I will not be returning if the beer and food were amazing I might come back even if the service sucked but if all three of these important factors are not up to par I will spend my money else where
after all my years of drinking haterade in Urban Outfitters I finally found one that is worth my coveted 5 stars
I think the retail wine selection is less but the food choices are slightly expanded and the quality is wonderful
This dish was both visually appealing and absolutely delicious I've said this about several of the night's items with good reason it was perfectly prepared tender enough to cut with a fork with just the right amount of salty smokiness which went well when paired with the accompanying apricot sake sauce
The server came over pretty quick and took our drink order then delivered them promptly that's where the good ended
Draft beers are $3 glasses of wine and well cocktails are $5 and they have a selection of small plates which are smaller portions of their appetizers but with the entrees being so incredible AND coming with soup or salad and don't forget the bread with some balsamic vinegar and olive oil
They have a good sized bar selection with some really interesting imported beers
This place does have beer and margaritas but that doesn't make a good restuarant
To drink I had an iced mocha and my friend the cappuccino which they do a lovely heart in it its sooo cute and also delicious
I'll definitely be returning to Brunchies and trying more from their huge menu and to try some of the amazing cakes I was spying under those glass covers ;-
Most of all we had a really good bottle of wine which made the experience a lot more lovely
Great location good beer and liquor selections prices on the higher side mixed service lame food
Bottom line stop in for a beer if you're in the area but look elsewhere for deals and good food
After we hadn't seen our server for a good 10-15 minutes and then she botched our drink order the manager had stopped in to see how we were doing
Ya know just when I thought I couldn't fit one more restaurant into my casual Mexican food rotation Rubio's comes along with its damn delicious tacos and its friendly employees and its integration of Coke Zero in its fountain drink machine and the next thing you know I'm up to FOUR very viable options for my frequent inexpensive taco/burrito cravings
I also got a an avocado boba drink which was delicious thick and creamy
Good beer good pizza good service - just have to be a little faster getting them out especially since it was not busy at all
Definitely a good place to gather with friends or enjoy a glass of wine to unwind at the end of the day
Very bright and airy and they had these awesome glass garage doors that allowed for good people watching
In conclusion I would solely recommend this place for drinks and snacks
Depending on what time and what occasion you went to that place for dinner or for drinks I think it is a good place to hang out
HH consist of a good selection of $5 wines of all varietals or $20 bottles
They have amazing root beer on tap which is a rarity and let me tell you its amazing
We cleaned our plates played with some of the Trivial Pursuit cards on our table and enjoyed a few beers
I have no idea how Rebar is I wrote on their Facebook wall about their beer selection and got the answer If you want good beer go to Roosevelt or Lost Leaf
I've eaten here once and yes the food was really really good but I gotta be honest I come here to drink beer
The Kiltlifter is by far my favorite of Four Peak's selection as it reminds me of my favorite beer from back East and it's now offered in cans making it an excellent choice for your next poolside beverage
Although tasty; the server knew nothing of her craft when it came to table service or she deemed us not worthy to bestow her wine serving skills on us even at one point filling one of the glasses with a different type of wine than was previously purchased
Their wine list is quite good we had the White Star which of course was well White Star
He doesn't drink but for some reason he eats nothing but excellent hang-over food
Happy hour is great at $5 - $7 apps and $2 off beers/wine = $3 for a good beer
I'm drinking the free beer which is light and delicious
Great deli selection lots of beer good produce and very helpful staff
I'm torn with this place because i love it so much but dislike it for certain things so I'm going to stay positive because the things i don't like can be a personal thing about the music they allow in there it has a HELL a lot of beers it has a grand selection of wine it has no food but who need food when you've eatn before going to the LOST LEAF the music is a hit and miss some days a very kool unique style and other days not good and i think this is why i sometimes have a problem with the music is because with all the great local musicians out in phoenix it should be easier to play this place but it isn't
What I did enjoy was the outside area and that there are many good options of beer
Food-mehBeer-goodAtmosphere and music-awesomeI will go back to Rosie's for the music and beer but not the food
Most people seem to like the ginger-laced Winter Warmer - my friend Justin really enjoyed his last night - but I'm not really into malty beers
Overall I think we would go back for happy hour - just drinks and appetizers
I drink copious amounts of water so that is pretty good
When the food is quality I won't hold above average drink prices against Scramble
The guy next to me got the Southwest burger and he said he's gotten that before as well as the fish and chips and beer battered chicken strips and everything has been wonderful
I ate lunch here and I was impressed with how one of the managers was educating the staff about the wine specials for the day and he had an impressive knowledge of many things that just aren't generally imparted to wait staff at most places he went off into detail about microbes in the soil of South Africa giving wine certain flavors etc
The food was good but not enough to make me go back with the slow kitchen service and no refills of drinks
One last thing -- the mixologist for cocktails is amazing and she knows her bourbon so if she's working the night you visit definitely ask her for a special drink
Good drinks although they didn't have any of my faves on tap
World Market has a huge variety of products from food to wine to toys to kitchen gear to furniture - it's all here in one wonderful magical store
There is an extensive wine list and a good selection of by-the-glass choices
We wanted to hang out in the bar area to have drinks appetizers and listen to the live music
Our drinks and food were very good and ended up being a fun night
The thing is had we had gotten good service we would have stayed for a few more of those expensive gay drinks
Not sure a full meal would garner my 4-star rating but for drinks and appetizers I'm a fan
The service was good and the bartender was funny and prompt with the drinks
He gave some good insight on the bar the drinks and the absinthe
I can't say that I would rush back to this place but the service is friendly and the drinks and food are good
The beer selection was good and overall we all enjoyed the drinks
and were not impressed so we finished up our drinks and headed out to eat dinner else where
The girls in our group really enjoyed their Moscow Mule in the metal glasses so definitely got that right
He came by several times to check on us did an excellent job at stating on top of our food and drinks
Mark my wonderful waiter deftly brought my drink order of their Riesling $9 per glass
The pretzels and cheese where also a good app to share among hungry friends who had been drinking at the bar for more than an hour before dinner
The place had yet to fill up completely so we were seated quickly and enjoyed some delicious champagne wine and appies waffle chips and tuna tartare bruschetta
As we enjoyed our drinks and people watched the place filled up and by 11pm the place was poppin
The Mythos beer was tasty and stronger than Bud Light
The cocunut/carrot juice drinks are absolutely amazing
I had a grilled chicken sandwich tater totsrecommended by my friend and a lemon/berry drink
the bartenders have the right amount of attitude and do a good job of getting drinks out
The drink was really tasty and my mom loved it
It's amazingly good and addictive - but almost requires a cold beer to go along with it to help cut the heat
fries were crisp and flavorful drinks exceptional and the service was quite impressive
Good drink great food great music great atmosphere great service
good bar to just settle down and enjoy some drinks without having to feel like you need to dress up
Outside bar last call brunch two pitchers of delicious $5 beer and music on a very packed patio
The non-wine happy hour prices are good
And if you're not a drinker or tire of it after 3 shots and about 5 regular drinks at that wonderful Happy Hour price created by the gorgeous and hilarious bartenders there's the lanes and pool tables to get things physical
For drink I recommend the Sangria it is amazing and delicious
I also had a glass of Malbec with dinner that was only $9 but quite good
The wine was great and the pizzas were tasty
I just moved to Phoenix and was looking for a good drink special for lunch
If you're a wine buff then you're good here at all hours
Two glasses of wine an appetizer and two entrees cost a little more than $100 not including tip
Key West Martini - A good dessert drink
They have a nice selection of wine and staff are eager to give their recommendations
not sure if this is good but the fries and drink come as a large
For light bites I had the Duck Pate with wine mustard which was very good
It had some nice earthy flavor that the wine mustard really played well with
Wonderful wine list tons of awards for it ask for a recommendation and you'll be duly satisfied
Cute modern looking place to grab a burger and a beer they had a good selection on tap with friendly service
I don't normally eat at CJ 's because the portions are ginormous but I do like them for a quick drink happy hour and maybe an appetizer to share

Most appetizers a small portion are $1 and most drinks are half price
I spent the better part of an hour at AZ88 had a couple drinks at the bar and tried their shrimp ceviche tasty
I decided to give it another try and got a drink that claimed to have pineapple orange and other flavors I like
We had sausages fish and chips and tasty beer
We hit the joint at 3pm for Happy Hour when drinks and certain appetizers are half-price
OK service nothing to write home about and the red beer was very good
I paid my bill and decided there are plenty of places with good beer and good food
The food the drinks the music are all excellent
The wine was excellent they have the largest wine list I have ever seen
So if you want a specific type of wine from a specific region good luck
I can just go to the bar for drinks and I am good
However some pretty ladies helped me find it and I enjoyed some great wine
Typically you will findA wide variety of salads and appetizersSeveral Pizza choicesSix Pasta dishesSix Entrees A GREAT dessert menua nice wine list If they don't have exactly what you like or you have a special dietary restriction ask if they will make it
Good selection of beer and the food is extremely edible
There is an excellent beer variety although the prices aren't great in that category
The house beers are surprisingly good as well
drunk kids acting like idiots the distance to walk from any parking to main gate the lack of signage to show you where to go to get from one point to another practically having to perform a high wire act with an elephant on your head just to get a beer stopping beer sales while Shiny Toy Guns is on stage the sound quality in Erotic World the portapotties being disgusting and out of soap and water no lighting at/near portapotties at night only one entrance/exit on a huuuuuge festival lot the litter
Great beer selection - We had Delerium Tremens Stone Arogant Bastard Roosevelt House Pale Ale Alpine White Rascal and Hitachi White Ale and all of them were delicious as well as fairly priced
Our glasses were always full with great beer see above our questions about the city were always answered with excitment and vigour and our taste buds were consistantly flattered by the sumptuous fare they recommended
Excellent Spanish sparkling wine promptly served while awaiting friends
Pros-Wings and tons of sauces my faves honey BBQ asian zing-Offer low-fat ranch regular ranch and bleu cheese for wing dips-Good happy hour food and drink specials-Tuesdays - regular wing specials-Thursdays - boneless wing specials-Service - I've ALWAYS had very accommodating servers and bartenders including changing TV channel to a different game-Calorie counts on menus - make better informed decisionsCons-Noise level - it's CRAZY loud in here even when there are no major games on-Misters do a better job of cooling down the area OUTSIDE of the patio than they do cooling the actual patio area
The peanut sauce is so good I was tempted to drink it
My main issue was that they were out of the bottle of wine we ordered and brought a different one which they recommended
I've been to the Garage a few times generally for a long lunch they are usually pretty quiet and I can catch up on some e-mails while getting a quality craft beer
I recommend riding your bike or taking a taxi - the drinks are seriously that cheap
spent less than $20 each on 2 bottles of wine 2 pizza's and the AMAZING banana and chocolate calzone btw don't ever try to eat that alone
Our waiter was very attentive and really seemed to care that we enjoyed our time there continually checking on us while refreshing drinks and offering suggestions; he acted more like an owner than just an employee
Owned and operated by Eugenia Theodosopoulos an Ohio native fyi and considered by many to be the best patisserie/bakery in the state I approached Essence with a note of skepticism largely assuming much of the hype was derived from Tempe's plethoric college crowd but arriving at the doors of the small shop on a particularly lovely 80 degree morning I gathered quite quickly that my original conceptions were misplaced; not only does Essence not look like a college haunt neither do its prices or products - a vast selection of at least twenty items aside from the posted menu sitting beneath and atop a glass case forcing me to make more than one tough decision that was not helped by my server's accurate assessment that everything was really good
Featuring light and crunchy layers of choux easily withstanding the tines of a fork without turning into a smooshy mess see Mille Feuille New York intertwined with rich pastry cream speckled with dots of vanilla bean and ripe raspberries what truly made this version stand out was the manner in which Theodosopoulos caramelized each layer of choux a technique reminiscent of Pierre Herme and as good as the French icon's version was I'd be hard pressed to say Essence's was any less impressive
The Arnold Palmer wasn't good at all plus the straw was TOO short for the glass that's pretty annoying
It was a very well made cocktail that definitely had the peach flavor while still reminding you that this was indeed an alcoholic drink - very refreshing in 100+ degree weather
Not much of an oenophile or drinker in general so I can't comment on the wine selection at all but overall you can have a tasty experience here with generally high quality food all around
Upper Wine Pizza and Bar has a very chill atmosphere and had delicious food
I'm not a huge wine connoisseur but I know a good glass or 5 when I have one
Overall I would not recommend the happy hour food options but the drink prices can't be beaten
After lunch we visited the baby cows the goats and then stopped and had a big glass of flavored milk $1 each - grape for my 2 yr old daughter and chocolate for my 4 yr old son
they have a pretty good wine selection at various price ranges
The food and drinks were pretty good but free makes everything taste a little bit better lol

My drink arrived quickly and unlike many other diet drinks I've had before had enough syrup in it to actually taste good
Despite having some communication difficulties since it was hard to hear each other speak We were outside on the patio at a table and a live band was playing our waitress did a good job refilling drinks as needed and getting our orders in
Amazing beers craft food and exceptional service
They also have amazing beers served so cold- it is a feat of science
If you have a big group the $39 price tag for the bottle is actually a decent value considering the quality of wine
The beers I had were very tasty served right
My wife enjoyed her wine also though the tiny water glass it was served in was a surprise
Citizen Public House has a cool vibe; good lighting a vaulted cieling with dark wood beams a large open patio and a bar in the center of the room where all the drink magic happens
I didn't try a cocktail last night but the drink list looked really good
From the traditional Oggie with beef onions potatoes and rutabaga with a lovely red wine gravy to the adventurous Lamb Vindaloo with basmati rice potatoes lamb and a wonderfully spicy vindaloo sauce all of Dean's creations are worth trying
For a drink I ordered an iced tea which was a flavored brew not your run-of-the-mill fare often served at quick lunch spots
We had such an enjoyable time sitting on the patio having a couple glasses of wine beer for the guys and eating from very tasty food
While they don't necessarily have the most amazing selection of wine they do have a good selection and I had some pretty good glasses from Spain and Argentina while I was there
Beer battered onion rings win for the appetizer the Philly wrap or beer battered fish and chips are my choice for the entru00e9e and desert is their bread pudding takes 2 to eat it
The beer was as good as ever and the food was quite a surprise more than the mediocre bar fare we had expected
About ten minutes later our drinks appeared along with my Tortilla Espanola which was as delicious as when I'd had it during our prior visit
Great atmosphere - a real nice pub complete with jukebox dartboard and a lot of really good beers to pick from
This place may have one of the best appetizers I have ever had - the English beer cheese dip
I enjoyed 3 cherry blossom drinks throughout the evening
This location has been around long before many other restaurants graced Scottsdale and they continue to have good service a lively crowd tasty drinks and good food
In summary this is a great spot to come for drinks with friends their tasty cornbread some queso and an entree such as their chicken sandwich with avocado
My husband and I had stopped by for a drink and appetizer last weekend
darkish lighting church pews first time i actually didnt mind sitting in a church pew tables made of doors with glass over them and good music
i did see only one local beer on tap Kiltlifter but it didnt disturb me too much since i saw quite a few delicious Belgian and German beers
I was able to taste lots of yummy goodness off their menu they had a white and red sangria station set up so I grabbed a glass of the white sangria and started tasting the food
She enjoyed it the rest of us enjoyed our wine
However thanks to their good beer list and given that most suburban peeps wouldnt notice the difference between fresh never-frozen and frozen fish
If you just want a good beer in the neighborhood and a passable roll to fill you up then this place is perfect
took forever for our drinks to get there food wasn't expensive and was semi-tasty
+Little touches sorbet in between 1st and 2nd course to refresh the pallet hand towels water glasses always full nice bread with pesto dipping sauce and a complimentary house appetizer-bit
I enjoyed the selection of beer and tequilas
I enjoyed stopping in being greeted by staff with smiles; staff that could make a great drink and fast
Food and drinks- The food was average tasting with an okay amount of flavor
Everyone said the drinks were pretty good and well blended
The issues that I have are the really weak drinks don't even bother ordering a cosmo or margarita especially since the drinks next door at Z are amazing and the not so great eye candy behind the bar which has been in place for years
Their wine list is nice I was sad they didn't have a moscato on it however the Reisling was really good so I couldn't complain
I paid just over $10 dollars with a drink not at all worth it
This store is very user friendly because they categorize by wines with similar flavors such as bolds mellow crisp and others
They also have monthly wine classes which I have taken and enjoyed very much
We started with a suggested appetizer and a nice glass of red wine
Our service was excellent and don't Phuket the beer   Great HH prices on the drinks
We ordered the Arizona smash burger the All American Smash burger 2 drinks an order of smash fries and an order of sweet potato smash fries which are both flavored with olive oil rosemary and garlic though you can also order regular fries
The food here is EXCELLENT the beer is VERY good and I've had both good service and slow service
The wine selection is as excellent as the food
My drink was refilled before it was empty a plus and the complimentary bread was delicious
We enjoyed great wine and great food--all very reasonably priced
people this a freakin bar for goodness sakes a hole in the wall  its no Bistro Its no classy spot and you can honestly smell a stench coming from the place weather its the bleachy pissy smell  or stank coming off the BAD SERVICE
Keep it classy and go next door to Mill cue club  its nice inside great service smoking hot staff and cheap good drinks
Food-wise the menu is kinda geared towards comfort and southern style offerings including mac-n-cheese scallops with bacon and corn grits dungeness crab cakes with complementary slaw pork-belly etcAgain overall good place to go for a casual and relaxing drink or two
We enjoyed several half off appetizers 2 bottles of wine Arnold Palmer ice tea and three kinds of desserts
I do enjoy the food -- the Udon noodle is good but there wasn't any of the Japanese beer left for me to order
The beer was so good it made me forget about sunshine wheat
I enjoyed the rest of my beer and fries and still left a happy camper
E -veryone who loves GOOD beer will be happy hereB-e a bit early on the weekends or maybe go during the week for a seat otherwise you're standing
The lemon vinaigrette dressing is almost good enough to drink
Wine $44 4 glasses Excellent as usual
I would recommend if you want a great glass of wine without food Cork is the place though our waiter Winston had difficulty remembering what wine was ordered at our table
Upon our servers recommendation we ordered a couple drinks and some guacamole
They have a good selection and I love that you can get your glasses made in an hour
= Strong drinks served super fast interesting crowd dance floor small but worked good music even before Ash took over
My one bowl with no sides drinks or appetizers was $11 after tip
Well the beer would have been $4 making lunch here for one with a beer an appetizer and a main about $22 after tax and tip
The mixed drinks aren't designed to be tasty they are designed to get people super fucked up and come in a giant mug
were our servers and made sure that we had a good supply of drinks chips and salsa
The patio is so pretty and they have a nice selection of appetizers wine and cocktails at reasonable prices
Though the menu is fairly extensive we stuck to the basics and had shrimp nigiri no brainer 2 lobster rolls excellent a Caterpillar roll fighting over who got the last piece edamme 2 glasses of a decent Chardonnay for me not my daughter and finished off with some white rice strawberry ice cream
Um I think you HAVE to love beer specifically Wisconsin beer memorabilia you have to love Anthropologie like clothing you have to love good old fashioned drinks like Greyhounds Old Fashioneds and Sidecars
Pros nice comfortable casual room; varied appetizer buffet- we especially liked the Kobe sliders and the salads; the complimentary duck fat fries; the skirt steak and salmon entrees were both outstanding and perfectly cooked; delicious sides- grilled corn smothered in a zesty sauce grilled asparagus baked beans; dessert overkill with apple crisp root beer floats and chocolate slivers and pecan cookies; mostly great service they brought me the wrong entree at first
The only knock I have on this place in comparison to Delux is its lack of good beer and its dwarf sized burgers
The tofu is always perfectly crispy the dishes especially the chow fun are excellent and the drink menu is fun and creative
-Their coffee is very good and shade grown but you can drink it in the sunna
The good thing is the beer list is one of the better ones in Arizona for the place beer list at Papago is good but not my scene that's the one good thing
I ordered a beer The waitress even recommended one that wasn't on the menu yet nice touch and my sister who is much better behaved than I am ordered a water
It was SO GOOD I'd have waited double the time although I'd be drunk by that time considering what a good beer selection they  have no good would come from that
When we first arrived a very knowlegeable and cheerful waitress explained the menu and specials took our appetizer and drink orders
The drinks were pretty good the decor was cool
we came here as three girls and ordered at least 5 appetizers on top of dessert and wine and the bill came a little short of $60 dollars
although disappointed by their escargot which could use a little more salt and butter their Moules Maison that is made of mussells and white wine sauce had the most enticing aroma and the most wonderful sauce base i was ready to lick the plate when finished
I was able to purchase the groupon for $40 worth of food and drink for $20 and was very excited about it
They have a lot of good beer on tap--Tetley's Boddington and a whole lot more
I tried it and thought it was good but it was definitely more like wine than a mixed drink
Drinks are a litle expensive but it is hard to turn down a flavored lemonade with a fancy umbrella
But I can't really have any complaints about free tasty snacks and wine
The orange juice although fresh-squeezed and very good had to be the smallest glass of OJ I have ever seen
The wine and cocktails were pretty good as well
Lightly beer battered seasoned to perfection and delicious
Just had a couple beers and some appetizers since it was late
but hubby was most impressed with the happy hour prices of the beers and the size
My glass of wine was the perfect temperature and tasted delicious throughout the meal
It was a very good price for 2 appetizers 2 entrees 2 glasses of wine dessert and tip
Cheap drinks rowdy people good mix of music
I understand Chef Stacy is planning on hosting tastings for her wines that will be superfun plus looking forward to sample the good beers in the coming rotations
I would recommend checking out 5th and Wine - if you have an evening with nothing planned and no time constraints
Wife and I are enjoying our beers and the staff is so wonderful
The place is packed at night which most of the time is a sure sign of good drinks and crowd
Chino is fantabulous but for goodness sake dinner is served in an aluminum freaking bowl
I usually get one of fruit-flavored sodas that come in the glass bottles from the refrigerators next to where your order your food
And the tSoynami's are really good but closer to a dessert than a drink
Tacos are good drinks are strong and sitting outside under the zigzag of string lights is very romatic and laid back atmosphere
The appetizers were a pretty good price and the drinks were half price for ladies only this was a Wednesday up to two drinks I hate restrictions like that
Otherwise the service was generally very good except for my last drink which I think she forgot to order until I reminder her
Great beer good food and awesome live music
The food is so good tho and the beers if you wait 10-25 mins for them are VERY cold
Their strawberry cocktail Rest Stop  is one of my favorites drinks ever - its the right amount of flavor and alcohol without the over abundance of sugar like most strawberry cocktails have
They have an awesome list of mixed drinks that they do a wonderful job on
The pizza is passable but not a million miles from a toasted lavash cracker the beer is all right and the pizza cookie is pretty good it's basically a cookie half-baked in a deep-dish pizza pan
I opted for the fountain soda their unsweetened iced tea is a good deal but I saw they have Virgils' Root Beer the best root beer on earth after Stewarts-and will totally get that next time
They also have a nice wine bar with a good selection by the bottle or glass
I've had drinks coffee appetizers and a bunch of different entrees with my wife
They have good drinks and the music is generally pretty good
The beer selection is decent service is good and I really like the food
Went to Gallaghers on a Thursday night for a blind date I can't really say much about the place because the date and I just wound up talking nonstop and only ordered drinks it was a great 1st date but not really great for our waitress who was waiting for us to order have to say on Thursday nights there is a trivia  night which brought out a good crowd but with the questions being asked my date and I felt like we missed the study class and jumped right into the test wow we only got one answer right  and that made us both laugh too
Very well priced with great drinks and EXCELLENT food
The main entree was lamb chops cooked in a unique and special way with wonderful spicing on a bed of precious sweet rice and vegetables plus dumplings and Russian beer - we were in heaven
Oh and Bobby's across the way in Kierland is a nice spot for a pre-dinner drink 400s Hollywood glamour meets The Jetsons with cool live jazz your parents or grandparents would have enjoyed back in the day
We waited for a good 15-20 minutes with now-empty water glasses and bread basket while NO ONE came to our table and Joe and his family were schmoozing around the room
High-end burgers delicious craft beer selection and great service in a cozy and hip location
If you love appetizers go for their happy hour where all appetizers are half off and select sushi items are at a special price as well as drinks
Though the wine took forever to get to us the bruchetta came out quick and was DELICIOUS - get the quattro thats all I have to say
No drink deals worthy of mention that I am aware of but I usually stick to draft beer
After the four terrible $13 cocktails cold appetizers poor service and dirty plates we decided to pack in our planned dinner and head down the street to a place that knew how to mix a drink and cook
They had a great selection of beer but they also have and amazing selection of vodka
So I had a chance to talk with the bartender take my time looking at the different types of beer and getting recommendations not just on beer but also on the foodIt was obvious that the bartender loved talking about the beer
Every once in a while Crate and Barrel hosts registry parties and you should definitely go to these-free food drinks tips and demonstrations make it worth the drive to the mall on a Saturday morning
Yes the prices are a bit high but I love the uniqueness of their glassware and furniture and you're paying for high-quality merchandise
While my visit to pick up take out was kind of drunken blur the amazing food I ate from Diamond's after a few hours of harder than intended  drinking were JUST what the doctor ordered
We were really impressed with the CRAFT BEER & the always rotating menu - keeps things fresh & us wanting to come back for more
We were also able to get a few glasses of wine during their happy hour which is a good deal
If your looking for a good small wine selection check it out
- The Food and beer selection is AMAZING- The atmosphere is great - not too college-ey not to snooty like Scottsdale - but a great mix of college young adults and families
He said it was a great place for him I think I did good picking it hahaSo we ordered the wings with spicy thai peanut sauce and beer bread the wings were so dang good it packed the right amount of heat
The beer bread omg that was soft and so good you don't need any butter to put on it it was perfect without
I'd also have to say that their alcohol selection is wonderful - more often than not alcohol especially beer ends up being cheaper here
The food is always amazing and never anything that is on the regular menu and the wine is perfect
We enjoyed their beer and their happy hour menu is different but good
Amazing happy hour menu lovely craft beers on tap extensive wine list and they make a mean martini
My husband and I had been here shortly after they opened and really enjoyed the food drinks and atmosphere
and he didn't even save me a bite  8We sat down and ordered the 6 course tasting menu paired with wine -- everything was just amazing
You only get three in a glass but well worth it
I don't think they offer a case discount but I think you are generally getting a good deal on wines anyway
The package included facility rental food and drink for 50 people LUX Catering three appetizers  two entrees one salad one vegetable one starch basic bar service and a bartender a DJ and Master of Ceremonies for 5 hours a cake for 50 Nancy Rae Cakes ALL of the flowers for the whole event a security guard and a choice of linen colors for the tables and a coordinator to make sure the whole thing went smoothly
It's such a fun place to go with or without someone else and they have delicious sandwiches salads and of course wine
They have a huge wine selection and I highly recommend getting a bottle when you're here
We get our drinks and the menu looked good and we figured out what we wanted to order but then another 15 minutes went by without any waiter attention and we decided to head off to another local place that we knew we would get better service
Everything from the seasonal and LOCAL fruits and veggies to the frozen organic meals to the fresh sliced deli meats to the local baked goods and brick-oven pizza made just the way you want it even with goat cheese to the Watering Hole where you can try 30 delicious local and craft beers to the in-store restaurant and grill to the
It's not overly expensive to eat here and they have some tasty girly flavored martinis too
Our waiter was realllllllly slow like we sat down and sat and sat for a good 10 minutes when a lady walked by and asked if anyone had taken our drink order we said no she asked what we wanted
Good wine selection too and though I'm not usually one to eat/drink with my feet up on another chair the atmosphere is super chill and I felt relaxed to the max
They are always whipping up a new latest and greatest batch of home-made vegan delicacies and even if you're not into coffee they have a wide range of other drinks and pastries to make the visit well worth it
They have a pretty good menu we tried the fried ravioli appetizer and it was really good also the drinks we ordered were mixed perfectly and he definitely didn't skimp on the liquor lol
I've never had a meal that was really that good here but do continue going back because of the atmosphere and drinks
We arrived early and enjoyed a drink at the beautiful bar
I finally got up and this is why the inside table was good and just ordered from the bartender directly to get a fresh set of drinks
They have this yummy melon drink with gummy bears or  gummy worms but anyway it is really good
It is also a hot spot for drinks so once the sun goes down the music goes up and the drinks flow Woohoo let the good times Roll
Good draft and bottle selection with nice happy hour deals on well drinks but stay away from the food
Good place to have a beer duck fart or whatever you may fancy
don't judge I had a glass of wine under my beltAnyway the steak was cooked as requested and everything was pretty tasty
The Good The beer selection is excellent
We had some winewhich was delicious the always spectacular bruscettawe had 2 bruscetta boards and all were fantastic and I had the Autostrada panini
So let's recap - bar oysters beer = good
So my mom came into town last night and after a night of drinking at Finnegan's my belly was asking for a tasty Carolina's burrito
My sister's sandwich side of bacon just 2 strips  but very good my caesar salad and 2 small drinks came to 21 bucks
It is a good deviation from chains and not quite as expensive as a quality independent wine bar
The flavors that are typically highlighted are - Chocolate Covered Banana & Marshmallow served on the same day really good as a swirl - Pistachio really good with almonds as a topping I tried getting pistachios as a topping and it was a little much - Butterscotch reminds me of pudding cups back in the day - German Chocolate & Caramel Custard also served on the same day and very good as a swirl - Irish Cream & Kahlua not served on the same day but the closest thing to drinking at work - S'mores delicious with a graham cracker topping - And every once in a while I like the Reese's with you know it Reese's as a topping
Decent drinks cheese/meat plate was standard but good
Papago is a strip mall microbrewer with pretty good food and great beer
Cherry Blossom has Japanese beer on tap and good house saki
I'm always a fan of the huevos rancheros in the restaurant a hearty worthwhile meal and I also like the overly strong espresso drinks they prepare at the bar in the morning
Happy Hour is a great deal with a large beer for about three bucks and half-price appetizers and maki
ProGood locationNice outdoor patioGreat happy hour Stick to cheap beer and makiConEverything other than the maki is pretty lameClassic rock 24/7
$4/$5 beers and drinks pretty good deal
We each had 2 pints of the Arizona peach four peaks beer at only $3 a piece it was a good and super tasty deal
I mean I have never really had a wine anywhere I didn't like so take it for what it's worth
We're talking plastic cup chug a lug cuz you're thirsty kind of big - I was looking the glass and was thinking Is this a 40 oz diet pepsi goodness
I'm a sucker for a good Mimosa but could not pass up this interesting drink that added cranberry juice to the mix
It is that good love the food the drinks and how snug it is
They have a huge list of toppings candies normal and home-made treats coffee and coffee drinks and baked goods available too
We ordered our drinks I ordered the margarita that Jordan recommended Primarita and my husband ordered the sangria/margarita Missionary both were very strong and very good
While the place was clean the bartendress friendly and a good selection to drink
The lineup was good  we got a booth in the corner got a beer had to go to the bar no waitress and it was a cool night
They serve beer here so that's good to know
I might return just for a drink and share a appetizer
Appetizer specials are $1 $2 or $3 and a few drink specials are also available
Our group enjoyed relaxing on the lanai sipping our drinks underneath the tiki torches bamboo and heat lamps
As we relaxed with the good food good drinks and good company we joked about hanging out until happy hour started up again at 9
That was a slight disappointment because that wine was VERY good
I recommend getting some trail mix to munch on with some beers
htmWhile you are in Coolidge I would recommend the Gallopin' Goose for drinks or bar food and Tag's for dinner
It pretty much fits all of my criteria for a perfect bar Clean good/affordable drinks private patio friendly staff respectful patrons has karaoke makes it easy to get a cab home
Most of the goods therein are now unencumbered by glass
They have good drink specials and all kinds of stuff going on every day of the week
I said when he plopped the delicious beer on my table
Don't get me wrong I enjoy hanging out with friends drinking and having a good time at Ra but I solely do not go there for the sushi
Occasionally I will be distracted by good hummus or decently priced produce or flowers but really for me it's all about the fact that I can find at least half a dozen great red wines for under 6 bucks
But I also really like good craft beer and unlike most brewery/restaurants I've been to the beer at Oggi's was really really good
Good craft beer - far less expensive than any budweiser I've ever ordered at a restaurant
Service and atmosphere were as previous reviews and worth another trip back though the drinks were very light on alcohol
They also have a decent selection of Mexican goods ranging from salsas and candy to beer and juices
We also had a couple of good glasses of white some excellent salami and crutons and a nice variety of green olives all from the bar
Oregano's also has a pretty good selection of beers a decent wine list and limited hard liquor options
It was like drinking Robitussin and no matter what you ate after nothing tasted good and you coudn't get the taste out
The drinks are good and prices are right for North Scottsdale
Good drinks excellent people watching and goddamn waffle fries
They have veggie options and all kinds of sides and unique drinks and a variety of tasty desserts
No burnt drip just great americanos excellent blended coffee drinks and everything in between
But when we finally did the food was great not your regular pub fare and all the beers were wonderful
The drink selection was vast and both of my drinks were unique and tasty
The price was excellent just over $100 for the room after tax and the concierge level floor was very good they had great appetizers happy hour priced drinks and free softdrinks
Drinks are also made really well and they have a huge variety of good beers and good spirits
For a drink and an appetizer off the Happy Hour Menu we each paid $10 plus tip
For $15 you get a drink chips and salsa an appetizer and a main course
All jabbing aside the beers here are all very distinct and cover a pretty good range
A big glass of beer for a small note always equal a good time
If you want good beer and good bar food with good friends and friendly staff then you are good to go
Not a good place to go for a drink after work
Their cowboy beans were average at best  My wife had the all white meat fried chicken fairly good and lots of it 3 breasts with the bone deep fried but we had to ask for some gravy twice and then received half a shot glass of tasteless milk and flour white gravy enough to sparely cover one breast
Thats okay though the crowd was great and I definitely recommend coming here to grab drinks in the front room area hang with friends or even see a show
Anyway good crowd decent drinks and AWESOME concert venue
Beer selection was good although my hubby was disappointed that they did not have Miller Lite on tap
My pear cider beer was delicious tasted like Sutter Home Moscato wine
I had this drink at Citizen Public House and didn't really care for it but I really enjoyed this one
Since there was a bday they comped a canoli and gave us an extra one for being cool  pitchers are also half off on Thursday's so 7 bucks for 4+ glasses worth of fat tire made us all extremely happy
Making sure everything was good with our food and drinks
Went in here for the first time recently intending to use the appetizer/wine tasting Groupon
I go to Hooter's every now and then with the husband to get some drinks and appetizers
The last experience I had at a Carrabba's in Scottsdale was pretty good so  let's try the one in GlendaleQuickly seated  drinks and appetizer  were great
Their beer selection is constantly changing and they do a pretty darn good job of keeping the crappy beers off there
I've had drinks I've sung karaoke I've listened to some great music I've taken gondola rides and been serenaded only in Italian by the gondolier's operatically trained voices I've eaten dinner at their wonderful restaurant
the view is great the drinks were tasty long island iced tea and the staff mostly attractive
I would highly recommend coming here for a relaxing evening with a fine cigar and glass of scotch I was thoroughly impressed
Don't get me wrong I was going to give them a good review anyway the free beer was just icing on the cake
Beer wine and liquor prices are beyond reasonable  Basically this is the neighborhood restaurant you have been waiting for the place where everything is affordable and delicious and the menu is diverse and balanced enough to keep you coming back a couple times a week
The strawberry fizz drink was delicious and had quite the kick without tasting alcoholic
It helped that this was right near my old house but even if it wasn't i would have traveled far and wide for Wineburger's fries and beefy goodness
I might end up buying some bottles because I thought they were so tasty- the staff knows their stuff- the caprese was great- it has a very laid back attitude when wineries and wine tasting usually exudes this air of elitism- would be cool to have a private party here which they do a lot of- tasting 5 wines for $10 is pretty awesomeCons- it is kinda weird to be the only people in the place no matter what day or time it is- i don't need to watch you put on rubber gloves and make my food you can do that in the back
An extra bonus was  to get to this place during the happy hour 3-6 because the drinks and appetizers were  less expensive so that convinced us to try the Empanadas for the appetizer - yum
Nello's is in the same shopping center so we decided a pizza sounded good - plus they had beer
The service was excellent - we were immediately seated and a server appeared immediately to take our drink orders; brought them right back and took our order
Aside from the quality of their food and coffee drinks the staff is nothing short of amazing
So picky that before I discovered Lox I would only drink the coffee that I made for myself at home because no one else's was good enough
I knew when I was heading to Papago Brewing that I was going to get some good beer
Good stuff all around but go with some of the other beers on tap if you're looking for a classic tasting brew
Although the food and beer were good the service kind of sucked
I think my favorite drink is the 'Old Fashioned' and the Butcher makes a good one
everything I've had has been good quality another interesting touch is coffee ice if you order an iced drink they actually use frozen coffee cubes as the ice so even when the ice melts it doesn't spoil your drink
The juke box is stocked with good tunes there's a patio for smokers and the drinks are cheap
I would recommend having drinks on the outside patio at sunset then enjoy an excellent dinner at the restaurant
The coffee was lukewarm not worth drinking
Have always enjoyed the food and they are good with soft drink refills
They have also done some theme dinners where they pair wine and serve a mutli-course chefs choice menu the one's I've gone to have been outstanding and well worth the price
Beer is really good recommend the sampler--try them all
Beer is still good but now the food is really good
Honestly I liked it a little more before the smoking ban seemed to have more ambiance but it still is a good place for some cheap drinking
With $1 sake and 1/2 of many rolls nigiri and appetizers it's worth eating here from 4-7 or for a late night sushi fix during reverse happy hour
The Rum Bar connected to the restaurant is a nice alternative if you want to skip dinner and enjoy the tasty mixed rum drinks instead
The brick oven table with the wine pairings is a spendy nearly $400 for the 2 of us but worthwhile experience
Dustin was our server for the evening and we enjoyed all the info he shared about the ingredients in the food and the wines
So you can imaging what it will cost for a higher quality wine
Get a pint of beer to wash it down they have a good selection
SKINNY Come here on weekends with a group of friends for an excellent burger and good drinks
There are far too many other restaurants with fantastic delicious food and tasty drinks PLUS FRIENDLY accommodating staff
Plus when they gouge for a drink it's a good drink or a local beer
For me this almost had a creaminess from the round flavor of the peaches this could be my signature drink on any upcoming visits if there weren't so many other choices
One waiter as we paid our bill inexpensive by the way- $30 for drinks appetizer 2 entrees and dessert said that this is the only restaurant he's ever worked in that he still wants to eat the food at the end of the night
The prices were very reasonable the portions big the flavors fantastic and the draft beers thirst-quenching
The Amber Ale available in 21 oz glasses is a good pairing
We all had bought drinks and shared two appetizers but still got out of there for under $120 including the tip
Food highlights were the Escargots & Braised Short Ribs and a truly excellent wine list
Their beer/wine list is limitedbut what they do have is pretty good
The food was pretty darn tootin' good too but the beer
We were greeted warmly by the staff and sat at the bar where we ordered wine and a few appetizer's
Yes it was good- I purchased a corn dog from a vendor that was missing his front teeth and wanted a sip of my beer
I walked in here thinking this is another place that could serve dog shit but if they dress it up with a nice drinks good looking people and a Crate and Barrel catalog it will get 5 stars
It was like drinking lemon flavored tequila
They are known for their wines and they had an extensive wine list of different local wines available which I understand are quite good
Excellent staff amenities drinks service views and luxury
The drinks are excellent and the food is great a little rich and over priced in some areas
The beer was excellent several good interpretations of standard beer types
In sum the food and beer were excellent but this particular waitress was terrible
The House Margarita is pretty excellent and you can refill your glass with the shaker they leave at your table
A fine beverage list of cocktails Arizonan wine and local brew is available as well as some of the most delicious appetizers one could find
I always order the same drink because it's just so good - iced almond milk mocha
They have good cheap wines excellent salads and tasty appetizers
The drinks were good and the baked goods looked amazing
The prices I think are a little inflated for their attachment to the Squaw Peak Hilton but as a regular you figure out that the flour chips and salsa fill you up VERY well and a couple of cold beers/margarita's go a long way with an appetizer and can be considered a meal
Only had the bruschetta and wine but wasn't overly impressed with this place
The beers coming in giant schooners the prices are good and they have a guy who places great sing-a-long acoustic guitar on a regular basis
This place is small and didn't have a good selection of beer or liquor
The produce is always fresh they have an interesting selection of frozen items including some great appetizers the meat department is outstanding - I've tried a few different kabobs from here spicy kabob rocks bakery is great nice selection of hard to find dairy items like fig yogurt fair cheese selection including a local fresh burrata and mozzarella that will knock your socks off excellent selection of wines and craft beer and a floral department that has exquisite arrangements
Their tequila options are wonderful allowing for creative margaritas or a fine neat glass of 100% pure agave goodness
$2I washed all that down with a large glass of sweet yet delicious orange juice
We wanted to get some drinks but we were unable to because the place was so crowded which is why I gave it two stars instead of one don't know how good the drinks may be
Add on a few drinks between the two of us and it was SO MUCH FOOD BUT OMGAHD SO GOOD
There was a hint of possibly white wine which was nice; however it did not have much of a cheese flavor and no garlic at all
It is worth a try though you never know you might end up with some accidental hire that is actually nice and can refill your drinks in a timely manner
I know this is a kid friendly place during the day but for goodness sakes make them behave
Also the lychee infused vodka drink was amazing and strong
nut brown very good pale ale hoppy and floral amber ale malty my favorite hefeweizen a good basic wheat beer and a red ale good blend of malt and hops my husbands favorite
We were seated right away but we waited about twenty minutes to get our drinks and another thirty minutes to get our appetizer
We asked for our daughters sake if we could have her food first after the appetizer and that did not occur
They also have a lot of really good beers
By the time we left around 9pm the drinking crowd was there and ready to have a good time
I had a beer a shot and a DELICIOUS Italian Chicken salad
There was a good selection of champagnes wines and drinks
If you want to have great conversation over some amazing wine Bomberos patio is one of the best in the valley
She was very good about refilling our drinks & asked how everything was
They have a reasonable dinner menu special for Monday night and it's good to pass the time while waiting for the manicure and to sober you up while drinking the martini's
After the National Anthem finished playing it always plays every time I eat there but this particular time I was solo I was serve a Lebanese beer Almaza or something like that that the owner recommended to go with my dish which he also recommended
The bartender made a good Manhattan for my sweetie and I enjoyed my V-Day special drink which was a prickly pear-flavored Cosmo
At the conclusion of the meal however I realized that the full-bodied wine's flavor had changed to something more well saline
He declined politely but when we explained that the flavor of the wine was now off he poured a small taste off the floor
Again the wine's flavor changed and really enhanced the toffee flavor of the little cake
Please Scottsdale you're getting good prices for your wines in restaurants serve them at the proper temperature
I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes to eat drink and be in a loud environment
Their Happy hour during the week is good 2-4-1's on drinks 1/2 off apps
Surprisingly a table was ready to go for us so we sat  and enjoyed some wine for them and a mimosa for me
The mac and cheese and baked beans were pretty good and the homemade root beer was excellent
I almost forgot but the drink I had was amazing
Also tried their mojito at the party which I would have never ordered since I generally go their for the wine selection but it was delicious
Enter Boston's$4 32 oz beers $5 filling appetizers an open neighborhood bar atmosphere and hyper friendly servers
We got a few drinks from their AMAZING soda selection
Our total bill for 3 glasses of sangria and 2 appetizers came out to $33
