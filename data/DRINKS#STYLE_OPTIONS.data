We did have room for a glass of port nice liquor selection btw and an order of their banana creme brule which was a nice end to a nice meal

- Seating It's not a large space but I always manage to find a seat - Beer selection is awesome- Good lighting/atmosphereThe bad- You can't take your beer outside on the porch/outdoor area- Hipsters please kill yourself- Staff please read above statement be nice to people even if we aren't artists/emo/punk/goth
What Panne Bianco gets right is -quick polite but personalized service-a great short menu with no surprises-great to go options-big portions when a sandwich and a drink cost $12 it better be good-close to my work wishing they would move into my work's cafe space-its right by lux-its food that any single person could make at home with a sandwich press but doesn't b/c high quality bread and the like go bad too soonthe somewhat bad-wierd hours and parkingkinda high pricesno place to sit and wait
Their signiture drinks are not Happy Hour prices but there is something for everyone on the menu

On the upside I counted 7 different kinds of sake on the menu
its nice with alot of good wines on the list

I heard through Facebook of the excellent food and great selection of beers gotta tell you we were not disappointed the food was soooo good that several members of our party requested to meet the chef our waiter went to the kitchen and soon we were speaking with chef Diego what a true professional who took the time to explain the dishes and their origins
We started with cocktails and our server recommended a drink not listed on the menu; a cherry lemon drop

Olive oil to die for with the bread amazing wine selection mouth watering food

With phenomenal wines on the menu dishes filled with a melange of delicious flavors and fresh ingredients and their bread is some of the best I've ever had

From the local draft beers to the great menu and original entrees to ending with flavored cotton candy it has never disappointed
The look and ambience of the Roosevelt with their beer selection and presentation makes for a wholly enjoyable experience
/Vegas price point for drinks this is a place that should be on your short list

Chintzy retro-ish juice glasses were used the Pinot Noir only 1 selection per category was ok
Tonight I found fresh seafood that was prepared just the way I like it-fried with extra sides of tartar sauce cocktail sauce coleslaw mayo not red and a healthy selection of domestic beer
The drink menu which you can only order from is nice but really doesn't cater to those that don't like sweet drinks
A great selection of draught beer and bottles
Our server was very knowledgeable about wines and helped me make a great choice -- I concur with Natalie the pour was generous
We noted that they had a pretty interesting beer selection both on draft and in bottles which he said he rotates fairly frequently

We used to come here for dinner once a week also but since they took the stuffed poblano off them menu we really only come for drinks and apps
I would imagine that one of these pizzas and a good glass of wine which they have a large selection of would make for a nice evening of food wine and conversation

The drink menu is creative and I LOVE the beer selection

I feel like the limited beer and wine menu keeps the frat boys out and the 'normals' in
The wine selection is ok but the waiter didn't really know the nuances  between the wine by the glass yet
Gave us a drink menu then took a full 10 minutes to come back
The beer selection is good not great but they rotate drafts quite often which is nice

With the closing of Bomberos/Verde/My Florist the burning of Richardsons  the crowds at Postino the valet only at the Vig the lack of fresh salads at the Garage cold warm food at Local Breeze and the disappointing service at Arrogant Butcher - this place moved quickly up to a top choice for dinner and drinks
Bottom line get your beverage to go and be sure to use a Gold Bar punch card -- buy 9 drinks and get your next one your choice for $1
The wine selection is incredibly extensive but our waiter knew exactly what would go well with our dinners
i ordered the 6 course tasting menu with wines paired
The service was largely spot on and attentive without being annoying the wine and beer list was sufficient and the for the price it's a steal

It took a while to get a server to clean some unidentified stickiness off of our table bring menus and take a drink order and about then the table next to ours got LOUDER w/the addition of an off-duty server confirmed by asking our server wearing a Rose & Crown shirt and another woman identified as the girlfriend of one of the owners

We had asked a few people to send someone out to take our order and the table next to us that had been seated after us had gotten menus and drinks
The five of us sat there trying to talk over the sounds of our gurgling stomachs as we waited for about a half hour without menus drinks or any indication we were going to get served

Lots of unique drinks on the menu recommended for quieter times

BUTIf you are a *new* bartender don't upsell me a handmade margarita with Cuervo instead of your house concoction that comes out of a tap  use the small side of the jigger to pour said tequila into one of those ridiculous tiny cactus margarita glasses haphazardly salted expect me to pay $6 for tiny little glass and crappy pour and somehow appreciate that you have any understanding of what it means to make a good margarita - you know one where the orange from the triple sec lightly dances with the tequila flavors rising above the  sweet and sour and the tang of fresh lime juice - especially when you still haven't given me a menu and are now serving jiggerless poured Crown and diets and Jack and diets to your 21 and a half-year old friends who are leaning all over the bar with slithering arrogance and no sense of personal space yes I can smell your drugstore perfume and no it doesn't make you pretty

Server got our drinks and we took our time reviewin the menu
Hanny's drink menu has more options than eTrade so obviously I freaking love it

In fact I don't even WORK there and I still find ways to bring up Hanny's drink menu in regular conversation
They had a small wine list that was half off for that night -- as a nightly special
The menu can be arranged in several ways served a la carte in full portions or arranged in tasting menus of various combinations paired with wines and smaller in size

They've got a pretty interesting wine selection I'd like to try but I'm not sure how well that would go with my breakfast sandwich or boss

The beer selection both on tap and by the bottle is incredibly impressive and the list of appetizers is almost as long not really but you get my point
For being a wine bar I thought the wine menu was on the small side
Beer selection was limited to about 6 choices
The waitresses outside who kept looking our way didnt bring us over a menu or take our drink orders until 9
And not that their beer list is bad it just pales in comparison to some other local bars but they serve hard alcohol which the other local bars lack
The pros - good experience lots of menu choices good food smells wonderfulThe cons - poor parking you will be a little crowded $10 guacamole and $11 glass of sangria
first we sat at a small table along the wall and found to our dislike that the enormous speakers pumping out the bass was right behind us made for a slightly freakhouse feel but this was easily remedied we sat ourselves at the bar and were quite satisfied with the drinks he Stella Artois me Mojito and the Margharita pizza - roman style the menu says - it's on flat bread
This place was nothing special thats for sure good wine list though and the bar area did look fun unfortunately we didn't both to stay and check that out
Craft beer selection is nice with quite a few local beers although they never seem to have anything from Old World Brewery dammit
Wine selection is excellent if you are bargain shopping and they do carry a few mid-higher grade wines
You can get decent value wines much like you would at Trader Joe's with a good selection of countries available and they often have an impressive selection of organic/biodynamic wines if that's your thing
It's also go a fairly decent wine selection and if you buy a bottle they'll uncork it in the store so you can drink while you eat there

The waitress had a nifty hand-written updated list she kept with her and while I'm not a beer man I can appreciate the effort in something like that
Only irritation is the inaccurate beer menu on the tables

2 The first thing you see on the menu are fresh healthy fruit drinks then at the bottom of the list they say add a shot of vodka for $3
They expanded their beer menu carry wine guest taps and it seems like the beers are just better overall now

Sure the beer is great but if you're a wine drinker like myself be ready to settle for one of the daily selections posted on the chalkboard
It is located in a strip mall on Scottsdale Road toward Tempe in a strip mall as most of the good restaurants in the area are Walking in it is a bit confusing as you go through AZ Wine which is a very large wine store with a great selection of Sake Wine Half Bottles Craft Beer Aventinus so turn to your left and there you will see the dining area if no one is immediatly there someone will pop up shortly as there are only two people working the front of the house

I liked this place in previous years when their selection was more focused on the quality craft beers

This has a pretty great selection of crafted beers drinks and other items
Was greeted by a server after a few minutes and brought back drink and food menu

A more extensive selection of wines by the glass would be a nice compliment to the place
The quirky name drew me in but the craft beer selection is what really won me over
The menu is mainly Greek but after four hours of drinking I opted for a grilled cheese sandwich and french fries
Any how this place is pretty fun its open till 2 in the morn which is a big plus in my book the tap beer is extensive but in a beer snob way its kinda boring
Love the wine and beer selection and all their unusual desserts and snacks they carry
+  A really good drink menu+ A great happy hour+ Great atmosphere- Long wait for a table even when several tables are empty this has been the case for me on several occasions but luckily not last nightWait staff is hit or miss - luckily our server last night was fine although he didn't have much personality- Tables really close together both inside and outIn my case the positives really outweigh the negatives
To wash it down you can check out their extensive wine list
Besides the superb atmosphere the wine list is nothing short of incredible
My first time and I was not familiar with the beer selection
Pros - Great beer selection constantly changing and you can tell the owners have a serious passion for the topic
When it comes to single bottle beer selection Total Wine is where it's at
Sure they're both big box liquor stores but if you prefer a less fluorescent and industrial place to purchase your spirits with low prices and huge selection choose Total Wine
Wine by the glass draft beer and well liquor listed in the drink menu is all half off as are Bud Light and Coors Light bottles
Extensive wine selection will cost you significantly more although they have a selection of some reds and whites from $12-15 a bottle

After the Grand Opening I'll return to see how they're doing as a winebar with full menu and I imagine my star rating will reach 5
We were seated promptly our drink orders taken and we were left for about a minute or two to peruse the menu
Here are a couple menus and the beer list is right here
to discover they messed up the beer choices in the bucket
Much of the wine list looks like it's taken straight from the shelves at the local Fry's market
Good food lots of TVs with games on fun atmosphere - but where you can still talk nice outdoor seating with misters on those hotter than hell days and an amazing beer list

Service was awesome and the menu/drink selection is nice as well
Nice selection of desserts and gotta love that they have both beer and wine in individual size bottles

They have a large selection of drinks including retro style sodas to regular fountain drinks and even one of my favorites Sobe diet
The wine list is sufficient and the service adequate
There is also large selection of helper products - cheeses crackers spreads cups glasses gift sets etc
In some ways it embodies a European sensibility--the communal dining small menu limited drink menu rustic decor and the uber-gracious hostess who went out of her way to save a table for our large party when I called ahead are all reminiscent of places I've been in Europe where dining is about simple flavors good wine and great conversation
After this visit I highly doubt I will ever return to any ra location out of my own pure choice and would most likely frown upon someone having the idea to go unless its for happy hour on sake
Our party ordered a couple bottles of well priced wines along with a bruschetta selection
The wine selection was excellent but the food needed just a little tweaking
The beer selection here is impressive and seems to be quite a draw since I got the impression that the crowd here was suitably beer-literate

Appropriate wine list to compliment the menu selection
We selected the wine pairing along with the tasting menu
I have about 30 different choices when it comes to the cheap-drink+bar food combo in my hood

This place has the typical bar food and a good selection of beer
The bar menu has many Spanish cocktails none of which I tried and they give you olives and nuts while you have your drinks

Will definitely be back - and I have plans on working my way through the happy hour drink list
I even skip my usual drink of choice to order the Scottsdale Cocktail yup friggin' awful name but the citrusy goodness in this glass is just too hard to resist
I have come to believe that most of us generally desire that unique union of a robust menu composed of carefully planned and executed dishes with a splash of unique drinks a dazzling wine selection excellent service that offer suggestions to round out a dining experience and finally an atmosphere that lets us focus on our palette not our survival instincts
Another downside is they have no soda fountain so you are forced to pace the 20oz drink of choice from the cooler
and I never actually saw a menu but from what I gather the place is totally popular based off the amount of people and the wait I was told about also that they have a great beer list also a full bar and some wonderful orange special sauce that you definitely need to dip your french fries and whatever else in
The wine list is vast so 5 stars for that
I have sampled a few of their specialties on the drink menu and they are all quite good even if they are way overpriced
Also beware although the childrens' menu says drinks included in the entree price of $6

The wine and beer list is well-curated the staff is attentive and the carefree pace continues throughout the night
Their wine deals are great a $5 a glass and their lunch menu was good
I'd eat and drink just about anything on the menu and I'd be sure to leave full drunk and without a huge hold in my wallet

I'd go back to Yardstick again simply because I like beer a lot and do like their selection

The selection is fairly limited but I would even recommend Bar Bianco as a place to spot just have a drink in a cool spot so long as you have an excuse to be downtown when you do

3 stars for the sandwich and added star for the beer selection

The wine list is very extensive most of which is in the bottles that they offer not in the wines by the glass

The wine list is pretty impressive too and I'm not just saying that because they had my favorite Cliff Lede Cabernet
Huge selection of craft beer the cool thing is you can buy any of them in just a single bottle to see if you like it not end up with a 6 pack that you really have to fight it to drink it down
They have an extensive beer collection with different options from all over the world
The prices were great on the drinks but the margarita was an awful choice
Fresh flowers + great selection of wine and cheese + all the essentials They deal is that they cut out the middle man to get great prices for quality products and they don't have sales because they always sell their products at the best price possible
The wine list is comprehensive for both the white and red wine enthusiasts and the servers are willing to make recommendations off of the list from their cellar
In addition to the wine choices the bruschetta is awesome
Good place for under 30 and killer beer selection on tap Gulden Drak on Tap
If only that selection of beer could be somewhere else

from the yummy fresh warm bread to the salad with the awesome shaved tomato pieces to my HOMEMADE chicken alfredo which was most definitely the best Ive ever had in my life and the raspberry cheesecake everything was just absolutely amazingthe service was great and the wine selection was HUGE
The wine selection as you'd expect is very good
Gilbert if you like a wine list of literally ten wines a menu consisting of bread and bread byproducts 40 year old Gilbert moms trying to look cool and whiffing the smell of a far greater restaurant next door i
Their wine list is less insignificant then Tim Meadows's career
OK so me and a few friends went here for a few drinks and maybe to talk to some ladies or possibly trannys my friend Sean is all into that and i say don't knock it till u try it anyway we sat at the bar and waited for our list of beers when all of a sudden a man/petifile crept out of the shadows gliding towards us as if he was wearing heelies or he was a fucking vampire
The liquor choice were impressive but the martinis were skimpy
In order to stream line the ordering process and saving themselves the problem of having to memorize exactly whats on tap they have a beer folder with a list of the beers on tap listing Brewery Name Location Beer Name Beer style

They carry a decent selection of wines - having sampled quite a few I've decided that the least expensive ones taste best

The wine list is nice and the cocktails are inventive
Great selection of sodas and other drinks definitely try a strawberry limeade
The food here is good the drink menu is extensive which is always a must for me and the scene was pretty good
So anyway - in spite of this place having great wine selections at reasonable prices considering the cost of the food great pretzel bread the illusion of great service and good food when they allow you to order it I won't be going back
He explained some of his favorite items on the menu and suggested some great drinks

The bartenders were super friendly and offered up a lot of great information about the drinks and the food menu

Their sashimi is always top notch their drink specials great and their selection of rolls are too many to mention
Actually Tops and Sun Devil  have an even bigger selection and the beer is available at a much better price

My meal of choice at the Capital Grille two Pineapple Stoli Martinis and their bread
I'd say the best thing about Cowboy Ciao is their extensive wine menu
They have one of the largest wine lists that I've ever seen
Great food good service and awesome wine list gives Cowboy Ciao five stars
So if you're into drinking this may be an amazing stop for you with its huge list of tequila if not you can probably find better food elsewhere with about the same prices

The waitress was nice when she finally showed up answered questions about the menu but then never bothered to refill our drinks for the rest of our time there
First the dislikesWine list  Not a big selection
limited wine list and we would up at Rokerijj for after dinner drinks
Their selection of wine is always a delight and service is bolting fast
All flavors of hummus are great and usually some decent wine choices
The other thing I didn't like was that you had to *buy* bottled water if that was your drink of choice
They also have a good Happy Hour menu with a lot of variety and $2 draft beer
It's called Garage the menu items seem to be aimed more towards an Uptown kind of crowd and when my husband ordered a coke the server brought him a glass of ice with a can of coke on the side
He offered us the great happy hour menu which included some of the better Green Chile Stew I have had $5 glasses of wine that you can't beat
what was impressive however was their beer selection
The drinks menu was quite good and some very interesting cocktails
So many other delicious choices - even for people who aren't hardcore tea-drinkers - you'll even find something you love here
Happy Hour drinks were well priced $3 beers $6 wine and martinis with a decent choice of libations
The wine list was a bit disappointing with very few worthwhile bottles under $50
Ordering our wine was a bit of a process as they were out of a Syrah I wanted off the main list and the alternatives suggested by the server and the little-too-annoying sommelier were not doing much for us
They have a decent selection of beers my favorite is the Left Hand milk stout
I really enjoy the free breakfast nothing fancy but it's a nice to have for sure and the small lobby area bar is great - beer wine and a great tasting selection of bar type food
Some bright spots remain half price drinks and apps during happy hour cool outdoor patio when it's warm and a menu refresh that includes skewers that are really really good
and the food and beer selection is good too
Four Peaks has a great beer selection and an outdoor patio that is quite nice in the spring/summer/fall/even winter because this is Arizona isn't it
The wine list is fantastic; you would be very hard-pressed to find more tightly allocated wines on a list
Kosta Browne in abundance Leonetti wines Seasmoke Pinot Noir; great Spanish selections and 2nd growth Bordeaux at less than $100; don't even get me started on the Bond and the Harland
One thing that gave me a great impression up front was the awesome beer selection they carry mainly local microbrew products from Grand Canyon Brewing Four Peaks Oak Creek etc
It is expensive no lie especially if you are drinking a glass of their huge selection of wines and they even have an alcohol cart that comes around with the good stuff
They have a very wide selection of teas to choose from and if you ask they will bring out the tea chest to show you the different blended varieties in glass jars
Lots of nigiri rolls beer/sake and appetizers to choose from on that menu
The Lost Leaf already had the best beer selection in The Valley but they recently added a small draft selection including the delicious locally brewed Four Peaks Oatmeal Stout

My cork-dork friends like the wine list and I like the cocktails
very hip- good selection of wines- excellent friendly serviceNot so much- food was good but not as interesting as other wine bars we frequent- too many kids
*Cosmetics/Bathroom = ok selection*Rice = several kinds*Snacks = plenty*Dried stuff = plenty Curry Dried Seaweed etc*Frozen stuff = good amount Natto Udon Ramen Tsukemono etc*Drinks = good selection of Japanese soft drinksThe one complaint I have is that they don't have fresh fruits or vegetables
I'm assuming everyone was there for the Smart Shopper deal for 1/2 off menu items excluded the drinks and desserts
They have several drink specials I didn't listen after I saw the juicers at the bar and heard orange slice martini 3
There is a selection of wines and sake here as well but do this place justice and drink a beer
The stadium had a decent selection of craft beers but I had to walk to the outfield to get it

While waiting for our food I wandered back to the retail area to check out the beer and scotch selections my beverages of choice
I had a 3 dollar mimosa and Nick had a mixed drink on the menu with gin
Knowing the Southern influence of the menu we figured it would be appropriate to have a drink and an appetizer while pouring over the details
I think this location has a somewhat small but interesting wine selection but my real purpose for this review is to talk about the cheese shop
The wine list is incredible - and there are almost always specials going on so you can try something new without breaking the bank
Heavy on wood - both reclaimed and polished - constituting everything from the floors to the tables to the open rafters of the ceiling I was greeted quickly upon seating by a young man named Spencer who along with a female bartender were apparently the only persons working front of the house that afternoon and with the menu presented I spent a few minutes perusing as Pearl Jam played over head and with my decisions largely made before I even entered the door I had a full glass of water and my order placed by the time the song ended and progressed to Radiohead; to say the least I agreed with Praying Monk's recent nomination for best restaurant soundtrack
A long day of dining behind me and dinner yet to go I hope Praying Monk is turning better business on other days of the week-my guess is that it'd be an awesome place to watch some College Football in the coming months particularly given the quality of the food and beer list if you're into that
The wine room is small but good and fairly well stocked with a good variety of wines though a measly wine by the glass selection for a fairly impressive cellar
My favorite part of their menu is their organic beer selection
Great wine list too- Apothic Red is one of a few reds I like and they have it
I will definitely be going back here in the future to try their seasonal beers they were in between seasons when I went buy fresh-brewed beer to take home and try some more of their delectable menu
Not only did they have a good beer selection but the bar keep ZackI think that was his name I had several pints is a beer sommelier one of about 3 I've ever encountered here in the Valley
Their wine list is unique affordable and offers something for everyone
The gentleman working there I apologize that I didn't catch his name didn't waste time having me try on pair after pair of glasses - he asked what I was looking for and then listened to my response found a couple of options and I was on my way very happy and looking good
We purchased the coupon on Travel Zoo; a predetermined chef's menu was presented with the wine list as we sat down

It took her at least half an hour to come back and check on us at which point she didn't note our empty glasses and listlessly said something vague about how she didn't know when our food would be out
The wine list was very minimal and the very limited bar didn't help
I can't help but compare this place to my favorite tapas place in the valley Sol y Sombra in the DC Ranch where they have a huge selection of fantastic wine and a full bar and a huge selection of delicious and much larger portioned tapas for the same price
The beer selection was good and the service was okay
Great cheese selection awesome jam packed menu cool drink list
They have a pretty decent selection of food and we all seemed to enjoy our fare nothing special just your typical bar food and they offer mini pitchers of beer I love that
So friends- an hour for our food from time of order food that wouldn't even be good if we waited only 5 mins for it and sucky wine choices
What this place does have good drink selection OK prices and big bathrooms good security and a descent stage
Our waitress who must have barely been 18 promoted savignon blanc from Spain maybe that exists somewhere but not on their wine list and food was coming out undercooked meaning raw chicken to tables around us
To a realist the glass is always full - half with water half with air
We waited for a table had to grab our own menus waited for drinks etc
David is also great with his wine selection

I didn't imbibe but the selection was pretty standard fare rum scotch tequila vodka and looked decently priced at least according to the drink menu
The beer selection is great - including the brews on tap
Nothing too special about the place - the wine list is OK and the bruchetta is really good but besides that
The waitress came back to tell me that they were out of one of the alcohols to make it and if I could order something else off the drink menu
would come here almost just for the fantastic beer list - local brews Kilt Lifter Oak Creek Nut Brown Ale pale ales stouts
It may be the big box store of alcohol and I'm not sure how knowledgable the employees are about their product as they would be in a small wine shop but the prices and selections are hard to beat
They seem to be able to incorporate different malbecs in their wine list which is a super plus for me
The beer list was amazing and props for using correct glassware for each beer
We would go back for a few beers maybe try something else small off the menu but at this point I would be hesitant to order a full meal or bring a bunch of people in to eat
Really what is better than a bar that has a decent beer selection lets you watch live hockey AND lets you grill your own steak freeof charge

I ordered a draft of one to try and then she handed me a menu - which actually had beer descriptions on it
The service was decent and the place has pretty good drinks so I may stop in again to give something off of their menu another try
The cost of the flatbread did include choice of beer or mimosa so that helped the cause
Personally I don't care that they don't serve liquor they have a GREAT beer selection
Good  varied beer selection all bottle though and they usually have good musical guests
Not a good selection of wine by the glass
The beer selection is great and I appreciate that
The drink menu was a little weird since it looked like an elementary school scrapbook but we didn't really refer to it much since Chris was quick to throw up options once we told him what we liked and didn't like
She was friendly and brought us full menus and offered us drinks
Excellent selection of beer wine and booze
A large wine selection that is varied in quality price and regions
they do have filtered selections but that's more of a fire water than sake
Extensive wine list paired with an equally extensive on-tap & bottled beer list

They have an entertaining menu and their drinks specials during happy hour is awesome

Neither my guest or I were blown away by the favors of the food but the drink menu and atmosphere were wonderful
Sidebar has a great drink menu--Belgian beers galore decent wine selection and amazing signature drinks
Also I should note that I keep using quotes around the word bar because they only had a few beers on tap and a wine list
When I asked the young energetic bartender what the specials were during happy hour she happily recited a long list of bargains including domestic and imported beers wine margaritas and cocktails
Carly's is a really great place to drink some yummy small brewery or Belgian beer and have a snack or a sandwich while listening to live music
They get major points for delicious food with limited kitchen capabilities for a really cool vibe and for the best beer and drink list that I know of in all of Phoenix
Listening to myself next time on both desserts and drinks
They are always out of at least half of the beers on their menu
For one only 2 bottles of wine are offered whereas Postino gives you a choice of ANY FREAKING BOTTLE OFF THEIR MENU
While there's not a huge selection of beers on tap care has been taken when choosing which beers to offer
A chalkboard shows the list of wines they offer -and they have some great ones

2 The beer selection is incredible full of tasty imports and domestics both on tap and in bottles
On the positive side the selection of wine and beers is pretty extensive the produce is fresh with quite a few organic choices
Their beer selection is not large but it's a fairly decent selection
But we have concluded 1 Rokerij does offer good food - but they are slightly over priced for the quality 2 the professionalism was seriously lacking in service presentation of the wine list focused on the price and not the taste pallets and 3 they should get their ego in check - I get that you have a long list of people waiting for tables at your restaurant - but the next time I have a special event I will be going to one of the dozens of restaurants in the valley and receive the level of service that should come with the ambiance and food
Four Peaks is an excellent establishment because they have wonderful food a very robust beer selection brewed on site and incredible atmosphere

I had to go to Whole Foods to complement Total Wine's selection
But - at the same time I think I'd rather go to Trader Joes and grab a bottle of wine if I can - small selection but they have the kind I like there and I don't have to walk the immense aisles of Total Wine but they're amazing - don't think I don't like TW I'm a huge fan
As far as drinks there's a decent sake menu but seriously who's gonna shell out for something more expensive than Sho Chiku Bai at a place like this

Beer Their beer selection on tap is magnificent
When she returned with drinks I asked if there was a drink menu I could look at since I hadn't made up my mind about what I wanted yet and without even looking at me she just shook her head and started rattling off ALL the drinks in the bar in one breath which wasn't really what I was asking for

Everything is so fresh and they've got a nice selection of wine

While the bar offers a nice selection of wine the Beer menu is the real star at the Roosevelt so if your idea of a nice drink doesn't involve hops and yeast you may want to go somewhere else to imbibe
9 Did I mention that many interesting regional beers and monthly regional choices are on the menu in addition to those on draft
I believe a nice wine list is featured here as well
They also have a hot food stations that serve rotating dishes of various pasta sweet and baked potatoes pizza multiple breads and muffins desserts drinks and a 6-7 choice soup bar that's outstanding
Before I hit the food and drink I must say that the service was stellar extremely knowledgeable regarding the menu perfect timing in table visits beverages constantly cleared/refilled and a perfect dose of information and interaction
A comprehensive wine list that might be weighted a little too much on the high end on the French side but plenty of good California choices in the affordable range

Yes they have an extensive list of specialty drinks
The beer list is also a great selection which is what I eventually turned to

I don't think you can make a bad choice off the menu - they have mac and cheese on a hot dog for Pete's Sake
Pours on the drinks were generous and no one balked when I asked to modify my dinner selection - in fact Paul stopped by to confirm and just set expectations about how he would prepare my meal - a Hawaiian butter fish - which was excellent and the best part of my meal
The wine selection is fabulous and this is not just a place for dinner
Sadly the menu gave very little description of the brews and although the bartenders may have had answers it was difficult enough to get their attention let alone ask about the beers
The drink menu is good and if you do not find what you like there you are more then welcome to get a drink at the bar next door and bring it over

After being seated we were quickly given bread and water but then we waited for approx 7 minutes before a drink menu or food menu was provided
The wine list is interesting and reasonably-priced
Decent wine selections and decent pricesI've also found talent at Terroir
And they have a good selection of bottled beers including a local organic brew
They have a few local beers available but for me I would prefer a little larger selection
The wait for the food wasn't bad either but I hate when you as the customer have to ask for a wine list because your wine was empty for 10 minutes but the waiter didn't ask if you wanted anything else because he was focused on the table of 5 women next to us sharing an appetizer
The beers keep running out - it is a rotating selection they are not running out they are changing
I love the beer selection I love that I haven't heard of most of them
We enjoyed the Wine & Bruschetta Special where you have the choice of a bottle of house wine and four selections of bruschetta all for $20 after 8pm

Their beer list is pretty descent by my standards and the food seems to get better with each visit

Also considering the food they're serving and the prices the wine list is suprisingly uninspired

My first shout out goes to the wine list - it is impressive
I will even go so as far to say that it is the best wine list I've seen in the valley to date

To which the server replies that beer is not on the happy hour menu
Also you guys were out of my first 2 beer selections and had to decline me on another that again wasnt on the happy hour price

The wine list is extensive however I think they should add more low range wines in the $25-$35 range to their list

The beer selection was great as well with beers I usually don't find elsewhere
Great location and staff and great selection of drinks as well as free wi-fi
I asked what kind of beer they had on tap and instead of telling me he pointed at a book on the other end of the table and said the list was inside it
When I opened the drink menu there was only like 5 or 6 beers on tap so why did I have to go to the other end of the table to get the menu instead of him just telling me what my options were

I am a tea drinker so I was a bit disappointed with their tea selection
Positives  decent beer/wine selection I liked the atmosphere open air bar & grill type of placeNegatives  bad service mediocre food pricey dinner entrees kind of a boring menuWill I go there again

We ordered a very good sake from their extensive sake menu to accompany the meal
There's a good selection of beer and wine and an almost impossible-to-choose-from selection of pizzas
We received our drinks menus napkins with silverware at 530pm
We were totally ignored for 4 hours and 45 minutes with our watered down drinks menus and rolled up silverware in napkins sitting on the bar in front of us
The wine menu was sparse but come-on the real reason you are there is for the entertainment
After being to Zinburger last week and having tested out a lot of great places in the area we will for sure keep this place on our list of fun burger joints and are excited to returnOh and happy hour is 330-630 so half off appetizers and we got some great beer specials

Drinks here are your typical bar drinks with a limited selection on happy hour but enough to find something
The beer selection is limited which surprised me considering it was in Scottsdale
I liked the atmosphere and the beer list was really great
The wine list is mind blowing expensive and out of keeping for the restaurant I wasn't exactly spoilt for choice as I looked for wines in the $80-125 range
The decor is minimalistic and could actually benefit with another mural but overall its a comfortable easy place to grab a beer and eat a deviled egg
so it stay pretty active and keeps you entertained and they have a pretty wide selection of alcohol so don't stray bc you don't think they can deliver when it comes to drinks cause that's far from the truth
They have tons of tv's decent food and a pretty good beer selection
Speaking of service sitting at my table waiting for a server to take my drink order i was able to read the entire menu but when i have to ask for a refill on my tea from the hostess that's bad
Beer selection was a bit sparse for my tastes didn't look at the wine list
Although there were only four or five table filled It took at least 10 minutes for a waitress to show up - no menus in hand - to see if we wanted a drink
The less than perfect rating was that I saw people with mimosas/champagne and while I had been offered something to drink I figured I could just choose water or coffee as that is usually is what at hair salons I wasn't informed of my choices by the front desk staff
This seems like a wise choice for meeting with friends for drinks or  hanging out with your mom
One star for the unbelievable wine selection
After about five minutes our waitress came over with drink menus told us the kitchen was closed but the bar was still open
Canteen one ups La Bocca in fact because there are menu items included in happy hour 50% off most drinks and select food items

outside of water my choices are sugar drinks or beer
I have no qualms about ordering the French Canadian Hefeweizen that I can't even pronounce spell or at this moment recall with one glass all to myself and lick my lips at many other brews on the menu
Add a wine list beyond belief and liquor if its your poison too
They usually have decent fish that is on their specials menu buy you have to remember that this is a beer company so don't get too crazy
Three dollars for a pretty good selection of draft beers is almost unbeatable
I love that the drink choices include sasparillo flavored teas and creme sodas
Beer selection is great wines not so bad and plenty of choices of hard alcohol to make any concoction that keeps you happy
I love a good rum drink no doubt but I don't like the idea that I need three drinks to have a full run of the menu
Nice selection of beers on tap and in bottles
We decided to try this place for restaurant week as they allow you to choose ANY app entree and dessert from their menu PLUS a glass of wine for $30
Their wine selection is great and they have a little floral area that has beautiful and inexpensive arrangements
I thought the wine list was great and has a nice range of wines and prices for both glasses and bottles
All the wines are $5 a glass until 6pm which makes it an outstanding choice for lunch and happy hour
I think they have a casual loungy wine bar vibe  that definitely suits the decor and most of the menu as opposed to a more upscale and elitist feel at wine bars like Kazimierz
I will definitely be back to have more wine and see what direction they decided to go with the menu
After thoroughly examining the menu and choosing our drinks our appetizer and our entrees we had still not even seen a waiter or even received glasses of water
Anyways we each got a glass of wine easy peasy and we started to peruse the menu
They have a wonderful wine list too - extensive and not outrageously priced
love the atmosphere food is OK beer was cold price is a little high for what you get menu is too big quality of food is OK
We sat outside on the patio on a Saturday night listened to live music and shared some wine and food
Their selection of beer is focused and somewhat limited but still very good choices for any palate
The rest of the people in my party enjoyed various mojitos from the drink menu and no one was disappointed
There were only about 5 other people in the place which is good because I like to have my choice of seat and don't like to wait for drinks and service
After tasting more than 3/4 of their menu I have yet to taste a single thing that wasn't perfectly cooked perfectly spiced or perfectly paired with their exquisite red wine gravy
Top notch service beautiful interior and their wine list kicks ass
The beer selection was good but you can get half of it in a store
Great selection of beers on tap and a great bar
She took our drink orders and left us with menus to look over
That said I haven't tried their namesake sandwich but it is on the to-do list
Yes the sandwiches are kind of expensive no they don't have a huge drink selection and yes you have to sit outside on a picnic table
Extensive wine list with a few by-the-glass selections written on the chalkboards each night
From a couple of weeks back we were more looking for a place that did beer first and then the food would be ice to have  Early Oktoberfest seemed to be the theme as they were stuffing kraut onto into and around everything on the fly out menus but it was pretty much just the shape of kraut andunsurprisinglynowhere near what passes for it when it's been made by people that care
The menu was concise and paired well with the beers we selected
Didn't get to try too much of the food but what I did try the mac and cheese was really yummy and the wine selection wasn't bad and the fact that they had happy hour certainly doesn't hurt either
oh and just so you know they have the same wine distributor guy as the fabled Postino- we are talking some seriously awesome wine choices
Beverages - good selection of affordable wines and specialty drinks
The selection of drink flavors and burger toppings is certainly not lacking
There was a great selection of wine and beer I think  however they don't have a full bar
The wine list is lengthy and  the staff is knowledgable about the wines and how to best pair them with the dishes
- The drinks a decent wine selection and a nice variety of signature cocktails
A whole wall of specialty beers rows on fabulous wines and a great aisle of liquor and yummy choices to mix that with
The menu mentions that shots of beer what is known as samplers in most every other craft brew bar or brewpub are $2-$5 charging $5 for any shot makes no sense at all
I recommend that if you decide to go with shots of beer stick with only the cheapest beers on the menu so you pay only $2 per shot
They have decent prices for food the sushi sucks but limited drink selections
There's a creative drink menu including some crafty beers and the sushi menu is definitely not your Japanese mama's selection
I've eaten at almost all their eating places the Smoke House - GREAT burgers and fries the Beer/Wine has great selection the salad bar always has a variety of salad toppings - organic too
The service is not particularly stellar here and their drink prices are steep unless you get there for their late night past 11pm menu
Great wine selection and I love finishing dinner with some amaretto
***This review is for their happy hour only*** Sat down and waited about 10 minutes before we were acknowledged menus finally arrive drink orders are placed I get a glass of wine my dining partner gets a coke we wait another 15 minutes to get our drinks and we still haven't ordered
While I'm there let me pick up a selection of beers from around the world I hear Holland has some good brew browse the allegedly specialized food items and take a quick peak at their assortment of candles smell-good bath things and kitchenware
While this is probably true to a point I both love and hate their wine selection and I just plain hate how everything else takes up space that could be used for more wine
When we asked for the 'special menu' as we were told to do so by the website she placed it on the table and handed us the regular menu and wine list
The various bartenders I've met here are all very good and honest about the wine list
The wine selection is grand and the servers are knowledgeable and helpful
They have a wide selection of beers to choose from and are very knowledgeable about them
All in all they have a good selection of food for pretty good prices and the beer and wine selections treated us well
The drink selection is pedestrian as is the beer and wine selection
It only gets Four stars because it could use a bit more snob appeal and a better beer selection
Sure we needed more time to peruse the wine menu and decide what to order but when I told the server to give me a couple more minutes to pick my wine of choice she never again asked me if I wanted a glass
Or it's designed to be accompanied by an intelligent server who can walk you through the wine offerings and pizza choices
This location has no citrus besides lime so keep that in mind if you want something in your beer or waterFor our food choices we went withspicy wontons - great flavor and like other mentioned could use more filling - but definitely worth eatingsesame tofu - great light batter good sauceslime mint beef - not something i would do again - not bad but not carpaccioshrimp wrapped in bacon - how could that not be good
The wine selection is so huge it's overwhelming
The wine by the glass selection is fairly small boo and mostly French yeah
The wine and beer selection is vast yet not overstated and also very reasonable
Not a huge selection of wine but no one in our group has ever complained about it being bad
kid standardFor the adults they have a fairly good wine list full bar a good choice of cappuccinos and flavored coffee as well as some really good specialty drinks like the seasonal gingerbread martini
Service was good to excellent nice wine selection steaks were also good to excellent
Honestly the beer selection on it's own would be enough to get 5 stars for me
Between the rotating draft beer selection and the bottle/can list there's pretty much something for every taste
The whole menu looked awesome including the drinks like fresh squeezed juice and hot bevvies from their coffee bar
Normally you can give an experienced bartender a direction you want to go a couple of spirits/mixers you like and they can suggest a drink from the menu or craft something specifically for you
my bad]Next up is the beer selection which while not as exhaustive as the Lost Leaf two blocks down is quality
And for God's sake if you don't already know don't ask what menudo is made of
They have a huge menu of specialty martinis and other cocktails that are all pretty darn tasty if you ask me
Here's my two complaintsI thought the wine list was overpriced
But I always think the wine list is overpriced
I haven't really seen too many wine lists nor Happy Hours that can compare to Christopher's
Our waiter was exceptionally knowledgeable about the menu and ingredients including the wine
The beer selection is pretty decent for the restaurant
A group of friends and I sat at the bar and had good service great wine they have a very eclectic wine list and the food was AMAZING

So I dropped in and sat at the counter so I could look over the scotch selection while I had lunch and see if this a place that I want to come back to so very important in this day and age of so many sports bars and I was thrilled to see that Blue 32 stocks most of my favorite single malts along with a metric ton of beers and wine
The beer selection left a lot to be desired but the Stella I ordered was cold and $7 for a 20 oz beer isn't bad
The wine store- They have an eclectic selection of wine and once again the staff knows the wines well
The happy hour menu has Asian tappas apps for $5 and many $5 cocktails and glasses of wine
I just tried the cheese and fruit plate and I think it is the perfect pairing for any of the drinks on the menu
This place is wonderful -- great drink and food menu
The version offered on the drink list at Hanny's is a gingery cucumbery bitters-like concoction
I am an avid Snapple drinker and I was excited to find that they carry it if only a very limited selection
Jamie had a great understanding of the menu the specials and especially the wine
Tons of beers to try brews you've never heard of a rotation of the menu and OHSO is soon to brew their own beer
There was absolutely no theme concept the music was atrociously paired and half of the acts were unlistenable they quickly ran out of food drinks and souvenirs within 45 minutes and THE TICKETS WERE 60 FRIKKIN DOLLARS
The burger is worth it for five bucks on Monday the fries are awesome the drink specials are mediocre the atmosphere I found a bit stuffy and unfriendly the menu is all over the place with no solid direction or theme and the totally modern contempo art deco bullshit bathrooms make me roll my eyes while I pee
Garlic Fries and Flatbread were good but drink menu was limited because they were out of mint and 1/3 of their cocktail menu uses mint
The wine selection isn't very unique or broad but it's probably suffice for the majority of the people in the Phoenix area
Grenache for $7 a glass and since it is on said chalkboard I order a glass despite it not being my first choice
The bulk of their wine menu comes in bottle form
Martinis and wine were our choice both well done and we started with the mixed basket of sweet potatoe and regular fries; which were AWESOME
The wine selection is really excellent  with offerings for all budgets and tastes
Great steaks perfectly executed side dishes exceptional steakhouse wine list meaning lots of full bodied choices all the names that some diners seem married to and just enough obscure stuff to satisfy those who prefer smaller vineyards
I complain about the wine selection and to date no one's brought my favorite Plungerhead back on to the menu- but all-in-all you can't beat the burgers sliders and fries so I'll choke down whatever the wine dude says he likes and open a better bottle when I get home
Some of my fellow beer nerds pan them for not having a hop bomb on the menu but they are missing that Gordon Biersch does traditional German styles and they do them very well--all of them are lagers except the hefe and an altbier that I may have had seasonally
I'm a chai and kawa green tea drinker by birth and all this fruity tea business that was left to choose from wasn't all that appealing to me but I had no choice and ended up going with one
I'm not really a beer person but loved the huge selection and appropriate glassware
HH got you a good choice of beers for $3 and $4 plus we had a card for a free pretzel and I loved it
Managed to snag a table outside and was surprised to see a decent wine selection priced very reasonably
While waiting we looked at the menu and ended up ordering the foreign correspondence wine flight
The ambiance is old-schooll steakhouse with a great wine list and and even better bar stocked with single malt scotch
Not a huge beer menu but definitely a solid selection and good happy hour prices $4/pint $10/pitcher
Great earthy pinot noir - was her choice Im a hard liquor drinker myself
Maybe they have a larger list somewhere but the wine list I saw was pretty short - particularly for a wine cafe
some times they taste other liquor tooIf you want beer selection go there
The staff here is very knowledgeable and we like their recommendations especially on their wine selections
He had just purchased the wine and it wasn't even on the list yet
-good service-wine list-full bar indoor/outdoor-patio-valetBoth times I have been there I ordered and Iced Cafe Mocha to go for the stroll home
They have a very knowledgeable staff that can guide you through the menu and suggest tea drinks and seems well trained in how to make tea
We wanted to see their wine list along with the martini list
5 minutes pass and finally the server comes by to bring menus and take our drink order
They had a few Greek wines and  a few California wines on their list
UpsidesI wanted to try this restaurant because they supposedly have the biggest selection of draft beers
my husband loves their selection of beers but if i want sweet potato fries
I would recommend avoiding specialty cocktails though I have not tried other drinks on their menu
The beer menu humored me a bit as did the wine list
The beer and wine list seemed to be a melange of randomly selected beers and wines from different countries with no real particular direction or reason
They also have a variety of bottle beers including some choices from the Caribbean and Hawa'ii
Give the cool vibe great seafood and wide drink selection Hula's Modern Tiki is set to become an uptown classic especially as they work out a few remaining kinks in the kitchen
But the wine list was nicely varied for all tastes and they had Cusquena beer which is just absurdly fun
The bar staff is quite friendly if a little slow and the beer selection leaves a little to be desired
They also have interesting cocktails sangria and a great wine/beer selection
It's just a chill place to hang out with a great beer selection
The beer selection here is very good but rely's heavy on the Rogue and Four Peaks breweries
The wine list had mostly very high priced bottles very few options for wine by the glass
I didn't try any of the wines but the wine list looked decent
I'm also not really a fan of how their beer menu is presented- the bar area doesn't need to be that crowded
If they had a weekly rotation they could print out weekly beer menus
I'm not sure how many have actual beer knowledge but I'm betting they use the 'beer list' as a crutch
I get why they have the beer list as I'm sure they don't want to answer annoying questions over and over but this is the ONLY place I've been to that does this and I would honestly prefer a beer menu and use google if the server can't answer my beer question
Their menu is very easy to read and give those no too educated in the was of coffee a good description of what each drink is and how it is made
It was our first time here our server was Gib he explained the menu to us described some of the menu items to us as well as drinks
The menu from the cafu00e9 is full of items like Panini's and small plates If you like Panini's try the George Clooney And of course they also serve beer/wine
Bottom line- I will probably go back to Copper Blues for a drink as they have a great beer selection but I don't think I'll eat there ever again
5 out of 5 starsMenu Appeal - 5 starsDrinks/Happy Hour - 5 starsService - 3
Looked like an interesting foo-foo drink menu
First this place has the most impressive wine list I have ever seen
The draft beer selection is just okay but there are a ton of TV's so you can get whatever game you want on a conveniently placed screen
But I will still come here because in the end it's a low-key relaxed venue with a fantastic beer selection
The food is stellar the lines are non-existent thanks to the flocks of people that essentially just go to drink and socialize and the selection is immense enough to cause death by gluttony if you're the kind of person who has to taste everything
Food was Ok never saw the wine pairings so we bought our own which was good decent selections
The wine selection was random but whatever
Great selection of beers cheap $3 per beer happy hour relaxed atmosphere and walking distance to the Light Rail
And the people at the window acted like they were indifferent bored amateurs not there by choice - what a contrast with the bright cheerful chipper greeting from a Starbucks barista five minutes later my hubby wanted his Starbucks not some DD drink
Bloom has an amazing wine list and everyone enjoyed the wine and champagne we ordered with dinner
I decided to eat my lunch with a glass of wine from their very ample selection available

You sit in a fun environment order drinks and food from the menu and just have a good time with friends
Drinks aren't cheap but run pretty much standard for the area and they do have a pretty decent selection of brews for the beer snobs count me among said group
Their happy hour menu featured a nice variety of white and red wines all for $6 plus we tried the escargot pate and frites as well
The beer selection is great both the bottles and the tap collection
The bar gets 4 stars for the beer selection alone
I've never worn glasses before and this was on my way home so I figured I would stop in and at the very least just browse the frame selection
Beside each of the parking spots was a lit-up menu with fast-food type stuffs drinks slushies smoothies ice cream sundaes banana splits etc
Ummm I didn't see any menus on Saturday if I had I probably would have ordered a specialty drink and they would have made a few extra bucks off of me
The wine list was extensive we had a very nice Pinot Grigio
Beer was very overpriced and domestic beers like Sam Adams Boston Lager were included in the Imports menu for a premium price
If I lived around here it would be an easy go to place for happy hour w/great beer wine selection and cheap burgers for the carnies-it has a no nonsense charm that I can't seem to replicate in colour scheme except you could take a hipster and your dad here-and that is pretty rare around Phoenix
I also really appreciate the fact that they take the time to create a beer menu with so much more detail than just the name
I met some friends here last night for some drinks and to listen to the live band
Hummustzatziki   served w/flat bread selection of olives a couple of pork belly selections I had the lamb burger I ordered medium it was served a more rare but was still good the did offer some higher priced entrees and there were other selections of burgers and sandwiches thus the name gastro pub  they had some good beers on tap
I don't cook and even I was impressed by their big selection of cheese meat pasta wine and sauces to buy
They recently expanded their wine list to my delight and I've been having fun giving the new vino a try
first and foremost i was glad to see so many choices of beers which was the main reason my friends and i came
Decent cocktail and wine menu but like most of the stiffs in this place they are trying a little too hard
With great food good wine selection personal attention I cannot find anything that was not positive
Sure the place has atmosphere and a good drink menu but I prioritize the eats
Drink prices are average but the selection of Scotch's were spectacular
We had a couple beers small selection - but we found something we really liked and a glass of wine reasonably priced tasty The service was fine the prices fine
We found a table and enjoyed their excellent wine list until my husband got hungry and we decided to stay for dinner
The Beer selection here at WOB is awesome with over 50 rotating taps and 10 beer frigs shelving hundreds of bottles even some 22oz selections
-The beer list is extensive and full of local brews
They need to work on the drink selection and add maybe three additional entrees around the $10 price range or under
Another great thing about The Parlor is their beer and wine list
Huge list of beers on tap and they serve them in pitchers
The wine list is one of the best and we think these are bar-none the best steaks in town
they have a pretty incredible selection of cheeses and charcuterie along with wines
Good wine and beer selection sushi stand olive bar deli with ready made good sandwiches and a pretty robust nutrition/health food section
A nice selection of a variety of beers which I thought were fairly priced
Besides the amazing assortment of sports artifacts I especially like the Cactus League Beer List which pairs a beer with each city that has a team in the Cactus League
I'm not really charmed by the ambiance or impressed with many of the menu items--and their beer selection is really lame too
The beer selection is great I can't lie there but if the latex clad goth oddballs who wander in  don't put you off and bitter snarky waitresses who couldn't tell an ipa from a hole in the wall isn't a big deal to u then proceed with caution
It's cozy it's intimate it's secretive and its a great choice for a glass of vino by candlelight
Our server forgot about us to the point that we had no water or drinks placed OR menu's after sitting for about 10 mins
The wine list was pretty good for a Thai place
Fabulous selection of wines by the glass too
Full drink menu and I love thier prices here
Once famous for the Gordon on their drink menu they have mixed it up a bit with the Gordon equivalent G'Knight
Not all of them drink so they weren't impressed by the awesome wine selection--I had a glass of a delicious White Knight and not all of them quite understood the concept of tapas
They have a great bar with a well stocked selection of beers wines and liquor at least I noticed my favorite; Maker's Mark
They offer an eclectic menu of small munchables they have some decent beer on tap and they have created some lovely sounding signature drinks
TMI's beer list is solid and I've yet to try the wine but when it's basically down the street I don't have to think of too many excuses to get back for the service and the atmosphere
If you want a nice romantic special events meal this is a great choice especially if you want to celebrate with a really fine bottle of wine
Unfortunately we could not drink an margaritas because we had to go back to work but the drink menu looked interesting

Unassuming from the exterior in a strip mall with such high end boutiques as Enterprise Rent-A-Car and sharing a zip code with a cowboy tourist targeted bar that features bull riding of the non-mechanical variety Binkley's is a tiny destination restaurant that seems slightly uncomfortable with its surroundings and we were equally slightly out of place with our sinusoidal experience not for control freaks- Greeted by name due to party size and expected arrival time being unique resulted in feeling like VIPs confused by their own fame- Sending away the sommelier a bit dejected when we unanimously declined wine- Realizing our head waitress was a bizarro version of a friend from back home- Opting for the highest end 5-6 course tasting menus $82 - $89 wine pairing $40-50 extra like non-confused VIPs but skipping the foie gras surcharge +$14- Being thankful of no collective food restrictions or allergies to impede chef creativity- Impressed by a nearly endless train of experimental amuse-bouches- Processing that we were 3-4 courses in without seeing anything we ordered- Recalling that some of us were no stranger to this dining style when it's called omakase except then there's no illusion of input into the majority of the meal- Hitting our stride with the hot appetizer including a superb soft shell crab course- Enjoying the best black cod I've ever eaten in a sea of unusual but not quite as enjoyable candidates- Starting to feel full around the penultimate course an amuse of chocolate souffle - Understanding without bitterness that soda refills were not free $2
The ambiance was good low lights with a very nice wine selection
Their selection of sunglass frames is really limited and if you know anything about glasses you know that a pair of ordinary frames can never really be made into adequate sunglasses because they don't cover enough of your face to keep the sun out

Plenty of seating at the long bar and a really nice selection of beers on tap and reasonably priced too especially if you go to the 3-6 happy hour

Beer selection alone and this would be a 6 star review I know they only do 5  stars but I've got some dirt on a few yelp employees that I would use to make it happen Unfortunately there's other things to consider like food and attentiveness of the waitstaff etc
The rotating list beers on tap changes frequently so unless you are there multiple times a week there's probably something new for you to try

The wine selection was equally large and offered all the selections one could want

Good wine list and all of the entrees our group had were well liked
Over that time my friends and I developed relationships with the wonderful servers there who always remembered our names our favorite dishes and who were always willing to recommend a great new beer from the extensive ever changing list
The online beer list never matches the beers on the chalkboard so it's hard to order without checking with your server about what's ACTUALLY going to be on tap
They also no longer have prices posted so more than once I have been surprised by ordering a premium beer when no indication of this was given on the menu
In the past year we've had a different server on every visit and every time they seemed brand new didn't know the beer list forgetting our order etc

We sat down and got our menu's it was the dinner menu and WAY too expensive for us - we thought about leaving just then but decided to order drinks and an appetizer oh yea no drink menu so I guess you have to wait for the bill to see how much the drinks were but then the waitress who was very nice suggested the lunch menu - much better but still priced a little high
The wine selection is about a third of what it used to be
Friendly helpful people always yummy stuff in the deli fresh veggies/fruits pretty big wine selection for a chain store and the guy in the bakery is an absolute doll to my cookie-grubbing offspring
The typical wine connesuir will want to love Armitage but after looking at the menu I am sure they will be disappointed
DC Ranch is a very upscale area so you would think that the owners/management would have a wine list that is well diversified and not outdated
Nothing is worse then going to a wine bar and the server gives you that blank look when you ask about different varietals on their list
Overall this place has one of the best patios I have been to in the Phoenix area which I would give 4 1/2 stars but the service and wine list is lackluster
Her knowledge of the wine list and wines in general was beyond expectations
Their house-brewed beers are great--the first time I came I ordered the sampler where you can try them all there are quite a few choices or you can ask for a taste of one you think you want
In addition their selection of small brewery beers and mixed drinks is fantastic
Pros-nice ambiance-friendly service-nice menu options-fair prices-hot sauces on tables are awesomeCons-carne asada is smoked with mesquite I think and tastes likes it's been covered in bbq sauce-not the biggest fan of the chicharron de queso husband liked it though-service was a little slow they set themselves up for failure on this by giving you tiny ass water glasses-coke is served by the can for $1
During happy hour drinks are half off so you wont feel bad throwing back that $11 martini or 5 and their HH sushi and appetizer list is extensive
They have a good selection of wines and the staff can be helpful if they aren't preoccupied or busy
The wines-by-the-glass list was definitely over-edited IMHO and quite pricey for what they were offering
The wine list has a nice selection and is broken into their regular list which is basically what most people will order from and a special list where the entry price on the wine is $120+
Ah yes & then there's your choice of TWO HUNDRED FIFTY bottled soft drinks to go with your food
they have a few creative drink recipes I've never seen anywhere else and a gigantic tequila selection
Great selection of beers to choose from-whether you want domestic imported or craft beer
They also have a lot of other good beer choices on tap at reasonable prices
I would like it if they added a meatball dish however but that is minor when you are considering a full menu of beers on tap
fantastic place Mario and Peter owners are awesomeFinally adding this review to my yelpI went there last night this isnt really last night it is few months ago - it is still excellent not too and it was excellent - The beer list they have is fantastic and Mario who is a part owner was behind the bar and it was good talking to himArrived just at the end of happy hour they have $1 off draft beers for happy hour and half priced glasses of wine and there was a certain amount off well drinks but i don't recall what that isThey are going to be working on their mixed drink menu they wont have that ready to go for another week or twoStarted out with Schneider Aventinus Doppel Weizen BockGermany 8
2% which could be my new favorite beer it is a unfiltered wheat bock amazingOne of the nice touches is that they have the proper beer glass to go with each beer they have on tap in the appropriate sizes and the largest karmeliet glass i have ever seen and they have a lot of imports on the list so they are doing great in the strong ale category - which is my favorite type of beerAs i was looking at the menu I asked if they had foie gras because i saw a picture on their facebook page and Mario told me they always have that as an off the item menu and it could be prepared however I would like it - which sounded great to meFoie Gras torchon with toast points honey comb apples cherries - also had a lemon tuille and some micro greens as wellThe honeycomb was a very nice touch because it got the sweetness however the bonus was the nice texture it added to the overall My friend ordered Heirloom Tomatoes and Gioia Burrata and i got a taste of that it was a great salad and had small bread sticks and fresh pesto on it as well very light and refreshing - just the thing after foie gras for my main i ordered the crispy half duck it was confit duck style the skin was very crispy and it was a huge portion - the duck was very good the crispy duck skin fat had lots of flavor with it - and i was happy to have confit again since i still dream of the chez dumonet duck i had in Paris this summer - my only change i would have made was the side items it was served with i would have liked dauphine potatoes - with that said it was the best duck i have had in AZ and i was happy it was not just seared duck breast My friends ordered the spinach Gnochi Black Tagliolini Mediterranean Sea BassI tried the Sea Bass which was was very good with the skin on crispy and crab on top the pasta dishes all looked amazing although i didnt get to try them i will certainly be trying them on my next visitrubee while i was there quite a few people ordered the crispy ribs - they looked great and everyone said they were deliciousSeems like there will be specials each day as well based on what looks good in the market everything coming out of the kitchen looked great - finally a place with an awesome beer list and delicious food - looking forward to seeing what they do with their cocktail list will certainly be back and it is nice they have parking
the tortillas YUM YUM and the wide selection of lemonade drinks
I typically don't prefer these fusion type sushi places but the ambiance and their menu + drink names are fun
I also noticed that some of their wine was bad the waitress went through several bottles before finding a good one and they don't seem to be keeping all their wine/beer in stock as some of it was unavailable after ordering off the menu
I especially loved that they had sake on the menu
Theres usually a uniquely crafted beer on their menu that cant be found other places
One thing that is consistent with most brewpubs is that on the menu there are beer suggestions for most of the foods
Historic home turned bar The Roosevelt is dark romantic and the perfect place to spend hours drinking wine by the glass or bottle or beer from their fairly extensive beer menu while getting to know that special someone
I'd also be careful of their wine list - very high and not as good a list of wines as the prices would suggest Souverain Sauvignon Blanc retails for $14-16 per bottle FGS
- Excellent soft drink selection if that's your thing
if you want a pricey beer that you can find anywhere and an unimaginative menu doused in napa slaw this is the spot
The wine bar is extensive with a variety of solid names and many boutique wines including Joel Gott A to Z Wineworks  among others
They offer iced green tea that is really tasty and have a small beer/wine/drink menu as well
and drink from the copious beer selection
I also think they could add a couple more micro brews into their beer selection and considering they don't have happy hour it isn't cheap to go for a round of beers and some wings
In my experience the drinks read better than they actually taste but I am a big fan of the Streetfighter which isn't on the menu anymore but I hope they can still make it next time I'm in

They had Sangiovese on the wine menu which is a MAJOR plus considering it is one of my favorite dry red italian wines and I was totally blown away by the tabbouleh salad bulgar wheat peppadews and marcona almonds tossed with diced cucumbers tomatoes and romaine in an oregano dressing and the salted caramel pudding heavenly for those into the salty/sweet thing
I recall that they have some tasty martinis on the menu but most recently I enjoyed a glass of Cakebread Sauv Blanc - you can never go wrong with that

I finally bailed on the half bottle idea and looked to the wines by the glass list which by comparison to the bottle list was very small and there were no Chardonnays I liked so I ended up getting a glass of Kunin Grenache

Their salsa is excellent as well and their beer selection is modest but they have something for everyone

I'm torn with this place because i love it so much but dislike it for certain things so I'm going to stay positive because the things i don't like can be a personal thing about the music they allow in there it has a HELL a lot of beers it has a grand selection of wine it has no food but who need food when you've eatn before going to the LOST LEAF the music is a hit and miss some days a very kool unique style and other days not good and i think this is why i sometimes have a problem with the music is because with all the great local musicians out in phoenix it should be easier to play this place but it isn't
Also the wine list looked great and on Saturday's they have half price bottles as an FYI
Given I'm uneducated when it comes to wine selection I'm hoping my husband selected a ice wine from our selection and that we were getting approving looks from those tables

A few things one should expect when coming NOCA-you will never be thirsty waterboy is there stalking empty glasses like a hawk-the pasta is not at all impressive-cotton candy is complimentary and served at the end of the meal-this is casual fine dining = large rimmed heavy expensive ass plates with dallop of *insert food here*-great venue for a date-menu changes NIGHTLYDim lighting  small cozy atmosphere but not excessively loud either

Owned and operated by Eugenia Theodosopoulos an Ohio native fyi and considered by many to be the best patisserie/bakery in the state I approached Essence with a note of skepticism largely assuming much of the hype was derived from Tempe's plethoric college crowd but arriving at the doors of the small shop on a particularly lovely 80 degree morning I gathered quite quickly that my original conceptions were misplaced; not only does Essence not look like a college haunt neither do its prices or products - a vast selection of at least twenty items aside from the posted menu sitting beneath and atop a glass case forcing me to make more than one tough decision that was not helped by my server's accurate assessment that everything was really good
They have a great soft drink selection with everything sweetened with cane sugar although no name brand sodas

I dismissed that and placed my order anyways I ordered the Aegean Club minus the gyro meat because I am not a fan of lamb but when I asked to have the gyro meat removed I got an eye roll then I asked for it to be paired with a Greek salad and would like a water for drink I don't drink soda and wasn't in the mood for tea then my friend placed her order and bill was rang up I handed her the card and asked her if there was a to go menu since this was my 1st there I wanted to see what all they had to offer without a single word she looked at me then looked to the left as in dummy don't you see them right there
They have also done some theme dinners where they pair wine and serve a mutli-course chefs choice menu the one's I've gone to have been outstanding and well worth the price
The have a very nice wine selection for you to try and buy by the bottle at very reasonable prices
The house brew is my fave because its a light beer with citrus undertones but they have an extensive beer and wine selection
Get a pint of beer to wash it down they have a good selection
For me this almost had a creaminess from the round flavor of the peaches this could be my signature drink on any upcoming visits if there weren't so many other choices
The staples I buy here are coconut water all my veggies they are cheaper than Fry's wine great prices frozen fruits and veggies meat although I wish they had a bigger selection especially more seafood and I really like the bulk department
I didn't have beer this time but I'll definitely go back for the beer selection
Food highlights were the Escargots & Braised Short Ribs and a truly excellent wine list
Their beer/wine list is limitedbut what they do have is pretty good
We helped ourselves to some coffee and lemonade before we received our menus which stated that each drink was $2
Of course  I am a beer drinker and their choices were limited which I had expected - but they did have a beer brewed in Prescott which was fine
They are known for their wines and they had an extensive wine list of different local wines available which I understand are quite good
A fine beverage list of cocktails Arizonan wine and local brew is available as well as some of the most delicious appetizers one could find
Since a new seasonal brew had just been delivered the bartender mocked my choice of beer
Since my wife is having a baby any minute now I had a glass of Tempronillo which I thought was nice option on a wine by the glass list
We had planned on having a few drinks and checking out the menu
This place is small and didn't have a good selection of beer or liquor
There is not much on the wine list either
The produce is always fresh they have an interesting selection of frozen items including some great appetizers the meat department is outstanding - I've tried a few different kabobs from here spicy kabob rocks bakery is great nice selection of hard to find dairy items like fig yogurt fair cheese selection including a local fresh burrata and mozzarella that will knock your socks off excellent selection of wines and craft beer and a floral department that has exquisite arrangements
My all-time favorite drink is served here--I don't think it's on the menu so be sure to remember SUMMER SOLSTICE MARTINI
I don't drink but they seem to have a decent selection of drinks there and my boyfriend really liked the beer he got
There was a good selection of champagnes wines and drinks
Deemed to be South American the only thing South American on the menu is the wine and a reference to a chimichurri sauce
They have a reasonable dinner menu special for Monday night and it's good to pass the time while waiting for the manicure and to sober you up while drinking the martini's
I had stopped there for lunch and they had a decent selection of prepared foods and pastries as well as coffee and espresso drinks
Nay White sangria - I'm a white wine drinker primarily so I was super excited to see this on the menu but don't love it
Surprising wine list with both a Burgundy and Bordeaux by the glass getting a little tired of the Merlot/Malbec routine around here but my only gripe is that they refrigerate the wines as they should but not nearly cold enough so I still had to ask that they chill the wine a bit Mikey was nice enough to chill it in an ice bath rather than my having to add ice to it like I have to do everywhere else in Scottsdale as everyone serves their wine at room temperature rather than at cellar temperature which is plus or minus 65 degrees according to the Court of Master Sommeliers
They have a great wine list and a full bar
Also tried their mojito at the party which I would have never ordered since I generally go their for the wine selection but it was delicious
Huge bar in the middle with a nice wine list and a variety of drink options
Their beer selection is admittedly impressive but that's not my thing
I would however sit there and have some drinks while listening to the piano player/singer
I like to have the bartender all to myself to get the lowdown on drink and food choices
The beer menu is outstanding and I can't wait to go back and try more
We got a few drinks from their AMAZING soda selection
