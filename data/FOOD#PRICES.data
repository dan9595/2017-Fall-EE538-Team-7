I saw so many rolls that looked yummy but they were expensive
I didn't like the prices so much but for good sushi you can't expect it to be super cheap
Prices  are low and food is simple but well prepared
Their specials are a good way to get  a lot of food at good prices
The food is cooked to order so really no complaints about the price
The food is served in generous portions that makes the price seem too good to be true
I love trivia and the menu is happy hour prices tho to repeat myself I will not order any food again
You get your food quicker the prices are better and the food is tastier
Seems to me a little on the pricey side BUT you also get a decent amount of food so it's a wash
The food was about on par price and quality wise of what you would get from Applebees or TGI Fridays
I've been daydreaming about a build-your-own burrito place for years but I haven't hashed out a way to properly account for the mass of meat pricey versus rice and other ingredients cheap
Cheap drinks casual atmosphere and decent Mexican food- that's how I'd describe Dos
If it's your first time there plan on spending more than the one-$ listed the more authentic creole dishes are a tad more pricey but completely worth it
The sushi are all labeled and priced and have a nice selection
We went on Wednesday nice live music food was awesome we got our bill and thought they made a mistake it was so cheap
The bill says we ordered a dish called Traditional yet the price is for the Top Sirloin Steak Benny
Because the quality of the dishes didn't live up to the hype or price I felt like this was simply a novelty restaurant hiding behind a gimmick rather than great food
Expensive I guess if you base it on Cen Pho's prices but much better food I think
A bowl of Ramen in Japan is like getting a hotdog from a street vendor in New York it is supposed to be quick and inexpensive and while I understand that it is a niche kind of dish here I don't think $10+ for a bowl of soup and a drink is a very good value
The pizzas here don't come cheap but I'm telling you they are undoubtedly worth the higher price tag and the longer wait
It's worth the price of admission just to see others work their magic while they pile on the food 6 inches or more above the rim of the bowl
Also great to go with friends or even just late night to get some atmosphere or half price tuna rolls
The food is way overpriced but in Scottsdale I guess that doesn't matter
I would go to Basil for a cheaper meal but this seems like a little more work went into the sauces and meat was better quality
They have a nice happy hour with cheap dishes and drinks from 5-7pm
As for food they have an awesome menu but the food came off a bit cheap in quality to me so I don't think it's worth ten dollars a plate
3 stars for good food quality and fair prices but with poor game selection and service
It is a little expensive to eat here because it is quality seafood
The food served at Juan's is delicious and cheap
The prices are very reasonable but it is not as inexpensive as say Carolina's Mexican Food and the portions weren't enough for my appetite another good sign of the food quality I guess
It can be a bit expensive but it is good food
The ice cream and cake were mediocre the onion rings were crispy-initially the burgers were WAY overdone and made from cheap beef
I also thought that the food was a little pricey for how much we got but the taste definitely makes up for it

I guess bistro is like code for snotty bartender overpriced drinks slow service and B at best mexican food

Okay so they only get 4 stars because for the same prices the sushi is much better than what you get in Philly
We enjoyed our cheap drinks and cheap sushi which was really not that bad
Their food is very good and reasonably priced and always cooked fresh upon your order
If you are looking for quality food at slightly higher than Subway prices than this is the place for you
Amazing prices on the food great flavor on the tacos burritos quesadillas etc
The food is ok nothing special and certainly not worth the price they charge
The Camarones Culichi and Molcajete Caliente one of their specialty dishes  If you go for lunch and be sure to ask for the lunch portions which are half the price listed on the menu
The dishes are very tiny for the price and the tea would cost extra
Really yummy food extremely friendly and cool staff and great portions for the price
Personally I prefer grilled burgers over fried but it's good quality meat compared to the typical fast food joint which should be expected given the difference in price
Good place for lunch large fast service good prices and good food
They have bar snacks which are actually tapas smaller sized portions of some of their main dishes so it was great to be able to order several of these and share them - and they were really reasonably priced too
The addition of the chicken bumped the price of this jewel up to $12
The prices seemed reasonable for the food and the flavor

Not that there is anything wrong with that I think it just speaks to the the food prices and atmosphere

I had the pita pizza which was delicious but extremely overpriced
The restaurant is a cut above -- considerably above -- the standard hotel restaurant in this country with reasonable prices for quite good food
Food and service are below average for this price level period
Basically if you want three scoops of okay food for the price of one scoob of the good stuff you'd get at Panda Express come here
Sure there are other places in The Valley that are fancier where the food comes to your table almost too pretty to eat but that comes with a price tag and often a nice appearance is used to mask inferior quality
For the price that we paid for average food I really wished we would have gone across the street to Noca Highlights  service atmosphere mozzarella mousse
I'm sure the veal is quite tasty but I just can't bring myself to digesting it not to mention it was more expensive than the chicken
So this is a shorty review but if you are in need of food for a reasonable price that is good over conversation and drinks you might want to consider this one of your stops
My last visit was reminiscent of cheaply made sushi and bland food
Luckily this place was open had cheap pizza by the slice
In addition to the totally acceptable food pleasant service and good prices you get the added bonus of checking out an old school cigarette vending machine on your way out
Food City has the absolute BEST prices on produce that I've ever seen anywhere in AZ CA or HI
Other than that you do get plenty of food for the price and the decor is nice
the food is decent but not all things are worth the price
I'm giving 4 stars because the prices have gone up in the last few months they've stopped offering their pimento cheese dip at the bar which was amazing and they no longer offer the crescent rolls with dinner anymore
Food is amazingly fast for the quality and rather inexpensive too
The price was pretty fair with a pizza and drink being under $10
1	If you want disgusting food, it can be had much more cheaply
25 and I must say for the price the amount of food that you receive is excellent
The prices are on the cheap side so it shouldn't be a suprise that you aren't coming here for the food
Great service fair prices for the large portions great food and a nice outdoor patio- you can't go wrong
Prices are a bit high but the quality of the food offsets the price
Not terribly inexpensive for counter service and food served on paper plates
Clearly Crazy Jim has decided to deal with the crappy economy by giving patrons less food and charging the same price
which I just don't understand cause the food is reasonably priced and seriously amazing
Pretty much this place is good for quick and cheap food
Price for all the food you get is not bad at all
The rolls were completely overpriced $11 and $13 which wouldn't have bothered me so much if they were good
The prices are perfect the service is great and the food is really delicious
I really enjoy Goldies and Zipps for their cheap beers low-key atmospheres and decent food
the food is incredible the wine list is extensive the menu is reasonably priced the ambiance is delightful and the service rocks
I wasn't totally impressed the 1st couple times but have come to the conclusion that the food is good for the price
All in all it's good food for a great price
However the food was decent; not fantastic and for the price plus the annoying lack of personality and experience I'd rather not go back
Happy hour food specials are a nice amount of food for the price and the outside patio is private and fun
Bottom line when a buddy wants to go grab a drink and some bar food I'll recommend we go here so at least I can eat something but the price point prohibits me from eating there even semi-regularly
The third thing I love about Sprouts is their grass fed beef and when it's on sale it's not expensive at all
tee hee 4 stars good service cute service good food cheap food
A little higher priced than I expected for such a divey place but the food was great and definitely hit the spot
The food although a bit expensive in my opinion was excellent
The food however seems to be about 20% overpriced for what you receive
Prices were what you would expect for good sushi but definitely over-priced for the quality that was served here
The chef here sent us out toro it's the fatty part of the tuna good toro is like biting through butter which also happened to be the most expensive fish they had
Thought some of the prices were a tad high for MExican food but it is at a resort
Luckily for me Haji-Baba is known for tons of food at decent prices so I have a promising evening of stuffing my face without breaking my wallet
But really to be truthfully super blunt honest-to-go-honest truth Haji-Baba's food is not the best in the world but it is 1 fresh 2 good quality 3 tasty and 4 cheap
The food is generally good albeit a bit overpriced -but you expect that to some degree when you walk through the door given the top level service you expect to receive
At similar mobile sushi places usually there's a sticker dot that indicates the price of the sushi and based on dot color or number of dots you could tell how much each plate is
And don't even get me started on the rise of Rito's Chipotle and Juan's all of which provide superior food for less than half the price
html  It looks exactly like the regular menu just without any idea of how crazy expensive their food has become
The best part is that prices are very similar to Thai Town food
However aside from the pain in the ass parking them not taking reservations being herded into his cramped almost non-air conditioned bar for overpriced drinks for hours then being made to sit at the bar instead of a table; the food was very good
It's a revolving sushi bar that serves fresh sushi and creative rolls at great prices
BTW the  prices have increased- the lower cost I found here as late as last year was a large factor in my positive reviews but now I'd rather spend the same amount elsewhere and get what I want out of my dessert
They have an excellent selection of entrees to choose from their lunch prices are fantastic and the food portions are just right
but with pretty decent prices this will be my sushi stop when I hit the craving while downtown
*Shrugs* still fair value at both prices with the amount of food you get but of course the $7 something is better

$27 a night overnight valet this is Scottsdale not LA Over priced and mediocre food
Pretty much everything we have tired here we liked and the prices are reasonable and food is fresh
Also it seems like they have raised the price when they made fancy-new-menu which had more ad by us-air or something that had nothing to do with their food
Rude staff slower than molasses service DIRTY sloppy unappealing food that is expensive margaritas that taste like some tangy sour tasting kool-aid-- and if you are unlucky enough to be seated in what I call the after thought corridor you will nearly suffocate from the lack of circulation and heat the narrow little seating area off the main dining area
The conveyor belt is almost hypnotic the food is quite good the price is awesome maybe just train the waitresses a tad better but since the food mostly comes to you who cares
IT IS AN ABSOLUTE WASTE OF $150 THAT COULD HAVE GONE TO A FABULOUS PAIR OF SHOES OR OVERPRICED AIRPORT FOOD
With very good quality food and great prices no wonder it is so popular
The food was good but not nearly as good as it should be considering what you're paying for it--yes it's pricey for what is essentially bar food
The atmosphere gets five stars and the staff was friendly and service excellent but the food is overpriced and the food was satisfactory
The prices are a little excessive but I think the quality and freshness of the food is outstanding and that this is well worth paying a little extra to obtain
I agree with the other reviewer the house chicken is good and very well priced for the amount of food you get
I get cheap food that's good at the time then you feel like death later
Haji-baba has cheap food insanely cheap food food so cheap you would debate eating there due to the cheapness but have no choice but to give it a shot because
It is cheap mexican food that best hits the spot while in a state of inebriation
Been there a couple of times and the food is excellent and cheap
Mexican food is in general cheap depending on how much decor you're willing to give up so the deciding factor is in the taste which Susie's unfortunately did not especially shine at
The pizzas are pretty good if not slightly over priced but you're paying a bit for the atmosphere instead of a hole in the wall type joint
One harsh bit of criticism Don't be cheap with the pocket bread; one piece rolled up in foil is totally insufficient for a 7-10 oz
It is a bit pricey for pizza but it's so nice to be able to eat out safely
While I feel the food merits one star based on goofiness and price I'm giving POSH two stars just for having the cojones to push out this concept on Scottsdale and not to crack a smile when delivering the check
It's cheap with a coupon and they will like the kid friendly healthy food
Also the price was an issue for the the money you should get a side dish frys potato salad something to lessen the kick in the pants
Honestly for my money there's far better and cheaper pizza in Tempe just up the street and there's not a 20-30 minute wait nor any hype
The food was reasonably priced for a stadium and they even had a stand for Skyline Chili along the left field foul line
If you are looking for a quick decent priced sushi fix this is your place
Let's just say for the actual price of the food that this restaurant isn't worthy of a revisit
Better food and prices in downtown Scottsdale at the Italian Grotto

Being unemployed and dining on someone else's ticket I went cheap this time and got the cheapest entree on the menu -- the beef Flemington
I can get Thai food nearly as good for cheaper in Chandler where I live but for a date night out this place will do nicely
I'm sure they used quality ingredients and at no point did I feel the possibility of contracting some food-borne illness from my food which would have made the experience more authentic in my opinion hehI just didn't think it was all that and the size/taste to me did not justify the price
The drinks and food are very reasonably priced and their Sunday happy hour is awesome too
The staff is inattentive the food greatly over priced and poorer than fast food quality
If you drink and/or have dessert though it can get pricey for what it is but again the concept is solid
If you want sushi you'll have to pay a hefty price for it
But on the hand the food is pricey and portions are small
I really don't get that policy consider there isn't a price difference between the meats
Sure the food is not bad no sparkley magically taste-bud juice inspirings going on though and the lunch prices seem fair but if you try to lunch there it's really obnoxious and definitely not wheelchair accessible
I will say the Happy Hour prices were a great deal and the food was pretty good
The food here is delicious the staff is friendly the prices reasonable & they even have BOOTHS  -  back in their almost secret rear dining room
This is a great neighborhood bar and has a suprisingly tasty breakfast and the food is VERY reasonable priced

The food is really good & the prices are totally reasonable
The $3 price tag for what amounts to a medium-sized pizza can't be beat either

The food is great for what it is the price is right and the service is very good
Although they have many expensive/indulgent dishes most are reasonably priced
ALthough service was great and the food was good all in all too overpriced for what you got
Talk about fresh food and great prices this place has it all
The waitress was rude and I could have whipped up a tastier sesame chicken in my own kitchen without a hefty price tag
If you are looking for this option then try it but otherwise I would find a restaurant that offers a smaller selection of these dishes at a lower price
Really affordable sushi all the time why do rolls have to triple in price because it's not between 5-7pm
I think Fry's can be a bit pricey but I'd rather shop here than Wal-Mart for food
It reminded me of a better version of wing stop since it was cheaper I believe 15 pieces of wings were around $11 and there was actual meat on it
Prices were fair for the amount of food at least for the soups
Part of me wants to say that since ramen is supposed to be cheap street food they could cut the price of everything by a dollar or so but then again we all took home enough for another meal
the food is great the prices are perfect for Happy Hour
I got the Creekside filet *the most expensive dish on the menu*
I can't believe how cheap the food on the happy hour menu is-$3 for a regular sized burger
My drink was the highlight of the evening though it was at least twice the price of every food item ordered combined

The pizza and house salad were made with high-quality fresh ingredients and I thought reasonably priced
Pizzas are priced similary if not less than the chain places and is a million-percent better
Perhaps if the food was incredibly inexpensive like how it tastes I'd see the merit in eating here once in a while for convenience's sake
Each roll we got was $6-7 and when you add a sake bomber you're looking at an expensive night
Select sushi and rolls are nearly half the price as well as items from the kitchen such as coconut shrimp and asian chicken salad
All of the roll fillings are a la carte so the more you want the more expensive it gets
The food is a little greasy and the price is a little high but every once in a while that's okay
Food & drink prices were re-DICK which was disappointing
So all in all NoRTH to me is like every other fox restaurant it's cool good consistent maybe a little overpriced for food that is slightly casual but it's good enough that they get away with it and you realize you are paying for the ambiance and experience too
Management was friendly towards people of all ages prices were cheap and pizza and wings were excellent
The food quality also was much more sloppy and prices steadily raised over the years
Price  We order almost the same thing at most dim sum restaurants as we have our favorite dishes
You can get better Mexican/tex-mex food in the valley but this is good for the price
And I'm sorry but if you run a special for a $6 12 pepperoni pizza and the customer asks for just cheese why not drop the price a tiny smidge considering that you aren't having to provide any pepperoni on their pizza
However some diners may find some of Palatte's quirks to be frustrating rather than accepting them for what they really are the small price one must pay from time to time for some really amazing food

I recommend ordering here if you have a hankering for a bucket-load of reasonably priced Chinese food and don't feel like changing out of your pajamas
It manages to be trendy yet unintimidating for us non-trendy people has great service and excellent food I'm willing to overlook the dessert and very reasonable prices
This location not so much however there is a far better Mexican place up the road that serves way better options and ummm real Mexican food and I don't care if it's cheap here either
Also just yesterday I hit Whole Foods' sushi bar and for about the same price got a truly fresh product so I won't be going back into Tokyo anytime soon
The food here is quite yummy and the prices are reasonable
I also like the fact that there is no price hike up for the same dish just because it's dinner time on their regular menu
All in all a very pleasant experience with very good reasonably priced food
PRICE A little expensive for pizza standards but nothing that will have you digging deep into your wallet
The long wait bug in a pizza lack of free refills and higher than average prices are too much to be ecstatic about Pizzeria Bianco
- The food is very good and the prices are probably cheaper than the average subsidized school lunch program
I hesitate to say considering the price the food is great  because it makes it seem like it's about a cheap meal
Think of the food in the Ikea Cafeteria like their furniture   Quality stylish sometimes exotic always unique at a great price  and you have to assemble it yourself ;
I mean the dog food toys and upkeep required for a massive Horse Dog are all expensive enough
Some might have more seating some don't have the grocery store attached but they all have delicious mouth-watering food at decent prices
For the quality+quantity of food you get I can't say that the price is that great I've had way better food for way cheaper with just about the same level and speed of service elsewhere

In the end it gets 4 stars for good service decent food convenient location and consistently feeding me when I'm hungry on the cheap
I dined at Fleming's recently on the insistence of a friend and while the service was good I thought the food was shockingly high priced for what it was

Luci's has a great selection of really good healthy food on their menu and the prices are super reasonable
- I really enjoyed my meal here with a grilled chicken sandwich w/gluten free breadI'd only go back here during happy hour or on their Monday 1/2 price night because my family said that was quite expensive for a meal at lunch time and they'd rather have leftovers then clean their whole plate
Which I wouldn't have minded if the sandwich was great but it was just ok--sloppy with lots of cheapo mustard and low-level dairy meats
The jerk tofu and spicy peanut salad are good but I feel they are overpriced for a few pieces of tofu/meat substitute and plain greens
Just like the other reviews said small portions high prices low quality food very limited menu
Note only 4 stars because it IS a little pricey for breakfast food $9 for eggs Benedict and because you will run into someone you know not good if you are all tore up from the night before
The prices are reasonable the service is always friendly and the food is really good
Like this place - it's best for happy hour as the food is a little expensive

I order tuna salad with fried calamari and 2 rolls keep in mind that this place is very expensive my father in law order a roll and my wife order some rolls with appetizers
All the rolls where very small for the price and with out presentation they fall a part and when I told the waiter to please take this back he said that the manager can only take half because I eat half of the roll
Prices are not the friendliest but the gourmet Mexican food will make your stomach sing Mexican mariachi music

For only having veggies inside of my roll I wish it would have been a little cheaper but it was filling and tasty

The prices are very reasonable and the food is good

And partially because upon doing my due diligence I learned that not only are Tuesday nights $20 Wine and Pizza Night but they also offer 1/2 Price Any Bottle of Wine Mon-Thurs from 9 PM- Close

I love Postino for providing a great place to be with friends wine and great food at an excellent price on a Monday or Tuesday night
But the service was lacking - for this level of restaurant you expect exceptional service - and frankly this caliber of food can be found elsewhere with good service and more reasonable prices
But we have concluded 1 Rokerij does offer good food - but they are slightly over priced for the quality 2 the professionalism was seriously lacking in service presentation of the wine list focused on the price and not the taste pallets and 3 they should get their ego in check - I get that you have a long list of people waiting for tables at your restaurant - but the next time I have a special event I will be going to one of the dozens of restaurants in the valley and receive the level of service that should come with the ambiance and food
TLC may not look like much from the outside it sits in a far corner of a strip mall and it's got a tiny little storefront and sign but it's a fast-casual concept with moderate prices friendly service and pretty good Vietnamese food too

The food is authentic prices are cheap service is great
The bottom lineGood food reasonable prices
It's absolutely not a place I'd want to go for a date night I'd feel very upset I'd wasted the time and effort getting cute because you probably won't see other human beings - probably why they offer a 20% discount for sit-in dining but its great for good reasonably priced take-out Chinese food

Definitely not a big deal though and we loved all the food we had which was very reasonably priced as well

All in all the dish was a good combination of flavors and adequately priced for the ingredients
Sandwiches aren't cheap - at least $6 for a regular plain turkey sandwich on whole wheat bread - but these guys give you a LOT of good quality turkey on good quality seed wholegrain bread not one of those sandwiches where all you're eating is bean sprouts in dire hopes of actually tasting the deli meat
I like tho place but I think that they are trying to ride on the coat tales of Whole Foods next door but it is a PET supplies store so people aren't going to pay the ridiculous prices that they do on human food At least I won't
Honestly the food is overpriced and I wouldn't go without a groupon deal on the tickets which they have available like every month but the overall experience was fun and definitely worth it

The food and drink not to mention the happy hour prices make this place more than worth it

It has gotten more expensive and the quality of pizza has gone down
Overall very nice service  - they had no problems splitting our tab with the other person we went to lunch with - and pretty decent food for the price

I called to see if they would even return an opened bag of expensive dog food and they said YES
The first time I ate here I didn't have a memorable experience because the food was not bad but there are so many good taco shops and Mexican food restaurants in central Phoenix that are less expensive
I would say overall the food was fair but it was about $5-$10 more in price point per plate than it should have been
I would say its better than pizza hut and domino's but not better then Grimaldis although the prices are comparable
The other dishes on the menu while tasty are a little on the expensive side for me $10-$12 and not in portions large enough to justify spending that much
Excellent authentic Chinese food quick and friendly service and just about as cheap as it is possible for a restaurant to be
As others have pointed out here it's a Hong Kong style diner meaning a kind of cheap no-frills let's grab some food on the way home kind of place with Cantonese comfort food joke chow fun rice bowls and Chinese interpretations of western dishes

This is a bit pricey considering where it's located but not over priced for the food quality
I enjoyed the food but the surly slow service coupled with the expensive menu items make this spot a poor value in spite of the lovely old house and charming patio in which the restaurant is situated
And yes it's a bit pricey to buy a beer or any sort of food item but that is also expected
HOWEVER for the price the sushi is pretty good
They do pizzas  soups  salads  Sandwiches  pasta and entrees and the most expensive meal is $13
You realize why when you see the pricey beer and food vendors inside
The food is a bit pricey but you get what you pay for here
Las Glorias has awesome dishes at very reasonable prices
I can't wait to try the specially-priced fish tacos on Wednesdays along with a Corona
Not so it was built like a cheap fast food joint minus the drive through
Probably won't ever go back unless it's for happy hour since this place is just so expensive but the food was quite good
I have been coming here for about 5 years and I love the food the service and the price
The food was ready very quickly and the total price was good for the area around $10 for the three items
This place has great food and service and I really love the fact that they have so many microbrews on tap and wines by the glass at reasonable prices
Prices are a little higher than a Subway but their meat is freshly sliced to order and they do a much better job with their bread
You can stuff yourself with some pretty tasty appetizers and sushi rolls or sake bomb the work day away for some wallet welcoming prices
Their dinner is alright and some rolls aren't really worth the full price tag
The prices have gone up with their menu changes but we're willing to pay for the organic meats etc
Joe's delivers great value despite the high prices because the food is that good
The food was boring the service was unfriendly and almost non existent parking was lousy the food is overpriced and the ambiance if any was drowned out by the incessant blaring music
The food is always great service even better and the prices just perfect
Often I leave other locations with one or two extra meals for the same price and food quality
While the appetizers and desserts are yummy I've can easily have similar items as delicious at much cheaper restaurants
Salmon with Wild Blueberry Sauce - GREAT salmon for the price - blueberry sauce was really tastyBeef Short Rib - Very very tender beef
Prices were reasonable I think we paid somewhere around $11 for a large pizza
PROS Reasonable pricesComfortable atmosphereFamily owned local businessCONS Too much sauceCrust is just okayTook longer than expected to get our foodBOTTOM LINEI'd eat at Nello's again if I were in the area but there are certainly better choices for pizza in the Valley
The pizza is good the prices are good and it's a fun casual spot
It was a little pricey but I also felt that for the price you got a TON of food
But the fact is the food is bland over-priced and the service is bad
She rolls her eyes throws her hand onto her hip and goes off on some tangent about how Thai food is different than other food and is more expensive and that they don't take items off the bill no matter what the complaint
I thought the prices sounded great before getting the food but thought they were even better once I saw how much food you get
The prices were definitely too high and the food was generally bad
Prices are great the portions are abundant and the food is tasty
Happy hour prices are more than fair and the Caterpillar and Spicy Tuna rolls are some of the best I've found
The pizza was ok and a little over priced
The food is very cheap most items under $6 for a lot of very good flavorful food
Prices are definitely on the cheaper side and they have some new-ish options of making your salad a 'Junior' size for a few bucks less and it's STILL a ton of food
And because of that I imagine some may see Roka as too expensive for the amount of food served per dish unless you have a GrouponNonetheless this place is a must-go
It was just some strips of cheap beef and chicken with some sauce
The food has remained delicious and the lunch specials are priced right the lamb vindaloo I had there on 4th July was awesome but there's something that pissed me right off when I ordered takeout recently
That's WAY too expensive no matter how tasty the food is
Im tired of paying for the more expensive chicken meal and getting a cheap classic chicken sandwich or asking for no-onions on the kids burgers and have to scrape them off when i get home
Food is outrageously expensive small portions no seasoning
$68 for 2 adults and 2 kids no drinks or dessert and one less expensive kids meal is crazy
I thought the food was great for the price so long as you don't do anything bigger than a double and hurt yourself and the staff was very friendly
The place is fun the food is good  and the price is great
The food was on the pricey side but the quality was apparent
Chinese Gourmet has ROLLED BACK the PRICES
Food prices are similar to any outside restaurant
Although it feels inexpensive based on the location and the atmosphere the food is upscale
I'm not sure why anyone would go to some big chain place when the food is fairly priced and so delicious here
I don't buy food here because I like to cook my own food but when I do its on Monday and I have not been able to find such a great burger for such a great price
If that isn't enough the prices and great food will keep you coming back
The owner gladly pulled off a tray of fresh colorful salad and gave me a great price since I had purchased so much food there
5-ish star review because for AZ and the price this sushi menu is pretty decent
The service is polite the food is very good and the price is reasonable
The flip side to the food was the portion to price ratio
However if you're looking for a broad variety of good Thai food cooked to your liking at a very reasonable price come on in and pull up one of the leatherette bar stools
The food was way over priced for it's quality
Overall perhaps next time I would pick a better sandwich or even try their delicious looking quiche but definitely would come here for the desserts  However I must say they are pretty expensive
The prices were good but I didn't try the food
Give me a rude waiter some fantastic food and reasonably fair prices and like a Vietnamese hooker I love you long time
I'm not rich so shopping at a place like Whole Foods with such a huge selection and an even huger price tag isn't going to happen
The food isnt that great and the beer is cheaper is most other establishments where management is generally nicer
And while we did get some good food while we were there it wasn't worth the ticket price but if the beer we drank was free then it could have worked
The reason I capitalized SPORTS above is because you can not expect great food at a SPORTS bar it should be ok to good and cheap
+++'s FREE fast WiFi so you can check the scores and your girl that's with you who gets bored after the 1st Qtr can social network; OK cheap sports bar food breakfast burritos & other stuff before 11a and under $9; plenty of TV's; plenty of seating if you get there early; friendly although not speedy wait staff who put Hooters girls to shame; good relatively clean crowd although a little more than a healthy dose of the mid-western/north-eastern boys who think their team is THEIR team and those mid-west girls with the witch-chin beady eyes thin plucked brows stark nose and brown straight bob that wear banana republic clothes they're still hot and I'd take one on the chin for 'em
Bottom line is you get a lot of high quality food for a great price my order was $9
Here is everything my friend got for $180 plus free bag of treats- dog crate75 pound dog- new toys- huge bones/rawhide- the long stick thing that throws the balls for you i dont know the name lol- economy size shampoo- economy pack of beggin strips- breath freshener- brush and comb- 6ft leash-food and water bowl they only get four stars bc the hours are super difficult we had to schedule time off work to go they close at 4 and aren't open on weekends and because the prices aren't listed on anything so you have to constantly flip through this huge catalog to find prices
Atmosphere service the food prices drinks
There are better neighborhood sports bars throughout Scottsdale and Phoenix with better food cheaper drinks and more relaxed for watchng sports
It's cheap food and a lot of it but I'm not a pig although I do have my times and I don't want to feed from a trough
I'm not a sushi expert by any stretch but suffice to say that the rolls here are well-priced fresh-tasting and overall pretty damn delicious with good presentation
We usually mix and match our way around and right now they're running a happy day 4pm-9pm special on a lot of their rolls which makes them cheaper by $1-$3 each
Half price drinks appetizers & house maki get the chicken gyoza - you're welcome in advance
The cha gio egg rolls are some of the best I've had though at $5 for two I'm wondering why the soup is relatively cheap
Although the food is good the customer service is abysmal and the prices are way too high
The place is always clean and or being cleaned the prices are great the food is awesome and there is barely any wait to get your food
I've been here several times over the years and pretty much everything to be said has been said on other's Yelp reviews but here is my overview1 - all the food is great portions good and priced decently2 - make a reservation - the place gets busy3 - the place is loud as heck
Because I just can't stand  the lady who owns and runs it and cooks your way-too-overpriced food
The food is pricey go to Schlotzky's across the street for better value
The Asians who run it are always very pleasant also cook basics think burger hot dog burrito fresh sandwiches wrapped up etc and their prices are really reasonable for on-the-go food
They are more of a mini-Circle-K with a small corner where they make food more diverse options than Central Cafe all fresh and all pretty cheap for a downtown Phoenix office building shop
The food is reasonably priced but not all that good
You can get much better food across the street for similar prices
Both times I've been here the service is mediocre sloooow and the food is overpriced and lacking in flavor
That was nice & the service was attentive but the food is a little blah overall & the price is a little high at $9
The prices seemed  OK but the pizza didn't look all that wonderful- I guess they're selling the organ music
Secondly while I liked the food I thought it was overpriced for what we got
The people were friendly the food was tasty and generous the atmosphere was happenin' though the ordering process was tricky to figure out at first and the pizza-by-the-slice prices were definitely fair
I ordered sushi from the place mat menu and since it doesn't list prices I thought it would be more reasonable than $12
Besides the price and quantity this dish was delicious
This place is not cheap but the quality of the food and drinks make for  good value in my opinion
The prices definitely do not reflect the atmosphere as you'd certainly expect more expensive drinks and food when you first walk in and see the place
Service was top notch and as many other reviewers noted their prices are unbelievably low for the quantity and quality of food that you get
The combos offer a lot of food at a very affordable price and may prove to be perfect for someone trying Indian faire for the first time
You get chicken rice salad & a few orange wedges - perfect portion for lunch and it's almost cheaper than bringing your own lunch to work
While their food isn't five star worthy it's pretty damn good for the price and the fast-casual model
Their pre-packaged meals are pretty tasty and cheaper than a fast food combo
The food is still pretty good and so are the prices
Prices after pasty dessert and 2 20oz beers and tip was just around 27 if I remember correctly
But watching him deal with people who are overwhelmed by the menu in the middle of the lunch rush would be worth the price of admission even if the food wasn't so good
If you go in expecting an inexpensive fast-food lunch you won't be disappointed
Either way for the price I know you can get better Italian food
The Good Location views prices The Bad Food
THE GOOD aka the foodIf you've been to another Roku or even a Nobu the menu will look familiar as will the prices
Food is a bit overpriced especially for Mexican food and in Arizona where you can get just as good for a bit lower priced than Los
Oh of course drinks and food are retardedly expensive
Like I said their prices are way too steep for the food and subpar service
Different types of meat depending on which dish you chose but they're all about the same price
I was surprised visiting from the Bay Area that prices at this place which resembles a semi-fast food establishment were so high
Food and drinks can get pricey but they have to pay for the atmosphere in one way or another
If it doesn't end up being a great spot for dinner it still might prove a great lunch place for standard Thai food at good prices
get the duck to start but look the portions are on the small side and the fresh fish starter is skimpy for the price but really good
I usually eat at fast/cheap Mexican places because I am not a fan of places like Garcias macayos Arriba etc but I have been looking for a good/authentic sit down Mexican food restaurant for a while
The food was good not awesome but tasty and reasonably priced
Great food great ambiance and at an affordable and fair price
We love the fact that this is not a large chain restaurant and has excellent food at a price that will keep us returning
The menu merely lists each dish with a price
And there are no descriptions of any of the desserts just names and prices
As for the food my four companions and I all agreed that it was overpriced for the quality
Lunch specials are still kind of pricey for what you got $13 Small rolls and I would say below than average tasting sushi
There are places nearby that have better prices bigger rolls and mainly just better tasting sushi
from the very basic looks of this place you're thinking you could get some cheap southern food for maybe $6-$7
Fast service tasty food good prices - all in this relatively modest restaurant in a  quiet strip mall across the street from ASU West
I wouldnt shop here too much for food but the wines are insanely cheap
but it doesnt i think it smells like an old persons house i would give it a 3 for the atmosphere its cool to go see a sporting event there or go there for trivia night which is lots of fun and i would give its food 5 stars in particular their hamburgers for their price they just cant be beat theyre just delicious and the seasoned fries are always tasty fresh and crispy
They treat you like a king great food at a much more reasonable price than durants
This is a great place to enjoy some sushi or a have a few drinks without having to endure the plasticity or prices of the 'Dale
The best part is that it's not that pricey and you get a TON of food
No way can you beat the happy hour prices for this sushi
Not super cheap but like I said more food than I would normally order at once
A little spendy for lunch served in stryo while seated on a bench but it was fun and I will order a little differently next time so it won't be as expensive and I won't order more food than I can eat
Blackened Mahi sandwich tasted good but overpriced for the little amount of fish I got
The California Chicken sandwich also tasted good and was much more reasonably priced
The best part is the food is relatively inexpensive our meal was $32 for the 3 of us you can't go wrong with that
Prices are steep but considering how much food you get I guess the value is there
I felt like the food was mediocre for the expensive price
Again the prices were way too much for below par food and the amount of plate filler is unacceptable
Bad food high prices and poor service pretty much sums up this gem
The food is real cheap and just a typical diner food with good sandwiches and soups
Still love the cheap food and cute hackable furniture though
Granted you have included tip and tax in the individual price so I don't have to bother w/ the icky math but $23 seems high for sandwiches a few savories scones and some desserts
So the food is amazing and well-priced the service is prompt and consistent the staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating
Being that I've resigned myself to never again eating the great cheap Mexican food I had in Chicago or even in Madison I might have just lowered my standards -- but I think that Rosa's serves inexpensive and tasty food
Prices went up from there for the various fish dishes but I can't really judge those without trying them
I've been to the Asian Cafe Express four times now and I can't help the fact that the prices are so incredibly affordable for the amount of food that you get

The Beef with Broccoli was just ok but for the price I couldn't complain
the drinks ARE cheap and strong the food is actually delicious
Food is excellent service is good and the prices can't be beat
So In short i would say the food is better at Chuhgajib and a little cheaper than Hodori but the win was not as good
The decor was pretty blah and the pizza on the menu I felt was on the expensive side
And if you're comparing it to Whole Foods oh my gosh everything is probably at least $10 cheaper
We walked into this taco shop late one Friday night after a party hoping to soak up the alcohol with some cheap Mexican food
Their prices are on par with most fast food restaurants and unlike KFC their chicken doesn't upset my stomach
The food is very tasty the tempura squash was exquisite but it's a little on the expensive side for what you get
If they hadn't plastered their walls with newspaper reviews exalting how cheap their eats were I would probably be a bit more accommodating but more than ten bucks for a fast foodie burger meal just ain't on
Otaku is a little pricey though so it might not be for our weekly sushi run but I hope they'll stick around for a long time
I'll stick with my Ole Brass Rail for great traditional breakfast food on the cheap
The food is delicious and the price is right
The people are friendly and the food is cheap but I'd be willing to pay a bit more for one thing that really lacked in my experience - FLAVOR
Prices are VERY low for the quality and quantity of food received
The food as dinner wasn't worth the $70 price tag
It's too bad because Phoenix could use a GOOD cheap Seafood place
You get so much food for such a resonable price
The best thing about this restaurant besides its very authentic and yummy food and quick - never a wait - service is that it is cheap cheap cheap
*Good prices and tasty bar foodI will definitely be back
Decent happy hour prices and the food is so-so
The portions were pretty big and it's funny how prices fluctuate from 8$ the soup to 30$ the fish specials
The prices are barely more than the fast food burger places
In fact the prices are extremely reasonable especially when considering the quality of the food
The prices are okay on food - as a comparison Blue Buffalo which is also carried by Petsmart and Petco is a few dollars cheap for the 30# bag
I've had amazing food and its not always expensive usually not
Prices are pretty good really good if you hit it weekdays for lunch special - and lunch special includes General Tso's Chicken for fans of that

The food is reasonably priced and the portions are decent
not to badly priced There beerbatered cheese is amazing on the pizza
Overall it was very reasonable priced and the food was average
It's just such a shame the food is so lackluster and expensive the menu is so pitiful before games the hours are so freakin stupid and there are no happy hour or game day drink specials to get me warmed up for the passion and the pride I need to bring to a game
The prices are reasonable the food is absolutely delicious and the ambiance is pleasantly modern without being too hipster douchey in your face
Delicious food relatively low prices and decent enough service
take your Scottsdale flash and all of that money that you are making on that over priced sushi and RETRAIN your staff
Having just moved here from the Pacific Northwest where these sushi track type restaurants are as ubiquitous as Starbucks I actually seek these places out due to their prices usually being very reasonable; I try to eat sushi 3-5 times per week
These however were just scooped and fried round balls of cheap crab meat mixed with soem breading
Prices are what you'd expect from a high-end resort restaurant with great food excellent service and wonderful atmosphere
The ranchera spinach was fresh tasting but didn't have too much flavor; the mole was good but the sauce needed to simmer longer to help smooth out the flavors and the Veracruz style with a tomatillo sauce and cotija cheese was excellent with gooey cheese and nice chunks of chicken and plenty of spinach all rolled in what seemed to be a housemade fresh corn tortilla all this plus soft drinks and 20+ percent tip for only $18 a piece can't be beat for the price in the area
They are friendly customer service oriented and work at producing great food for a good price
Exactly what a dining-out experience is about  - good food reasonable prices and welcoming environment
The prices are roughly on par with the vastly superior RA Sushi restaurant but because they're both pretentious and puerile they will arbitrarily decide to tack on gratuity at a whim as well as various taxes to punish customers
not very expensive but you get a ton of food for your money spent
They have slices for lunch which are a great deal very cheap and you won't have to wait an hour to eat pizza
The lunch portion is big enough and the dinner portions tend to be a little pricey for bar food
Although a bit pricey for what you get the pizza was very good
The food was very good and the prices were reasonable
Their sushi is usually pretty good and they are by far the cheapest place around for it
I have eaten here and had dinner to go it always takes forever and it is not cheap I expect cheaper if theres no atmosphere or really good food would make up for it
Place just lacks consistency - and since it is definitely not a cheap outing Spend about $80 food ~2 hours bowling etc for family of 4 I would expect more
If you or the person you take out knows and loves authentic & very fresh sushi at very reasonable prices then this is the place to go
no way people who started at 9am are going to hang around in the desert sun eating overpriced hotdogs and hamburgers all day they don't allow you to bring in outside food or beverage
The food was good quite authentic and fairly priced
Yummy pizza at a yummy priceD I never eat my crust because it's usually never good enough
i feel like ray's is a little more pricey than other similar pizza joints but i rarely care
The one exception was the poolside restaurant - In addition to being overpriced the food there was disgusting
I couldn't believe how inexpensive dinner was for 3 people and all the food plus drinks we had
Instead my review is based on the fact that it is not really quality food and definitely not fair priced
Another friend recommended this place and it was a nice spot for a cheap drink and decent food
This type of food is not expensive to make nor difficult to prepare so I think $4
For the price the portions do seem like your typical small fancy food plates but I ended up being completely full at the end
Great prices for delicious food that is still perfectly edible for many days
The prices are low the people are very friendly and the food is great
The food concessions were surprisingly good not overly expensive $8 and freshly made and 20oz soda were only $3
Mediocre food overhyped overpriced no parking bad service and waaaaaaaaay too many people to enjoy yourself
Also don't expect New Mexico prices but for me the food was worth the prices

Great food great prices and great service even when the place is busy - no wonder this place is so popular
And what would be a price fix course at Vincent's without our knowledge a complimentary dessert arrived
All in all gourmet prices for pizza that doesn't measure up
I prefer to bring my own food and snacks plus I can entertain myself with a book or iPad movie no need for them to provide entertainment and raise the price of a ticket
Don't expect anything but some comfort food for a reasonable price
The decor is appealing the food is decent for the price the service is friendly and all in all is a good experience
Overall overpriced for the taste of the food
Prices are fair for the amount of food given3
Over all the food was awesome and the prices were great
lots of food for pretty cheap and it's actually pretty decent by bar food standards
We were very very pleased with the food over-all and will most definitely go back even though it was more expensive
Our sushi & service was great AND it was a cheap dinner
The decor was nice but the sushi was overpriced and you didn't get a lot for what you paid for
I am also a HUGE fan of their freezer section you can get everything you need for a tasty and cheap dinner so those nights you don't feel like cooking the frozen food is a god send
Prices on drinks and food were reasonable and I would probably compare the food style to Serrano's in the East Valley
I would absolutely go here for Happy Hour for the discounted prices on the amazing food too
The atmosphere is cool and the prices are extremely reasonable for the quality of the food
Service was quite good portions were large we each took some food home and priced were OK for the quality
Price  Not badService GoodAtmosphere  GreatFood  GreatWhile slightly more costly than I'd pay for a typical sandwich lunch it's worth the cost
If you missed that banner made for a cheap dessert for my gf on her bday
The prices change based on your selection but for about $6 to $8 you'll walk away with a pretty generous sized roll
But considering it's fresh fish it's not expensive
It's way too expensive for what little meat you get but it's an awful lot of fun
I know some people like to go for the 'cheapest' most basic rolls for sushi like spicy tuna/california but I would highly recommend their specialty rolls What the Heck is my fav as they are really creative/unique and very very tasty
I usually go for Happy Hour; Majerle's undoubtedly has the best after work prices on both beers and food of anywhere I've been in the Valley
The location is great the people are fun and fun to watch as are the TVs the food and service are both very good the prices are outstanding the Bocce Ball is different and it's always packed
At first I was skeptical looking at the size of the bag & its price tag but as she explained off the top of her head the ingredients and even her own cat's experience with the food I was sold
Overall it is not a cheap meal but good fish rarely is
The pizza overall is a bit pricey drinks are not bottomless and this is absolutely no place to go if you are in a hurry to get somewhere after you eat
East coast atmosphere and east coast food  on the expensive side for being a cheesesteak dive but it's worth it since you cant get them anywhere else in this stinkin' desert
My only suggestion to AYCE newbies is to order the more expensive rolls first
We just put all our rolls on the first sheet and we got the cheaper rolls like California roll and spicy tuna out first
Then after a good amount of time they brought the smaller more expensive Pancho topped with spicy tuna and the soft shell crab rolls
It is not a big deal if you have an unlimited appetite but you might as well get the more pricey rolls with AYCE
I popped in here several times a week to pick up staples it was always an adventure to see which prices had been marked down-- they even have a section in cold foods where they mark older stuff way down
Check out frozen foods too-- there are reasonably priced items like tempura and special organic seafood dishes I never found anywhere else
When I took my young cousin there the price for the food we bought was brilliant
Great food great prices great service great space
I guess the only caveat is we never have a to-go box of the delicious food to take home ; Also if you like wine the owner has other bottles that aren't on his list and he prices them well
I ended up with a chicken breast about 2 by 2 in size with two onion slices and two pepper slices and 13 pickles on the side charged full price though
What's even better is that the mini desserts are really reasonably priced so if you are looking for a dessert for someone to celebrate a birthday anniversary whatever this is a great place to go
Prices aren't horrible given the fact you're not getting a pink sludge burger like most fast food places
Also the pizza is not bad the prices are fair the salads taste fresh and the place is bright and welcoming with comfy hotel room art and a steady flow of people getting their orders to-go perhaps to avoid my hero server
I pay attention to the service I do and while normally I might scoff at her unpleasant attitude and smoker's voice for some reason I find her and this place a fascinating destination for a cheap pizza lunch and an interesting experience
Just another overpriced Scottsdale restaurant where more money was spent on decor than food creation and beauty in the servers is clearly more important than the service itself
Pearl is an anomaly in Scottsdale- a reasonably-priced quality bar/sushi place that doesn't discriminate
I think AJ's Fine Foods is better and less expensive
Because I eat a lot at least 5 dishes for myself alone you can see how that begins to rack up a pretty lil' bill with these new prices approx $4 for small and $6 for medium
Anyhow the bowl didn't fit nearly as much food as other places I guess it's good I didn't over -stuff myself but the price was higher and that whole  meat product area was really bad
Besides the meat which was delicious but served in very small portions it was substandard especially for the price
* The staff is really friendly* They offer a bunch of varieties of pho an pack the veggie pho with lots of broccoli and bokCons* It's not located in the best area of Tempe* The broth wasn't extremely flavorful definitely beef based* You get a small portion for the price of the pho
The food is great-and relatively cheap-no it's not Filly B's eww
I have been here several times over the past few years and other than being overpriced the food and service was always good

The food was OK the drinks were OK although a little on the expensive side
The prices are reasonable the food is good and the service is top notch
I loved everything about our dining experience from the service to the meal except compared to the many restaurants I've eaten at I thought it was over-priced even for the high-quality of their food
I was hoping this sketch area could provide some decent cheap pizza but I was wrong
If u can go for lunch the dishes are cheaper than dinner and they are still very decently sized
It's a little more expensive than Ranch Market Food City Sunflower or Sprouts but on an item-by-item comparison you can definitely very easily save over Basha's Fry's or Safeway and you can DEFINITELY DEFINITELY save over fresh produce options like Whole Foods AJ's or Trader Joe's
Will definitely go back again if not for the food then for the decent prices during happy hour and the atmosphere
In the end it's just overpriced ridiculously sized chain food
Whole Food is too expensive to have this low of quality and bad customer service
PEARL sushi is good sushi for a tolerable price and has great employees that look happy to be there
Food wasn't good at all specially for the price
Anyway we don't go here too much because it's kind of pricey but for a quieter sort of special evening sit on the patio in the comfy outdoor seating and be sure to order the chocolate cake dessert
So Brooklyn NYC pizza is the place we go to for cheap food
It was similarly priced but the food was definitely better than your typical cheaper breakfast joint
Although the food is good I do wish the food wasn't as expensive as it was

I must tell you that if you order the food there is no special prices for the drinks
The price is reasonable for the amount of food that they give and the owners are always nice
It wasn't $3 like everyones Monday night burger but that is the price I must pay for not eating beef
We had a large party of six and ended up waiting close to an hour- so show up early for that cheap beef
The food seems reasonably priced for the geographic location which isn't necessarily cheap but hell it's Scottsdale after all
The sushi prices were neither exorbitant nor cheap

Sure it's expensive but the quality of the service and food is superb
It's a treat but you certainly leave feeling like you got your money's worth or close to it because it's hard to eat that much food as it is a bit on the pricey side
We usually order them a $12-15 pizza FOR EACH and then tell the cashier to take all the expensive ingredients off which they do and we end up with a very expensive cheese pizza

The food comes out quick and is decently priced
For the price and ok food you will enjoy
Look this is the deal if you're hankering for fish and chips imo the best disclaimer - still new here so there may be a better cheaper alternative I don't know about is Shakespeare's on Val  Vista

There isn't a food court or cheap eats as is usually a staple of malls but rather upscale restaurants
WAY overpriced and really run of the mill pizza found the crust to be tasteless and boring and really feel ho hum about the whole meal including the hummus
The Sushi was definitely up to par and tasting delicious plus the prices are excellent
95 price range with the seafood add ins like crab costing a little more
The only thing which keeps it from getting five stars is that the $25 price is a bit high and it lacks sushi which I've come to expect at buffets
The price was very reasonable for the amount of food that we got
Otherwise the food is actually very fairly priced - eSPECially considering how AMAZING the atmosphere and ambiance are
The food is a little pricey considering the portions are not huge like Filiberto's or Carolina's Extra Yummy
all kinds of good clean hippie fun So all in all The Farm has absolutely delectable fresh invigorating food that isn't all that pricey and even though you may have to wait a lil while for a table at peak brunch times it usually turns into a lovely stroll through the gardens and fun shops fairly painless in my point of view
I spent almost a week in Phoenix on a work assignment for Global Dance TV and visited this Target numerous times to buy food comprehensive grocery section toiletries they've got everything and it's way cheaper than at a drug store and even Legos I'm going to argue that they were for someone else but you're not going to believe me even though it's true
price is affordable and the menu distinctly not run of the mill mexican food

Good cheap Mexican food but like a previous comment it gets harder and harder to keep going back
The prices have gone up I thought with gas going down the transportation costs would go down lowering the price of food
They also have omlets made to order for around the same price and if you wan meat added to that it will be an exta dollar
The food is great the prices are super and the customer service is unbeatable
The food was reasonably priced for a sit down restaurant
The food was pricey- our lunch ended up being almost $40 for the 2 of us- but it was good
a hole in the wall restaurant with good food and service would get 5 stars to me but a pricey steakhouse with amazing ambiance but ok food and good service would get 4

The chef making our pizza was nicer than the woman with the frown frozen to her face and only spoke to tell us the price of our large pepperoni with wings
I highly doubt that I was just grumpy that day because I'm never grumpy on Smunch day but the prices seemed a little extreme for the amount and quality of food
I'm not one to go out of my way to write a bad review unless the place really deserves it and sadly this steakhouse certainly does due to the quality of food price and service

So riddle me this How is it that on a menu where no item is more than 14 bucks all items very well priced by the way that the special fish is f-ing 25 dollars
Seriously had the fish been priced closer to the rest of the entree's the anger I am spewing currently would be much less vitriolic
The dishes are small but they are are also inexpensive at $6-10 each
The final tab for two entrees a couple glasses of wine and dessert were still notably cheaper than a comparable dinner in Las Vegas
The food was always fantastic even if a bit overpriced
The staff was nice food was good prices reasonable establishment was clean
They serve pizza by the slice or a whole pie if you want the portions are big not like some other pizza places kids will have to cut 1 slice in half just to be able to pick it up the price is comparable to the hut about 19$ for a large but I mean large
It's a very upscale place but they have or had when I went reasonable prices on food
Great service great food great prices
Somehow the place just doesn't fit but the food is good and inexpensive
It is a little pricey $88 before groupon discount for 1 appetizer 2 entrees and 1 dessert and coffee but totally worth it
It's not cheap fast food but you get what you pay for
Hana prices their sushi at high grade prices but serves sushi made from standard grade fish thus
Added edit   Hana does offer sushi from 'wild' sakesalmon at the higher price of $10; that price is more than a little expensive and as I didn't try it I don't know if it has more fat/flavor than the 'regular' sake they serve
This was one hell of a Pizza and a great price to boot
The food can be crap and over priced but if they take care of you alls well
Good thing their prices are so great otherwise I'd end up in the poor house because every time they post the nights specials with a picture of whichever Delicious dish they are featuring I am sold
I typically order the Filet or I go for the Chicken if I'm feeling cheap
The prices seem reasonable when you sit down there are different price points for the different sauce options red/white/pesto and a large pizza is base priced at $18

Overall the pizza service and ambiance are good though it's overpriced in my mind
Anyways so the coffee is pretty great and the food was decent but I think it's a bit pricey for what you get

Bad service  bad food  small portions of over priced bad food
The drinks are a bit pricey and skip on the food
The food was great very fresh reasonably priced and it was a perfect atmosphere for families with kids or even a date
There were two reasons I did not rate it a 5 star;  1  the restaurant is clean and nice looking but a bit crammed with tables - in addition to the conversation I had with my family I got to enjoy the conversations of the people on the tables to the right and the left of me and  2  Although the prices are not bad - the place is not cheap $10 to $14 not including tip and tax or so for a meal including a glass of kool-aid and it sort of seems like the sort of food you should be bragging about how much food you got for the money
Sapna seems like it should be excellent cheap healthy food in a unique triangle-shaped setting

Granted the prices of these items are SIGNIFICANTLY higher than the prices at Whole Foods
The food here is quite good as far as Chandler goes but you could get better and more at the same price elsewhere if you were willing to drive a little

Pizza - 5 stars great sauce great crust cooked right great price
Food was OK Denny's quality prices were descent
I don't believe in ratings based on price you get what you pay for the food at Modern Steak is excellent but I do only give it 4 stars for originality steak places with mac and cheese and asparagus are a dime a dozen
The food wasn't any tastier for $60 bucks than the $20 we spent at the Peledrago which had lower prices and the same menu also owned by the resort
I liked the pizza more then I thought I would and that is good given the high price they charge for it
Despite that we did have a good time and once my job situation gets more secure so it is not so painful overpaying for pizza I do plan on going back for some really good overpriced pizza
It came off a little crowded which means one of two things the food is really good or the place that is merely convenient and cheap

Margs sangria and their specialty cocktails are all $5 beers are on special and there's a good selection of food priced for happy hour

location rather than one of the cheapest food products to make  which usually  costs under 2
We stopped in to get take out because they do not have an online menu and we were rather pleasantly surprised by the quality and flavor of the food not to mention the great prices

I like the chicken sandwich but I'd pass on their quesadillas since for the price you pay it's sort of a meager meal
We didn't mind because we really liked the dish esp the black moss which is a more expensive and rare ingredient
We had a variety of appetizer plates - mac n cheese crab cakes chicken & waffles - that were way overpriced and just average at best
Dinner was a little pricey but for the great quality of food and service I'd say that it was worth it
The prices were average but the rolls were a fair bit bigger than your standard fish joint
Atmosphere feels like you are in a tiki hut off some island The food have not had dinner here but I can make a dinner out of coconut shrimp egg rolls and at Happy hour Prices

95 and literally was 4 slices about 1x3 inch pieces- far from worth the price and not the best sashimi grade fish I've had
Otherwise for the two of us lunch was $50 with tip- kinda pricey but the servings were decently large and food was excellent quality
Visit one  good sandwich lots of food for the price relatively quick but no ice and soda was warm
For a chinese buffet they really put a lot of thought into the dishes they made and not just stick with the trademark cheap chinese buffet dishes like sweet and sour pork
I wouldn't say the food here was super excellent this is Arizona after all and there are some great Mexican places but it was good and the prices were reasonable and the service was prompt and cheerful
The food smelled delicious but I can't comment anymore on it since I did not eat anything but the happy hour prices were fantastic includes both food and drinks and it doesn't get too crowded
There's also a small but decent selection of sake and beer here and prices are very reasonable compared to other sushi spots in town

The food and drink are also priced nicely
Any of a number of places are cheaper and better True Food Outback Steakhouse In-N-Out Burger Pei Wei

2 reasons - 1food quality 2 price1 When a place serves only sandwiches you'd think they'd pay attention to their bread

A buffet overcrowed with blue hairs and sweaty tourists a loud and bustling buffet with high prices and mediocre food
I love that they have different flavors for edamame cheap bombers and did I mention the fish sticks are way to good
Two things I know they get from Costco and then just put on a plate for way more than the original price are the cinnamon roll bites and the black bean burger
Pitchers were cheap food was good bar food we had the chicken nachos
Plenty of food great menu and amazing happy hour prices
Although the prices were a little bit on the higher side hovering around 10 bucks a dish including bottomless coffee it was well worth it
Good food good service moderate prices
The only reason I give it 4 stars is because I don't believe the quality of food and service match the prices

The food is priced reasonably and of great quality it doesn't get better than that for me
The food was cheap and it was evident in the taste and presentation
I don't think I've seen pizza priced that cheaply since college
that as well as pregame meal and drinks elsewhere cut down on spending for overpriced and mediocre food and drinks in arena

Overall a pleasurable meal with wonferul service and presentation but for the price they could really up the quality of the food
The sushi is not good the rice in our dish was hard and the food was way overpriced
and their recently-emptied location Culinary Dropout moved in to offer great American food at reasonable prices

While I enjoy the food I felt it to be a bit over priced
Their food is also overpriced but it is always a fun time having your food cooked for you as you sit around the table and are entertained by the chef
I forgot how pricey it can be $11 for just that one dish but was pleasantly surprised by the portion size
Pacing and food and price couldn't be beat
Update Went for dinner this time and the service wasn't near as good prices were much higher than food value and as such it wasn't worth the bill price
To summarize Like the food love the drinks really love the prices
Does it have good food for a good price quick friendly service and a good casual atmosphere

The fact that they have quick small cheap portions of sushi to go on the side if fantastic

The more fat is collected in the muscle is going to be harder to trim therefore the price of that meat is going to be cheaper because of the excess fat in the muscle tissues

The food was not great and was overpriced
The prices were reasonable and all the food fresh and delicious especially the pastries
I probably have had better pizza in town but it was still good and for the prices such a great deal
They offer great bar food at great prices
But without the sit down comfort food prices
I wish they made their desserts in smaller portions for a cheaper price
I even heard some guys complaining the price and quality of food outside when I was walking toward my car
The tuna tasted fine - I think they put some lemon in it and maybe there's an olive or two pulverized beyond recognition into the paste - but it's no better than when I open a can of albacore at home and add a little horseradish or curry or what have you and slap some water chestnuts on top - or when I go to Subway and pile black olives tomato and cheese on a larger cheaper sub  on admittedly inferior bread
Maybe it's the quality of meat but I really can't complain it was very reasonably priced

Food is delicious authentic and cheap
Anyways the food was fan-damn-tastic and worth the price
The prices are a dollar or so more than I was expecting to pay but due to the fact that the only people who work there that I have seen are the owners and the fact that it is one of the only place I have found with non rolled Japanese cuisine not to mention a humber of Vegetarian friendly meals I am willing to pay whatever they want of me
It is one of my favorite pizzeria's usually get Sicilian style same prices as a regular slice of pizza but i get toppings of sausage's $

We will continue to eat here once a week because of how nice the family is that owns the place  the good prices and the good food
My recommendations for dimsum Everything - at the great prices it's worth trying everything - My recommendations for entree's if you're not into dimsum  - Fish with Chinese vegetables- West Lake Soup- Noodle Soup with Chicken and Fish- MaPo Tofu- Walnut Shrimp- Kung Pao Chicken
The food serving/ price is real good considering their small bowls of soup are huge
The food just wasn't cheap enough to explain away the bland and terrible taste of it
I consider the prices here to be a bit high for Thai food as I've had so much great Thai food for very reasonable prices
She was able to split the bill per couple bring the food and drinks in a can't say timely because it's too close to spendy or pricey So She was on it is all I have to say
Only beef  The pastries we tried the blueberry muffins and the cinnamon roll are obviously brought in and were waaaaaay overpriced and nowhere near up to the standards of the rest of the food
The food isn't anything to write home about which makes the prices a little hard to justify but it is consistently adequate
Either drop your prices to make it just a large bar food type menu - or dramatically increase the quality

The prices were ridiculously cheap food was hot and tasty
One complaint I do have is that the food was extremely over priced for what it was in my opinion
They are reasonably priced and most of the people that eat there are on their lunch hour so they do hurry to get your food out
Simply the food was not good and you are over priced
The pizzas all tasted really good but I would not come here again because of the prices of the food here which is the only reason for the two star review
I think the pizzas are also very overpriced
After reading some of the reviews yes - it is a little expensive for breakfast and yes- the food is normal breakfast food but I love that it is a small little breakfast brunch lunch joint
I ordered a bagel and wished I had just gone to TJ and picked up some wild Alaskan lox organic eggs organic bread organic butter and I would have gotten it all for the price of their lox & eggs breakfast plate with plenty of quality food stuffs for 4 other meals
The service is outstanding and the seafood is excellent I've had the sea bass scallops salmon ahi and filet but if you were eating the same food anywhere else I don't think it would stand out relative to the exhorbitant prices
Also considering the food they're serving and the prices the wine list is suprisingly uninspired
Food can be pricey menu is huge and so are the entrees so there's no harm in sharing an entree with a friend
Huge portions great prices and there's so much other things there to compliment the food
Definitely give them a try the prices are great the food is tasty the portions are huge and the value is high
They both seem to have their pros and cons which don't necessarily have to do with the food's flavor but more so personal preferences on texture price Blue Nile is a bit pricier than Lalibella and types of offerings Blue Nile seems to have a more extensive menu than Lalibella
I might have given four stars if I tried a dinner because the dinners at their sister restaurant Saigon Kitchen are pretty good and I know they use sushi grade salmon in their reasonably priced dinner
If you operate under this principle at Hiro Sushi prices will augment
My family is always running around from sporting events to girls scouts to school activites but we still love good mexican food at a good price where we can get in and out quickly
Tiny little I guess that's redundant bar and grill that seems to have a regular following and serves simple yet tasty food at a decent price
When the cashier rang it up it came to 39 dollars and some cents ---- I thought to myself what the heck is going on 13 dollars a person - notice it was only two side dishes ---- I said I thought that sounded like a lot --- and the cashier checked the bill - said that it was right - and then the fellow who brought the food out said - the prices are on the menu - I said I believed him just that it seemed like a lot of money for take out and not very many items
They gave me happy hour prices for drinks but not for my food
I had the blackened chicken pasta and it was a good sized portion good flavor and an all around descent meal for the price
We had a delicious and very reasonably priced wine Primitivo and three starters  to share the deviled eggs with caviar Swedish meatballs and the ahi tuna carpaccio
Undaring dishes with expected flavors delivered witha reasonable price
For those prices you get slightly smaller appetizers and the rolls have four pieces but it's still an amazing deal
I'm not stingy when it comes to food but for that price they should at least gave me a full bowl not a small ice cream scoop of it
Stumbled across Zoes on our way out of town we're touring musicians so fresh fast inexpensive food is super important to us on the road
Went there to try something new I was shocked when the kids behind the counter pulled out plastic bags with meat and sides in them in order to make my place which was priced more than Joe's Real BBQ which a million times better
If you're in the mood for mystery food that sits in a plastic bag all day along with some disgusting sides for a ridiculous price then this is the place for  you
It's seafood so the regular menu is not cheap mexican
They run circles around every other sub place in the incredible variety of choices they offer and their regular sub is substantially larger and meatier than Mike's fresher and a lower price
The portions are insanely huge for the price you pay and well it's great quality Mexican food
If you want real Mexican food at a great price this is the place to go
Do not expect the best service as a past server smaller checks food is cheap means smaller tips and servers are not as frantic to help you out
Not a horrible place for lunch - their food is good - but their recent price increase and changes have pushed them over the edge of a place that's worth going to
the waiter told me there's no lunch special so the regular price of my Drunken Noodle dish was like 12 bucks
Special prices on cocktails beer and few rolls
Located in the old town area I thought that a small family-owned french breakfast place would be the perfect refreshing break from the trendy Read untsss unttsss untss music mimosa-brunch places and overly-priced-food restaurants
I felt the prices were steep considering its SUSHI
That being said expect great sushi at an unbeatable price
Reliably good food and reasonably priced considering location atmosphere and quality of food
Extra bonus points for the large selection of cheap pizza wines
Frankly I was annoyed to see this place fill up with lunch customers while similar Souper Salad right across the freeway is struggling to survive with much tastier hot food & a $3 lower price
Whether you're looking for a generously priced happy hour delivering food far beyond expectation or a gourmet meal without pomp and circumstance Cafe ZuZu delivers
Their food is inexpensive fresh and tasty perfect for college students
so the price combined with the food and the bad service- i won't be going back
Its expensive for the food you receive but worth the novelty of it and the few pictures you leave with
It offers more of the all-around grocery store like Whole Foods but offers prices similar to Trader Joe's and exhibits the healthy all-natural organic products that both Whole Foods and Trader Joe's capitalize on
Bottom line cheaper than Whole Foods more selection than Trader Joe's
Even though it was only $10 to get in the prices for food and drink were so high that we ended up spending way more than we would have if we had just gone barhopping in downtown Scottsdale
Overall The prices food and restaurant was average Phoenix sushi fair
Also I find the lunch prices to be very reasonable considering the high quality of food and time-intensive preparation
As before the food was ho-hum at best the prices too high vs the product quality but the death blow to me was once again their customer service or shall I say lack of customer service
So yeah food is great and for dine in the prices are decent
And I heard a rumor that they're raising their prices because they were just featured on the Food Network
While pricey the service decor food and selection are all top notch
It's in a perfect location prices are reasonable food quality is good; but the customer service is bad beyond belief
The price was reasonable the food was good and the soda pop made it a nostalgic experience
The food quality is only marginally better than Outback but the price is much higher -- more like an upscale steakhouse
Where else can I get awesome buffet style food at prices that any good ol' pre-diabetic overeating and underpaid american can appreciate
-Cochata will change your life-Hit up their website for their story it's always cool to read up about successful food establishmentsThings I don't like-Don't let the menu fool you it gets expensive fast and the portions are small so find some coupons
the menu is very cheap for the quantity and quality of food you're getting
Authentic Mexican food is a mixture of cheap and fresh and spicy
It's not just fabulous for cheap food it's fabulous for food at any price
You'd also expect there to be more fast food options for the people just trying to avoid high prices inside the venues but there are only a few
Food quality was above average and the prices are more than reasonable
Seems like it's typical American food but it's a bit more pricey
Price For the hole in the wall look the way the meal was plated/served the food definitely doesn't look like the pictures they post on their website so don't expect fancy stuff and with the quality of the food you really wouldn't expect these plates to be well over $10
The place isn't inexpensive but you do get a lot of food for your $$$ so it's worth it
Yeah it was a little pricey for a pizza but it is worth every penny
Went for happy hour and had the shrimp pizza a shrimp cocktail and a sauvignon blanc that I really enjoyed and of course no I did not make note of it -They've lowered their prices and they are definitely worth going over for dinner or happy hour or lunch -Initially the service started out really strong
There isn't Mediterranean food in all of SF that is anywhere near as good for 3x the price
The coffee is excellent they have an organic colombian a good selection of veggie friendly foods wi-fi a large outdoor patio and there is an extremely reasonably priced yoga studio on the premises which I visited for one of their intro classes and removed the kinks of several days of driving from my back
she doesn't like food in US in general so this was a great choice not spicy not just meat and carbs and not overpriced
The sushi is a tad expensive but you get what you pay for - the quality is high
Food was okay but it was overpriced and wished they would have more of a selection
The only problem is once you eat this fish you will forever be tied to a higher price tag than what's available in most grocery stores
The food is a touch overpriced for Tempe but it's nice to sit and chat for awhile with an appetizer before the comedians come on stage
If they had some more authentic salsa to go with their foods I'd give them 5 stars - It's a little  more pricey than something like taco bell but you get much better quality food
If you're looking for vastly overpriced underwhelming unbalanced dishes in a beat-up oppressive and dated environment Vincent's just might be for you
The food is high quality tasty and inexpensive
Bottom Line-If you're going out for cheap sushi crab legs Non- Americanized Asian items and/or Mongolian grill
There were a few people in our party who had never been before so I'm glad they got to experience it but when you compare the quality of the food to the price it just doesn't add up
The food was expensive bland and questionable
If  that's the fish they're serving the prices really need to reflect the quality
Yes pricey if you compare to local grocery store items but if you are a Whole Foods shopper not at all
Their price is very cheap compared to the quality of the food
I was going to give them a 4 only because I thought they were on the pricey side compared to other places for the amount of food you get
Staff is friendly prices are right and you can take advantage of M-F lunch special - $10 for a mini 2-topping pizza salad and large drink
The prices were very reasonable for the amount of food you get and we will most definitely be returning some time soon
Bottom line excellent pizza fair prices and it's better than Bianco's
A nice middle ground between a cocktail lounge and a dance club we found the staff to be friendly the prices reasonable and the food and drink to be absolutely delicous
The food at Yogi's is certainly nothing to write home about but you can get a decent teriyaki bowl at a good price for lunch -- that's about it
For cheap pizza on the run you can't ask for much more
Offering up the Valley's best sushi I've yet to chowed on better BEST PRICE GUARANTEED
Yeah it's a five dollar pizza but setting aside the price it's still a very very yummy pizza
Some cheap pizza joints go way to easy on the sauce but these guys keep it in proportion so it play's its proper role
The portions are generous and the prices are pretty typical for food in the 'burbs
not that a $14 jerk chicken entree and carrot juice is that expensive
The food is cooked fresh noticeably healthy in large portion and is remarkably low-priced
While the food was delicious it was overpriced with mediocre service
The menu provides a nice selection but the food items are a bit overpriced for the quality but not by any means bad
The food and drinks are reasonably priced with a very good selection
Fez serves solid food at inexpensive prices
I just love the simplicity of walking in and ordering and being able to sit and enjoy a casual and quick dining experience with good food at a great price
Also I don't believe their food is priced fairly
$27 for a large pizza is too much; it's not like they put expensive toppings on it or anything
They had a wine aisle with quite a few good reasonably priced choices and a meat aisle with plenty of sausages beef pork and chicken cuts
The meat prices were very good considering that they are comparable to other grocers and are still providing hormone and antibiotic free meats for which others are horribly overcharging
They offer significantly lower prices on USDA certified organic chicken feed
But I don't care how great the service is or how cheap the food is if it taste like well i don't want to say crap because that has a distinct taste this was more along the lines of plain cardboard
Food got ridiculously expensive over last couple years
Price raise ~20-25% but food didn't get better in fact the portion gotten smaller
You can find better egg rolls at 25% cheaper in Saigon Pho a couple miles away
Overall overprice and not worth it coming from an Asian who knows about Asian food
They have a good wine list I started with a chardonnay the Diamond T which pairs perfectly with seafood - a little pricey at $12
The quality is there in the beef but the bun sucks for that price
A bit overpriced for the food but the ambiance and service made it worth it
Tommy V's is a delightful twist on old town dining where fine wines come with a surprisingly  refreshing price and food pairings  are always fresh and so delicious
25 - basically a deconstructed cheese pizza for 1/4 the price
Food was half-good my pork dip not the chips but the prices outside of happy-hour seemed a little high to me
The main reason that I would not suggest BLD is mainly due to the price - my food wasn't too bad aside from half the chips tasting stale
The sushi even though creative lacks flavor as a whole the prices and ratings are too high and the food under delivers
The prices are dirt cheap and the food is consistent
Decent quality food at very reasonable prices
The food was great but the bill was pricey
It is much overpriced and in my opinion the flavor and texture of the food was similar to what I would expect from any drive thru 'berto establishment
The atmosphere was pleasant and the food was pretty good for the price but there was nothing that really jumped out at me
Prices were a little high compared to other fast food Mex places such as Rubio's which is right across the street
It's not as busy and the food is half price
The food here is actually pretty good and for the price it's one of the better lunchtime deals on Mill
And that reminds me that I should add another factor by which one should judge an establishment--the price of the food
Often celebrity-themed restarants have much to be desired on the food front -- overpriced for what you get -- but we were pleasantly surprised
The food is nothing special unoriginal and expensive
The food isn't great nor is it well priced but I may have gone on an off night so I'm willing to give it another shot and possibly adjust my review
There are much more fast food Mexican places in the area that I feel are better for the same price
00 for both our meals and 2 sodas for that price I expect that they take more pride in the making of the food and at least make sure it is served hot
00 the fish is a little expensive but was served with a nice size piece of fish and the good serving of fries
However the food was arguably the worst most overpriced burger/ chicken sandwich i have ever had
The price to portion ratio is very fair and $9 will get me enough food for 2 meals
The chicken gyro was delicious and worth the price but the Greek fries were bitter soggy and awful
Second time i came in food is pretty expensive but its well worth it
Teh consistency reminded me of those cheap egg rolls you get with a lunch combo at a bad Chinese takeout
The all you can eat ribs good price but the ribs hardly have any meat on them
The decor was modern mexican and very colorful but the food was not impressive and the prices were high for what you get even for downtown Scottsdale
There are several gourmet pizzas some non-raw fish sushi rolls and other miscellaneous appetizers all at great prices
The food is always good the service is always a little lackluster but without blame as those guys and gals bust their backends considering how busy the place is always and the prices are really fair especially considering portion sizes and happy hour specials
When you need cheap 24-hour artery clogging Mexican food look no further than Los Betos on 24th
Overall good price good food Panda with guns
I'm not sure but they went majority cheap on the beef
Sadako the owner has a place that is not only serves great sushi and rolls but does so at a fair price
Good atmosphereVery well lit with tasteful decorCheap foodVegetarian friendlyWe had the veggie burrito which had potato beans grilled veggies and maybe cheese
After living downtown a while now I had to come to think I'd never find a rebound for Haji Baba I grew despondent and longed for their market and cheap delicious food on the light rail rides that brought me to Haji Baba my mouth would water as I anticipated my falafel and hummus and favorite confections
Food's ok   fitting with the  price range and  the burgers are well appointed   cooked to request and  relatively  tasteful
Cevapi = excellent although I'm not a fan of the raw onionsKebab = excellentPileci = excellentSirnica = excellentBaklava = sweet and deliciousI thought the food was very unique delicious and reasonably priced
They have a great bakery; the fancier desserts are definitely on the pricey end but there other baked goodies are great for breakfast like muffins and pastries and are very reasonably priced
I almost wrote a letter to their management last time I bought carry out because I was enormously disappointed when I'd brought an order of Shrimp Pad Thai home a quite basic and expensive dish only to find a basic gluten ball with hardly any veggies and all of FOUR SHRIMP
And while it still retains a wonderful atmosphere and good service I do have to agree with many recent reviewers that the prices are now out-of-line with the quality of the food
Food was good though I agree that it could be considered overpriced but that was completely overshadowed by the horrible service
The booze is cheap and the food high quality
Prices are expensive and the quality of food is not that good
I loved their vegetarian options and how many veggies they put on the pizza for such a reasonable price
the food didn't stand out in any way and I didn't consider it that cheap
39 wing days - but if you are gonna pay full price for a chicken wing at least you get your moneys worth here
It's pricey but with it's slow-food focus and its creative meals it's one of those rare places that you feel is actually worth it
All that matters to me are two things when I'm stepping into a genuine joint the food and the price
I can't think of one complaint- great food fresh ingredients and reasonable prices
I'd eat there AND here three times as often if only they delivered an amount of their food which matches the exorbitant prices they charge
Anyway I have never in my life complained about food prices before so it is a little weird having to write this but I truly feel Hana is fleecing people and since they were the only game in the area for a long time they think they can get away with it
There's a ton of busy Camelback restaurants but it seems the choice is often between fast food pizza or pricey event dining in the Biltmore or Esplanade
After you pick up your favorite fruit drink head over to the grill for some carne asada street tacos but only order two because you'll want to save room for the seafood bar where you will find a deliciouso shrimp ceviche at a very reasonably price
LaceyChipotle cream was hard-hitting like Dick Tracy Had a slurp of buffalo chiliBona fide good if only I had a WillyPortions are healthy not large and sillyDessert sampler was flavorful and dreamyMocha Macchiato was caramel and creamyMmmm Mmmm-Smile so big it's gleamyLunch menu less than 475 caloriesPrice points easy on your salaryEntrees change as often as Facebook galleriesWill have to come back for some moreTrying new things is never a boreEspecially if it helps my washboard
That's the price you pay for authentic Mexican food
the place smelled wonderful upon walking in and everything tasted okay though not as fresh as I would have expected for the price but I was thrown off-guard by the plastic chairs and frozen fishstick-resembling appetizers
The happy hour is moderately priced not cheap but given the quality and quantity of the food it's still a great value
I enjoy it a great deal and I'd say this is a very solid choice if you're in the mood for inexpensive Chinese food
I definitely took advantage of that although I wouldn't have minded them restricting food because I don't think everyone appreciates having to smell wafts of eclectic mixes of cheap food while they're watching movies especially the sensual scenes unless food turns you on
The service was good the food okay and half price appetizers at Happy Hour is always a nice bonus
I felt that for the quality of food that you receive here the prices are reasonable
My friend and I went on a quest for some cheap but still good mexican food
From what I saw it appeared that there were great prices on the meat as well
I'll admit the food at Coyote Cafe is acceptable but at least it is cheap usually under $10
The meals were not grossly overpriced but I expected better food at that price tag
5 stars for freshly cooked to order food healthy options and low prices
The service is always good and the quality of the food is good for the price
They do have a snack bar with a good selection of food & snacks that are decently priced
Same price but not nearly the same quality of food
The food is very good and reasonably priced
Great food great service and price was just right
The food was wonderful and the price was great
The food is great and the prices at that place just can't be beat
A few things I could never do without- Freshly made pesto as good as homemade- Wheat pizza dough- Cascade fresh yogurt- Fair trade and organic coffee by the pound and there's no douchebags grinding the disgusting flavored coffee in the organic grinder- Dr Praeger's veggie burgers- Sunflower multi-grain bread- Double ad WednesdayAdditionally Sunflower has scads of inexpensive store brand canned and boxed items that seem to increase every week
I can eat healthful and even organic food for cheaper than a regular grocery store
To sum it up -- good food good service and reasonable prices
The only downside is that I've had better food for the same price
There you go great food great drinks great price
A bit pricey but I understand the food is very fresh
Great food and nice grounds/location; however very pricey for what you get
Open 24 hours with some of the best dishes for cheap in the area
the movie ticke prices are very affordable and prices for food are comparable to any other restaurant
The staff and food are all good here and very cheap
I've been many many times and the service is always good the food is always consistently good and the drinks are not expensive and are potent - I like that
The prices are great and I've found here many items especially food items that I could not find in most supermarkets
LIke the others the food is so cheap I periodically try to run the numbers to see how they could possibly be profitable to reassure myself it is not a drug front and while I haven't cracked that equation I also don't equate them with crack
My expectations for this place  are Fast tasty and cheap food
I could have sucked up the expensive ticket prices & food costs but the heat
The margaritas and other drinks were priced fairly decenlty so if you're craving Mexican food and drinks out with friends it is the way to go
Their menu has a deceptively large food and price variety ranging from $1
For the price of the food everything should have tasted better
For the price and the fact it doesn't taste like every other pizza out there
LOVE the 2 price options on the pasta dishes
I actually didn't find it all that cheap considering it's basic Mexican food but I guess it's cheap for Scottsdale
For the price you are better off going to Whole Foods or AJ's Fine Foods - they usually have a fabulous pastry case in their stores many of the pastries from local businesses that make everything from scratch
Prices are reasonable for the food appetizers $2-7 and dinners $10-20
Happy hour goes until 6pm half priced apps and pizzas
It was a great pizza for the price; if I go back I'd like to try one of their other pizzas
Overall I think with the price of every dish average of $28-$30 per dish the quality of the food was average
the portions seems a little smaller the prices seemed a little higher and the chicken was not as juicy as I remembered
There are plenty of other places with better food better prices and most certainly better customer service for us to ever return to this establishment
The portions one small plate and one smaller entree were just right and the prices very reasonable for the quality of the food
Overall decent quality fish prices are rather high chefs are pleasant
Overall the food and price are comparable to our other favorite places to grab pizza
Denny's and IHOP fail to stack up against Joe's and their amazing food and reasonable prices
The menu consisted of your typical diner food assorted omelets breakfast specials ect and everything was priced under $10
In short Great food amazing portion size for the price 50's atmosphere CHORIZO GRAVY
While I didn't taste all the menu items just felt like the food was overly priced or maybe seafood is just alot more expensive in Phoenix
Overall this place was way overpriced considering the fact that their sushi wasn't even that great
Overall absolutely a great local health market with much more reasonable prices than Whole Foods
The very inexpensive sandwiches vary in quality I found the falafel to be really good the koubideh was OK and the beef shawarma was dry and lacking in flavor
For food quality I consider the nearby Cafe Istanbul to be a better choice; but for price this is the place to go
My guy and I thought their prices were a little overpriced for what kind of food it was
Price - on the expensive side for the amount of food we got
The refreshments are good and food and drink prices are not inflated and more reasonable that those at the sports stadiums
I can't wait to continue to go here and enjoy being a meatavor  Service was great and prices are always reasonable
Don't let that freak you out because the food is good the service is good and the price is excellent
You get a lot of food for a small price
The drinks may be spendy but the food is relatively cheap
Bottom line Original Hamburger Works is the perfect place to go when you want a quality burger and fries at fast food prices with the luxury of a liquor license
This chain is pretty overrated considering how average and expensive the food is
Food was WAY over priced and I couldn't speak to my dinner companions because the music was way to loud
Overall Bombay has good service a good location next to Whole Foods progressive menu items is moderately priced and has a good variety of items available for vegans and carnivores alike
It's a traditional japanese restaurant and from what I remember the food was decently priced maybe a little more expensive for dinner than other places
They had a ton of food and miso soup and all that and they were a great deal I don't know how much they were but it was very cheap for what you get
The service is only average but for a cheap lunch with more traditional sushi I would definitely hit this place up
I just have trouble giving you 10 times the price of the lunchmeat
for those seeking quality food at reasonable prices this place is very hard to beat
Great food great service and prices similar to others
The broth wasn't too salty and the beef didn't taste cheap
The negativesOver-priced average food noisy and the layout of the restaurant is ridiculous
The food was really good but on the pricey side
The food is pretty good quality and is very inexpensive which is great for a college student I also used to work 2nd shift and their prepare meals were a much yummier alternative for dinner than having a sandwich or gross frozen meal
They are not near as cheap as fast food pizza joints but it's worth the price
The food is great above average prices are well
Lastly this place dishes out cheap strong drinks
Eating here can be a little expensive but I really like the food
The bar menu offers several cooked and raw dishes and the happy hour prices can't be beat give the shochu infusions a try too
Julio's Too is very reasonably priced and offers the same quality of food as the main restaurant
When I have a craving for Mexican food I usually lean towards Julio's because it is close to home fast and cheap but sometimes when I am really in the mood for some good beans I have to go somewhere else with better beans
He had the manager come over to check it out and the manager gave us free dessert and took some money off the price of my friend's filet
Either way the food had a good taste and a great price but just doesn't agree with my sensitive 'personality'; I guess
But most important; the food is cheap and fantastic
The happy hour prices make it affordable but the food quality still doesn't match the price
4 The food was overpriced for bar/pub grub
While the price felt a little steep for the volume of food received the quality of the pizza as well as the AMAAAAAAAAZING AMAZING AMAZING FANTASTIC staff ultimately made the $20 I threw down feel like a value
Pretty reasonably priced and the food and wine is delicious
Friendly and fast service decent prices and good food
Good food reasonable price and a unique local business
I've managed to pick up bargain hummus sushi shrimp ceviche and ahi tuna salad from that section all for 50% off of the already cheap prices
All in all the chef has a fine touch and the food is very solid and well above average although a bit pricey as you might expect for the location
The food tasted quite mediocre but the price was high
Cliff notes- Cheap $1-2/plate- Fast It's ready-to-go and on a conveyor- Acceptable quality I'm here weekly and haven't gotten sick lolThis place is definitely good for what it is it being a budget-friendly sushi place that's great for a quick bite
This place has a business model based on selling in large volumes hence the low prices like wal-mart so they're gonna have to reduce costs somehow so-so quality food not-so-attentive staff and slightly smaller than average portions but it's still a solid bang-for-your-buck kinda place
a little on the pricey side but we don't mind paying as long as the food is up to par
In contrast I would warn anyone who chooses Vincent's to expect mediocre over-priced food served by rude incompetent children and management that doesn't concern itself with service
Rundown - Food seems really cheap for what you get
The food at Someburros is on par with any good Mexican restaurant in the Valley but it is fast and inexpensive
That being said the food is not as great as the setting the food is to expensive and ok
When you broke them apart they seemed like real meat with flat bones but then you taste it and it tastes like those gross artificial frozen pork products you find in bad cafeterias or cheap buffets
The excellent food does come at a high price $$$$
My only intent in reviewing Andreoli is to say that I love the food and atmosphere but have been very disappointed in the prices
Prices are good too - we compared what we pay for our big bag of food to PetCo Petsmart doesn't even carry Solid Gold and we are paying less by buying it here and supporting a local business
Local products + fresh food = money well spent even if it is a little more expensive
We had to sit at the sushi bar to get the happy hour prices which sucks
Price is pretty good maybe slightly pricey for breakfast i think the pizza is like $9 ish but completely worth it
Old School place been around for 50 years with red leather half circle booths red velvet wall paper dim lighting old-time professional waiters with grey hair and expensive food specializing in steaks
All the food is good but not fantastic given the prices
But if you are a trendy chic diner you should pass and try something fresher in ambiance and food but equally expensive think Scottsdale's overblown newer mega-restaurants which are the new Durant's except with Sushi or Asian Fusion or oversized Southwest flavored creations with names taken from Cactus varieties
The menu is very simple and basic but the food is done well and very cheap
So overall it lives up to everything a dive should do--cheap good basic food
We looked at the menu for a minute which seemed cheaper than most Maricopa non fast food joints
It's nothing spectacular its just a good price and a lot of food
Prices on drinks are great they have a good happy hour and I have never been disappointed by the food
I'd been there before a dozen times and the food was always good if not a little expensive
Clean enough place cheap food is okay and service is adequate
2 stars for the authenticity and quality of the food lack of chips prices not in line with the level of quality of the food and totally overdone vibe
At their prices for beer and food there's no way we could've stuck around for 6-7hours which is too bad because I think we had a god shot
I can't tell you how many times I have walked into a Thai place in the area and been royally disappointed in the flavor and quality of the cheap food
Still tensions have been known to rise as patrons anxiously await their foodMany presume the real motivation for the Army's visit was its rather low prices for pitchers of beer
It was a place we went all the time but lately not as often not because the food isn't excellent but because it is quite pricey
If you are looking for great pizza this is the place if you are looking for cheap well I'm afraid it isn't
It's not cheap but very good and goes well with the sushi
Great Food Great Atmosphere and reasonable prices
It definitely has that outdated whitewashed decor with bad fake plants and too much lighting but the food is solid fast Japanese and is reasonably priced
I think their food is too small and not high quality enough for the prices they charge
My second trip - I came here for lunch with a coworker who recommends this place for cheap affordable and good Chinese food
While it appears they don't have a happy hour at Sakana they do have a special Customer Appreciation menu Mon-Thur with discounted prices on the most popular rolls
Sure it was pricey but for the quality of service the taste of the food the exquisite setting it was worth every penny and more
The price for the food is right although in no way cheap the lobster mashed potatoes are always a must
It but overall it was fantastic servers were attentive and very nice and the food was YUM and at a good price
Sushi was also on the cheap Nigiri was from about 1
Nonetheless the fantastic food great service & low price here make this place so SPECIAL anyway that we all three said we can't wait to come back so FIVE STARS
I don't really like Mexican food but when we want something cheap and fast this is a good option
The sushi is super cheap and the food quality is pretty good
I have always wanted to try a revolving sushi restaurant but I feared they were expensive
the problem is controlling yourself from overeating because of the prices
There is a reason why the cocktails are more expensive than the food it's because the drinks are better
the prices have risen and the food quality had declined

The food is tasty reasonably priced and they have a decent selection of beers
Usually if the food is delicious I can shrug off the bad service the fact that I still patronize Cornish Pasty makes this evident but I think I hit my breaking point today when a female employee rudely told my friend that we couldn't get the food items on the happy hour special as takeout and that we would be charged full price if we wanted to order anything on said menu
Bottom line this restaurant serves good Mexican food the portions are huge and is inexpensive
There's usually hanging number signs indicating food prices but nothing

Plates of half-rolls or two pieces of nigiri the fish on rice if I got that right as well as drinks desserts edamame and a few other things go around the bar on colored plates color indicates the price

The sushi is cheap and skimpy spring rolls were bland
It's not the cheapest in town and there are some full service restaurants around that may do the chicken better I would still choose LoLo's or Tuck Shop for chicken and waffle over LFC's chicken and waffle - but as far as fast food fried chicken goes - LFC is worlds better than KFC Popeye's or Church's

*********PRICEY IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT**************The food is OK
50 despite the staff's complete lack of hesitation in providing them- Taking home satisfaction levels ranging from grudgingly enjoying the expensive dinner show to thinking it was the best overall food experience in months if not yearsMenu guidance would be a futile endeavor since as the head waitresses helpfully informed all non-returnee tables it turns over completely around every two weeks

The staff is very friendly the food comes out SUPER fast and the prices are extremely do-able for what you get

Giligins has cheap booze cheap and tasty greasy bar food party games and lots of weirdos

But on a leisurely night when I don't mind waiting too long for a table or for my meal I'll head back to Oregano's for its friendly service reasonable prices and above-average food
The food was perfectly prepared and priced fairly
We were too full for dessert but noted that they were reasonably priced

I'm glad I went on happy hour and spent $6 on the roll instead of double price

While Redendo's is clearly a favorite I do have to point out a couple of small details that for me are a bit annoying - they charge the price of two full toppings if you go half and half on a pizza

Three because the food is decent nothing fancy and maybe a little over-priced
- We ordered received our appetizers in ok time and then waited another 40 minutes until our meals began coming out we ordered special courses - big mistake- Each dish came out somewhere between warm to cold for sure sitting around-  Even if warm the quality was not anywhere near the caliber of what a similarly priced meal at any other high-end establishment around town would be
The prices were somewhat reasonable I got the Lo-Lo's for $11 2 waffles and 3 pieces of fried chicken
The meals are cheap and you get a lot of good quality food

At about $35 for 2 people it was a bit pricey for lunch but well worth it because it was a very unique experience coupled with excellent food

I thought it was a bit pricey but the food was good and the portion was generous
When asked what to order the owner will point you in the direction of the steamed beef buns the cheapest and tastiest item on the menu
The fried chicken noodles are also delicious and nothing on this menu is expensive

It is a little pricey but if you go for lunch it is roughly half the price of dinner with exactly the same food and service
The food was meh desert was pretty good but way overpriced for what we got and not made for a big guy
I've been to a LOT of sushi joints in the valley and none of them really have FANTASTIC sushi merely different price points and presentation neither of which make these places any more appealing to me
Second it's the best sushi you can get a a reasonable price
Can't beat the price for all you can eat sushi either
This place gets packed during happy hour for their half-priced sushi rolls and great drink specials
Their lambrurger is awesome; their lamb chops are great just order them cooked med rare trust me and it's just nice to have a place that offers tasty lamb dishes close to work and for a special price on Wed's

Agree w/ the other reviewers that the service is oddly slow but the coffee & food were really good and overall super cheap
The Melting Pot does not serve gourmet food but you will pay gourmet prices
It would be 5 stars for the delicious inexpensive food and the huge portions of their lunch specials big enough for at least two people for under $5

The food here is not eally cheap perse but it is a cheap restaurant if that says anything
Food was alright but I thought it was a bit overpriced for fast food Mexican that's really nothing special or unique
Where do some of you eat where you walk away barely full and have spent over $20 on so so fast food and call it cheap and large portions
The fish was nothing to write home about and if you're looking for actually delicious fish & chips and not just a cheap Tempe staple you'd be better off going to Rula Bula or 4 Peaks which have fantastic beer selections to boot
The fish is a square processed patty and the fries are skinny and cheap
I also find great items for my  home like memory foam mats on sale in neutral colors kitchen utensils Food Network stars brands and small appliances for better prices than anywhere else I can drive to locally
It's a busy place but as far as customer service is 2 out of 5 waitress took about 15 minutes to get us water Long story short decent place if you didn't have to be rushed out of there would consider to go back after all the food is cheap =

When I went today to restock my larger dog's feed supply I was almost overcharged again same dog food and same sale price- $6
It's definitely on the high-end of the price spectrum and sure you could get sushi as good for half the price elsewhere but it's not your weekly sushi place
The food here is delicious cheap and the people working here are very friendly and appreciate your business
The groceries such as produce and meats are much better quality and the prices are very close to the same
The best kept secret is that they discount their meat when it gets close to the expiration date so you get excellent quality flavorful meat for a great price
Fogo is pricey 47 dollars  a head for unlimited food so if you aren't hungry don't waste your money
Cheap fast food that you should not eat everyday - unless you want to get fat and have a heart attack
rrAnd what *seems* expensive at $11 for a half pound Kobe burger $8 for Angus half  $6 for Angus quarter pound they serve bottomless drinks at a reasonable price $2 and cheese veggies special sauces for covering your burger and a side dish were also included best sweet potato fries I've ever had
I'm rating this place at 4 stars because it's low priced decent food and the owner was a really sweet lady

In addition to delicious food and generous portions the prices are super reasonable
While some of the dishes were very tasty others were not  for such a pricey place
Basically if you don't eat seafood you have to pick from the duck which was terrible the beef tenderloin what I ordered was reasonable but wickedly overpriced at like $34 or another grilled chicken dish
All in all the food was good - the quality for the price of the lunch was good - but the service was ridiculous
It was very cheap looking and they charged a lot of money for very subpar food
I liked the decorthe small feelthe art workservice from the barthe taste of the beefthe size of the pattythe cooked to orderI did not like the toppingsthe priceno side's includedThe burger is a great hunk of beef cooked to order on a huge bun served with burnt bacon and cheddar cheese

What I got was frozen fish terrible sushi construction and a spicy tuna roll that I almost couldn't eat but did anyways due to the inflated prices and some awful service
It's a little pricey but we shared the Scotch Eggs & Yorkshire Roast Beef and topped the entire meal off with some bread pudding and after all was said and done we were well stuffed and paid around $30 for the meal with tip
With food this flavorful and inexpensive neither should you
The food was good at decent ballpark prices
The food prices are a little high but the food quality and portion sizes are also very good
what else do i like about this place price wise its very comparable to most fast food and mexican fast food places
Some other places I'd recommend over Udupi for typical delicious and cheaper Indian food would have to be Jewel of the Crown in Old Town Scottsdale and Delhi Palace on ASU Campus
But only if you got the cheapest store brand possible and made sure it was a SQUARE patty of frozen breaded fish
The fish sandwich was one of the aforementioned fish patties on a cheapo hamburger bun with a smear of sauce
*Food = great*Service = good but you basically serve yourself*Price = good*Decor = very cool
Good service decent prices solid food in a Tempe strip mall
If the food is good though the prices might be justified
For the price we paid for the food it was an enjoyable experience
The second time we went was for dinner and the prices for food were a lot higher
Our food was definitely tasty - the lamb shank and steak tenderloin bruschetta were very flavorful - but the prices felt a little high and perhaps more fitting for a hotel restaurant

I resisted the temptation of cheap chicken and ordered the California Club sandwich fries and a diet Dr
My friend ordered the Japanese Wagyu meat which is highly exclusive and was priced at $10 and oz

5 stars for its great local vibe and cheap and tasty food and beer
The rolls were really tasty and the appetizers were good but had they been regular price it probably wouldn't be worth it
It can be a little pricey but if you want something other than your standard pep and cheese pizza with sodas drop by and give it a shot
I specifically say a cafe because that is where the french go for good food and wine at reasonable prices
It gets the highest of ratings from me because it is what it is excellently prepared French food at prices that don't give you indigestion when you think of paying the bill later
Eat here when you need delicious satisfying comfort food and a pretty-cheap Dos Equis
It's awesome inexpensive food- not cheap food inexpensive
Korean food tends to be on the more expensive side but those little side dishes are great and the service was great here too
The Price It's about the same here as it is everywhere else you go to get Greek food
I'd consider coming back for the food and the ambiance but it's definitely not one of my favorites there are better places in town for the price
Probably my fault for ordering one of the most expensive dishes
The food quality and price of this place is unbeatable
The fish always tastes fresh the price is good really good if you do the all you can eat menu
Slices offers rather large portions of pizza for a great price
One small nit as some others have written it can be quite expensive especially with drinks and desserts

Very friendly very clean great prices and damn good pizza
Food A-Service B-Environment A-Price B-/C+Onto the food

I think that it was a little pricey for the amount of food you get
With free wifi and multiple wall plug-in's available at every single booth you can set up there for hours but be sure to buy food/drinks don't be cheap if you're going to be there for the day
The food is overpriced bland and it is so loud you cannot enjoy your company
The in-laws were hosting the dinner so I don't know the exact price but I think the food was around $25-30/pp excluding beer and wine
Carl's has raised the price on its food so that the $6 burger is now actually almost $6
Great atmosphere service prices and of course amazing food
The saving grace for this place is definitely its cleanliness but the flexibility on the menu the relatively high prices compared to the portion sizes and the taste of the food is really all lackluster
While the food was pretty good & 4 star worthy I felt it was overpriced & the place lacked any ambiance so I think 3 stars is appropriate
It was not the most amazing food ever but it was fresh and cooked by a person in a pan not in a microwave and beats the pants off of an Einstein bagel sandwich or anywhere else with comparable prices
The food was enjoyable on both visits although again a little expensive
If they lower the food pricing a little or give a little more wow factor to warrant the price then this place will be complete
Other than that the service is great the food is great the drinks are great and pricey
The first place I've found since moving out here that truly understands what tapas are all about; cheap plates of finger foods -olives cheese hummus croquettes- that are meant to be shared

We had the meat ball starter for 2 huge portion with Gluten Free bread - Delicious fresh and very tastyThen I got a pizza - Italian style with fine crust and plenty of topping on it fantasticAnd the best of all Gluten Free Chocolate Brownie with Coconut milk Ice Cream - DivineThe place looked great the staff friendly and the bill had a good price
The prices were fair the amount of food was plentiful and the service was quick and friendly
A  bit surprised at the high prices but figured that the trendy factor in old town and the atmosphere was the reason because the teeny portions of the food and the quality is just GOOD like the Good egg not great not bad just good

In this growing neighborhood there are several places with better food at lower prices

The food was really good specially for the price
But the food was not bad and the price is pretty good as well
The price is average too but not worth it for bad quality sushi
Despite the name the Chinese food is the better half of the restaurant but it is a bit expensive
The comfort food is nice though may be a bit overpriced
Bad food overpriced with severely lacking service
I can roll out of Trader Joe's with a bag full of groceries at 1/2 the price of Safeway

The food has remained consistent through the years and the prices are low
It's expensive the service is decent it's crowded loud and they serve alright food
If you are a vegetarian and you love Greek food beware of Jay's Gyros their vegetarian selection is overpriced and tastes like trash
Like two desserts for the price of--well almost two desserts at $9

These far-reaching Gods of Cafetopolis you see Whose minions such as Paneracles and Chipotle have erected from sea to seaDesired like the vendors beyond the Acropolis offeringsCafeteria dining serving Gyro and many such thingsThe fare was befitting of above mentioned ilkTwo stars at best though service was silkThe dolomades came hard the hummus was tastySpanakopita came fried as the cooks may be hastyFalafel were shaped as tater-tots wouldPasty inside the two were not goodSalad lacked olives but for a dollop all groundFeta was sparse with no pungency foundDrachmas went quickly when food was just orderedHigher quality Greek food the price could have affordedEnglish majors

This is a great spot for some mid-week relaxation cheap drinks and solid food
The service was prompt helpful and friendly and the food was delicious and inexpensive
It's nice you can custom order your pizza just be aware that it will probably come out even more expensive than if you order from the regular menu

The food overall was OK meaning not bad but not great just OK and not expensive
Everyone I know that's eaten the miso soup rates it above average There's a wide variety of rollsappetizers and drinks that are reasonably priced out-with happy hour
The prices were higher than average but then again there's a big appreciation factor that needs to be considered due to the time consuming effort it takes the cook to make some of these dishes; like the Lao dishes
The food is delicious and pretty inexpensive the portions are also very generous
The pizza was so-so but not worth the price
The food is very good and similar to what you might get a Chili's or Applebee's and not too much more expensive

The food is good and filling and the prices are great for the amount and quality of food that you get
But it's not bad and these guys took the plunge and rolled back their prices
The rolls were good the salmon sashimi was awesome and prices weren't outrageous
The food is exceptionally priced think around $5
My favorite roll is the Crunch Roll which you can get for cheap during happy hour until 6pm
To say the least is was very dry and the flavorless but maybe that's the price you pay when altering the dish so it is what it is
No offer of a complimentary dessert actually no offer of a full price dessert and the bill was dropped off with no discount or anything taken off the bill
I am reviewing the service drinks food and prices at the establishment all of which suck
I think the price is just right because it is a specialty dish so I don't have any problem paying the $7 for an amazing crepe
Food is expensive but everything tastes so fresh and just a bit different than what you get everywhere else such as Dates on the BLT and Butternut Squash in the Creme Brulee

The food was great for the price - everyone was delighted with the quality and quantity of the food
The food is more than filling the price is very reasonable for what you get and the staff is friendlier than most places I've been
the prices were a little high and the food was mediocre at best
What I didn't see and wish to comment upon;Pros-Amazingly tasty sangria maybe the best in town; really fresh ingredients; prices that won't break the bank and special food
the friday fish fry kicks ass and isn't expensive and you can choose between cod and perch
While in my personal experience at Posh the quality and deliciousness of the food I had definitely justifies the price-tag it should - if the quality wasn't extraordinary it wouldn't rank at all
Not the cheapest but at $8-10 for a combo meal you're not getting better food for the same price elsewhere
The atmosphere is friendly the prices are very reasonable and the fish is as fresh as it gets
Our food was alright but also ridiculously priced
Most items are around $8-10 and it is a very casual atmosphere but you're getting very good food for that price whether you dine there or take it home
Great service great food great prices this is my favorite spot in Scottsdale
The happy hour prices and menu are decent with some interesting and not too typical bar food selections
All the food was so fresh and reasonably priced too
POOR POOR POOR customer service over priced food considering the quality and amount that you receive
Their lunch combinations are the best bet for people who want a lot of food at a decent price
You cannot beat the cheap price for the large amount of food
I did think the food was slightly pricey but hey most sushi places are
Yeah it's a little over priced for fast food
The place is huge with lots of very inexpensive and very fresh produce plus fresh meats and seafood at prices that will make any budget-conscious grocery shopper very happy
All of the food was seasoned excellently and very filling for the price
Very inexpensive yummy food great large TVs pool table couches and yes even a faux fireplace
They have lunch portions which helps since the food is a little pricey
The only reason they get two stars is because the food as decent and the price was reasonable
A little expensive for the lackluster performance and average quality of the food
It is pricey but I am willing to pay extra for what I think is good food
have a vacation home in queen creek so i dnt  know how to go anywhere else other then to the shopping center where walmart is at this is where i came across the jungle buffet so i figuer i would give it a try i was so suprised how economical this place is and everyone was nice n friendly the place is cheap n has good food i almost felt as if i should pay more
I must say that I was a little disapointed in the amount of food your recieve for the price
Bottomline Good food  not in the regular mexican fare groupCon; No enough on your plate for the the price you get even if it is a gourmet
I must since I've probably dropped over $100 here in the past month between the 25 minute drive the ticket price and food; but I've got to say it's worth every penny
The tacos and pizza were great and overall can't beat the prices
The food is worth the price and I strongly suspect that the kitchen performs better when the place is not packed to the gills
it's much cheaper per ounce to get juice at the whole foods juice bar
I don't like greasy saucy chinese food at all so when this restaurant moved to my neighborhood I was so delighted by the fresh and nicely presented food and the prices are very fair here
Prices are reasonable; roughly in line what one would expect to pay for sushi outside of Scottsdale
They have awesome happy hour food at cheap prices
I guess its the price that gets me for the quality of food you are getting
They had unagi sushi too which is usually kinda pricey so it was generous of them to serve that
I also thought the $20 price was very fair considering the amount of crab legs oysters sushi and shrimp that we ate
They spent quite a bit on decor and it reminds me a bit like a Scottsdale type establishment in decor but considerably cheaper food than your RA's or Sapporo in upscale Snotsdale
Most items on the menu are cooked to order besides desserts and it is also made from scratch they use very good ingredients in their recipes you can't beat fresh homemade for so inexpensive
In a town rife with everything from exotic grinds of meat to log cabin themes for burger bars Lucky Boy has a mind boggling simple cheap formula a non-mad cow burger made with all the of the basic ingredients like onions tomatoes lettuce pickles and assorted other condiments cooked to order on a fresh bun
I thought the food items were a little pricey for what the items were such as $10 for a couple of cut up pretzels with cheese/fondue dipping sauce
The platters are priced well for the mound of food you receive and while I have had some tonsil-scraping dry chicken on occasion the majority of the time the kabobs and koftas are moist and tender
The prices are reasonable less than $10 for most dishes
The Godzilla Roll is super chunky so bring a big mouthed companion with you and it is big in price too
The bowl of pho I received was small with a small amount of meats and was over priced in my opinion
The average Roll Price ranges from $5 to $8  with some special rolls costing a bit more
I would have given them 4 stars prior to the last two visits but the continuous loss of my confidence and over priced food brings it down to a two
It is $75 per person so it is not cheap but you definitely get your money's worth of food - and the price is similar to what you would pay for appetizer entree and dessert but you get WAY more food than that - a great way to go
It could've been just me but I found the selection of sushi a little limited and the specialty ones pretty overpriced but the sushi I had was out of this world
However I really get disappointed at the prices of the ones I would like to try especially for lunch and think I may run out of new dishes to try soon
The bread was gross the sandwich barely had any meat in it and was totally overpriced
Prices are moderate for this quality of food and atmosphere and the free valet parking is convenient
I would personally suggest that if you want a place to eat with good food good service was for us good portions at good prices stop in and see Kathy or Mo
The price is fair and the food is fresh and hot
As for price - any good sushi restaurant is going to be expensive but we've spent as much or more at lesser quality restaurants like Sakana
Certain dishes are definitely disproportionately expensive and too small portioned
The only reason I didn't give five stars is the price of the salads when you add meat to them $18 I had one once and although IT WAS GREAT not worth $18 I don't know if the salad was smaller than it should have been or not I still remember the $7 extra to add the  salmon maybe 2 oz  also we've found service hit or miss when an unexpected rush of business happens  but had mostly good service
The service was great but for the price and the taste of food I will not be returning to FnB
The food is delicious the portion sizes are big the price is cheap and the food comes out fast
For the price I would have been pleased with adequate food but each item really blew me away
The quality of food is truly amazing for the price
If you're looking for a place to grab some simple inexpensive comfort food and are in north central phoenix this place is worth a stop
If you were wasted in Margaritaville the bad food and high prices would not bother you
However she wasn't as attentive as we would have liked or expected and she failed to mention that adding chicken to one caesar salad costs $10 making the cost of the salad $14 that was the happy hour price
I will spare you the environmental lecture & just leave you with this restaurants especially in areas not close to the source buy fish as cheaply as possible which usually means fish that are dwindling in population Chilean sea bass etc or collected in the wrong ways that kill other marine life or damage ecosystems many kinds of tunaetc
A little on the greasy side they were tasty and filling with a price that was pretty decent for the amount of food on my plate
To start with - super-cheap stick to your ribs breakfast food
ok so the food was way overpriced for what you got
In fact many of the dishes are the same as I remember but everything at this restaurant is substantially higher in price over-priced in my opinion
The food was very good and very reasonably pricedIt is an outdoor hotel ie rooms are along outdoor corridor and the garden view was a little misleading
It combines the three necessaries for a wonderful Thai dining experience great spicy food cheap prices and charming ambiance
This is a great place for quality food a beautiful and romantic atmosphere and cheap dining
Price Fairly expensive but worth it for the quality of the food and service
The food is typical bar food moderately priced and filling with whatever unique twists that the business owner's manual theme demands
Moderately priced food and drinks; patio bar open on busy nights and weekends
If you're a cheapskate you can even get the spaghetti marinara meal w/ soup or salad bread drink dessert tax and tip for under $10
I was very disappointed in the food quality and variety at this price
Place was clean food is ok but rather pricey considering what you get
Considering all the wonderful Vietnamese food there is in Phoenix I would go else where for half the price
The food was typical to above average for a bar drink prices were nothing special even at happy hour
Other than the food the prices are fair
The food it great the portions are what we fat Americans should be eating the prices are great there is a play area for the kids and Grandma even lets the kids pick out a toy from her bucket when you leave
The prices were reasonable about what you'd expect to pay for decent sushi
They had a big menu with super cheap food
The Mexican pizza which uses ground beef remained the same so I guess it was cheap enough not to substitute with junk meat
You go to get cheap drinks at happy hour and fill up on sushi to fill the void that the alcohol has caused
It is an expensive restaurant and I do not like that they charge a high corking fee for alcohol but the food impressed me and it had a nice romantic feel
The restaurant decor is average nothing fancy but we've learned that the less expensive decor = way better food typically
Aside from the food the best thing about this place is the price
Portion smallQuality cheap fishTaste too fishy I'm surprise that many sushi restaurants are trying to make profit by cutting corner
I would figure that their prices should be way more considering the AMOUNT of food you get
You know they have a Tommy's in Maui too we ate there while on vacation a few times because it's so good and because it's much cheaper than hotel food and come on way better in taste
I am  a fan of asian and latin foods and admittedly have an odd penchant for cheap asian buffets -- so I'm usually pretty tolerant of cheap bad fried foods

Windsor is a fun lively bar/restaurant with a great vibe and good food all at a reasonable price
Food seemed reasonably priced and portions were sufficient
The wine list was concise and interesting with boutique well priced wines chosen to enhance the food
The sushi is dirty cheap and good enough for the price
First they have a more interesting selection of fish than I have seen at most Valley stores and the prices seem to be quite good
I will pay for good quality pizza so the price was in line for the quality of the food
We use to visit this Pub 10 years ago because they had a nice English waitress and excellent fish and chips for the price
The price of the fish and chip dinner went up and they cut the portion in half
The food is reasonably priced with most sandwiches and dishes right around $10
Bad service bad food and overpriced- drinks included
The staff is GREAT and the prices are right where they should be for good chinese food
Swanky Vibe W/ Fantastic MusicConsistantly Good FoodGreat Friendly Service & A Price Tag That Won't Bankrupt you
Great location good beer and liquor selections prices on the higher side mixed service lame food
The sushi didn't stand out on this visit either making me wonder if the high prices were worth it
Food was cheap because of happy hour specials but the only thing I didn't like was that there were many flies in the restaurant
Very nice exterior and interior which probably explains the little higher prices for Mexican food
The prices are great and the amount of food you get is good
Ya know just when I thought I couldn't fit one more restaurant into my casual Mexican food rotation Rubio's comes along with its damn delicious tacos and its friendly employees and its integration of Coke Zero in its fountain drink machine and the next thing you know I'm up to FOUR very viable options for my frequent inexpensive taco/burrito cravings
I always appreciate a healthy restaurant and I am a foodie to boot but this place had the tiniest portions for the price you pay and the food really isn't that great
Also my avocado and squash salad was okay but tasted like something I could just pluck off the salad bar at Whole Foods for a much cheaper price
Could have gone somewhere else with better food bigger portions and a lower price
Even my beloved Blu since the prices during Happy Hour were incredible the rolls were phenominal and the service was fantastic
The price was about right for the organic and natural foods they offer
It's probably a little more than most tiny breakfasts stops but knowing the food served was chosen from natural food markets the price was spot on for the quality of food
Pros nice service nice decor cheap lunch specialCons food was mediocre
Choose to pay for a full price bottle and you will get yourself a free meat board
The food selection is pretty standard but they offer great prices that easily beat Safeway and Bashas
However the food was just ok especially for the price
However Whole Foods has always been grossly overpriced that I can never do my shopping there
Until recently I found they are actually cheaper on a few things for the first time in my history of shopping at Whole Foods
They do an excellent job offering food at reasonable prices often times with a nice discount promo and I can leave with a 6 inch sub bag of chips and large soda for under $6
I've been to Sushi Q many times when I was attending DeVry University Tried almost every roll available at the time and they were all pretty good and decent sized for the price
I have recommended Salsa B to many Sun City Residents - most are picky food critics all LOVED Salsa B - they felt the food was good prices GREAT  some thought the prices should be raised all will be going back - all will pass the word to their friends and family - all wish these Great New Entrepreneurs  the BEST OF LUCK w/this One of a Kind Mexican Food Restaurant --- Chili R's and Beef Taco's ARE  TO DIE FOR - I am SOOOOO Hooked
And I do agree with others that it is a bit pricey but some of the dishes were worth it
It was happy hour and the prices were great for the food they served
The food and ambiance certainly deserve 5 stars and while this place is known for being spendy I ordered a tasty bone-in filet small one and it was priced a little better than other steakhouses
One minor beef I have with Scramble is overpriced beverages
When the food is quality I won't hold above average drink prices against Scramble
They are what your neighborhood pizza place ought to be with great service and a decent price
The lake is stocked with trout during the cold months but the fishing permit for them is kinda pricey you can get it at local sporting stores like Dick's
Good deals for cheap food - recently they had a $2 breakfast special consisting of two egg & cheese burritos with hashbrowns
Considering that potatoes are like the cheapest thing on the planet and french fries are possibly one of the most delicious food groups to ever exist this should be standard practice
The fact that their food is so cheap actually makes me wonder about some things
FYI - The all you can eat sushi is about $24 per person - definitely a good price for sushi
You get a great portion of food for the price
We were supposed to grab a bite to eat but no one was really felt the food on their menu seemed appetizing and almost everyone opted to wait for the game where prices are much higher
In fairness in terms of cost it's no worse than Mastros Ocean or any other high end restaurant and certainly less expensive than Bourbon Steak but the setting is much more intimate the service much better and the food every bit as good if not better than those other must do places
The regulars love the pizza the drinks are cheap and it is a small dare I say cozy place
Its sushi so its going to be a bit pricey but WELL worth it
The wood-fired pizza certainly rivals its more expensive competitors
The food is terrific and reasonably priced
As for value and quality I don't feel that the food meets the high expectation generated by the price as most seem to agree with
First the sushi rolls were very good on the small side but they were $3 so for that price they were amazing  potstickers were good too
Having frequented the resaurant multiple times I'm always impressed with the food quality in correlation to the price
Sure some specialty rolls are a little pricey but that is any sushi joint
The happy hour prices are unbelievable both for the food and drinks sake bombers
50DOWNSIDESSmall portions by the time you order enough food it gets pricey could get really crowded if you're there at the wrong time just okay egg salad which is made entirely of eggs and not with lettuce like I was thinking the cute Italian breadsticks are flavorless have they not heard of garlic
Weak drinks and overpriced bar food make this place very low on my radar
The sushi is readymade as are the side salads including a deliciously tangy southwest pasta salad and are in a refrigerated grocery-style section along with Pom Kemper sodas and overpriced waters such as Ty Nant Blu and Voss
Between the prices on frozen food the sales on live rock and the health of the fish this is a great little local mom and pop sort of place
The fish industry in particular was overrun a few years ago by big chain corporate pet stores who were offering fish at a lower price and a much lower health level
cheap food cheap drinks diverse crowd and sports
So if you are looking for Fast Food at reasonable prices that tastes great you should check it our

99/lb and the steaks were averaging a little over 3/4 lb - so super yay for the BOGO sale - it brought the meat down to regular grocery prices
Even though it's dirt cheap the food selection and quality are on the same level as other $9-$10 lunch buffets
Great prices excellent food and a nice patio area pull together for a great package that is going to be tough to beat
But then again there's the food which is cheap and delicious
If you want reasonably priced imaginative creative Chinese food I suggest you try another place
However we enjoy making sushi at home and that is an even cheaper option
I think Ra is great if you want to go to a tready place and have fruity overpriced drinks and sushi
etc  Price is decent we had their chicken tenders burger bites and buffalo chicken bites;  I had an Ice tea and my friend had a beer our bill was under $30 plus watched an awesome movie and had a great girls time
First of all let me say this pho than blows the place out of the water price wise portion size and taste Vietnamese is my all time favorite food so I've had much to compare it too
The #6 beef pho I ordered was small for the price and I was give about 1/4 cup of meat to add the my soup
And the worst part of the whole meal was the over priced shrimp spring rice paper rolls I had to remove the shrimp because the poop was not cleaned out of them at all
I wouldn't suggest coming here for sushi except during Happy Hour because their sushi isn't very good and so it's overpriced if you go during regular times
A few things one should expect when coming NOCA-you will never be thirsty waterboy is there stalking empty glasses like a hawk-the pasta is not at all impressive-cotton candy is complimentary and served at the end of the meal-this is casual fine dining = large rimmed heavy expensive ass plates with dallop of *insert food here*-great venue for a date-menu changes NIGHTLYDim lighting  small cozy atmosphere but not excessively loud either
The prices are reasonable and the food is good
For just under $25 the price was a little high for the small portions of mediocre food
The price is a little high though not any higher than I have seen at other sushi places included Ra
The pizza was really good the customer service was horrible price was okay
The food was really great and the price was even better
The food is excellent and I think appropriately priced
They've got a friendly atmosphere inexpensive prices and a menu encompassing both the familiar enchilladas braised meat dishes etc
Price  $15 for all you can eat Chinese and made to order sushi plus a dessert bar
The bottom lineThe lunch specials are really only a few cents off the regular prices but for under $10 you walk away feeling like you've eaten real-whole-food not some over processed junk from a tube
I chose 3 rolls soft shell crab tootsie and I don't remember the third - when I figured the price I realized I was just a couple bucks shy of the AYCE price
Also their Boars Head deli meat is cheaper here than the grocery store
The prices are preposterous the people are pretentious and the pizza is pitiful
The food is great and the prices are just right
Food was not up to par for the prices they charge
95 for everything it was even less expensive than Al-Hana & it all turned out like thisComfortable dining room + lovely staff + excellent service + delicious food + very reasonable prices = Yay I'm a fan
It's good fast cheap Mexican food that is heavy and greasy and you want to be sure to have no plans after eating so that you may lounge around feeling large
Finally a decent downtown Thai food place with good lunch prices

*Price = on the high end for pho*Service = the bare minimum*Food-Spring rolls = ok
For that price the food and selection isn't bad at all
Also for the price $14 I could have purchased a rib eye steak sub rolls an onion steak fries slice cheese and a 2 liter of soda and made enough food for 4 people
Loud music Check Overpriced food and drink
Okay let me give it a review run-downfood  goodservice good polite niceprice under $10 for burrito and chips/salsadecor cheesy literally because it is yellowwould I go again  yes maybe in a few weeksshould you check it out  if you are in the neighborhood
The prices are a bit high but they probably have a higher food cost than your average cafe due to the local and organic sourcing that they do
Given the size and quality of these dishes the price was truly a bargain
I got the carne pizza - its good and I enjoyed it but not sure if its the sweet sauce but when you first bite into it it tastes like a familiar cheap pizza think Lil Caesars Peter Piper I couldn't really put my finger on it but the flavor becomes fuller and more quality later on
Good sushi excellent price but poor service
Now on to the food the menu is affordable not cheap I like the cheese and meat boards concept although I realize when they say hard cheese they mean HARD cheese next time I'll go do something a bit softer
The dishes are OVER-PRICED for what they're worth if I had to pay my dad had to foot the bill for a party of 6
I spent too much time and money there while a college student but the food was cheap back then and it is delicious
Oh - and they have spring roll wrappers - for a quarter of the price of AJ's
Nothing to rave about at all the food was just okay not worth the price tag and we will not be going back
A small restaurant on the corner with very low prices for the amount of food given but also at the cost of cleanliness/neatness
Overall I would not recommend the happy hour food options but the drink prices can't be beaten
Its not as pricey as whole foods but has the same great selection of fresh fruits and vegetables
I've been to this place for lunch and dinner on other occasions and the prices are really good  but their food is just OK
I've been going to Mido Sushi for about 3 years + and the food is consistently good and the prices are unbeatable

Food 1 edamame moderate sized bowl for happy hour price
Overall everything was great everyone loved their food decent prices and something for everyone next time we might try the Italian items
The only issue is that they should have some kind of Sunday football food specials or keep the apps at 1/2 price
Anyway the food is awesome worth trying if you don't mind the price tag
Even if the service were great I don't know if I'd make it a point to go back based on the food and price of the drinks
It's priced ridiculously well so much so that the senior citizens roll out from Sun City all the time
The bottom line is that the food is good and cheap and the place is real
Their food tends to be a bit greasy and overpriced however the salsa is excellent
I think you get a decent amount of food here but it is a little pricey
I'd say the food is on par with Ra but is a tad more expensive

This shack goes through its spurt of being good and average but to be honest through our venture with this business we have never had an awful experience with the staff or the food AND the price is soo affordable
I felt the prices were rather high for the quality of food
We also shared the pizza which was a fabulous price but nothing to write home about
Although we left Nick's not planning to come back as soon as we can I think based on other reviews that perhaps we just did not find their star dishes and for the price 2 sodas pizza and pasta for $26 I will most likely be willing to give this place a try again
Also what I'm pleased with is for the cheap price they have a great dessert area with an ice cream machine
On top of that  the pizzas aren't too expensive and the rustic atmosphere of the restaurant adds to the experience
The service is friendly food is the bomb and price is cheap

On the other hand the food was crap especially for the price I was paying
You can get a lot better Mexican food in Phoenix and for a lot cheaper

But the food is REALLY good and very inexpensive; everything is freshly made to order and is very authentic
This place used to be a great place to eat now it looks like someone took it over removed all but two of the tvs which had news on it and are selling over priced food
The menu was a little confusing and little pricey yet the quality of the food is there and considering the location of the restaurant pricing isn't an issue
All in all the great variety on the menu good service tasty food unique atmosphere  and moderate prices make this a solid choice for lunch or dinner
Low prices good food with good selection reasonably priced and served at all seats reserved seats if you want them good servers who work at staying out of the way clean new and nice but unpretentious

The food is upscale and so are the prices
Hands down it is the BEST middle eastern food around and the prices can't be beat

The price is also cheap compared to your typical sushi bar

Very well priced with great drinks and EXCELLENT food
I think this place has potential I don't go to buffets for the atmosphere I go for a lot of cheap food and they had a lot of decent food at a smoking price

One word of advice though bring your own food and drinks as prices at the Zoo concession stands are fairly ridiculous $6 for a hot dog
Our server was very nice and attentive but the food was very overpriced and underwhelming
With prices that are pretty close to what they charge at Panda Express the food is easily ten times better
A little more expensive than other places but you pay the premium for the better food
Obviously Whole Foods is losing an entire star due to the inordinately high prices HOWEVER I go there for things I can't get anywhere else and I know that
Cheap food and extremely expensive drinks
If over priced small portion dishes are your thing then this is the place for you
First the food and the prices were great and the sausages were very good
We then checked out the menu lunch menu as were out and about shopping after recovering from our New Year's hangover from hell and came to find the prices really weren't all that crazy; $15 for a Kobe beef burger with fries or slaw $11 for a huge Cobb salad $11 for a club samy $23 for a steak you get the picture
If you haven't been to this place let me advise you if you are searching for RA or Blue Wasabi which is my fav place  grade rolls & prices then this isn't your place
This place is fast fun and cheap that's right cheap and your food is on a conveyor belt
The hotel food is obviously expensive but it is good and convenient
This review is based on ordering many things from the overall menu over a 1 year period however one item there deserves a 5 star rating which I will get toOverall most of the items are fairly americanized and not traditional which you expect from a fusion place - however most items are very average and for the price I do not feel you get good value here That being said the one item that does stand out here is their Shrimp Tom Yum Soup which i feel deserves 4 if not 5 stars - it is excellent and flavorful with a lot of shrimp - make sure to order a side of steamed rice with it medium hot and you will have a stand out dishIn general their soups are solid but the only thing I have not found better somewhere else is their Shrimp Tom Yum soupGo for the Tom Yum get your Vietnamese soup from Khai Hoan down the road a few miles
I'll pay the prices for their dessert
Copper-kettle banging or not the food was good and a great price
Food is decent atmosphere is ok prices are little schizo
Some rolls are reasonably priced your standard spicy this spicy that and other typical fare but I've never seen a roll that costs $25 in Arizona
Metro Brasserie fills a HUGE void in this town by offering delicious French food at a reasonable price
Too bad that nail polish is more expensive than that food
Price of food and drinks there were typically high as similar to other baseball field around the nation
High quality food but at a bit of a high price
It's a great deal and the price more so matches the quality of food
Food is cheap and I am able to afford snacks again for my family
- flowers minus the designer baked goods minus the bakery deli cheese and meat sans the counter check out the price on the brie and a small drugstore with vitamins a baby section and paper needs
Don't get me wrong I enjoyed my dish and it was priced appropriately at $8
Although the price for the side dish was pretty steep at $18 it was a large family-style helping and we brought over half or it home for leftovers
The tab was a little more expensive than we expected but the quality of the food and the customer service was top-notch
The food is spot on very reminiscent of Big Brother Bistro but priced with the common man in mind
But overall if you want good diner-style food that's pretty inexpensive check out Harlow's Cafe
the korean family that runs this place is super sweet and has done a great job of providing quality sushi for a fantastic price
They do have some organic chicken but it's not the best priced Check out Trader Joe's for better pricing
The prices on food/beer were perfect even though I didn't eat I remember all of the prices were very reasonable
was not as great the meat needed seasoning and the chimichuri was bland  not to mention a little cheap on putting the sauce on  so i had to ask for more
It is taking it totally out of context to say that Big Surf is expensive for food or admission and end it there
Have you been to the ball park lately and seen the price of their food
Great inexpensive food casual yet trendy atmosphere perfect location
The prices are on the high side but that's what you get for wanting decent seafood in the Biltmore area
If one is going to charge the prices they charge for regular Americanized asian food
The quality of the food at such a reasonable price is something we will remember
Some of the people might have been arguing to get a discount on the expensive bill but given that most of the individuals were either on expense accounts or on vacation at a $250-850/night resort but I think most of the arguments were rooted in slow service or food that arrived cold
The food is bland overpriced and far from authentic
are made from fresh ingredients and include a side dish of your choice for an incredibly reasonable price
To top it off the food is actually fantastic well portioned and also decently priced
Playgrounds for older and younger kids awesome splash area water rivers for fishing and small lakes lots of trails for walking a bridge that is fun to cross or take picture on volley ball courts that have misters to keep you cool and the dust level down from the sand lots of ramadas that you can rent very cheap if you are a Peoria resident the inside rec areas has a gym rock wall climbing  there is a full skateboard area and 2 baseball fields
Real authentic food and not a bad price for good food
We have five kids under eight and they all love it here lots of food for a small price
Sure Chick-fil-A is not as cheap as other fast food choices but it's so much better feeling the clear juice of a real chicken breast run down your hand than the mucky slippery oil from a chopped & formed chicken 'patty' that a lot of places have
Over-priced bad service and horrible food
Value priced food exceptional service or fresh ingredients
My initial reaction was to upgrade my review to a 3 but after further consideration I've decided 4 stars is more appropriate considering the quality and price of the food
I'd be super excited if there was a lunch special that included miso or edamame for the same price as one roll but it's whatever
Not only charged the dinner price but would not be getting the egg roll which came with the lunch item I ordered
The restaurant on site was good fairly quick service decent prices and good food
The drinks were very reasonably priced especially given the fact that it was in an airport and no one seemed to mind that I didn't order any food
Food prices though are pretty damnoutrageous
Beside for the seafood items everything else on the menu is affordable and decently priced
Nothing is overly priced for the amount of food served
Along Shea Blvd there in Fountain Hills there's Wendy's which I have given up on expensive small and crappy; Taco Bell NEVER; Arby's weird fake roast beef; Subway genera-sandwich; & a few others
This is a fit-for-foodies place with a fairly priced wine list that has a pretty deep bench for a smaller place
Granted with that price came a super tasty plate of mixed sushi options
Our table also got the chicken nachos which were overpriced and had chili with a canned taste
My boyfriend said the sushi is alright but way over priced
Great food reasonable prices and beautiful patio
See I would pay Ichi Ban prices for any sushi made here
Poor food awful service overpriced beer
Other reviewers have noted the high price but you get what you pay for and where are they finding all this cheap seafood anyways
I'm used to paying resort rates for food drinks and service but this place is over the top on their prices
I have eaten here many times in the past and have always liked the food especially the Thai Beef Salad and the price
Anyway the food was really yummy cheap and as a bar it seemed to have great value too
ProsGreat Hashbrowns and made from scratch foodGood specials to keep things mixed upGreat company and serviceConsGuy up front says a little over 35 minutes but really means an hour and 45 minutesPricey for some dishesInteresting people around while you wait to get inside street walkers etc
Food prices are cheap portions large but quality and taste are not lacking
For the price I would expect much better food
Yes it offers over-priced mediocre food as expected but I appreciated the fact they offered a vegetarian sandwich $8 or so along with some pasta salad $5
The menu does have an exotic variety of food and can be a bit pricey
Basically you'll pay ridiculous prices but the fish quality is actually good
The decor the music and the drinks are great but I can't say that I think that the food for it's price is really that great
The foodis reasonably priced always served hot and the service is great
The service was attentive and friendly the food was amazing and the prices were reasonable though the bartender encouraged us to order waaaay too much food not that I minded We ordered-Edamame surprisingly large portion-Shishito peppers really good but WAY too large of a portion - I hate wasting food and we only ate like 1/3 of these - only so many peppers you can eat
If I wanted amazing sushi then I wouldnt have gone there - I would have spent a $100 at an expensive sushi bar
Wait staff was sub-par food was average and the prices still conveyed the idea that the management thought they were awesome
no food specials but the sandwiches were reasonably priced
The food here is fantastic and this is saying a lot since we never thought we'd find a decent reasonably priced place to eat after we moved here from the Midwest
The flavors of all the dishes I sampled blew my brains and the cost to quality was insane which means the food quality is excellent and the price is insanely cheap
The service was bad the food mediocre at best and the prices were no value
Loads of fresh ground beef pork and poultry at very fair prices
This morning I got a dozen donuts here and not only did they charge us an extra 50 cents for adding a tiny cinnamon roll it was the same size as a regular donut so I don't see the need for a price increase here they only gave us 11 donuts
Also my expensive cinnamon roll had almost no cinnamon
Overall it's good but I would say a bit over priced and some of the heat of the dishes takes away from the flavor
We went there for Sunday brunch for which they have a special menu and although the prices are a little up there the portions of the food are in line with the cost
If you're looking for a pub-like restaurant that has good prices pretty tasty food with a good variety of items on the menu and excellent cocktails Keegan's is your place
I have found their prices for food to be on par with other pet stores that sell similar food
I could get the same quality and half the price at Food City no joke
I have nothing to complain about regarding the food itself - for me it has consistently been good the servings ample and the prices reasonable
The rad nar was the best I have ever had and the dishes were reasonably priced as well
If reminding myself that cheap sushi and a good buzz is worth it doesn't work I'll cut happy hour short and probably won't return for another few months
In spite of the poor dessert choices this time around I'm convinced that people who think their food is overpriced or overrated have poor palates and probably rarely venture outside of chain restaurants where the food is laden with corn syrup MSG and other fake flavors
One waiter as we paid our bill inexpensive by the way- $30 for drinks appetizer 2 entrees and dessert said that this is the only restaurant he's ever worked in that he still wants to eat the food at the end of the night
good for quick grub at lunchtime in North ScottsdaleLunch was good I had the chicken club - the service was brisk and friendly shocker fair prices and the du00e9cor is excellent - has a genuine Irish Pub feel to it
The staples I buy here are coconut water all my veggies they are cheaper than Fry's wine great prices frozen fruits and veggies meat although I wish they had a bigger selection especially more seafood and I really like the bulk department
Though this restaurant isn't quite as good as Green I'm biased toward American-style food anyway its food is unique tasty and inexpensive
There are a lot of pizzas on the menu and they are reasonably priced
You can choose pizza or pasta then a salad and your drink for a standard price
The Teriyaki Beef Bowl & the fried dumplings Gyoza are very good and very reasonably priced
The food here is decent and the food reasonably cheap so we keep going back but it's not really high on my list of preferred Asian places
It's a little pricey for pizza but when you order it fresh it's worth it
I am a very simple eater I like good food and want it to be reasonably priced
It is rather expensive but the atmosphere food and service make it reasonable
Expect to spend around 150 a person per day on food and drinks and that's on the cheaper side
The drinks are excellent and the food is great a little rich and over priced in some areas
The first wing the husband ate made him a convert; I was already in love with the food and the options and the price
All three dishes we ordered came out lukewarm and the portions are really unimpressive especially for the prices
Prices are reasonable for sushi and the salad dressing is the best EVER and I am a sushi-a-saurus
Mimi's may be a chain but for all that the food is quite good and reasonably priced
once your ears and eyes have recovered from over-stimulation by way of too-loud music waiters who can barely hear you strange lighting and fancy filled vases take care of your taste buds- skip the cooked food it's over-salty and over-priced- fresh sashimi was awesome
The food was just okay kind of bland and a bit overpriced
When we sat down I thought the prices were high but when our food was delivered burger and sheppards pie we decided the prices were just slightly high for the portion sizes
they have EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN and MORE and their prices on meat and produce are also rather spectacular
They offer the usual bar food and the drinks are pretty cheap
The cost is cheap but it should be cheaper considering the quality of food is so poor and the taste is so bland
Luckily I had a sense of humor so when I ate it I said Man this is so disgusting that its good  All I am saying is if you like good cheap hole in the wall type food this place is not for you
Yes the crowd sometimes can be a little off the normal and the pizza is not always glamorous but it's very cheap and top rated for healthy dining in mens health magizine
Though the food was good I found it overpriced and certainly the charm you would expect from a neighborhood hangout like the Havana Cafe was totally missing
Prices are Scottsdale par and the food is upscale bar
Price is comparable to any other pizza spot around but the pizza itself if you like thin-crust is just awesome
They have pretty good prices for food but maybe there's a reason
its a bit pricey but you get plenty of high quality food for your dollar
The chicken salad was small for the price and was not that memorable
The price was high considering the food was only ok
rrI'd like to say it deserves a second chance but rude staff and stale food at high prices don't mix well
The only thing I really didn't like was that this restaurant was so expensive but you get what you pay for so I am sure that their prices were fair and reasonable because both the food and service were outstanding
Made soft by previous seasons of DirecTV with limitless 30 packs of Coors Light cheap homemade food and plenty of room to stretch out in front of multiple big screen TV's we had it made
there is a full menu and the food is on the cheaper side
I will definitely be back to The Meat Shop but the only downfall is that it's not exactly cheap and it's kind of a drive for me so for that I will leave my visits to The Meat Shop for a special occasion
Sashimi/Sushi prices range from about $6 to $15
It galls me when a place charges the same or higher prices than other establishments that offer full table service and comparable or superior food
I wouldn't mind trying some of their other dishes too but I think it is just to expensive of a place for a breakfast/casual food menu
I have no complaints about this place service was great food was good and happy hour prices were decent
