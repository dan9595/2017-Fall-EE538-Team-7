The dishes them self were decent but nothing too impressible and when you ask for hot sauce you get a small dish of chilli oil hardly enough for a true fire head
I've had the machaca burrito and fish tacos here and both dishes were amazing
The food here is delicious and flavorful if you don't live in the neighborhood it's definitely worth the drive
I know its fast food but that doesn't mean it can't taste good
It was good I suppose even really good considering we are at a fast food joint
The beef was a nice quality and thick pieces
The spring rolls come with a wonderful sweet sauce
The good is that yes you can get all you can eat of the available sushi not everything is on this special
The sushi available is of good size without the rice bloat that some sushi bars have you know what I mean when the roll has more rice than contents fish/veggies/seaweed or soy wrap
I recommend ordering a regular roll such as spicy tuna and an underground roll mentioned above
I wouldn't call it a sushi experience but rather a nice sushi restaurant in a good neighborhood
The service is always good the restaurants are always clean and the food is always fresh
The meat was great - a far cry from the typical dog-food flavored mass that is typically served at most mexican restaurants
The wait staff was responsive and the food was served up quick and hot
For the entrees if you like fish the Pescado Veracruz is very flavorful
I expected shrimp on the pizza not shrimp flavored puree
I was having a pretty good time in my head until the food arrived
my husband ordered the garlic/lemon chicken on quinoa salad - more flavorful than mine
The Taiwan Express has photos of many not all of their dishes
I've never loved anything I've ordered but I have been more than once so you know the food is still pretty good
Gotta' have good clam chowder or it just aint' a fish house
The fried shrimp are great and the brownie dessert is decadent and good
We thought the food was good and the atmosphere was great
Yes it's fairly greasy but the food is absolutely delicious
I should have taken the advice of a coworker who recommended no seafood in the desert
But if all vegan food could taste this good I'd plaster Phoenix in PETA stickers
As for the pizza my boyfriend enjoyed and commented that it definitely had its own unique flavor
Little Saigon has the whole package  clean cute friendly and attentive service and excellent food
Sauce is A~OK with a solid 3 star rating because the service is excellent their turkey and feta salad is amazing but their pizza is unique and just OK at best
We found it best to go when they are having their special 1 pizza 2 drinks and a salad for $20 and it is a really good deal
They also have a new very tasty Chicken Spinach & Apple salad with gorgonzola and candied walnuts
We've tried almost all of their pizzas and you would think having a name like Sauce and advertising pizza as your specialty this would imply they have amazing pizza sauce
Don't get me wrong it's decent pizza and the crust is surprisingly good for being so thin but still I could go to Barro's and get a more filling pizza that tastes just as good for the money
Especially when it's at a place that offers quality food and service at reasonable prices
Their food and drink pricing is very reasonable considering the quality and taste
We had the lettuce wraps appetizer teriyaki chicken and Korean sizzling short ribs
The host/manager was very nice and helpful though and the food is still good
and the Yellowtail Sashimi was great as well as a simple but tasty Caterpillar Roll
I was about to give 2 stars for the baba ganoush pita moussaka and some shredded meat dish that were good
I would rather have one dish cost $10 or more and have it be really good than have 70 ok or inedible dishes
The A la carte Taco's were generous on the meat and flavor
Lightly fried chicken with a sweet and spicy orange sauce over some tasty cabbage slaw
Just for a glass of wine and a shared dessert - Bread Pudding delicious
Now I will say that the actual restaurant seemed cold and unfinished but the food was killer
The brisket itself was super tender and had that killer beef flavor you expect from a slow cooked brisket
My husband ordered the meat loaf and he said that it remainded him of back home Ohio so I guess that's good
The food option in the kids menu is good and super affordable
I ordered a small traditional breakfast with bacon and country potatoes that was good but also ordered  a cinnamon roll to share with everybody that it was amazing
Serving such good food I'd be willing to pay a lot more
They were charging a ridiculous $12 for rubbery whatever that was cold eggs rock hard pancakes and a tiny dish of grapes served by a lady who couldn't even tell me the price of the brunch
Good crust not too think and the meatballs were not dried out from the oven; the garlic was a great touch
The food was good but for gluten free they really do not have many choices
Okay the drive through is never really quick but the food is always hot nonetheless - which is why I guess the drive through is not quick
When I lived in Phoenix I used to frequent CB quite often as the food was reasonably priced breakfast or lunch was always good and service was stellar
The food I had the fish and chips was served in large portions and pretty good
Your Ethiopian food is good too but I'd love to see that raw food menu expand
The ahi tuna looked really good as did the fish tacos
Food here is good though they messed up my order and put sour cream on it
I wasn't hungry though for just any corned beef it had to be Boar's Head brand aside from a few grocery stores the only place you can get Boar's Head is a good delicatessen
Let me tell you they serve up massive tasty sandwiches with thick piled meat on your choice of bread and they have choices
So tall you cant get your mouth around it its stuffed with corned beef swiss cheese and sauerkraut then grilled to a crispy buttery goodness
As I managed my sandwich for the first bite I felt the wafts of hot corned beef beckoning eat me eat me
For the health conscious who are rolling their eyes at my delicious choices Scott's does offer lighter fare such as salads soup and half sandwiches
The food on the other hand is sublime; inventive and flavorful
I've tried the many dishes including the duck the chicken and some appetizers
The portions are small like a tapas bar which usually doesn't bother me as long as the food is amazing
I've tried many dishes here that are bland with no depth of flavor
Either drop prices by 30% or make your food twice as good
Food is very very good - but make no mistake this is an alehouse not a restaurant so the menu is small
The food varies in quality or perhaps just varies in quality of recipe
Is it possible that the only good mexican food in this town comes from place where you have to stand in line to order
The pizza was good but it doesn't compare to my favorite pizza place
The bottom line here is that the food is pretty good and the service is great
I had the 5 meat deep dish and I was astonished how good it was
I've tried over a dozen of their dishes and all I can say is I've never not enjoyed anything they've made for me to date
And the entire staff is as great as the food they serve and the whole place speaks to quality from cleanliness to the ambiance
I just have to keep reminding myself that we are not in LA   Also had the 'chicken noodle soup' with it's slightly asian influence being that the soup itself has a 'hot and sour' note to it
I was hankering for a good fish dish a la Vera Cruz and decided to try out Mimita's Cuban Cafe since a friend had recommended it
They have so many great products at fair prices not Wal-Mart cheap but fair and much better quality foods
The burgers were the best of the lot made with an excellent quality beef patty delicious cheese and a tender bun
The wonderful salted dinner rolls were the hit of the night
it really wasn't even the equivalent of sharing two appetizers since the portions are small to begin with and we weren't inclined to finish either dish
The seabass was good but the mushrooms in the sake soy sauce made the dish even better
It was good but this wasn't my favorite dish of the night
The dishes are pricey but expect to get a wonderful experience of divine cuisine with an unbeatable ambiance
We had pizza this time while pizza is thin and crispy and pretty good it is over priced for what it is they do not look like their picture's with pile's of stuff on them they are mainly flat and chinsey w the topping's
This is a shame because the food is quite good
Good food fast service but busy at lunch time and small parking lot
The food was EXCELLENT YUMMY and the servings were HUGE
Average to the Viets / FoodiesNoodles Ranch by name alone should be a good indicator that they are aiming to attract the culturally timid
Butif you are really trying to be good the grilled chicken sandwich is good
Impeccable ingredients complexity of dishes and unique flavor matches make creations that are really unmatched
I never mind the food prices and accept that wine is pricy but like any other restaurant the prices creep closer to retail as you go up in quality and price
To be honest I don't even think the italian beef sandwich drenched and then smothered in sweet and hot peppers with provolone cheese even knew what hit it
To be frank because I guess I already used 'To Be Honest' I have enjoyed other tamales w/ chili and cheese a *skosh* better not bad but not the best ever but the italian beef sandwich today has me hooked plus they have pink lemonade AND deliver and that ALWAYS makes working Tygers happy
I had a love/hate relationship with the old Pho Bang;the pho was no goodbut the canh chua tom and tom bo nuong vi grill -your-own shrimp and beef were the best in town
Theydo use the poached porkwhich isn't as tasty as the bbq'd pork in myfavorite spring rollsLittle SaigonKhai HoanDragonfly
Our party was seated closer to the front of the restaurant and because they left the outer doors of the two doored entry way wide open whenever anybody would come inside there was a giant gush of cold air that would sweep in making everyone at my table cold while trying to enjoy out no-longer-hot food
----Quality----None of this even speaks to the quality of the food which is to say quite sub par considering the prices on the menu
We had the traditional hot vings guac and chips trifecta mini-burgers and the flatbread pizza with tandori chicken
I also ordered the Good Korma curry dish to take home to the husband after conferring with the waitress about good gluten-free options
Since the new Vig is just around the corner from my house has a super happy hour and the amazing salmon dish I'm sure I will be back
The pizza is good sure but the hassle is NOT worth it anymore
Dark decor aside the service is great the food very tasty and the prices quite reasonable
This spot is well worth a visit if you're in the mood for Chinese food
The food court is wonderful with so many tasty dishes
The best food item we had was the caramelized onion tart appetizer with gorgonzola cheese black figs and caramelized onions on a crispy flat crust
Prices overall are very reasonable especially if you stick with appetizers salads pizzas and sandwiches
His grilled cheese was full of flavor and I cannot tell you how great my corned beef was
During one restaurant week several years ago I was served overcooked chicken on what could only have been canned peas and corn-we never went back for the regular menu I was impressed by Lon's
Overall excellent food until I tried the boy's calamari- not so much
This place is fantastic delicious offering ramen udon and rice dishes with fresh ingredients for about 6
It's a funky artsy place with healthy food that tastes good and a huge selection of food and drink
They do a great business because the food tasty
First impressions are definitely lasting because after those dishes I was very impressed and eagerly anticipating the next course the beginning
My roast beef sandwich was tasty and the mustard was sublime the service was slightly above so-so and the crowd/atmosphere was totally in my wheelhouse but when on the clock dining at an Ale House you can't help but leave feeling disappointed
Really decent pizza for the price and the flavored garlic and herb crust was just as tasty as it was a year ago
For a pizza joint great service and tasty food
Always had good fresh food and friendly service
My friend & I just had to try this place to see what all the hype was about & to see if it was really pizza worth waiting 3 hours for
We ordered the Marguerita pizza & although we did agree that the crust was light & thin we again didn't think it was worth waiting 3 hours for
Quality local sports bar with decent food reasonable drink prices $2
Unimpressed in the quality and flavor of meat I'm not sure if they were even serving Prime that day
Very disappointing when you spend this much money and receive this type of service and quality of food
I found the food to be average-to-good I had the kibbeh plate rather tasty and plentiful portions and my dining companion enjoyed a sandwich
On the plus side they do have a decent selection of good looking pre-made dishes and some different wines breads olive oils etc
The food was wonderful but I hate waiting in long lines
The burgers are good quality beef with a fresh bun
My lunch was so good I took a huge meat lovers pie home which was so good my husband proposed all over again
This appetizer combines sushi sort of and fried rice
And a bit of a warning it can sometimes take awhile for your food but the wait is well worth it
The staff are incredible the architecture and layout is amazing and then the food and drinks
So if you are unwilling or unable to make the early matinees at a DIGITAL theatre with good sound systems etc or are just looking for a place to take the kids for a cheap movie while you hit up Santisi's next door for pizza and/or wings or to just escape the grinding heat in the summer
If you don't like spring rolls I recommend the Bahn Mi which is a Vietnamese sandwich that you'll never forget served with sweet potato fries
But this was what I consider to be way out of line with the quality of food service and overall dining experience
Food there is good but really more expensive than necessary
The server will make or break your experience - the food is good the atmosphere is great for family friends and/or a great night out however the experience is contingent on the service
The shrimp spring roll was delicious filled with lots and lots of veggies just the way I like it
What Panne Bianco gets right is -quick polite but personalized service-a great short menu with no surprises-great to go options-big portions when a sandwich and a drink cost $12 it better be good-close to my work wishing they would move into my work's cafe space-its right by lux-its food that any single person could make at home with a sandwich press but doesn't b/c high quality bread and the like go bad too soonthe somewhat bad-wierd hours and parkingkinda high pricesno place to sit and wait
I would not come here again for mediocre service and 1/3 dishes being good
At $3 and $5 per dish the appetizers are a steal
The rock shrimp and crispy chicken skewers were very good too
Yes it's just a step above a fast food place but the vibe is tropical and the food is tasty and prepared fresh to order
My recommendation to the owners is to put up some garbage bins like all other self-busing fast-food places and make _us_ do it if you're not going to
I got the small bite meatballs and they were very good
The prices are good the staff was friendly and quick and the food
I wasn't expecting much but it was actually pretty good food
Service was good though and the dessert I had was great Scharfenberger mousse
Ambience was a bit loud and not super cozy but I may be a bit of a food snob since I'm so spoiled by some amazing food in the Bay Area so I just can't give this more than four stars
Though Kung Pao beef is surprisingly tasty
Tips Asking for brown rice and steamed chicken make Pei Wei a fairly healthy and tasty alternative
The food is good and I have always loved going here for lunch or dinner
As far as the food never having had an Arepa before I was not too impressed
The Pastelito was the best-the ground beef was tasty
Long story short I'd like to come here again for food OTHER than appetizers
Don't get me wrong their food is amazing and their curries are pretty close to unique Thai
It is a dive but the pizza is simply amazing
Like everything else perfectly cooked the plump flavorful fish was served with carrots atop a pillowy mound of mashed potatoes
Francis was on point with every dish being excellent
I've been going here for years and the food has always been solid cheap quick and really tasty
If I have the cash I'll get some spring rolls with spicy mustard which are a hot crispy delight
Another jewel in the Fox crown-read amazing look and feel but outrageous prices for food that's really nothing special
Sure the meat has flavor but when the meat is too dry it certainly has a decreased presence
My wife and I had already eaten so we ordered an appetizer of chicken lettuce wraps
Must try the ravioli either as an appetizer or main dish and chicken Marsala with fettuccine Alfredo on the side
5 The food is just really really good
It was tasty as can be and I was glad as I normally order a Carne Asada Burrito when I eat Mexican food
The food was good but the service decor and music was not good
Coming from SoCal where there is a filipino restaurant in every kanto/corner their food is really good
Clean interior good service and dishes come pretty fast
tried their water boiled fish sour fish soup and a cold dishes
Water boiled fish was pretty good not all that numbing compare to other restaurant so it's good on my book soup is pretty decent too
They have big portions a big menu and delicious food every time
I can't say what is my favorite dish [they're all delicious
I've never thought the food was worthy of five stars however I cannot really think of anything specific to complain about either
I noticed that they've changed their appetizers and no longer offer the giant onion rings   I opted for a fairly healthy option the Sushi Combo $11 which includes eight california rolls and one each of salmon tuna and shrimp
Decent food good service good lunch prices
Some things that shine as stars on the menu* the hummus - served with fresh veggies and house made nan* barley soup when it is one of the daily soups - this stuff is loaded with vegetables and barley* angel hair feta or spicy chicken garden salad - both are HUGE and crammed full of the most amazing organic vegetables found in phx then lightly tossed in the house dressing that is crisp and brings out the flavors of every ingredient*purple shoots - asparagus and eggplant topped with sautu00e9ed onions garlic scallion tomatoes fresh herbs lemon juice and feta cheese*herb stew with chicken - I don't even know how to describe this one but it truly rocks
The scotch beef was very good too although it could have been seasoned a bit more
For dinner we ordered the pizza w/ sausage and sage I don't remember the name it was pretty good
We all ordered burritos which were also very good I love a place that isn't afraid to use dark meat chicken
The DJ played some good music and the place was nicely setup but for food don't expect a lot of choices
Although the food is pretty good though on the pricey side for  a specialty pizza ~$26 the service level experienced is beyond atrocious
Like I said the pizza and other food we had is pretty good but the service level makes sure you don't enjoy the food or the experience
Some examples include ahi tuna and caviar pizza braised beef with potatoes and unusual and tasty dessert such as chilled rhubarb soup with cake squares
The beef I have had here though has been very tender and flavorful so far though
I heard through Facebook of the excellent food and great selection of beers gotta tell you we were not disappointed the food was soooo good that several members of our party requested to meet the chef our waiter went to the kitchen and soon we were speaking with chef Diego what a true professional who took the time to explain the dishes and their origins
It comes out similar to the seafood tower and is so cold the drink bubbles when they put it in the glass
there is even a live band that is pretty good except everything sounds like dave matthews its just that the food is made to be non-offensive
Everything from the ambiance food happy hour beer and even cake pops were simply amazing
Not really my thing but with food it tasted good
During HH we ordered the pizza bread very good
There was huge pieces of piping hot tomato and bell pepper inside and the meat was flavorless and watery
Generous portions of juicy tender flavorful chicken piled in one corner of a styrofoam take out tray partnered with loads of rice flavors vary for example rice and beans or pumpkin rice and your choice of plantains or my choice steamed cabbage for about $10 with a drink
Online I learned they had a good looking happy hour with comfort type food and reasonable drinks - score
They call your name when your order is ready and it's IMPOSSIBLE to hear them call you when it's busy so if you're not waiting right by the kitchen your food will get cold
The food was good but not $60 a person good
I had the spaghetti and meatball calzone and the ingredients were delicious but the sweet sauce seemed to over power some of the flavor
My dining partner had the spinach special pizza and the ingredients were fresh and delicious
But we came for the pizza and while it was good pizza it is not something I would ever wait HOURS for like other reviewers mentioned
To sum it up good pizza but not mindblowingly wait for 3 hours good
In the past few years I have noticed the quality of the food decline
All that being said;PROS great chips and salsa              usually great servers               managers have been very pleasant and accomodatingCONS  decline in food quality               hostesses are not very friendly               menus always feel very oilyI think that we will probably try a different Arriba's location in the future
I usually only review a place that is exceptional or poor but since the choices for good Chinese food are so scant in the valley one has to make concessions
The sausage pizza while could have been crunchier was quite good
Oh the pizza was very good and more than most would eat at one setting
Thank goodness iPic rolled in to town to show everyone how it's done and my beloved theater followed suit
I would recommend dining with a large group to not only help with the cost but be able to chow on more dishes
The food is amazing that is not a problem
I'll keep going to the hole in the wall Smith location in Tempe where I'll actually see some of the Family and get the amazing food and service that I've grown to love over the last many years
I worked in a kitchen making pizza for a while so I know what is good
Every portion was enough for two to three people to share or even save for the next day see photos BUT it is going to be so hard from stopping yourself enjoying your hot fresh food in such a romantic dark setting music overhead was a love song station
I highly recommend this place for large groups couples events and anyone else who loves Chinese Food
I'll be honest - the food was pretty good
Theirs is pretty good their noodle dishes pad see u pad kee mau etc are also good choices
I am a big fan of spicy food and their menu does not disappoint in that regard when I specify that I like it HOT
My only knock on the food was the bun that the sandwich was served on basically a regular sesame seed hamburger bun It cheapened the sandwich in my opinion which is a shame because it was soooo good
The meat was tough and there was no smokey flavor whatsoever from the meat just an incredibly sweet sauce with ketchup consistency that overpowered everything
It takes a bit longer to get your food it's a good thing
Honestly it was such a good deal for so much food and such tasty options
The food was alright we ordered scallops and filet definitely not worth another $200 or a trip back
We were impressed with what we perceived to be authentic Salvadorian Cuisine so we ordered one last dish
I ordered Benihana rolls as an appetizer; they were basically tasty California rolls loosely packed but a real bargain at only $4
In a way that was a good thing because I didn't waste any food
I can't imagine it's the toughest thing in the world to make consistently good teriyaki but I'll tell you what those people are friendly every damned time I roll through
And the food is always still hot and delicious when I plop down on my sofa to dig in
Salumeria means a store that sells cold cuts meats etc
The place is beautifully decorated and the food was AMAZING
While Los Olivos Norte is not going to blow your socks off it is good typical Mexican food
They were quick to take our order and the food was out fresh and hot about 10 minutes later
Again the food isn't going to change your life but it is tasty and does the job
Seeing that their menu had some of my favorite dishes I thought I give it a shot
So some Spicy Salt and Pepper Pork Chop Salted Fish Fried Rice and Beef Stew Hotpot
The beef stew was wonderful the meat was well cooked and the large pieces of the green onion was a great touch of flavor
Every dish is labeled with major allergens and everything is healthy & delicious
The foodI tried the fantastic goat curry and was very pleased with the flavor and quantity
Besides the ambiance the food is always of excellent quality
If you are wanting a darling experience with a Tea Room with excellent food you won't be disappointed
The food is good I really enjoy their Santa Fe spring rolls as an appetizer the pizzas are always up to par and lets not forget their skookie they have for dessert yumm
It's the most delicious dessert and I can never find the strength to pass it up
Then I came to realize that their food is equally as amazing as the pizookie
She adds all kinds of toppings to the pizza and I would recommend ordering a pizza w/ bbq sauce and then whatever else appeals to you
The staff is entertaining & fun the drinks are awesome the food is fun & delicious
Wide variety of spring rolls & appetizers
I would give the meal several points above frozen food but not as good as many other places I have had chicken fajitas at
The carne asada is very good seasoned well and almost always very tender the beans which are cooked with wonderful wonderful lard are always just firm enough never just a pile of mush never watery the chicken is juicy and tender I just can't say enough about it
Which would have been a good thing had the food been tasty
And here's what makes it greatFood  Generous portions of tasty food
Husband and I got the sashimi plate to test its fish quality
I can't rate this 5 like other people for I did not think the food was 5-star worthy
He recommended a bottle of wine that would suit both a meat-focused entree lasagna as well as a fish dish
The sauce for the bass was great but the fish itself wasn't noteworthy
The food was exceptionally prepared and tasted excellent
The pita bread was warm and fresh and for dessert the baklava had a complex flavor and tasted home made
I highly recommend trying the pizza 'well done' which gets you more char on the crust
The full satisfied part came from eating healthy delicious freshly-cooked foods
There's something special going on there and I recommend it to anyone who is tired of the same old restaurants the same old foods the same old
The food and service are consistently good and the atmosphere is always fun
Joe's BBQ in Mesa is much better and the food is dryer still not as good as back east but pretty darn good overall
The Philly Cheesesteak was pretty good and I would have it again but the Pepperoni Pizza we had was a soggy greasy mess that we couldn't finish
What was once a delectably spicy Cajun flavor on the blackened chicken is now scaled back severely and is mild by comparision
The flavor carried over to all of their meats served and everything else at the buffet was worth the 20 minute lunch wait
We ordered a appetizer sampler rib sampler tri-tip wedge salad and a bbq chicken salad
While I enjoyed the tri-tip salad T stated the bbq flavor was nonexistent on her chicken salad
1 Appetizer 4 meals 1 Dessert and 2 rounds of drinks cost around $250 so prepare for about ~$60/pp or maybe $40pp w/o drinks appetizer and dessert
We've eaten at this Chipotle several times and although it is not one of my favorite places to eat I recognize that the supposed quality of the food may be better than other fast food restaurants
I took two bites of my taco and the meat was refrigerator cold not lukewarm from sitting on the counter too long
I had her touch the meat in my taco to demonstrate that the meat was cold
I ordered a flauta dish that was large in portion size and skim on flavor
Olive oil to die for with the bread amazing wine selection mouth watering food
I got a bit of everything to try I enjoyed the rice and the chicken dishes
The fish dishes on the other hand not so good the fish puffs were cold and not good and the one fish dish super fishy tasteing
The food tastes good but almost too good like there's a chemical laced in to make you an addict
Dining room is a bit more upscale and I hear the food is good but we haven't done dinner yet I'll let you know when we do
Everything was delicious from the hot crab and artichoke dip through the entrees to the dessert
The tour guide was extremely knowledgeable and the food was amazing
Overall I would highly recommend this tour to anyone and everyone that loves food & wants to learn more about great local restaurants
Despite that we were treated to excellent service great food and awesome experience
And the pizza--I mean the toppings were fine--but the CRUST  the texture and flavor are outstanding
The lunch special veggie soup and roll arrived and the roll was tasty but the soup was extremely salty
The chicken was flavorful along with the rice and roll as sides you can choose either rice or fries
There are a ton of typical ball sports eateries at chase field hot dog vendors pretzel and beer vendors pizza etc
We ordered the Cold Seafood Combo; it was crab legs peel-n-eat shrimp clams and oysters
With phenomenal wines on the menu dishes filled with a melange of delicious flavors and fresh ingredients and their bread is some of the best I've ever had
Fresh fish good portions and great service
they have a pretty good size arcade inside as well as a food place to get like hot dogs hamburgers pizza etc
The BBQ chicken was not that good either and resembled slimy dark meat chicken that you find in a Panda Express rice bowl
Of course there is nothing heathy about any of this food but it's solidly tasty and satisfying
It's not particularly interesting food just good to satisfy your deli cravings
Mine was piping hot fresh just the right amount of creaminess and I was surprised at how perfectly cooked the onions and peppers in my dish were - still crisp without being under cooked
We were not asked how we wanted the items cooked but the man cooking the food had been interacting with us so I asked him to make my two hot dogs well done and he made the perfectly
Overall I would totally recommend EG to anyone with an itch for Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food but be warned they aren't open for lunch on the weekends yet
My only other complaint is the quality and price of the food
My Husband got the Pesto Chicken he raved about how delicious it was didn't try because I do not like pesto
I for one am happy to roll with their recommendations when I am there and enjoy my whole milk leaded latte with agave syrup
Everything I tasted was delicious especially the Chicken Quesidilla
If you want a pretty good burger American Kobe beef or bison your way sweet potato fries and a good shake come here
I had spaghetti & meatballs pesto ranch on my salad very tatsy- the hot sourdough was awesome and a scoop of spumoni ice cream
Most sushi places put the basic rolls on happy hour but Stingray added a couple extras - the Las Vegas Roll was good with avocado smoked salmon and cream cheese and wrapped in tempura
Its got some sort of asian horseradish dressing that was really good
Good dishes its just strange eating them in a strip mall on the west side
It's the closest Market to my house it's fun and lively the produce looks great and the prepared food smells wonderful
But the tub-o-security rolled over and said No Photographs
The funny little pinwheel chips are great in the smoky salsa the guacamole was amazing and the chipotle sauce that came on the chicken&spinach dish was drool-a-licious
Didn't have room for dessert because I pounded my food like that little Japanese hot dog eater guy
food is pretty good as wellBut I would say the selling point of this place is the view you get especially at night you can see the city light from there
However the meat did not have the excellent taste that we expected
Every dish I've tried here so far has been wonderful I really don't think you can go wrong with your order
Guaca Tony I only recently tried this and am sorry that I've been missing out all these yearsChicken Ceasar Salad dressing is SO good and there's never too much of it The Sproccoli Deep Dish or Stuffed Pizza - have a little salad which comes out quick; then wait another 20 minutes or so for the Chicago-style pie--SO worth the wait
I'm giving two stars because the duck taco that I had was pretty good but once the food got to the table it took me 4 minutes to figure out which tacos were mine because of the way they present the food
The key to making pizza with crispy crust is to have ovens that great sufficiently hot
And while it's nearly a 10-minute process to get your sandwich you order pay and then they call you when they're ready to pile on the fixings the food is pretty good even when you're not high
It's sexy and food photography is amazing
The meats were a bit overcooked but nice and hot and had decent flavored and the pastrami had a good amount of pepper to it which i like
With all the wonderful accolades this place receives we first worried that perhaps we'd left our test buds at home - but then decided that wasn't the case because the chicken meatballs & smoky tomato sauce we started with as an appetizer had plenty of flavor just not to our liking
Please don't misunderstand the entrees we had Osso Bucco and Short Ribs were beyond tender but what both dishes did lack were flavor
We just wish we would have been equally impressed with the taste of the food
My heart soared as I took a stroll around the aisles and aisles of beautiful sugar-goods throughout the store
Can someone please tell me what's so wonderful about the food here because I experienced a very average--and somewhat overcooked--omelet here
Dishes were VERY colorful tasty piping hot
The deli meat here and veggies are very fresh and the owners take pride in using high quality ingredients
I don't know what shortly means to them but we waited a good 20 minutes or so for our food
The flavor was just very one dimensional and the dish got boring after the first few bites
I've been here numerous times and each time the food is consistently delicious
One of the best Pad Thai dishes I've ever had and most of the curries have had have also been quite good save the Green Curry of which I've had betterLike most good Asian restaurants you should come here for the food and not the decor/ambiance/service/whatever
It's not a high-end place but if you're after good Thai food you won't go wrong here
If you're looking to pick up a pie or grab some dessert this spot can be a good option
Try Unphogettable in Mesa so you can see what good food and service is about and you will know what I mean about rude here
Then your food comes fresh from their grill and it is just wonderful
The first time I went to this place I felt it was an amazing experience and by far the best chicken tortilla soup I have ever had followed by one of the best carne asada plates I have ever had as well
Simple tasty food with AMAZING tortillas and they have the BEST classic guacamole in town
The tandoori chicken was flavorful and covered with perfectly grilled onions and peppers
The butter chicken and curry dishes had good amount of vegetables and flavor
Overall a good value for solid Indian food
The food here is always consistently good
I would say the Italian beef had a unique taste not sure if that was a good thing
We felt the selection was very good--canned goods dried beans fresh fruits and vegetables frozen meats and of course olives and feta and desserts
i have to say the food was excellent and the decor and patio were nice
We have dined here both during the reverse happy hour and at full price times and the food definitely decreases in quality
We never would recommend this place to anyone sad since it does have good food most of the time when they can get the orders straight and make things as described on the menu
True Foods was my go to spot in Phoenix because it was right across the street from the hotel
Then there is the food their burgers were fresh and delicious and not too greasy their Italian beef sandwiches were met with fanfare as well
The staff is wonderful and the food is great
The food was so ridiculous good that we actually forgot to drink
Well Pete's Fish and ChipsI'm mean its good I defiantly go there a few times here and there
The food at all the restaurants was good but not stellar
This time however if anything the piece of fish was too big a good problem to have in my opinion
Food was good egg rolls good then main course
My dish was good and seemed like the portion was big until my pork disappeared and the only thing left was lettuce
They have those really thin metal forks that only pizza places have and mine kept bending the dough was so nice and thick and good
The pizza was good but we only got a small due to the calzone
To me that's a clear sign you're in a good pizza joint
I haven't tried the pizza but it sounds good
Since ocean club is also in town providing good quality and fresh sea food has always been one of their top qualities
I do recommend a sea food tower  and a lobster mashed potatoes for every dine
I'll be honest the food was so good I ate here twice in one day
Add mine to the list of 'damn the food is good here' [as long as you order the right thing] and the guacamole is delish
Don't expect high end fixtures or fancy toppings just good basic pizza at a good price
The sushi was good we got a Vegas roll a Philli roll and a California roll pretty standard and then a order of chicken yakitori
If you need to buy substantial amounts of halal meat I suggest you go elsewhere probably Baiz Market would be a good idea
To summarize atmosphere is a 5 cleanliness 5 food/wine 4 service 3/4 and yes I would recommend this place to others
6 of us left trashed and full of delicious food for less than 150 bucks
but for good authentic Thai food this is not the place
However this was disappointing as the food lacked Thai flavor the chicken was overcooked and instead of having good Asian flavor
But if you're about the authenticity and quality of the food try the nearby Thai Lahna or La's Thai
The chicken was very good tasting juicy and cooked just right
The seafood soup is flavorful and just might literally nourish the soul
This place really has a chance to be a good-size fish in a big pond
Ate dinner at the bar one night while I watched the baseball all star game on one of the flat screen tv's and food was really good
He throughly enjoyed his meal and said it was the best Italian food outside his mother's cooking
Overall service was good especially for a busy night and food was decent
But the Vietnamese part of the menu disappoints with a sampling of various appetizers providing frozen food aisle quality
We stuffed ourselves with delish catfish fried shrimp  and tasty hazelnut Mahi
The sushi itself was also good and the miso soup was tasty
The first time I enjoyed the Enlightened Thai Chicken Mango Salad and highly recommend it if you're into that kind of dish
I do love the food and the servers are wonderful
I'm not trying to bag on this hotel to be mean but when you claim your a high end resort with lots amenities then the service food and atmosphere must live up to those expectations and unfortunately this hotel/resort does not do it
One thing I have learned is when looking for good Asian food look inside
There is a shrimp dish with a sweet cream sauce that is amazing
I love their steamed fish which is slathered in a delicate flavorful broth
A good judge is that a  negihama roll had not chopped yellowtail but slices of fish and plenty of scallion for i think $5
But These are really outweighed by the quality of the fish and the prices
The food is always super fresh and delicious
The appetizer plate consisted of sushi a shrimp stick a lobster potsticker and something else that escapes me
My wife and one of our friends had Scallops with basil---excellent dish and huge portion--scallops had a little crust on the outside and very tender on the inside
Oh one of the reasons we didn't have room for dessert is because we ate too much of the amazing bread basket they bring you
Pretzel bread olive bread amazing sourdough rolls - all worth trying
Overall though the experience was good and you can't dock them for the service because the food shines
There's no hype just some odd decor good seating mostly booths  good food and friendly service
It had a bright flavor and the sauce was just thick enough to cover the chicken properly
Fresh veggies that were perfectly roasted cold salty meats sweet rich cheeses awesome
The saffron lobster bisque broth was intense in flavor but let each aspect of the dish shine through
the unchain chain it's a Fox Restaurant Concepts venue does a nice job of good food at reasonable price and with pretty good speed
While the cheese pizza I had was excellent there were some nice mildly exotic offerings as well
The beef lasagna was for the price of $9 also a very very good choice
It didn't have the same crispy delicious crust I was used to but I am not the type to complain about the food unless there is something seriously wrong
For our main course we got The Big One which was a combo/sampler of a hot link chicken breast 1/2 rack of baby back ribs and brisket
Clearly living in Arizona limits my ability to find good fresh seafood-let alone trying to find well prepared seafood
Still the food was amazing and the flavors simply perfect
The Scottsdale panini is decent although the quality of the chicken seems a little lowered recently
An ex employee of Spoonz was an incredible pastry chef and made amazing desserts
The food is decent not overly memorable but definitely good for the price
I felt like the chicken had been pulled from the coop out back and flavored from grandmas long lost recipe
Eden's Grill is without question home to some delicious homemade Middle Eastern food
The kebab meat had flavor infused into the core of each piece
Dry and sticky rice; white meat chicken unidientifiable as such and a sweet glaze that provided the only flavor
Soon our meals came and they were VERY LARGE and also came with egg rolls and fried wantons both were fried to a cigar color I didn't eat them and steamed white rice the rice was good But my meal called Amazing Chicken had this sauce on it that tasted like sweet and sour sauce mixed with wing sauce and I tried to eat it but after a few pieces I lost my appetite and it is a shame because the vegetables were fresh and nice  the chicken was tender juicy not spongy it was cooked nice but that sauce killed the dish for me
Both of our food was good will be back to try different items
Good selection of different kinds of meat including Kobe Bison Angus Turkey Portobello and Salmon
Was a little more impressed with their service and food this go-around
To the food As I said above the food is good not great but like all Sam Fox restaurants its overpriced
There is just no excuse for serving mediocre Mexican food in Arizona and this is the reason why I would not recommend Blanco
33 which for the amount of food and the quality of food and the quality of service I was very pleased with
The food was decent; my salmon wasn't exceptional the salsa was a little more watery than I like and if everything overall was not exactly as hot or as spicy as I was hoping it wasn't bad
One that a customer will want to come back for over and over againFor me this place set the bar so high most of the other chain places will never be able to compare with the quality of not only the food but the great customer service that I received from this place
We got our pizza home and it was cheesy and delicious
My sister had the Sacks Overture which is basically a spruced up Roast Beef sandwich she said the beef was good but the Horseradish sauce snuck up on her too bad she doesn't have spice tolerant palate
One person ordered the salmon over mash potatoes and enjoyed it very much the other guest and my self had the spicy cashew and chicken
That's a problem because their pizza is so good
She enjoyed finding different dipping sauces for each of her meats and for the veggies
If I'm in Tempe whether studying or drunk and I want some quick food cheap there's a good chance this is what I'll be hitting up
I was looking up papa johns to order some pizza and I saw some really bad reviews on google so I was second guessing ordering from here but my friend from to Tucson and says they have really good pizza so I order the pizza anyway and it was the best pizza I've ever had
The food was delicious and the amount was well worth the price about $10/person for breakfast
For hotel guests I guess they serve non-Asian food here for breakfast and lunch
Place is dinky and out of the way but seems clean and food comes out reasonably quick and it tastes good
The sauce on the Jamaican chicken wings gets a thumbs up the pizza was much better than anticipated and I definitely enjoyed the chicken lettuce wraps
They never let me sit there waiting around for water or to remove a completed dish - they were ALL over it like a good team
I highly recommend the Plantanos Fritos con Crema y Frijoles as either an appetizer or dessert
The burgers were HUGE the meat was very flavorful both were cooked to perfection and the presentation was top notch
You get a skillet of piping hot meat and onions
I been here three times and tried appetizers entrees and desserts
They had a couple of thin-crust chees pizza's and a couple of slices with different meats spread on them none looked worthy of even tasting for free
One sandwich did interest me The Godfather Hoagie as it has all the italian meats that I love but being a good yelper I chose to go with their speciality the philly cheesesteak sandwich
I normally order a two taco combo plate the shredded beef is what I opt for and they're pretty good
Good Italian food just a couple of blocks from my house
The food on the other hand was very good
We recommend it for the food and the coffee but NOT for the service
Great place to socialize eat good food and drink tasty beer
- All the food I ate at District was expertly prepared & presented- Everything I tried was delicious
The flavor of the meat was quite ordinary though & fell well short of the best burgers in town so it's another 3 Stars for this completely ok but not special place
I thought a good beef fajita dish with a cup of chicken tortilla soup would be a safe bet but they couldn't even do that right
There wasn't a whole lot of beef in the beef fajitas either and what was there was lacking in good flavor
The roll we ordered for an appetizer was okay but the serving size was shameful considering the price and the peanut sauce I requested on the side was very watery
And with fake meat and funky flavor it was left unfinished
The baby bok choy was made to perfection and as a lover of garlic the dish touched close to my heart with bits of friend garlic sprinkled on top bursting with flavor that complimented the bok choy perfectly once mastication started in my mouth
I highly recommend going with friends so you can do what I did and split up dishes and taste multiple ones
The chef was very personable and we will be back  to try his recommendation of the Espana pizza
Food and drinks arrived quickly and were good
5 - 4 hours if you want to eat You know what I don't care how F'n great this place is supposed to be because that is not good practice it's ridiculous & any moron who waits that long for food is F'd up in the head
You aint gonna find it here because once you drive west of the Mississippi you lose the ethnic flavor & rich history of real Italian food where you can achieve four star worthy dining at many local neighborhood eateries on a poor man's budget without the hype
For a place that is primarily a coffee/beverage spot with some good food allowing people to sit and drink free drinks all day would be a bad business decision
Their wood fired pizza oven puts forth the best pies you'll find this side of Italy with a wonderful crust that is both crunchy and toothful
Always a good sign to a great food joint
The bottom line is the price is right It's amazing how cheap we got outta there really the service is fantastic the atmosphere is cute and cozy and the food is pretty great
29 which included a Chile Relleno made with a Big Jim New Mexico Chile a shredded beef taco generous servings of refried beans & cheese topped Spanish Rice & three hot corn tortillas rolled up in foil on the side
The food here is a little fiesty overall but not super hot & it's all delicious
When you walk in it looks legit and even smells pretty good due to the wood they use to smoke some of their chicken
The pizza crust was amazing super fresh cheese and the onions were caramelized perfectly
All in all a fun night away from studying but is it worth 3 hours of smelling pizza and being starved while you wait
That's your call but i will say it's the best pizza I've ever had in the US and almost as good as the pizza i had in Spain
They also have  a small food menu which I didn't look at but saw what people were eating and it looked pretty good
I admit that Fry's catering food was a smidgen below the deli quality
They are wonderful homemade shredded Angus beef served sizzling hot so hot they sometime melt the plate
They serve a wide variety of Mexican favorites including tasty fish tacos adovada carnitas and even menudo Sunday's
The combination plates I've tried have all been great and come laden with high quality food
The service was great I always had something to drink and the food has always been tasty
But overall management complied and I'm grateful for the good food had that day
As a someone who's traveled in Thailand and loves good Thai I was disappointed in the food
Disappointing as the venue is in a wonderful location and the food is stellar
My husband however has tried different dishes and I've enjoyed those as well
The building is great the food is good our server was friendly though absent at times but I didn't leave feeling it was worth the $100+ dollars
My wife ordered the white fish and enjoyed it
Again the food was good decent ambiance cool building but it didn't add up for me
Went their for Eater Brunch the food was good the service was OK
I was impressed by the variety of food they had available most notably the Teriyaki beef which is among the best I have ever tasted
The food the two gals I was with looked amazing though
We were starved for food and Mexican sounded amazing
The cost of our bill was too high for the quality of food
On first bite you pop the egg open over the meat and rice and just get this layered goodness
The service can be a bit flaky but I'm willing to overlook as long as the food keeps coming out hot fresh and yummy
We all enjoyed ourselves and feasted on the new and different cuisne that is Thai food
I would imagine that one of these pizzas and a good glass of wine which they have a large selection of would make for a nice evening of food wine and conversation
The host kind of pointed us to our table as others mentionedwe walked past once and had to ask where he wanted us againnot a great startBUTand its a good butthe food was amazing
Others had cheese steak mixed fish grill Rokerij steak and enchiladasall very good
[Value 3 stars Food Flavors Service and Ambiance 4+ stars]I have been here several times for drinks but last night was my first night for food
Quite tasty but with some dishes you have to be careful
Each bite was very tasty we decided to order a few dishes to share between 4 of us
However the meats were delicious and their appetizer/salad spread was yummy too
I ordered the - artichoke tomato & basil pizza really fresh huge artichoke pieces and nice overall flavor
- sausage peperoni and cheese pizza super meaty super flavorful and just as awesome when you reheated 2 days later
Overall good food and a great alternative to regular pizza
The pizzas here are never greasy your hands or the cardboard never end up oily-shiny and it actually feels like its good for you
Service has always been good here the food has always been good
I wish I could kidnap the chef and turn him into my personal man-chef/slave so he could whip me up delicious Cibo-esque dishes whenever the mood struck
It's quiet tasty if you like pizza and cheeseburgers
I obviously tried their spaghetti with meatballs which I thought was good but not  the best I've had
The sauce was a bit to watery for me and the meatballs just didn't have that wow factor but it was good just not the best
We also split a couple of different rolls that were HUGE each one of them were delicious although a little too 'American-ized for my tastes  I would definatley come back here for drinks or as a date night if you go early
Keep in mind again that we all have our different perceptions and expectations on food flavorspreparationpresentation etc etc etc
It kind of reminded me of what should have been an appetizer like  Chicken Satay but missing the stick or skewer
We did have a great server who kept checking on us and his other co-worker who asked us how the food tasted and we were polite in saying Good which in all honesty wasn't entirely true butagain overall our experience was ok
if you want really delicious and authentic Thai Food cooked by someone from Thailand please check out Thai Buffet in Mesa near the S
Really good food and overall good ratings from fellow yelpers like you and I
We sat out side on the deck and enjoyed a combination of appetizers pizza's and finished it off with a Pizza Chocolate Chip Cookie - WOW
Their corn side dish was served semi cold and tastes like it has lemon in it
Their rolls were served hot and those were tasty though they would have been better off making the butter salted butter rather than sweet butter with huge salt chunks which were again just awkward
the sushi is meaty and delicious and well-priced
I wanted to take her to some place nice with good food
The plates are small and they recommend 5 dishes to share between two people
A girl walks over with the 3 menus they have sushi appetizers and drink menus
I know your menu is cheap but I'd rather pay more for good fish
All in all this place has great food and In have always had great service and delicious food
I came in with a plan go easy on the salad part to leave room for the good stuff meat and get some salad fixin's to at least make it seem like it is a somewhat balanced meal
My least favorites were the lamb did not like the flavor I usually really like lamb and garlic meat can't remember the cut offhand which was a little overpowering with the garlic and I like garlic
The other meats I had were also very good
I did not try the plantains but the garlic mashed were uninspired at best and opposite of the meat had little to no garlic flavor but the polenta was fantastic
She was helping us make decisions since it was our first time but the food was cold on multiple occasions
Not quite sure why you would prefer that instead of good food go to a strip club
Maybe if the food was hot it could be different but I really doubt it since the recipes here are just way off the mark
The dishes were too strongly flavored for the ingredients
I don't know what they do to their corned beef but it's like chewing on corned beef-flavored rubber
This place isn't exactly cheap but the food is pretty good
But overall I thought this place had good food but the price was a little pricey for me come on' sandwiches and appetizers with 2 glasses of wine for 2 people costing nearly $50
yes I know some of you may argue that the food won't be as tasty but I still think it's a little nuts to be paying so much for 2 people for this low fuss food
First Watch on Black Canyon Hwy in Phoenix has amazing service and very good food
I have been back several times and continue to receive excellent customer service and delicious food
The chicken was served hot the waffle cooked to perfection
We had a nice lunch at Herb Box today and would definitely like to go back and check out dessert - the pies looked really good
The food here is pretty good and very traditional
But if you can get past the horrible service this place is worth a visit for the food
I went to one of the soft-opening events for Arrogant Butcher and thoroughly enjoyed the food
The broth was exceptionally flavorful and the shellfish was cooked perfectly
The fish portion of my wife's dish was wonderful while the chips were nothing more than the fries included with the mussels
For appetizer the 4 of shared the spring rolls that were fair and a soft shell crab that I think should have been cooked a little longer
Cibo has a lovely patio perfect for spring/summer but even w/ the heat lamps it would have been too cold a cute tiny bar not much room for waiting and great thin crust pizza
I like the light feeling of the pizza but I think it could be more flavorful
I recommend trying a couple pizzas and sharing
I think I enjoyed it even more than the pizzas
it's not the cleanest place and the menu might be confusing if you haven't had this type of food before but this would be a good place to try something new
But if the food is good enough to compensate I'm willing to overlook it
We had an order of the traditional fresh spring roll which was delicious and fresh however I do wish they would serve more than just one that's been cut in half
Unfortunately they were out of the pork when we wanted to order the crispy spring roll which was a bummer but the spicy shrimp was an excellent dish that we forgot all about it
The broth is a good beefy broth that has not been watered down and even the noodles are of better quality
The egg roll has NO flavor and for some reason the Pho here was just not as up to par the first time around
I am not a fan of most novelty pizzas but this one is just amazing
The appetizers are good food is good service is top notch but I never think of this place for dinner
Overpriced mediocre food in an ice-cold environment
Overall the food was good but nothing to die for
The chicken adabo was very simple and good
It is prepared using chicken wings and they were hot and tender
I go out to eat for fresh hot food and great service
After telling her the problem there was no apology and she walked away with his plate returning about 10 mins later with a hot plate of food
The food itself was good but not great in any way
I feel that there are many places that match the quality of the food at Over Easy and have much better service
The atmosphere here was pretty good and the food was great
As far as my meal the corned beef beef hash was OK nothing special the hash browns went from burnt on the edges to barely cooked in the middle sausage gravy and biscuits were good but would of been a lot better had they been served hot
Los Compadres is a excellent alternative to the fast food chains claiming to serve Mexican food
The 2 stars was because the food was delicious as usual but this was the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant for lunch
I was recommended this place by a local foodie who is very picky
The food that I ate however was not any good
Rye was toasted just right corn beef was flavorful and tender not tuff like some places and not too much dressing to overwhelm flavor but just to enhance
It was cooked rare so that wasn't the issue- just cut and quality of the fish
I moved from Philly this past summer and I've searched all over the Valley for a GOOD Pizza
all i can say is WORTH THE WAIT & THE PRICE The service is great the food comes out fast and they are constantly cleaning the buffet areas cause we are all pigs
Dessert is from fresh fruit canned fruit pastries cookies cakes AND 8 self scoop BRYERS ice cream flavors
So the sushi is half off plus the house drinks and all the flavor infused sake is too
We ate so much sushi and got a pretty good buzz going for a decent price and walked around old town afterwards
Wonderful adults only pool with great refreshing food and drinks
Not greasy just good ol' fashioned chicken fingers
Service was really good food was very good
Some of the guys at the table were served before their wives and then were patiently waiting to eat until their partner's meal arrived - result cold food
The beef hot pot was a 2/10 on the spicy scale and we are used to this place being a good 8/10 usually
They feature a free happy hour buffet with assorted Mexican food which was actually fresh and tasty
The food here is slightly above great and below drop your pant and put yourself in it' amazing
The dipping sauce on the side was delicious though we also made use of the condiments provided at every table namely fish sauce sriracha chili-garlic paste and soy sauce
The first two times we had appetizers and sushi
The appetizers were all awesome - fresh spring rolls chicken satay tempura - all very generous portions
That was wonderful but now after reading these reviews it's time for me to check out that Chicken Salad I love chicken salad
It's great to find a place that has really good HEALTHY food
The caesar was really good the dressing tasted excellent and was tossed perfectly and the chicken was also very flavorful but the whole thing still had a light quality to it
Well I know one thing I'm a huge fan of Chef Jeff Krauss and Crepe Bar's former incarnation Truckin Good Food and have high hopes for the success of his newest venture
The space is chill and if the experience at the friends and family pre-opening this weekend is any indication of the quality of the food and service i'm betting they will be hugely successful
The meat had great flavor and the sides were also quite wonderful
They have really good fried food especially the shrimp
It's a little tucked away but very low key and friendly and plain old good beer and good pizza
In fact I had a TJ's chicken caesar wrap for lunch today and it was delicious
The organic pesto pizza that can be found in the frozen section is also very good and just the right size for two people
But I finished the entire dish it was that good
Food was delish date went well and it was a good day
My friend and I both had the fish and chips because we thought that would be a good choice for a British pub
I used to love BK but they are skimping so bad now on the quality of there food it tastes like complete crap
There food went from juicy and good to dried out garbage
Jack in the Box is always good and you they have a great selection of food
With that being said I enjoyed the food
you'd have to roll me out if you left me there too long The burgers fish shrimp & sauce are all good
The food is served fast and the price seems to be pretty good as well
Anyway I had jade red chicken and emperor's chicken quesadilla and both were SO GOOD
being a regular patron of West Coast heavyweights such as Langers and even Canters I was hungry for good deli food and thrilled
Their food is meh at BEST and WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY overpriced for the quality
Fantastic pizza good friendly service cute inside atmosphere but the location is a nasty dump next to a Circle K in a seedy part of town with absolutely no parking
Food is very good almost as good as that other famous pizza place in town but my god this place needs a new location
The food was good as expected since I've been to Famous Dave's before I would go just for their corn bread
Thus far we've tried several of the chicken and veggie dishes--they are all very good
With the closing of Bomberos/Verde/My Florist the burning of Richardsons  the crowds at Postino the valet only at the Vig the lack of fresh salads at the Garage cold warm food at Local Breeze and the disappointing service at Arrogant Butcher - this place moved quickly up to a top choice for dinner and drinks
start with cheese appetizers and end my meal with every dessert they have to offer
The pizza isn't good enough to justify our wait
We ordered the Q rolls as recommended and we weren't disappointed
The beef ribs were very tasty and I would order them again
Anyway I would recommend this place to anyone wanting a unique food experience and interesting decor apparently the men's urinal is something to talk about
The broth was tasty but a bit ruined by the really fishy taste that comes from less than highly fresh seafood
I always resort to the Chicken Parmesan and have always loved that dish but if you want something unique to Tagliani's and you like spicy order the Chicken Dynamante has a sauce made out of pepperoncini's soo good or the Spicy Rigatoni both are awesome and must try
Granted it's not THE BEST food i've ever had but it's good and did i mention how cheap it is
The busser was horrible and we had to ask for things numerous times but the food is worth it
I had the garlic chicken medium to very spicy and it was unbelievably tasty
Lunch prices are great - about $6-7 for the whole meal which includes soup & spring roll both tasty
So I ordered the Chef Special Noodles as well as the citrus chicken thinking that we've gotta go for the specialties if were going to give this place a one time shot
Carne asada chicken fish it doesn't matter they're all delicious and incredibly flavorful
One thing I miss as an East Coast transplant is a good fish fry
Sometimes it's wonderful other times not so good with the food having too much salt
She had to go back to the kitchen three times and then couldn't figure out the difference between the names of cheeses and cold cut meats
We settled into the pizza which turned out to be cold around the edges and lukewarm in the middle and really soggy
Still it was fairly tasty for cold and soggy and I could see the potential for a decent pizza
Bottom line  Probably good pizza but there's a catch-22 of being overpriced without coupons and overly busy when coupons are offered
It's good service GREAT food and very reasonably priced
Cyprus Grill is amazing and honestly why would you go anywhere else for delicious greek food
We ordered 2 appetizers garlic bruchetta and cheese curds 1 small plate flapjacks and two sharing plates chicken and waffles and the nightly special a fontina-stuffed beef and pork meatloaf served with scalloped potatoes and topped with a chunky spicy tomato remoulade
Without exception each dish was excellent
For the quality of the food presented it was an absolute bargain
The chow fun was the weakest dish on the table--your standard noodles--but the lettuce wraps coconut curry and stir fried eggplant were all delicious
I am slightly disappointed I did not try any food the buffalo wraps apparently didn't have much buffalo sauce and tasted like little dribbles of the red hot sauce so I in no way wanted to eat a nasty wrap that lacked the kick it desperately needed
On our last night in Scottsdale we wanted nothing more than to have pizza delivered to our hotel room drink some wine and pack our suitcases in the most leisurely manner possible
Was it earth-shatteringly delicious ground-breaking pizza
I've heard from a reliable source my father who is something of a fish nut that the Blackened Red Fish was absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection as was the dirty orzo
And the Grilled Angus Burger is a serious meat-eaters delight with excellent ground chuck and fresh veggies with Tillamook Cheddar
Dessert was the farina with apple dish different just OK tres leche cake very good and apple cobbler again good but small portion
Service was good but very slow dessert took forever and the getting the check also took too long
The scallops & chorizo are amazing short ribs sword fish crab crepes omg
again good breakfast big u can even share it HA the food tasted fresh the juice was maybe fresh squeezed
The price on the bill could have been worth it if the sushi was top-notch but this sushi was bland NOT fresh the pieces were either tiny or falling apart
She obviously had never tried REAL DELICIOUS sushi before
Thank goodness neither of us have fish allergies very unexpected
There are some tasty dishes I've come across but their sides are tired especially the GCP which never sounded good to begin with
The gravy was rich and delicious and it was a large amount of food since it came with bacon potatoes and 2 eggs
So while I didn't really enjoy my dish the others I tried were very good
Have you ever been over to a friend's house to eat and the food just aint' no good
The Sausage roll was mostly cold the puff pastry which should have been light and flakey was gooey and undercooked although the pickle relish condiment was delicious
The fish while piping hot was EXTREMELY greasy and devoid of seasoning
I LOVE a good order of Fish and Chips but was sadly underwhelmed by the offering here and was forced to grab something on the way home to satisfy my hunger
He was nice enough to lick my leg a few times during dinner though  For future fish & chips fixes I will save the 40mile round trip and get it closer to home very sad that this wasn't as good as i'd hoped it would be
The food quality and chef expertise is lacking horribly
*** Also wonderful cashiers and meat departments employees
The Chicken Meatballs are served with a spicy marinara that I swear has a touch of cumin that gives it a slight curry taste-DELICIOUS
The beef was so perfectly prepared that it was tender and delicious while the tips of the beef were so slightly crisped it really was blissful and euphoric to consume it
I rolled into town Carefree and Cave Creek looking for an inexpensive hotel/motel
I'm so disgusted with restaurants that serve such low quality stuff i refuse to call it food
Most of their prepared salads are downright tasty especially the Chicken Won Ton Salad
As for the soups and hot foods 2 stars on their best day
If you're going here to eat healthy you may as well avoid the hot foods all together
This is not a place for a sushi purist but give me good food a cool gathering place close to my central Phoenix abode and I will be there
That being said the food is excellent
The portions are small so I'd recommend 3-4 dishes for 2 people
The food is generally pretty good you just may not get what you ordered
However they have odd things like deep fried pickles which are delicious and their breakfast foods are super delicious
The wine list smart the appetizers tasty salads luscious deserts to die for the location is adorable and of course the pizza is perfect
I'm not particular on Thai food however I was really impressed with the teriyaki chicken with fried rice and brocolli
Also I highly recommend the curry chicken with pineapples
I felt for the quality of the overall food/beverage the price was affordable at 7-9 bucks
Now the food Starters Oregano's Favorite salad - Delicious honey vinaigrette dressing and we added some fresh Parmesan to boot
and plenty of food all tasty but nothing exceptional
I tend to get the veal piccata type of dish at Italian places as a measure and the veal here was very good
the wines were reasonable waitstaff attentive food was good
Good pizza places that deliver are hard to come by or maybe I've become a Pizza snob I'll have to check my wallet for a membership card
Well this was a recommendation from a friend and we were in the mood for pizza so we ordered up a House Special
They have completely different flavors and creative takes on traditional dishes
We had the white pizza as an appetizer the pesto penne with chicken the cannelloni with sausage the tiramisu and a cannoli to go
The white pizza was just okay for me not much flavor
My pesto penne was delicious I could eat a bowl of it even without the chicken
We shared the tiramisu for dessert even though I am not a fan of coffee flavor
Her and her new roommate received all this food one that had like pizza with avocado slices and other delicious thing-my eyes were bugging OUT of my head-this food looks AMAZING
The food was just good and when you have to drive 20 minutes or so and you are expecting 4 diamond food and service good is not good enough
The food was pretty tasty and the portions were big
The desserts were good but very expensive- 1 coffee $2
Like i said the place has a little charm but with very pricey food 15 average for entree'  and very little flavor  it deserves just two 1/2 stars
They offer deals on drinks sushi and appetizers
I was looking for a good restaurant not too far from my hotel and although this seemed to be in a weird location the food is great
I had the chicken and waffles and it was delicious
Anyway loads of good points - decent beer selection for the freshman beer snob and there are even some good surprises such as the Leffe and Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA
Meat was tender and the quantity of food was really good
If Postino is your quintessential laid back Southwestern wine bar then Cheuvront is the quintessential urban wine bar - sleek hip modern fantastic wine list delicious cheeses great food and a nice variety amazing desserts and friendly staff
What I look for in a good dessertIf it's a rich dessert it should be thick and moist or indulgently creamy
Eating a rich dessert should make you feel sexy and naughty like stealing a peek at a hot guy across the way to find he's looking at you too
After the requisite my food is cold jokes we dug in
not only is it convenient and close to home but the food is pretty good
sometimes hole-in-the-wall places are the secret and this place is my go to place for quick good chinese food
My food arrives and everything is good the pho broth is a little bit sweet than I personally would care for but has a good complex flavor
That being said the food was excellent
But no they had me get on a treadmill roll up my black slacks to my knees yeah not so hot and run while they video recorded it
You get a plate of warm toasty pizza crust with a delicious salad thrown on top
Another good dish is the Vegetarian Mousaka http//twitpic
The beer is cheap good specials and the pineapple bacon pizza looked very tasty
I must say i sliped out before ordering food may be good if lucky
The food was good better than your average bar/pub food
You can also have lunch and dinner here with typical bar menus but high-quality food
We were met with a very helpful staff who enjoyed seeing our reactions to all the great food
By the way the servers were very good at explaining everything and brought our dishes out timely not rushing us but not taking forever either
As it was I had a delicious meat and cheese plate
Menu was not huge but food was very good
Honestly the beef appetizer was so good I was thinking between four and five stars
I'll go back because the food was good but not soon because of the servers
Food is delicious awesome beers and cocktails and great service
I have had a few things there now and everything has been so good both chicken sandwiches burger mac and cheese pickled vegetables
Just as others have said the brisket is tender the chicken is tasty the sausage
The highlight of the evening were the desserts they were both good
We ordered the Italian Stallion pizza chicken pesto lasagna and the four cheese ravioli along with an appetizer of calamari
Chicken pesto lasagna - Good but not spectacular
I do have to say that this pizza is very similar to Bianco's in style and flavor yet came out faster and I didn't have to wait 3 hours to get into the restaurant
I adore love crave & dream about good Greek food
that really sucks because I think they have the foundation for a restaurant I would adore and go out of my way to go to and want to support - extensive beer selection great ambiance perfect location local ownership - Please Carly's can I petition for some better quality/more adventurous food options
Friendly warm inviting atmosphere & amazing food
Edible flowers for crystallizing espresso powder for my meat rubs fancy pants mushrooms high quality chocolate duck fat mangosteens outside of an Asian grocer the works
The bread pudding dish which you'd think looking at the pics I took would taste good  was a disaster
We haven't eaten here but the food coming out looked really good
Aside from the oysters the food was good unfortunately the service calls for a two star rating
And the food is good and the prices are cheap for what you get which is a lot
Good food nice people serving and cooking your food
Short version good food good beer one-of-a-kind establishment go now
IThe food was good but I urge you to double check your bill even though it's a small amount no one likes to be over charged and under served
My go-to place for a cheap and tasty pho and love their crispy spring rolls
The food at Olive Tree is good not my favorite Gyro place but I would go again
Definetly a must try for the hot dog lover or that foodie who's looking for something new to try
Make no mistake it's not good but sometimes we all have our guilty pleasures and sub-adequate Mexican food happens to be one of mine sometimes--usually when I'm hungover or something
I position my rating by saying that the food is slightly more traditional with less focus on fusion combos and more on the individual flavors of key ingredients
I recommend the layered dip with seasoned ground beef melted queso guac sour cream and peppers
The beef was tender but sinewy at points; and the potatoes seemed an afterthought having not fully absorbed the flavor of the sauce
Overall - Worth a try I'd go back for the Smothered Chicken again
My mom was disapointed tho she grew up in Sweden and so did her sister my aunt who we came to visit and she made it seem to my mom like it was a big imported Swedish goods shop
Otherwise it was a nice night with good food
Solid food and very good breakfast burritos
Walked into the relatively small dining area with my wife and the food appeared to look good
We walked over to an adjacent restaurant Pho Avina and had great service and very good Vietnamese food
The food here especially the pizza is of a much higher quality than what I'm used to from most places back in Columbus Ohio
That paste-like texture is never really a good thing although it was nowhere near the worst sauce a pizza has seen
TL;DR 5 stars for the excellent customer service comped craft beer and extremely cheesy pizzas
Overall I am always a fan of venues markets and opportunities to be intoduced to new businesses and good local food
La Grande Orange is know for their pizza and for good reason - it's delicious
which is Creekstone Farms' premium Black Angus beef corn fed and aged 28 days for flavor and tenderness
As suggested the hummus with meat and pine is hummus with beef and pine nuts and was a great appetizer
However I have to agree with the comment that they are as fine as McDonald's because the sushi I had there wasn't very tasty
The food we had was good - but be prepared for very small portions overall and fairly high prices
Desserts the Sticky Toffee bread pudding with bacon ice cream was dry and not flavorful - very disappointing
The food was good - not outstanding - and high priced for the portion size
Both times the food was excellent-  we'd been to lunch
In summary the food was bland the food was cold the service wasn't that great and the salsa and the guacamole were just plain WEIRD
I ordered the Roasted Chicken with mashed potatoes and enjoyed it a lot
The Banana Buritto for dessert was delicious
They have a HUGE selection of delicious meats and a vast array of beautiful chilles
They are beer battered like fish which could be good but the execution on this was terrible
decided that I needed it and some good Chinese food for lunch
No it's not the greatest or most original Asian food around but it's pretty good
Food was standard snack bar fare but was very good
This was actually superior to the same dish at Yasu; the soup was less briny and the clams were a little more plump and flavorful
I'm not sure exactly what was in the yellowtail citrus roll but it had yellowtail on the outside and something cooked and flavored with a chipotle seasoning on the inside
My verdict on this place is that it is an extremely good sushi bar with plenty of interesting cuts of fish that you don't see at the generic places outside of Scottsdale
Sushi On Shea has to be considered one of the best sushi bars in Phoenix; I'm not sure if I enjoyed the overall dining experience better than the excellent meal we had at Yasu but this seems to be better place to get traditional sushi and less common fish
I was very excited to see what the new La Fonda location was like and what the food quality and the menu was going to be like after the La fonda move from the Scottsdale location
The shreadded beef taco meat was dry tough and flavorless
The ground beef taco had no flavor and the cheese portion put on both tacos was skimpy at best
Incredible Mexico City Mexican food in you guessed it the steadily gentrifying barrio - with absolutely no hint of regional Southwestern or Sonoran flavor which typifies just about every other Mexican restaurant in town
I ordered the chicken enchiladas suiza which were flavorful and tender covered in a terrific tomatillo crema
The food was delivered prior to the promised LONG wait and it was HOT and fresh
My dinner guest was equally as impressed with all of the food
- Hamachi Crudo Fish was fresh good flavor
My favorite dishes are the Poke appetizer pork tacos Coco Joe's chicken cajun burger either steak melt in your mouth
My friend had the chicken pad thai I think 8/10 hot
Burgers  sandwiches pizzas salads and the usual fried appetizers
I love food and have eaten at amazing gluten free and other health conscious restaurants  in many cities so I think I can be a good judge
I began my love affair with Ethiopian food last year when I went to visit a friend in New York and he opened my eyes to the delights of this interesting yet amazing food
After hunting down our waitress and asking to have our order taken our food finally arrived cold an hour after it was ordered it was so dark we couldn't see what we were eating and we couldn't eat fast enough to get out of there and get away from the whole scene
At our last visit we actually ordered some appetizers they were just okay but exactly what I would expect from bar food
If you like REALLY hot mustard Pot Stickers & Egg Rolls demand hot mustard ask for the House Mustard not the mustard packets
The food is excellent and reasonably priced
I was almost going to tell them where to stick their 1/2 sandwich but i had read good things on here about the food so I took it and left
All dishes were very good and flavorful along with being Vegan so I didn't have to worry about dietary issues
Pros - the food was very good except for a ho hum dessert which was extra I believe and presentation was beautiful
That's a lot of money to pay to sit at a counter and eat not a lot  albeit mostly tasty food
If you want fast and satisfactory food and a moderate price this is a good option to place  on your rotation
The prices aren't too high either for the quality you get over your average fast-food place a buck or two goes a long way here
The Chicken Chimichanga came with beans and rice with the hot green sauce on the plate
The dish was right out of the kitchen and it was pretty hot and quite spicy
*Food = very good-chicken wings = YUM YUM YUM
-Spring rolls = I never had it with such a nice aroma-Korean bbq = I don't know why my bf ordered this at a Pho place but it was good
The chicken skewers were pretty good but the queso dip was horrible
We knew the food would be very good but we were surprised by the originality of the dishes as well as the taste of each
My wife and I always enjoyed the food at The Place at their previous smaller location so we were happy to hear they expanded into a larger restaurant
The pizzas are big enough for two and I'd actually recommend sharing with someone else unless you want leftovers because dessert is the best here
Overall Einstein's produces good food fairly quickly and for a good price
She and another in our party enjoyed the dish but was surprised by the black rice
The GOODSweet n Sour pork is excellent Egg foo young is greatTeriyaki chicken is greatBottom line this is a very average Chinese place
Good burgers and you get to choose everything yourself the meat the cheese what type of sauce or veggies you want
Your not tied to a box at this place and it shows the meats are all fresh and the cheese and veggies are all top quality
00 after I got kobe beef and horseradish cheese but the burger was very good
The one redeeming factor was that my friend said his fish taco was very good
Been here several times food is always good services is sometimes slow but very friendly and it's in my hood
I give Pei Wei thumbs up because the dishes are good  for a chain
but whenever I go to the Vig I always go back to wine so I can't comment on the mixed drinks food is decent but what doesn't taste good when your starving and drinking
I've also tried the beef/chicken combo plate with rice and found it to be pretty good
The other fare is not as good as the sushi
One of my favorite parts of sushi is Saki and they do have a good Saki menu
Joyful Chinese was voted by all three of us as delicious and near perfect on all dishes
The main dishes were all delicious and as they should be each unique in its flavor
The beef was tender and flavorful with the perfect amount of pepper and spice
It had an excellent balance of green peppers onions and mushrooms but still more beef than anything
Finally the curry chicken was full of flavor spicy but not killer hot and just the right amount of coconut milk to make the sauce thick and rich but not goopy or cloying
For the record I gave him the beef I took the curry and I saved the leftover Yui Shan to eat cold yum
Prices are reasonable atmosphere is great service is always wonderful and the food is awesome
Just to try all the food they offer to see what are the good and bad on their menu
Just finished dinner and the food was excellent
The batter was thin and tasty the fish white and flaky
It's good for a quick lunch and an alternative to fast food anything is better than the F food
Fish and chips were not nearly as good as George and Dragon the shrimp was rubbery and the clam chowder tasted like it was from a can
This restaurant specializes in working with food allergies but apparently does not specialize in flavor
Have had lived in Louisiana for a while I've missed some really great flavored fried chicken and Lolo's is amazing
All in all it was great food and worth the drive from Mesa
Capriotti's food in general as a chain sub shop can be very good
And the spring roll app was a little nugget of goodness which I didn't know I was receiving
The chicken fingers were plump and juicy and the batter that they use was crunchy and delicious
Each time I have been back the service and food quality was just as good as I remember it being on my first visit
At RnR fingers I have had the same quality food and service each and every visit
The q-rolls were so freakin good the chipotle dip that comes with is delish
The food was very good and I actually had to ask the waiter what some of the ingredients were which makes it more adventurous
My boyfriend had the fish and chips and that was also very good the batter was light and fluffy and served with seaweed chips
I had the pho ga chicken and I thought the broth was really rich in flavor
Lots of dark wood framed photos and I think I saw some mounted fish on the walls
The medical establishment is taking food as medicine seriously and cinnamon is an excellent blood treatment particularly for diabetes
Load up your five Romaine cups as you please with the delicious mixture of minced grilled chicken  dried fruits and vinaigrette
True to FEZ' American/Med/Maroc culture this delicious item was a Levanter of pesto rosemay roasted red pepper and chicken
Generally I find their dishes slightly on the spicy side for my taste buds - but overall very good
I was very impressed with the service the staff and the food
I have been to Paradise at least 2 times now and I can say I am more than pleased with the quality food and service
Spring rolls were tasty with a delightful peanut dipping sauce
Crispy hot and coated in a savory salty sweet fish sauce with bits of caramelized shallot really tasty
I thought the depth of flavor in the broth was minimal but after augmenting with fish and chile sauces basil and whatnot it was quite tasty
My husband ordered the fish & chips but usually orders an extra piece of fish when he is really hungry because the portion is on the skimpy side although tasty
First food and beverage vendors were amazing
Here's the quick and dirty keep in mind that I give some leeway when reviewing airport food versus normal foodPros-quick service-great place if you want to catch a game-really impressed with free wifi at PHX-For folks who need to charge their computer during their downtime there are outlets on some of the corner tablesCons-burger was mediocre and you'd expect them to have burgers nailed at least choice was b/w medium well and well which should have been a sign
Not pretentious not overpriced just realllllllly good chicken fried steak
My wife enjoyed her chicken burrito bowl with similar ingredients
Food~ all of their lunch meals come with water and hot tea complimentary
You have no idea what good sushi consists of and are probably a huge fan of California Las Vegas or Godzilla rolls
Either way this place is typically a terrible place to go and eat if you want to enjoy good Sushi Sashimi etc
It has a good happy hour but the food is pretty pedestrian
Though the service was quite good the food was horrific
It's probably the only food I will take home because the left overs are usually just as good the next day
We decided to come back later that was a couple of months ago and we've been back many times since and have introduced our friends to the excellent food at this establishment
The wine list is very good and the food is outstanding
We go back often finding that each new dish is a good at the last if not better
I ate the chicken sandwich with fries which was good
I ordered the bi bim bap sizzling rice in a stone pot topped with sauteed and seasoned veggies and thinly sliced beef with hot bean paste and when it got to me I was mildly disappointed because it didn't look as tantalizing as the one my colleague had at Chuhgajib a few weeks ago
The banchan a number of complimentary vegetable/seaweed side dishes served in small bowls wasn't nearly as varied as Chuhgajib either but the kimchi was definitely hotter which was a bonus for me
Once our food FINALLY arrived I really enjoyed the chicken salad sandwich
Getting off point the food was excellent their menu had a nice variety of options
The food is flavorful and fresh the soups are unique and tasty
Trader Joes has TONS of prepared foods- thats their distinctive point and most of it is frozen but it is quite good
Fresh and easy has some frozen packaged foods but its mostly fresher ready to microwave items- but I havent found them to be flavorful
I got the Baja Chicken Sandwich and it was delicious
This week was Arizona beer week and I was stopping by Taste of Tops to be a part of the celebratory activities and lo and behold along the side of the adjacent liquor store Tops was this lovely little food truck with a wide variety of hot dog and a number of other sausage options
Really good clean tasting even the fried dishes Chinese
The clientele can definitely trend toward snow birds occasionally but it is definitely worth putting up with the surrounding conversations centering on what is going on in Boca especially the exceptionally tender beef in the flavorful but not too greasy chow fun which pairs particularly well with the Szechuan sp
One nice feature that they have is their packaged meal deals the Deluxe version is an absolute steal for around $23 a person you get your selection of soup which I always get the sizzling rice soup with good sized shrimp big tender chunks of chicken in a nice rich clear broth with still slightly crispy veg and of course the crispy rice 2 spare ribs 1 egg roll 1 beef on a stick and one choice of a premium entree lots of good choices ranging from chunks of filet migion called steak kew to various other beef shrimp and chicken dishes and the nice part is the entire dinner scales up for however many people you have I am a big guy and this is more food than even I go for in a single sitting
not bad for fish in a desert once you get over that then it is worth a try
i think that's also the take-away on the food--it is a lot of stuff put together to cover all the bases instead of one single thing that is quality at once
One of my favorite spots to go to for good cheap and usually fast sushi
I love everything about it the only couple times I havent enjoyed my sushi were when we had gotten a couple special rolls which I can't even remember the name of those since they were so forgettable
The beef looked very unsavory and didn't taste great but the chicken is always good and never too dry
Okay had a good time food was good wife had the Prime rib plate for only $12
For appetizers the table had the hummus but a few others ordered the green chile queso very unique and good the fried eggplant bites I was hesitant about the goat cheese as I'm not a big fan but there is not that much and it just enhance the flavors of the whole dish which was good and the bacon-wrapped shrimp YUM
Fun unique selection of delicious food that you'll find nowhere else in town great selection of cold beers cozy dark atmosphere friendly staff
It's got some small shops popping up as well as some delicious eateries such as True Food Grimaldi's and Brio
They have excellent dishes that will warm your body and your tummy
My other favorites are bibmbap in the hot stone pot  Korean BBQ Chap Chae  Sul Lung Tang Mandoo Gook Katsu plate huge and seafood pancake  it should be an entree instead of an appetizer
Good excuse to indulge in my favorite dessert on the face of the earth
Every dish that came out was beautiful unique and delicious
My brother had them cater his wedding and the food was quite good
I went there last night for my mom's birthday and the food was equally good
My mom had the chicken in creamy garlic sauce with pesto added and it was delicious
Everyone enjoyed their food and the service was great
I had never been to a Flemings but I was impressed with the meat
Ordered the seafood curry and it looked delicious but tasted very bland we had to add sugar and fish sauce to make it edible
The food is amazing the service is great and the restaurant has some pretty cool decor
Very sad that there is so very little competition in the entire Valley of the Sun for quality food
In addition to grocery prices the quality of their deli foods have gone downhill
The ladies who make the food and bring it out are sweet and wonderful people who make me feel like i'm at their house instead of at a restaurant
Honestly I didn't get a good look at the menu food or drink but since this place is still in the process of opening everything is still a work in progess
The desserts are amazing particularly the pistachio baklava priced by the pound
But I'll generously round them up -  they're friendly the food's tasty and filling and fuggit it was only $6
Cold meat didn't sound that appetizing so she deferred to the Liberty Bowl + Pasta
For example refer to my photos of the brownies and cinnamon rolls
Food is very good though note that entru00e9es are served with nominal pairings and you have to order family style sides
Food quality was excellent and all the selected meats and fish were cooked to perfection
Overall Great food; Not a great value; Good waitstaff experience; Nice decor; Would eat at again on special occasions
Not that there's anything wrong with that I wouldn't say the beef in the taco was the best kind of blah but everything else was decent and the beans were good for once
Was with two other friends and we split the large warm delicious cinnamon roll
Their food is fresh not run-of-the-mill and delicious
The food however is absolutely worth it
For those that have not tried Vietnamese food I highly recommend starting here
So far over the last few years this place has been a great place to go for some good food
Eh as long as my food came out piping hot which it did then I am happy and for me that is a win in my book
However once we got our food that was also very good
-- The meats are all very very good but some are more impressive than others
Also their lamb is superb -- seasoned just enough to expose the flavor of the meat
By good food I of course mean greasy and unhealthy
That is the definition of good food though right
The food was quickly served and delicious
The pizza was horrible tiny no flavor digiorno is better
But that didn't detract from the simple cool-ness and quality of our sushi-our bill came out to just under 40 bucks but they have plenty of lunch and dinner specials I cannot wait to sucker people into attending
Maybe it's unfair to expect so much from them all the time but it's billed as a special place and with appetizers entrees wine and dessert you're easily over a hundred bucks a head before tax and tip
We just ate dinner there a couple nights ago and we really enjoyed it with no regrets but the food was not as memorable as it once was
50 and you get a good amount of food and rice
The pizza is amazing with crust to die for and the cannolis are oustanding
A gathering of folks to eat some yummy food drink a good martini or beer and support Packages from Home a worthy charity that sends packages to our men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan
The first was an incredibly delicious salmon pizza
The food that we ordered was good don't get me wrong but it was not extraordinary middle eastern food
Good food yes but not sure if it justifies the cost
Over the years I had noticed the quality of food was spotting with sometimes good sometimes bad but we continued to go
The meat is very high-quality and the Sauce to die for
Chicken black beans corn spinach jalapenos & pepper jack cheese stuffed into a crunchy egg roll wrapper with this amazing chipolte ranch to dip them in
My friends all had a great time and they said their food was excellent
It is a pretty decent amount of really good food for $3
They meat is finely chopped up on top of a palm tree trunk which I am not sure if it give it a flavor to the meat but I think it does
After our pizza dinner as we sat there catching up on Yelpiness SBCness Bay Area-ness Lynn and I sipped away at Pumpkin Spice Lattes while Claire enjoyed a scoop of Cotton Candy Ice Cream
For the money $30 for a pizza three drinks and tip I could have had much better service and equally as good pizza at NYPD or Bell Italia
The service was no good but the food more than made up for it
As for the quality of food well I think you get what you pay for
Your specials keep me interested and my hope for delicious pizza on Mill keeps me hooked
I had the bbq beef with the eggplant side excellent
the food didn't knock our socks off but it was good for what it was
Excellent foodExcellent peopleAnd an excellent addition to Tempe's restaurant lineupThe place is family owned by three brothers and is owner-operated
I feel the customer service alone is deserving of 5 stars not to mention how amazing the actual food is
Anyway back to the food it was good but not better then pizza bianco but I agree it is a nice place to take a date if its casual
All in all a good visit but the food is on the high side so I can't see myself going there often
I got a ham/pineapple pizza and it was very good
The crust wasn't greasy crust can make or break a pizza the sauce wasn't too heavy there was a good cheese to topping ratio
But hey when the food is so good the hard chairs don't seem like such a big deal
My chicken sub was pretty dry and boring and served on an equally dry and flavorless white roll
The decor was cool but not worth eating the food
Some workies enjoy the giant hot dogs and other meaty treats
As for the food after our salad course we were presented with a complimentary amuse bouche which was a little bit of olive oil cheese and a cherry tomato served stylishly in a shot glass see pic
Most of it was grizzled fat and when I could find a pocket of lean meat it was dry and flavorless
We ordered 4 different dishes and an appetizer and all we great
My cousin really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere here and I'd have given this review another 4 stars if it weren't for the fact that our bartender gave us such an attitude when I asked to sample the two wines first before ordering
Overall the food was delicious - hopefully next time around our waitress and/or host will be a little more prepared
He said his chicken parmesan sandwich was very good and I enjoyed my Philly cheesesteak
i always have made good reviews for  filly 'bs  but stay away from this onewent in for some rolled tacos thursday nitewatched the cook cut RAW meat on the same cutting board  and use the same gloves to make a burrito for some poor soul going thru the drive in he actually put the tortilla right on the exact spot where the meat was   then it was my turn  he took my tacos out of the fryer without tongs   and he used the same gloves as before   then to make matters worse he stuck his hand in the cheese and put it on  the tacos
It seems that all the food is good but nothing to say wow besides the desert
Definitely a must if your not waiting to be impressed with food
The pretzel dippers and boneless chicken wings were very tasty
My custom -made crispy fried tacos arrive just a few minutes later  hot and crisp  but not greasy- with the pastor pork and onions meat inside topped  with shredded lettuce  a little sour cream and and queso blanco
Our chicken was fresh and hot and the fruit cup was perfect for my son to feed himself
I'm simple so give me good food beer service and music and I'm pretty happy
We got our food drinks and check within a good time frame and she was happy enough
Pros Delicious beer choices good food as far as I tried Cons Bathroom was kind of gas station-esque  and while the food I tried was good there was a dreadfully small food menu
consistent friendly service with good food
the Ahi salad is good as are the fish tacos and salmon entree
happy hour is before seven and a great deal as the food is just as good
First I'll start by saying that the food once I was served was good
The koobideh was good the chicken was kind of tough
We both had appetizers and then shared a dessert
The dessert was served extra hot which caused us to both burn our tounges
The chicken was really moist full of flavor and delicious; the fish and chips were tasty too
The baked potato rolls were sort of odd and delicious at the same time - cheese bacon and definitely potato
We tried the rol your own nam spring rolls fun to make and delicious
We always get the dac biet as it has a good mix of everything and this did not disapoint great meatballs and big pieces of tendon
For this place being around for 20+ years you would think they would have good food
Yea the food is good from what I've tried
This is a family owned and operated place who take pride in developing the flavors as you will taste with their food
Although all of the extra ingredients masked a bit of what I'm sure was some high quality beef it still tasted amazing
I will be coming here again because the food was creative and very high quality
There are plenty of delicious options at lunch and dinner for my non-meat eating friends
The food is excellent I have had tacos the guacummus tamales and assorted brunch items
The roll menu is quite limited but all are good including the salmon skin which was my first experience
We ordered a scallop dish which I had initially tried to explain to our server a baked scallop concoction I'd had a couple of years ago there that was delicious and she said maybe it was a special that day I'd had it on 2 different occasions but it sounded like the scallops and uni so I decided to try it
We both had Chang's Spicy Chicken and Hot and Sour soup
I'm sure it's a famous Chicago food and beloved and if I was raised there I would crave it but to me it was flavorless soggy in the wrong way and existed only so that people could drench it in chili and cheese probably a hit at 7-11's but not for me
Overall I would give the service excellent the food pretty good ambience good and value above average
The chicken was really good the pasta and garlic bread were very so-so
me  and my husband was in for dinner we order the fish all you can eat it was horrible too much grease so we order one more hoping the oil get hotter n it not to much grease it worse than the first order the cole slaw was no taste to it  so i went home n call talk to some one in charge his name was Mark he i just tell him that the fish was not good but he did not even care  we thought we order wrong thing cause they look busy but guess wat we do not want to go back or tell friend go there the waitress was not good too DO NOT GO THERE THEY DONOT CARE THEY WANT UR $$$$$$$$ ony
Food was really good and service was great
I had a sampler platter don't remember what side dishes came with it I believe they were generous and fairly tasty- not sublime but tasty albeit mostly forgettable
Maybe all the spaghetti and meatballs you can eat is what they're good at
If you don't speak Bosnian I recommend you just stop in and ask what's good grab a Shokata and enjoy some great food
Not only was SAM great but the food was excellent
I ventured down to the Wednesday night food-truck thing at the Phoenix Public Market because I am now a downtown bigshot
Now they don't publish their contents and calories of their dishes so I may be loving some heavy caloric meals but it is worth those calories
Very comfortable and delicious food - I would go back
What a shame that the good food and drink and nice ambience of the place has been ruined by an incompetent staff
Also while the Pho gets the most attention Pho Bien and the pork/beef are excellent the Hot Pot K got the seafood Soup was amazing
As always the staff is great the food is amazing at a great price and the place always makes me feel swanky as shit
The food is tasty but clearly pre-made and that is a little off setting
Anything usually tastes good with a lot of butter/oil and bacon which are one of two main ingredients of the Delux Burger after the beef
The Chinese Chicken Salad was horrible chicken wasn't cooked fish sandwich was bland and the grilled chicken sandwich was less tasty than McDonald's McGrilled Chicken
Although Chelsea's Kitchen has a pretty decent burger pricey as Delux thoughI think people in Phoenix haven't had good food before don't know what good food it or clueless
USED TO be known by locals for great wings and bartenders with some personality but they ditched them for room temperature not served hot to us at least breaded food service tasted that way wings
The japanese teppanyaki beef is also wonderful
Have had a couple of different subs the hot wings and pizza
The Pizza was nothing to rave about but good
This place is great for assisting the Snottsdale crowd and other unsophisticated palates at overextending their revolving credit a bit further but if you want good food then go elsewhere
While the sushi is good  I'd put it in my top 5 in the area it was the atmosphere that got me
The patrons are as friendly as the staff and great recommendations for food came from both
I have eaten a lot of very random and very no-so-good-for-you food in my day but this torta may take the lead
But not only is the food excellent the experience is fun as well
I was surprised that the bacon wrapped filet was very fatty but overall the quality of the meat was amazing
The salad bar was very fresh and tasty and the tres leches cake for dessert is definitely one to try
The crunch rolls and California rolls were tasty
The meat was juicy but not super flavorful
The sandwich was large and I left full but with so much great food in Tempe and a few other good BBQ joints around town I probably won't stumble into this place again
We also didn't feel Ike a fancy Italian restaurant meal but just some good Italian comfort food
As for dinner we ordered the Chicken Parmigiana Chicken Pasta Milano along with Mama's Trio see photos
The chicken in my chimichanga was very fatty and had very little flavor
There was only one waitress for the entire restaurant which was very disappointing because we had to wait for a good amount of time to order our food and to get our check
The meat department has the best cuts of meat the deli is connected to the hot ready to go food
They are cooked perfectly and the meat inside is well seasoned and quite tasty
The egg dishes crepes etc always leave me feeling unsatisfied and find they lack a bit of punch in the flavor department
Jekyll Says - On the contrary the non-breakfast foods are quite good
The salads and the pizzas are really good freshly made and what you would expect from an artisanal pizza place
You have to order your food all the while scout for the random table opening while also keeping a watchful eye out for your food to make sure you claim it before it goes cold
Standouts are the Italian beef with lots o hot
The corned beef was good but overall just lacking
The food is pretty delicious but I am not a connoisseur
The pizza was thin interesting and generally good though it took them 3 tries to bring it out the way it was ordered
I say that's it not for everyone because of the complexity and oddity of a lot of the food - each bite is flavor bonanza and often an extremely bizarre combination raw salmon with almond pecorino mint balsamic etc but it always seems to work
And I wasn't thrilled with the cheap wooden chopsticks - they changed the flavors of the subtle foods a little bit so I used the silverware - seemed a weird oversight for a restaurant that seems so focused on flavor precision but no biggie
My plate of food was huge and very tasty and with Coffee and Tax only $10
This pizza is perfect for when you want a quick inexpensive delicious meal but don't buy extra
The chicken dishes were tasty one was Chicken Marsala the other a Chicken dish with artichokes
Desserts were pretty good the favorite was the cannelloni
There was no flavor coming from that shredded beef that would've given me a hint I was eating southwestern food
One thing about Phoenix is that it's near impossible to find French food and good French food at that
To be honest everything is pretty pricey but it's totally worth it and I don't think that there's such a thing as cheap French food anyway
I also enjoyed the cherry's jubilees crepe with vanilla ice cream for dessert
The shopping and the food and the outdoors of it all make this place worth it
I had the house enchiladas with grilled chicken and that was delicious
We shared the macadamia nut brownie and ice cream for dessert and that was wonderful
Normally I get my sushi coma fill and I'm good for a few weeks; I kinda wanted to go back the next day
I'm not huge on raw fish so I stick to the cooked rolls and they are always really good; First trip was $10 = 4 plates iced tea and tip
Apparently they used to have this ravioli dish that was amazing but for some reason they took it off the menu which greatly disappointed my husband so I'm docking a star for that
If you want a good burger that's NOT frozen or from a fast food restaurant but also is a GREAT price for college students
The burgers are big and juicy and homemade and their fried mushrooms/zucchini are REALLY good if you don't mind fried food
If you're looking for good authentic chinese food then this place is one of my favorites in Phoenix
The ownership has been the same since they took over the location from Yummy China which was a pretty bad place and the food has been consistently good
So friendly and apologetic people not-so-good food
The food is good but seems they are still working on their recipes
Started with the Samurai Beef Sticks Excellent
Don't expect anything fancy just good honest home style Japanese food with no frills
Fresh rolls all the cold cuts are prepared and sliced as you wait
it had a strong black pepper flavor which I'm not a fan of but the meat was nice and tender
Sauteed shrimp with salsa verde which was light and fresh and wonderful but my favorite part of the dish was the roasted tomato with tropical pesto it was so flavorful
TRES LECHES dessert was amazing I'm not exaggerating at all
Yes the prices are a bit high compared to serving size but I felt it was worth it given the complexity of the recipes and the fact that this ice cream parlor needs a liquor license Desserts in sit-down restaurants cost considerably more and are not usually as good as this ice cream
Whether it's the cafe in Scottsdale or the one overlooking Union Square in SF the Neiman Cafes all around have one thing in common delicious food and mouthwatering popovers
Even with a dry cleaner among other small mom and pop shops near by this place does a good job of drawing you in with the smoky and sweet smell of slow cooked meat
Big hunks of meat cooked low and slow transforming into tender and juicy meat so good tasting you will wish you had three stomachs
The meat was tender had a good outside bark and smoke ring letting me know the person cooking this food knew what they were doing
Overall I have to say the food I had was good and I do look forward to trying other menu items in the future
Don't get me wrong I still enjoyed the food and would return here for another special occasion
Cafe Boa has a delicious collection of dishes some with strong or spicy flavors others more finely tuned and nuanced
Of all the food I've had there it was good
So if you want to immerse yourself in good food and some lively people take a drive down to Ranch Market
The first time I came I had to try the chicken chili relleno as it came so highly recommended
I'm cheap so I tend to go here for lunch when the prices are a bit lower but the food is just as delicious
I would give this place 5 stars if it had a few more items but all the dishes are good
They also have a goat dish that's very good ---- WATCH OUT FOR BONES CHEW CAREFULLY
The sushi quality and variety wasn't bad either
Pretty standard Cuban food and it was excellent
We topped the food off with a really good pitcher of sangria while a Cuban band played live Cuban music in front of us
The spring rolls are very fresh and delicious
Very attentive service and very good food
The food was delicious and servings reasonable if you get all the courses you can actually take some home
We have been here a few times for lunch and the food has always been good
It came with homemade rolls/biscuits family style salad for the table to share green beans beans tasty
Once my chicken was finger looking good; but then it tasted reheated
Service was quick and the food was served hot
We ordered fried calamari and vegetarian spring rolls for an appetizer
The spring rolls were 90% breading and 10% spicy delicious something I wish they'd put more of in the roll
Thank goodness it is staying light later now that spring is here because the food is really good
aside from the line and it taking 10 minutes to get our name on the list the food was definitely worth the wait
My friend that went with me recommends the chicken legs instead of the breasts though she said the breasts were a little dry
Wood paneled walls grimy pastel booths and chipped wooden tables can be looked over when the food is good
Pizza and salad while using quality ingredients is boring and dare I say skimpy
Two words Ricotta cheeseYes it costs extra for all the things I like on my pizza and I was shocked when I ordered a large and a personal pizza one night and the total was $45 and they put jalapenos on both when I had only ordered it on one but it just tastes so good
My recommendations- Pizza with Ricotta Cheese Sausage and Jalapenos
The food is fantastic and worth waiting for
We ordered the meal for 6-8 people which included a Turkey gravy sweet potatoes mashed potatoes green beans almondine rolls stuffing and cranberry relish for the amazing price of $130
My husband had the whiskey apple glazed chicken which was actually the best of our dinners but not over the top delicious just alright
The Happy hour prices made it worth going before 7pmVEGAS roll is the bomb Spicy tuna is excellent
Always very fresh always consistent delicious food--and that's as close to perfect as a restaurant can get
The food doesn't come out quickly but thats fine since the pasty was delicious
The soup was really delicious and her chicken smelled heavenly
We enjoyed our time there the food and scenery were great so we both agreed we would eventually come back
The food was good hummus though was very good
She went for a pizza and said they were delicious so I just had to do to the same and I am so happy I did
I didn't get to eat in the actual restaurant but I did try the food they put out for us in the banquet room and it was delicious
I'm visiting from California and I know good Mexican food
The chicken mole is out if this world very good sized portions you will have leftovers for lunch the next day
- I got the buffet and had the chick peas salad very good chicken tikka masala flavor was great but the chicken was slightly dry goat masala this was amazing and their tandoori chicken which was some of the best I have had
The pizza is another story I really didn't feel they matched flavors well duck with citrus and and too many herb mixings on all the pizzas we got
I brought my madre along and she is an expert connoisseur of Mexican food and she enjoyed it as well
I have tried many things there their fish tacos their carne asada tacos and I have to say the carne asada tacos arent the best the meat tends to have a sweet taste-like flavor that isn't really appropriate for Mexican food but their tortas were to die for as well as their Paloma drinks delicious
But if it weren't for their delicious food I wouldn't go back
I had a hot dog Mushroom Burger and Fat Ass Burger which consists of garlic aioli swiss cheese and sauteed mushrooms all meats were charbroiled moist and very well seasoned
This Korean owned market has a good selection of Korean Vietnamese and Indian foods
The selection of fish was good the fish looked very fresh and it was clean well organized
Ok so this place has pretty amazing spring rolls but the cook Boyd decides to not make them for me she told me they ran out
The PHO broth is awesome but due to the economy they have been using chewy low quality chickens of beef in their PHO yuck
However I am giving them only three stars because they have been using low quality meat as of lately and they only make you spring rolls if they like you or feel like it
I've been to this place for many timeswhenever I'm in Arizona and I always received the excellent food & the service
The interior decor isn't that  impressive or a style of up to date but it is a clean restaurant that I can enjoy my tasty Chinese dishes any time at Wong's
They are super crispy hot and the fish itself is still soft and moist
Whether you are a connoiseur of Mexican cuisine tacos or just love eating good food I highly advise you stop by
I had never been to their physical location before but I had tasted their yummy cold concoctions at various events when they brought out their food truck
I ordered a dish on the new menu a lot more options than before that came with a short description in English and had a photo next to it
I ordered the shrimp and crab noodle dish which in the photo looked like it had hand-made noodles that resembled Korean potato dumplings
And amazingly the prizes you earn with your tickets are decent compared to pizza joints that rip off little kids for junk
Their happy hour is fantastic; they have really affordable appetizer and sushi rolls from 3-6 as well as drink specials obviously
But if you're new to the Japanese food scene it's a safe and delicious bet
I will be recommending this to anyone that asks me for any southern food restaurants in the future
But the quality if the food in relation to the price is what gets me
Among the four of us we ordered a few appetizers and a main dish each
Peppered Steak perfect flavor balance is my favorite option when it is in stock falling back on the suitably spicy Lamb Vindaloo not too fiery but still true to the idea and Cottage Pie comfort food
Sure enough within minutes he and his team cleared off a neighboring table and pushed it together with one of ours so we could all sit together and enjoy our delicious food and drinks
Now don't get me wrong the food is very good
Now the dessert is not so great or very good for that matter
I had to travel all the way to Phoenix for some good fried chicken
I'm still getting over how amazing the food and service here was
The food is so fresh and healthy I kept forgetting that I was downing a veritable feast of Middle Eastern goodness
I have been twice now and have had their pork chops hot links and chicken wings all were perfectly seasoned perfectly cooked and tasted excellent
My husband and I have always enjoyed the food
I'm sure there's some good desserts at Ruth's Chris but we didn't even look at the menu
I was even more blown away with the food than the last time due to perhaps I picked foods that were more suiting to me some highs were-Beet salad- it was similar to others I had in other places but this one also had HOUSE GROWN BEETS Riesling soaked pears and the toasted hazelnuts made the salad  pop with flavor
This dessert was something Iron chef worthy for sure with all the flavors working well together
Quiet intimate reasonably priced overall excellent food and wonderful bonfire smell
KILLER dessert and wonderful selection of draft beer
I'm not sure if it's supposed to be healthy mexican food but either way it wasn't that tasty for me
The chicken sandwich is pretty good but the grilled cheese is better
From the wood fired pizza to the delectable salads everything on the menu is worth every penny
On the other hand their falafel is good gyro meat is good chicken is good regular hummus is good I'm not a fan of their other flavors
Too many problems here & I'll never return but since the food itself was pretty good I'll bring it up to 2-Stars
I stopped by for lunch on Saturday and hadSpring rollsKatheaw Cha large flat rice noodles stir fried with Katna broccoli carrots beef and shrimpTamarind-based soup forget the name and I can't find it on the online menu - I think it had lemongrass and a little bit of coconut milk for creamy texturePoat Ang roasted corn dessertThe pace of the meal was a little slower than what I'm used to but the servers brother & sister team were warm/attentive and the food was delicious
Here's the scoop on food + drink + San Tan Beers+ Waffle Fries + Beet Salad+ Spicy Brat+ Apple Strudel We left happy and I got a picture next to the awesome Brat Haus van parked outside coming soon I'll add it to the photos
Trying to figure out toppings for one pizza between three people you may as well be figuring out cold fusion with a box of toothpicks and some masking tape
The food looked amazing but was far to under seasoned
Keegan's usually has some good home cooking dinner specials so when I'm too lazy to cook my own meatloaf I'll head here on a Monday night
So if you are looking for some delicious inexpensive Mexican food served really fast and in a clean restaurant Moreno is your grill
We took the pizza home and were shocked how good it was
He is a perfectionist and it comes through from the quality of the food
BBQ and sushi  they have a BBQ everyday for lunch and it sometimes has really good deals -- like a chicken sandwich a side and a huge drink for $5
Can't really beat it except that it was making me fat from eating it too often ;  They also have a sushi bar that's not too cheap but is good if you want something light fast
Whatever that is it is not overt as Hubby and I never noticed that there was an issue with food quality or service at Bobby's
The menu was pretty extensive but when I saw I could have nothing vegetarian on their appetizer menu I knew it could end up being a Tums night so I didn't give birth to a food baby in the early morn-translation-almost all was gonna have meat in it even if they took it out
I needed a sauce perhaps to make it seem like less of slices of bread and good quality meat
I've eaten at plenty of places with terrible service when the food is good enough to balance it out
They have a wonderful selection of meats and do not charge you extra to replace meats in the combination plates like other places
The food is tasty the salsa is spicy when it needs to be and their guacamole is pretty dang good too
Food quality was medium nothing to Yelp about
Pretty good wine and from what what we got to try of the appetizers they were very good-especially the butterfish
Well we all  went to a going away party here at Casey Moore's Oyster House and the place was fairly nice lots of security around  but very limited parking we parked a few blocks away and had to walk in food was good but my onion soup was way to salty though and the dip sandwich was by far the worst item to order on the menu just sliced meat and bread  and I had order it
Tuna was perfect I had a chance to taste it  and that cooked perfect and I did notice a co- worker leave the 1/2 of the fish and chips on there plate no a good sign
Yes I would affordable food good music and  folks all in a good mood I'm there
Prices are fair for the quality and amount of food you get
Chicken tortilla soup was nothing to write home about but they are very conveniently located in the hotel
Apparently I have become quite the connoisseur of salmon thanks farmers market fisherman for making my standards so high because I wasn't entirely impressed by the salmon texture or flavor itself
The food looked amazing; the dessert looked way too good
We also ordered the White pizza which was very tasty
Next came the hot lips roll--sounded good but looked like a pink mayo-globbed mess no way to eat with chopsticks and forget picking it up with your hands
I had a little sushi nigiri sake and maguro--decent quality
Employees enjoy being there whenever that happens food will have more love and quality to it
The food was amazing with combos that were perfect
Today for lunch my buddy asked if I wanted to go to Joey's and I actually thought an Italian Beef sounded good so I went along to try this place out
I was quite surprised to find a really nice extensive menu with very tasty dishes
But guys change your name to make it as good as your food
A long time ago they didn't have a kitchen & let you order in Pizza & stuff but their kitchen does make some tasty food now
The atmosphere is really cool and the food is amazing
I'm not a big fan of beef or pork so that really limits my options but the Madres Pasta Favorito is amazing
The service was good it was packed we sat at a bar table the waitress was very sweet and the drinks were strong I had my usual the crusted chicken romano and it was just as good as always
Meat was spectacular and everything I tasted off of other's plates was worthy of a return trip
my unhappiness and my the redistribution of stars is much more for the fact that after asking our server to take it away and replace it with another crunch roll he returned holding the roll and said that flavor is because this roll is made with imitaion crabmeat and real crabmeat so there is a slightly different taste i explained that it wasn't the flavor but the taste of rancid old fish
a place where us late night eaters can go for some delicious and very well prepared sushi in downtown phoenix
get your group on at moira and your friends will love ya for introducing them to the most tasty dishes in town
We didn't ask for Calabrian Oil on the pizza but we were told they added it to our pie instead of the olive oil that they normally do since we got the peppers so I might have gotten more flavor on my pie than it normally gets
The one thing that I might be able to add is that the cheesecake dessert is  very tasty
I've had numerous different dishes here and they've all come out deliciously cooked to perfection
The prices are great for how spectacular the food is although expect to cough up a solid twenty per person for an appetizer entree and beers
The dishes were plenty tasty by themselves; next time I go I will either have to order it bland or bring a fire extinguisher
New hot spot the parking lot was full of RC customers we had to park across the street @ Olive Garden chicken is hot and crunchy like we remembered in Vegas location friendly customer service and friendly & fun atmosphere
Two of us at lunch 1 appetizer the turnip cakes are awesome and 2 dishes was too much food suggest 2 appetizers and 1 dish for solid eaters and was a $40 total after tax and tip and only tea
As an appetizer we got chicken lettuce wrap
I love chicken strips so I was thinking this would be like the In and Out Burger of chicken strips- simplified menu for an amazing food product
If you really want good chicken strips try Four Peaks chicken strips
Now to tell you about the horrible food that came out COLD
I started with the tuna tartar which is served with rye toast points and a cornichon paste it was so good my husband who refuses to eat raw fish even tried a bite
There's a good amount of duck in the dish too it's just really greasy
Prices are higher than other places but for the ambiance and uniqueness of the food and the quality of service etc I think its just about right for a special night out
And the prices for the amazingly tasteless food will stupefy you
What i was surprised about was i had to ask for a side of apple sauce which of you have ever enjoyed potato pancakes you have to have apple sauce seemed to me in a nut shell that we where all given large amount of food
But the food seemed to not really stand out flavor wise
Our food came out in two separate orders and lacked flavor
despite the gobs of sauce on them the chicken itself had no flavor
My Italian friend said the pizza crust was good but he had an issue with the cheese saying it wasn't ''authentic''
Sometimes when life is gloomy the weather cold or you're just tired of leftover holiday food TMI is the cure
The beans and rice were tender and tasty and the olives and capers gave the dish just enough zip
All the meat was moist and delicious and tasted great even without the BBQ sauce
It was good the slaw just didn't mesh well with grilled fish
My company both ordered sandwich combos chicken salad and tuna melt and both said it was really good
Food is okay but not good enough to overlook the service
The shrimp tempura and Lotus rollThe Lotus roll was good a little too seafoody for me
Make no mistake this place is literally just a pick-up counter looking into the kitchen but the food has always been damn good Again I quickly found what I liked and stuck with it
For pizza first tried their sausage and artichokes great flavor combo good sauce and never bothered to try another version
You can also order all the ingredients mixed in equally on the pizza if you wish but we decided to go with what the restaurant recommended and we were glad we did
95 the ingredients were high quality and there was a healthy amount of ingredient on each part of the pizza
Normally multi-meat pizzas make me want to ralph from greasiness but their Get Meaty is really good the sausage I think
I go to the location in Tempe but I believe they make their food in one place so you shouldn't get much of a difference as far as quality goes
We really like Gino's on the East of Chicago- deep dish golden crust pizza so maybe this wasn't exactly our style of pizza to claim Best Pizza that ever touched our lips I would recommend giving it a try
Outside of brunch the food here is amazing
The Food we ate was DeliciousThe items we tried were not necessarily something I would have ordered on my own but with our pre-fixe Yelp menu we were served a generous assortment of appetizersmy favorite was the butter-fish tataki and calamari
good food in a hidden place in one of the strip malls
jade chicken was good and the bkack beans were very good
Upon walking into the restaurant I immediately noticed it was clean and that there was no overpowering smell of seafood; both were good signs
Everything seafood and veggies  was fresh and tasty
I ordered the fried chicken for dinner which was delicious and I got the root beer float for dessert
While the pizza might not be unanimously voted the best in all of the world although it has received plenty of recognition it is still pretty effing good
Great flavors and very fresh food along with a warm cozy atmosphere
and I also heard the Chicken Katsu sandwich is good so I might just have that instead
Oh and the Spicy Tuna roll so much flavor
The ambience sucks the service wasn't very good and the food was totally average
At the end of the day food comes down to quality and price
I highly recommend the caprese salad antipasto and the rosa pizza
Considering I HATE pepper in my food this dish is delicious to me hence why I am loyal to it
First time here we sat at a booth and while the food was good there wasn't anything to make me want to go out of my way to come back
The sushi chefs are friendly and willing to engage you and what's fresh and good
But if you want good food try someplace else in the neighborhood - like Chevrount's
Standard breakfast fare actually very good scrambled eggs oatmeal biscuits and gravy hash browns even beef tacos
Certainly not a traditional dish but tasty nonetheless
There didn't seem to be a whole lot of crazy dishes to try which I'm always attracted to but overall the place was quite good
Then came the sizzling strips of beef and THAT was delicious some of the best tasting strips of beef I've ever devoured
Honestly I wasn't too impressed with the food
My friend and I shared the caprese salad- standard vegetarian pizza-delicious and spaghetti pomodora-amazing
The service was terrific the pizza margherita was wonderful and the drinks were stiff without being obnoxious
I almost forgot it they play banda music which I find hideous but the food worth the music pain specially if you're hung over
The Tangier burger was amazing with garlicky hummus tasty manchego cheese pesto oven dried tomatoes that thankfully were not over-dry and chewy and a half pound of delicious beef served on just the right proportion of ciabatta bread
I had the BBQ Korean dish which didnt really have much flavor and was kind of bland
Good food = high prices though so I suppose I will suck it up
Good food that combines interesting flavors - like their Apricot BBQ Chicken Sandwich
Great execution and the food is no more expensive than a typical bill from Chili's however the quality of the food is head and shoulders above your typical bar and grill fare
It is a bit pricey $18 per large pizza but well worth it
Who am I to suggest messing with success - the food was freshly prepared flavorful and fast
The sea bass had a very good flavor however I like my fish to come steaming hot and I would say that it was more luke warm and a little bit chewy for me
Overall I give Ocean Prime 4 stars because the food was tasty the selection of foods on the menu was great and the ambiance was excellent
I didn't really LOVE my experience here but for those who enjoy creative and fusioned sushi or a good sushi happy hour this is a great place to go
The pork itself was pretty good nothing spectacular it was the sauce that really made the dish
The dish was tasty but I dont think it was worth $19 though
Overall Fuego bistro is a great restaurant with creative latin american  dishes and would recommend this place to other foodies
Price was absolutely fair for the quality of the food - there are many MANY overprices sushi places in Scottsdale and many dirt cheap places in the valley
my pizza seemed more like a thin flavorless cracker mess
please serve some tasty food so I will be tempted to have dinner here in the future
come on HEAVENHouse and Caesar SaladsCog Au Vin Entree Broth utterly amazingThen we got to dessert
Not sure who is voting for these but it's obvious they've never had a good slice of pizza
The decor/ambiance is nice which is good since you will be so bored with the food
-sat at the bar and tried the flatbread pizzacapicola and artichoke which was amazingly good
My friends meals included roasted chicken Thai BBQ ribs pork chops and squash enchiladas which were all excellent
The main courses were very flavorful as well and were the perfect portion sizes to ensure dessert would be the cards
They have a wide variety of foods all delicious
The food runner even commented on how good that burger looked
I've been to the Pita Jungle in Chandler twice and on both occasions had excellent food great prices given how good the food was paired with huge portion sizes
I recommend the garlic dip and peanut chicken wrap and good service refilled drinks often brought more pitas brought boxes when we were done w/o our having to ask
My dad had a beef sirloin that was perfectly cooked and delicious with a side of fingerling potatoes
My only reservations would be 1 definitely is slow food maybe a tad too slow but so delicious it was worth it and they said they were short staffed and 2 i'm not sure i buy that their seafood is sustainable
I first went to crust over 5 years ago and the food has always been fairly good
We all shared the meat and cheese plate which was good but nothing extraordinary
We each got a rustica pizza and they were all really good I got the classic the BF got the New York Erin got the one with pesto and bacon and her BF got the meat
These pizzas are a funny shape but still tasty
The service was fast food was hot and fresh and waiter was friendly
The service however is excellent as our waiter scored 2 points for the wine and dessert recommendation besides he had an Italian accent and and old world charm that I couldn't help but like
The dish I had a homemade egg noodle pasta dish with a variety of fish and shellfish in white wine scampi sauce was good
Each dish was super flavorful and had just the right amount of heat
All side dishes are a la carte and on the large side so I'd recommend sharing
I've been to Oreganos three times now and have had good experiences each time except for the BBQ chicken pizza - not enuf sauce and they throw in some cheddar cheese which tastes awkward
But overall my experience there with the waiters and staff and the food is always good
Despite delicious food and an impressive wine list it hurts my heart to say that this place isn't worth the trouble
Location = awesomePatio = awesomeFood = really goodDrinks = really goodPrices = are you kidding me expensiveThat kind of sums it up
I would definitely recommend this restaurant for its service and its food
As far as the happy hour menu goes there is a good selection of sushi rolls to choose from
Once you're in though the food is excellent
The adjacent wine bar is a good idea and definitely the money make for the place as the food is very reasonable
Once again though the food is amazing but the wait stinks
00 chicken tostada that I got they are an excellent deal and very tasty too
Seasoning and temperature of the food was good
So looks like the good deals on this tasty food is soon to get even better
My husband had ordered the popcorn crayfish and I got the hotwings
Im not a big fish eater but I tried my husbands crayfish and it was delicious
Tarbell's has good food good service and a comfortable ambiance
The ice cream cream puff dessert was good but not to die for
While I'm not usually a fan of the trendy and this place is trendy I enjoyed the food here
When she brought the cucumber a WHILE later I recommended that they really should not serve food like that
They focus on all types of breads including a variety of loaves rolls and some baked goods
This dish comes in a big ass bowl and I can tell you this dish is so good I could eat two bowls o' this junk
#15-House PHOnomenal- decent broth not too fragrant a little stingy on the meat portions but overall a good bowl of phoIf you like lechee they have a drink pronounced hot-ee and it has little pearls of lechee juice and tons pf basil seeds
It's ice cream flavor chanegs everyday but we were lucky to get caramel wrapped lie a sushi roll but the rice is rice crispy
The crust is simply amazing and their pizza choices are amazing
The food was good but while my mom and I ordered appetizers and received our food in a decent amount of time my poor boyfriend waited forever for his small pizza
Granted I know that on a Saturday night a noisy bar is to be expected but I think we'll stick to delivery from now on when we want to enjoy this delicious pizza
The food well what can I say it tastes amazing
The food was mediocre are best slightly cold when served
Food was still very good but had not changed at all
The food quality is really good and I may update again as I make my way through the menu
I got some horseradish to go with it and enjoyed the meal
Indeed the food is delicious and consistently great
We didn't have any food but it smelled and looked good
Dear Kristen had the shaved prime rib dip which was fine a little disappointing I guess just not much meat the meat to bread ratio was severely lacking and it came with fries which were very good
I paid for Kristen and I plus the newly engaged couple and including drinks and all food it only came to ninety eight dollars that is a bargain for this atmosphere and the overall quality of the food and staff
The flavor was completely missing and the beef was dry
On a lighter note wrapped in translucent rice paper the spring rolls were large filled with chewy rice noodles and 3 plump shrimp unfortunately these were also flavorless
The patio is comfortable and well flowered but i considered taking a star away to reflect the knuckleheads and their loud Italian sports cars rollin up and down the adjacent promenade - i decided not to as it is hard to fault the restaurant for the sins of the neighbors all in all a good to great bet for any occasion out
The food is good and the prices are even better
I highly recommend the vegetable lo mein and the orange chicken
Oh good this way I could avoid all the meat get the waffle and avoid all oh you don't like meat conversation I hate
The lemongrass dish while a bit meager  -- 13 bite-sized pieces of deep-fried yumminess on a piece of lettuce -- was really tasty
You can't get any better than a place that offers really good Italian food at great prices
and both of these dishes have their fair share of the good green stuff itself
The chicken was delicious and cooked just right
Upon entering I did not smell the tasty meats simmering and cooking
When I had heard of Geisha it was for the cocktails music and people I had very little about their food however it was delicious and we will definitely go back to try other foods on the menu
The service was good the food was hot and tasty the atmosphere was fun and ladies don't forget to check out the restrooms ;  and let folks know don't come in after you if you're gone for 20 min
I started with sweet chile veal sweetbreads over creamed corn good but the flavor was a little reminiscent of sweet and sour fried pork takeout Chinese salmon skin salad and grilled swordfish over white beans with local sausage and pepperonata
After trying her dishes I wished I wouldn't have ordered all of my selections but they came recommended by the server
lol Their cat food is also made with quality ingredients
some tasty ones include risottos pesto pizzas gnocchi and a range of stir frys
I want to discuss the excellence of the food here but first the bread alone is worth mentioningThink of the best bread you can buy at a regular grocery store even from their bakery
A few that stick out to me areBLT sandwichSweet potato sandwichBeef Brisket sandwichAll of the breakfasts are healthy tasty and leave you feeling energized
The loaded nachos were overpriced $8+ since they didn't contain any delicious animal flesh of the beef or chicken varieties
Nice selection of sushi named in the menu reasonable prices very fresh fish great quality quick and attentive service and super tasty
It's a seafood and pasta dish in one and it's delicious
I any event The Beautiful Carin Mike and I strolled over for cocktails and dinner stayed for desert sat out on the patio which is very pleasant BTWAnd we enjoyed ourselves
They have two types of burgers - but the Delux burger with angus beef gruyere bacon arugula and caramelized onions on baguette is soooo good
Ordered the fish and chips - primarily for the coleslaw and it was served in a condiment cup - literally two small fork fulls - and not much flavor
My pizza came out piping hot and it was good to go in my belly
Assuming your options for your salad are either fried or grilled chicken you may think you are getting some kind of HOT meat on it
Well it's not the grilled chicken was cold and while there was a lot of it looked like shredded chicken that's prob not so fresh if you catch my drift
Then you go over to a salsa quacamole hot sauce cucumber cabbage and radish onion bar and fix it up how you like
The food is so delicious it doesn't matter
The food is always tasty for the most part
Chili's food just like many similar places is not very good 20 minutes later when you get home
The food is definitely not the best or the most exotic that can be available but I find it very good nonetheless
The food is very good in my opinion and the pastry basket is a nice addition to any brunch though it's definitely not for those on any sort of diet
Starting with the least flavorful the Chicken was kinda bland
This was a good cut of meat clearly slow smoked
Service & food quality are the same as the other Yardhouse locations in the valley
I ordered the strawberry chicken salad and it was great but for some reason the spinach was not cold
My boyfriend had the burger and my best friend enjoyed her seafood sandwich
It was one dish that we all kept picking fromPork tenderloin - this wasvery well done but was still tasty - though that might have been from the garnishment
All in all it was a good filler with the other two but it didnt explode with tastes from heaven like the other twofried chicken and waffles - this was ultiamtely the most surprising dish on the table
It was all in the spices in breading on the chicken which was extremely crispy but in a good way and the savoriness in the waffle batter
if you are looking for a great place to hang out people watch and enjoy amazing food and drinks this is the one
Zen 32 offers $3-$6 happy hour sushi rolls appetizers and some drinks from 10pm-2am
The quality of the sushi was very good
I can't remember the other rolls we ordered but just as delicious
Overall I enjoyed my experience and the food was delicious
I love the egg dishes try the Chicago omelet the salads Trifecta rocks pastries made in-store the black-and-whites are good and the fat-free blueberry muffins are better than the regular ones--all are usually refrigerated though so you may want to ask for your muffin to be heated before serving and the bagels have the perfect bite and chewiness contrast with the bagel-shaped bread that Einstein's churns out
Tasty with enough sauce meat was just a little on the stringy side but I prefer that over mush-meat
I think it would really improve the sandwiches if they switched to a higher quality piece of bread to match the meat
As a fan of excellent food I do appreciate their attention to detail and excellent craft
While I do love their pizza and antipasto which is not irreplaceable I might add after many months of consistent patronage I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone
The crab tostadas were good but I don't enjoy cold crabmeat too much
He said the rice added flavor to the dish
Yes they gave me a refund but anyplace that serves pizza with stale toppings isn't worth my time
We've tried a few places around town and have been looking for a place in East Valley that has good Med food at reasonable prices
Doesn't look Middle Eastern in the least but the food was good
But it's consistent service and good food
the sauce is a perfect balance of spices making for an interesting flavor combination against crispy pieces of chickenAlso everything is really cheap so you can order a couple dishes and walk out of there without breaking the bank
AND it's not a very good looking meat market to boot
Palate cleanser  Toasted nuts raspberries cheese and balsamic reductionAppetizer upgradedLobster roll - So amazing I will be back on a Wednesday just to eat this againSecondiHand Cut Pasta with brown butter and FennelEntreeVeal Scallopini-  This was perfectly cooked and the presentation was amazingDessertCotton CandyPassion Fruit and CoconutI also paired the meal with the wine accompanies which all were great except the dessert wine didn't really pair with the dessert I got but after I finished it and had a few minutes it went down well but just didn't go with the food
My boyfriend had the chicken fajitas and said those were good too
This place is for weddings family gatherings just simple good food morning noon and night and amazing drinks
The food is good; my friends and I would always get a variety of appetizers and share them
The Mexican pizza is really good and my friend swears by their chimichangas
Friends ordered Pollo Fundido & enjoyed it but our Chicken Fajitas and Carnitas Burrito were DRY and not so flavorful
Normally I go for the italian beef with hot peppers but decided to try half hot and half sweet
two stars for 5GB&F right there and it was ready hot and juicy when I rolled in
you know when Wendy's was actually pretty good not like now when they consistently screw up your order and figuratively literally throw your bag-o-food into your car as you idle by the pickup window
I went here with a few friends looking to get some appetizers sushi and saki bombs
We order the waffle dogs as seen on Food Network's the best thing I've ever ate and it was not as delicious as we anticipated
It's such a shame b/c the food was pretty good
We went here and ordered a variety of food an appetizer a soup a salad 4 entrees and a dessert
This place is great for a happy hour and to kick it as the environment is spacious and hip and full of good looking people but other than that the food is very overpriced and every dish besides the bison burger was bland and tasteless
The food tastes good its not that loud and you can walk in whether you have anything to do with U of Px or not
If you're crazy about crust you won't think this pizza is as amazing as I do
Why not wait an hour or so for good pizza when it's not anymore expensive that a fully loaded greasy large pizza from Dominos
For the food we only tried dessert but the homemade pop-tarts are amazing
I pretty much never crave the food here and the only reason it might be worth coming here is if you have a party of like 4 or more
When the food finally arrived we were not impressed at all
So yeah their prices are not the best especially for the quality and quantity of food
Thirdly they have great Cartel coffee and what appeared to be tasty food even though I didn't get a chance to try any of it
We bowled our two games while munching on delicious chicken quesadillas we each ordered a platter because they were so good and downing cold beer
The chocolate dessert recommended by the waiter was also divine - and I don't even like sweets or chocolate
This place is easily recommendable for any of the more adventurous foodies out there; you'll have a lot of fun at this place trying some new things
So overall it is a good deal but I have had better thai food
so when I do I don't want gristly cold marbley fat meat
I was full after the meal so I didn't get a chance to try any of their desserts but the Kahlua brownie with ice cream sounded delicious
The food will not knock your socks off but it is good and warrants a return trip
Their pizzas are great and the salads are just amazing and HUGE
we ordered the dinner sampler which had chicken hot links BRISKET
Still very good and packed with chicken broth and tortilla strips
I just glanced over the menu and it pretty much looks the same so I'm assuming the food is just as good breakfast and lunch-wise
Delicious food guacamole was chunky and fresh salsa was spicy and chips were freshly made burger was good but perhaps not a date nite food due to sloppy spill factor coffee was terrific and orange juice was fresh squeezed
The pizza always takes forever and sometimes arrives cold
I've tried a few of the dishes and the food is pretty good but nothing yet that I've built up a craving for
I swear I will only go to Thai Rama in Tempe for my hot food
She recommended a stir fry with bok choi beef chicken shrimp tofu and shitake mushrooms
The lunch specials here give you the most bang for the buck and the food is pretty good too
For dessert we got the chocolate cake skillet type dish with the ice cream on top and it was amazing
I noticed lots of local foods and a good selection of Arizona beers too and not just the standard Four Peaks offering that you can find in most stores
As for the food counter it's absolutely worth a try
We opted to try several small dishes over the entrees and every dish was amazing
I also recommend the butterfish tataki and salmon nigiri
Almost every dish had perfectly-balanced flavors and each was new exciting and utterly delicious
In fact it's so good I will not eat sushi anywhere else now
Disclaimer I have yet to try Yasu which I hear is amazing as well but compared to every other sushi joint in Phoenix THIS is the spot to go to
I got a gyro and it was delicious with tomatoes Tahiti sauce lettuce and the shwarma chicken
Great little restaurant where the owners are super friendly the staff I pleasant and helpful and the food matches the quality you would expect
We ordered the sampler appetizers a small cheese pizza for the kids some bone in and boneless wings the philly Cheesteaks and a ham and provolone sub
Milagro is going to be a little on the pricier side but hey if the food is good it doesn't bother me
Overall it was good food good drinks good atmosphere and I am definitely excited to have another restaurant option nearby
5 stars for a simple market and deli with some killer good freshly prepared food
I find the portions to be reasonable and the quality of the food top notch
The food was very good again that's what I would expect of restaurant where I am spending north of $500 for dinner and a couple drinks for 4
We had tempura shrimp lobster pot stickers calamari salad and thai beef salad as appetizers
nobody raved over the food although everybody thought it was good including me
Maybe other dishes are better but it wasn't good enough for us to come back again
I ordered the Shrimp & Bacon Quesadilla off of the appetizer section which I though was a nice change from the standard chicken quesadilla which they do have for traditionalists
Scale of 1-10 single visit10 Food9 Service10 Atmosphere8 ValueThis food is great had/tried the hummus appetizer ricotta ravioli spaghetti squash casserole and flourless chocolate cake
True Food Kitchen has obviously put some TLC into their dishes and you just feel good about yourself while you're shoveling it into your face
As an example here's my bill$16 - 2 cocktails$14 - 2 glasses of wine$  6 - 1 appetizer$25 - 2 meals$  7 - 1 dessert= $73 before tip
It was hip fun and the food was realistically priced and absolutely DELICIOUS
Pro  good food solid happy hour Con service is inconsistent but has been trending up of recent
We probably should have been able to guess the quality of food we were in store for when the Mahi Mahi was $9
Hot breakfast which is OK they run out of food very often there is one lady who serve there but we had to remind her we run out of food like milk bagels etc
* Pizza was really good but too expensive
It gave me pause at first but the appetizer I ordered Fried Imperial Rolls was excellent although the portions were small
The scrumptious citrusy ginger flavor of the sauce really made the dish though
that piece of meat was freaking delicious was totally reasonable
its been so hard to find decent quality meat since i moved here
safeway fry's walmart bwahhaha no way am i buying cuts of meat from there and other grocers just dont have high quality cuts of meat
Pizza and Speidini were very very good
Pizzas are good size one feeds two but make sure to baseline with a white and a red on your initial visit
Think Mozza in Hollywood has as good or better pizza and they accept reservations soits an easier otch'
95 and come with an egg roll and vegan hot & sour soup and it is well worth it
The staff is always loud and fun and I recommend sitting at the bar and conversing with the sushi chef Masa if you get the chance
Interesting contrast found here  excellent abundant authentic well to my American palate Sonoran-style Mexican food but in the setting of a semi trashy beer hall
Although the obligatory chili icon indicate this was a spicy dish the General Tso's chicken had zero heat and very little flavor
the chicken quality both tandoori and makhani wasn't fresh nor was the curry tasty
but it you are looking for good food just drive by and don't slow down
The location is not the greatest and you would never expect how great the quality of the pizza is
The Santa Fe Chicken was good eventhough the chicken was a little dry
As for the pizza itself the BBQ was decent it reminded me of a generic CPK BBQ chicken pizza and the Pesto was pretty good
Thus far I would recommend the Spinach Pie with Wheat Deep Dish Crust
We ordered deep-fried tofu stuffed with shrimp; orange flavored chicken and honey walnut shrimp but I was told that they ran out of the sauce for the walnut shrimp which was mayonnaise so I switched that out for the roasted duck
The orange flavored chicken was missing flavor
They have a great revolving selection of about 30 Microbrews on tap and make some pretty good pizza Thai Chicken and Buffalo Chicken pizza is where it's at
I prefer my Pad Thai a little on the sweet side not fishy tasting with some flavor and most Thai places here have the more traditional type
Speaking of food the green chili is  about as good as it gets
My fiancu00e9 and I have searching high and low for a good Mexican place all year we moved here last August and I must say we had all but given up finding good Mexican food until we stumbled upon this gem
The service at this location is very good and the food is delicious
I also really enjoy the fries at this place and they also have some really good desserts that are fairly large in portion
I remember after I ate my burger and fries I decided to ordered the Chocolate Lava for dessert which is a chocolate brownie topped with vanilla ice cream whipped cream cherries almonds and chocolate syrup a fairly simple but delicious dessert
by far my favorite even though the meat was flavorful and tender too
The pizza slice is HUGE and very delicious
We particularly love the roasted corn and goat cheese pizza add Italian sausage for richer flavor
The food all smelled really pretty good as far as bar food goes and the nacho plate we milked for an hour and a half was made with real cheese
Like so many others have noted moving to PHX made me realize how good I had it in Michigan with an abundance of solid choices for Middle Eastern food
This 3 meat Frybread is a good choice if you would to sample each of the beef options in one meal
And for dessert I ordered the Toffee Bread Pudding - it was good  but again should've known better it just made me feel even more disgustingly full
The menu is big and the variety of choices includes chow fun noodles my favorite tofu aka bean curd dishes galore delicious shrimp toast and tons of yummy seafood choices
I think it could have been a really good dish but it was smothered in mozzarella cheese
The meal began with the chef's gift of  warm chicken liver spread with thyme and crusty bread - wonderful followed by  the gruyere glazed popover served with a ramekin of european butter and sea salt
The spices were so charred the only flavor I got was burnt and the meat itself was so fatty half the steak was totally inedible
After a good night of slammin em' back there is nothing like a big pile of greasy fried food to coat the tummy
I'm all about a good margarita and authentic mex food
There are definitely sushi places with better quality sushi but the sushi here is not bad AND it's very inexpensive
The kind of meal that makes you smile for the rest of the day and turn and say mm that was really good pizza
despite a packed restaurant the food and service was excellent
Summer rolls and pan fried dumplings were good
Likes-*Seems like they always have a spot outside where others are packed to the max*Can bring your dogs with you to hang out on the patio*Happy hour everyday 3PM-7PM with great drink and bar food options*Prices besides happy hour are not that bad either*Free chips and salsa-Very light salsa and fresh which tastes amazing
All dishes are full of flavor with a nice little kick to awaken the senses
My Mom recommended this place - my oldest sister is a super health food nut and I've been on a new meatless journey - so she thought because they couldn't try it out last week hello 1 1/2 hour wait we would take it for a test spin
My fiance had the Panang Curry dish extra spicy and said it was good
We were too stuffed to try any of the desserts but they certainly sounded good
Great service charming atmosphere and excellent dishes
My Husband has the seafood crepes they were OK but lacking flavor
The building and patio are really cool and set a good atmosphere too bad the food and service don't follow suit
The firs time i and my hubby dinner yesterday night at Hongkong Gourmetanything food delicious
maybe next week we go there again so far with our house 40 - 50 minutebut if any food delicious we can go
I live in Old Town so getting Indian food that I enjoyed meant going to Tempe or Chandler
We ordered nothing outside of the basic chicken curry naan saag paneer rice pudding best I have ever had mango lassi not very cold or thick but good and the galub jamun which tasted like it had been frozen and thawed
only thing I didnt like  Overall I really enjoyed it and will be back when the craving for stuffing myself on Indian food revisits me
I thought the food was very good and warranted a 5 star rating at this price point however I can't give Bertha's 5-stars with the problems they had taking customers' orders that day
I was very skeptical at first because it's dicey in Phoenix when it comes to getting good fresh Sushi
Ordered the eda mame and spring rolls for appetizers both were great
The plum sauce for the spring rolls was delicious
I would recommend this place to anyone that comes to Phoenix for sushi
Prices are not bad either and by the looks of the Happy Hour menu very good prices to get your sushi on
Food at this local pizza joint is high quality you can taste
The smoked chicken was still moist the broccoli still had a nice bite to it as all vegetables should and had a fantastic roasted flavor
The half slabs of thick delicious bacon were simply laid over our pizza towards the end of cooking
The Mexican pizza is what it's all about; chicken or beef it's piled high with lots of good stuff
This flavor combination will rock you and the beef is very tender
The food was still good and the service was much better than what I experienced last time
The first thing we immediately noticed was that the sauce on our standard cheese pizza was extremely watery and flavorless
In fact its almost cheap for the consistently good food you get the cocktails - you MUST get the Summer Solstice martini - and the overall vibe
my friend ate a curry chicken pita which looked excellent and which she enjoyed
The Kobe Beef Burger was also tasty only downside is they say they won't serve it less than medium
Creative dishes for one of the few Asian tapas places in Phoenix great ambiance and excellent service gives my affair with Sens 4 stars
The food is overall just good for what it's worth
Between the rattlesnake appetizers fried shrimp bbq chicken and the many libations we had good time
The food was only mediocre but the service was good and the tourist nature of the spot was entertaining
The pond was beautiful and we even saw children fishing for crappie with poles and tackle provided by the hotel
The homemade chips are a little greasy but other than that they have a great salsa bar televisions with sporting events so that you can enjoy a good game while having your Mexican food
Tried the Funghi pizza and was VERY delicious
The special and delicate flavors of the wild mushroom and truffle oil came out nicely and were the centerpiece of the pizza
The philly roll was delicious all the flavors went together perfectly
There's the good nice luggage some nice jewelry some good foodstuffs the bad the same authentic Southwestern stuff you find in any gift shop from San Antonio to San Diego and the ugly several I [heart] Columbus Beanie Babies
Solid 4 stars on food freshness and quality
I've eaten at Orange Table somewhere around 50 or 60 times over the last few years and I can tell you that they consistently provides 4-5 star quality food which I absolutely love
Unfortunately as many other people have mentioned this amazing food is often but not always delivered with 2-3 star quality service
Your food will come out perhaps even without a smile but this place is absolutely worth it
I wasn't crazy about their rendition of chicken and sausage gumbo as it wasn't dark enough but the seafood gumbo was very good
I will attribute their longevity and success to the quality of the food in their restaurants and the dining experience they give their customers
Our chicken sample was dry the pork adobo and beef offered were better - the texture of the slow cooked beef reminded me of my mother's Yankee pot roast - only this had less flavor and seasoning
My recommendation is to try the hefeweizens if you you like Belgium beers and with a pizza
The meat is very good tasting and generous
The two of us were able to eat about 75 percent of the pie hooray cold pizza left overs and decided to save some room for some homemade dessert
The food is consistently good in either situation; survives the travel to our office well always hot and fresh and almost always delivered and set up by George himself
The Crispy Spicy Pork is just that served with white rice; one of the outstanding dishes lots of flavor with just a little spicy heat
Shrimp Honey Glazed Walnuts is excellent nice fat shrimp with an unusual thick and creamy sauce; one of my favorite dishes here
Spicy Basil Chicken and Vietnamese Chicken are both reliably good
in a theater that offers changing tables and dim lights in addition to their ultra nice seating VIP rooms 21+ beverages good food service incredibly friendly staff and caramel popcorn
Food on the other hand was delicious which is why I gave 4 stars
Im not sure if I'd come here again as the price for the quality of food isn't worth it to me
I personally think that this pizza is good enough to take on Chicago pizzerias and have told Grimaldi's corporate this
The food was excellent and we always come for $2 mimosas during brunch on saturdays/sundays
The selection of food is realllllllly good
You can enjoy good food and look out the window at all the planes too
I have always adored my visits to Valley Ho - I'm a suck-suck-sucker for modern design and du00e9cor and a stroll over the grounds and through the lobby are like a Mad Men fan's dream the cozy fireplace surrounded by couches for relaxing with your drink the lounge-y area just outside the bar is intimate comfy and gorgeous - appropriate for a date or a small gathering of friends -- the open layout means you can look from one end of the hotel to the other and all the way up to the third floor ceiling
We ordered 5 appetizers during happy hour its half-price the Cotija Grilled Corn BBQ Pork Cheese Crisp Chicken and Poblano Chile Cheese Crisp Beef Nachos and  Roasted Poblano Queso
I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys a trendy atmosphere and flavorful food
Outside of building is plain and doesn't pull you in but the food was really good
I had the chicken fried steak you could cut it with a fork Mac and cheese that was very creamy and much better then anything I have had in a while Sweet Potato's that had flavor all the way through soaked into each spud
Good home cooked food which are the basics of the southern soul cooking
It is home cooked food in a basic diner feel that you would find in Alabama or a small town in Georgia  Worth stopping by for good home cooked meal done southern style
This dish comes with a ginger sauce and wasabi dipping sauce which give the wontons more flavor
And so it is with love that I share these things with you * Your food is good but overpriced
The food looked pretty good though I didn't try any
The food is just what the name implies - excellent mexican with a modern flare
Their barteneder makes great drinks the appitizers were excellent my wife had chicken taco's that were fine can't really do much with chicken tacos imo I had the Obama Burrito
My dish was actually on the appetizer menu and let me just say I was in heaven when my dish arrived
that is allThe service was good the company was freaking fabulous and the food was divine
Another good starter is the Beafstro salad but it's a humongous plate of beef and salad the best of all worlds
You should definitely top your experience off with a pazookie for dessert it's absolutely delicious I get one every time I go
I opted for the classic chicken sandwich which was really good - bun fried chx fillet and pickles
the cheese was mildly flavored and the salsa did have a kick but not enough to make the dish
The service is bad and even thought he chefs are good the food is mediocre
Tediberto's rocks my word every time with spicy flavorful tacos and playful dishes that I just could not create at home on my own
The kale salad is my favorite but not available every night which is really a good thing cause id never try new dishes if it were
I always look for Cuban food when I'm traveling as I haven't found a good place near where I live
Anywho filled with chicken breast pico sour cream guac and a little cheese it was quite tasty and probably pretty healthy wouldn't you think
I make delicious fish tacos at home and figured they couldn't screw them up
Unfortunately however the food quality and wine list do not compare to Houston's and I would have gladly paid the extra $50 to have simply dined there
I like the white chicken enchilada thing and the apple desert burrito/crepe was very good
But if in that area and want some decent food with good chips and salsa in a nice atmosphere you can't go too wrong with Cantina Laredo
So much flavor in such a little glass with a fun little spoon to eat your little calorie filled well in comparison to the full size dessert
I can't even stress to people enough though that this is on the polar opposite end of Sweet Tomatoes both in quality of food and selection and they are about the same price
Lovingly decorated and the food was delicious
It may sound inconsequential to be so impressed about someone's opinion on dessert selection but I thought it was really cool
The BF and I both wanted to try the White Sands Chimi after all the awesome reviews on Yelp so we agreed that he'd get it give me a bite and I ordered the Arriba sampler which was like 8 appetizer sized chucks of really greazy indistinguishable and pretty tasteless finger foods
The desserts did look amazing so maybe some other time we'll check it out for sweets
It's not expensive there's delicious bruchetta and salads disguised as trendy light food and great drinks
This time was very laid back great music great Happy Hour prices food was excellent and had a great variety of appetizers to choose from
For dessert they brought out this chocolate cake that had layers and layers of good stuff
I got the #7 which was bisteces steak & onions - it was good but next time I would probably try the chicken enchiladas because those look awesome
We did ours with the kobe meat and it was delicious
However although we enjoyed it I wouldn't really say these dishes are worth $15-$20 per plate either in flavor or portion size
I wouldn't say we were disappointed in the visit we did enjoy our food but I'm giving it 3 starts for being average in flavor and overpriced in our opinion
Met friends and sat over 30 minutes with an empty drink glass  not offered food no chips were brought to the table until we asked and had to ask if we could order an appetizer
I got the chicken lettuce gacumole pico tomato cheese and a wonderful creamy chiptole dressing
The other food that my friend and I got was good but not even close to as good as that soup which is definitely what I'm getting next time
Wasn't the best chicken sandwich in the world but it was worth $5 and I would go back again but probably sit outside on the patio this time to avoid the smell
I always order hot peppers with my food and shhh
I recommend the hot Italian beef which was outstanding
I think it was prepared fine here it just isn't as good as beef really
Decent Atmosphere Average overall food Quality
The initial helping of all you can eat beef ribs was pretty good
HH specials are fantastic and the food is very good this isn't a premium sushi joint
The food selection is diverse and uniformly excellent
They have a good selection of mostly beers but the real focus here is the food
Dinner #1 was chicken satay skewers as an appetizer and chicken pad thai as the entree
Overall a good value and very good food
Some amazing standouts were the Lobsta Po-boy with Duck fat fries Seared scallop with Pork Belly and truffled parsnips and Crusty delicious Hake a fish I hadn't previously tried
Just like many other new fast food restaurant concepts that are popping up all over the place the food at Smashburger tastes as though it is fresh and of very high quality
The ahi tuna appetizer was pretty good I had that as my main dish
The one dish I didn't think was very good was the green chili mac and cheese side
I enjoyed the modern clean atmosphere and the food/wine/service was outstanding
Our friends ordered The Chef Board Artisan Meats and Cheeses Olives Grilled Artichoke Caponata this was excellent and enough for 4 people to share
When Christina P entrusted me with choosing the location for some good wine good food and good company it was like choosing the location for my Last Supper
This was followed by fish and chipsone of the best I've had in Arizona I'm sadly resolved to the fact that I probably won't get good English-style fish and chips anywhere in The Valley so this will do There's nothing I can say about the beer that hasn't been said but their summer seasonal was amazing and I could have stayed there all night putting many away
There was no wait and just enough patrons to keep the food fresh but not become an overrated hot spot
There is absolutely NO FLAVOR to this food
The tastes and flavors are across the board making it difficult to assign a star-rating; I've had 2-star dishes alongside 4-stars
then my friend got the Poboy Catfish sandwich not impressed said it was so freaking dry the fish and everything
I enjoyed my food and will likely go back
Instead of a smashed mess with a quarter-inch thick piece of mystery meat in it Five Guys delivers quality meat hand formed patties hand assembled while you watch and a real human touch with others lack
This is a simple quiet nice comfortable little spot with excellent sushi as well as other traditional Japanese food
It's as fresh as it gets and Yuki and EJ are truly talented at creating the most delicious sushi offerings you could ever hope to eat
This pizza was so good I couldn't even bother comparing it to my fave 'back home
The dressing was tasty and I really enjoyed the pulled-style all white chicken
I have had some pretty amazing quality fresh spring rolls at many other places having sampled those and the one-of-a-kind Vietnamese coffee all over the country
It's really dark inside and the food goes good with beer which they have much of
Just like other AJ'S the aisles are small the people can be snotty but the quality of food there is second to none
The rolls were tasty especially the lobster avocado roll
If you do come here try the hot deli where you can get every kind of ethnic food save for Ethiopian
The food is always delicious and the portions are enormous
If you're looking for good pasta/pizza at a reasonable price this is the place to go
If you want pizza go with the Deep Dish -- very rich and flavorful
The restaurant is definitely on the small side and pretty bare - just a few booths and tables and the Mexican channel is always on in the corner but nonetheless pretty good food for the price you pay
I am not a huge Italian food fan while I enjoy some good ole spaghetti every now and then when given the choice you are more likely to find me munching on some chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant
They make a good pizza and I especially adore their gnocchi in the vodka sauce but my favorite thing to get is the Chicken Parmesan
I usually get red chicken or beef curry hot and my wife gets green curry mild
All in all the food was wonderful the service was a little slow but since we had nowhere to go on Sunday it didn't really matter but it might matter if you are going to this place for an hour luch as we were there for about 1
Good food good prices good service I'm there and I'll be back again and again
Give this place a shot you won't regret it beats the pants off the gringo fast-food establishments like Taco Bell
More importantly I will have to find someone to go with me who will share one or two of their Mini Indulgences for dessert but again I'll have a hard time making up my mind which flavor
I of course looked at the reviews on yelp and was expecting a lukewarm time wih flavorless food
We've brought our kids out to eat since they were born & they know & appreciate good food
Then again I'm no fish expert and can't really fathom why a pasta dish would reach $30 or why their appetizers can be $12
Uhm maybe since they do have a couple good beers available they serve fresh fish and they have a pretty wide selection of oysters to pick from
I went there last weekend with four friends and we enjoyed plenty of food with three entrees and one appetizers for a mere $9 each
Panang beef was quite good but I was disappointed by the ratio of beef to curry sauce
Our appetizer Thai toast was an odd concoction that tasted like french toast but was supposedly made out of chicken instead of bread
I will be going back but not because the food is so stellar so much as because the prices are good and it isn't very far from my house
although Tanzy has been around for 2 years i haven't tasted food this good in a long time re Tanzy review
Went for lunch and our waitress was very helpful and recommended a great spicy tofu dish which was amazing
I think a good sushi master knows what I want better than I doMy lunch companion was not a sushi fan and went for the salmon teriyaki
We ordered a few different margaritas the enchilada special the fish special and appetizers
The food wasn't good back then but it was open 24/7 and always available
While it's still not food that I would go out of my way for I appreciate the level of quality Green offers
The only reason why I am giving this restaurant three stars was because the food was amazing
CONCLUSION go for the food well worth it but be prepared to experience not worth it service
The service aside I was impressed by the prices of everything very reasonable nothing over $20 on the brunch menu except for a few specialty beef items most everything mid $10s
I can tell you we will go back for it and all the rest of the increadible food and service at  Chelsea's Kitchen you can't go wrong there we highly recommend it its a new favorite place to go
Not as good as the chicken but same great mushroom gravy came with it
the food is hot freshly cooked and packed with so much flavor the prices are so low that I feel if they raised the prices slightly and kept the same amazing customer service and fantastic kitchen work they could easily get a well deserved bigger and more contemporary place
Regardless of the size this place is wonderful it's clean and the staff is so friendly and the food
I just can't stop saying how delicious the food here is
I've never eaten at a Hooters and enjoyed the food
Pleasant server good busser/foodrunner keeping our waters filled
I hate it when customers make the server cry and if the food was no good how on earth is that her fault
Appetizers house soft pretzels & provolone fondue zucchini fritters crispy rock shrimp pateSalad roasted beet saladEntrees turkey sloppy Joe prime rib french dip jambalaya sweet potato tortelli beef short rib stewDesserts warm peanut butter cup blueberry cheesecake hot chocolate cake salted caramel puddingAfter tasting all the above the dishes that stood out most were the pretzels sweet potato tortelli beef short rib stew hot chocolate cake and salted caramel pudding
Some of my favorites are- Frozen mashed potatoes ok this is one of those items that it is almost embarrassing to admit that I don't make myself but they are so darn good that if you tried them you would understand- Frozen breaded chicken tenderloin breasts- Wine Country pecan and cranberry chicken salad filling- White meat chicken salad filling- Frozen Mandarin Orange Chicken along with Veggie Fried Rice- Sliced cheese platter- Asiago bread - dip it in olive oil & balsamic vinegar
The rest of the family had an assortment of tasty chicken and lobster dishes
Surprising the fish was good quality white fish if I had to guess possibly black cod it came with fries not chips
The plate was not balanced the fries outweighed the fish the main attraction by a good 5 to 1
We asked our very waiter who kept asking us if wanted anything to drink besides our ice cold water are the Kobe Beef Twin burgers made from grass-fed cows
Grass fed local beef exceptional flavor tex-mex etc
Would definitely go back there to try another flavor or even the pizza we saw being made that looked great
Quite honestly I am really not a breakfast gal so I DEVOURED their deliciously fresh sushi and ceviche salad
I've never had a bad experience here--service food wine all good
Its not like they don't know how to make authentic Chinese food but like any good restaurant they know their audience
If the decor of a restaurant causes you to not eat there then sadly you have probably missed the most amazing meals of your life because some of the biggest holes create some of the tastiest food
I get the #1 and honestly don't remember its name only the deliciousness of the rice noodles and beef
The beef has amazing flavor and I wish there was about twice as much included in the dish not just because it tastes good but also because I could use a little bit more protein to get me through the afternoon
The side dish of white beans that came with it was delicious though
I ordered a ceviche or the cold appetizer soft shell crab for the hot rib eye for the meat and halibut for the fish
Also there cheeseburger pizza is great without some items for me pickles onions The salads are always fresh the chili size is good the pot roast is some of the best I have ever had
I had brisket sandwich which was good But my girlfriends dish which was supposed to be drizzled in vinegar was soaked so it tasted very bad
Need to visit AZ more often if there's more good food like this
Our food was delicious shrimp wasn't over cooked and plenty of mango and shrimp
Everyone is drawn to the magical chicken - moist and tender with a crispy skin that bursts with flavor
Yay for good affordable food for the hungry college kid
Even though the trout is not a type of fish with a strong flavor I still enjoyed the plate very much
The gnocci were good but the fish was overcooked and dry
Most importantly the new menu no longer carries the amazing churros that Prado used to serve for dessert
It is delicious food for an amazing value
The food was there fast hot and it was good
the food was good very good even but I have some complaints
the flavor was minimal and it was not braised enough as the meat did not fall off the bone as all the others i've seen have
I like their food & drinks and they have some good deals
Between all of us at the table I think we tried a little bit of everything and everyone seemed very pleased with the pricing and quality of the pizza and other entrees
The crunch roll was awesome so very tasty
The couple across from us were seated probably a  good 10 minutes after us had the same waiter and received their food a good 10 minutes before us
All of the food was tasty just not prepared to our liking
The chicken friend steak was some of the best I've ever had and the mashed potatoes and gravy all over was excellent
Service was good fast turn around on the food/shake
He knows his food is good and he will certainly be happy to tell you
this place it not super nice but the food is good
Maizie's has become my temptress as of late luring me out of the confines of my apartment to dine on oh-so-delicious food and drink great local beers all while not breaking the bank
She raved about how amazing this family owned cafe and market reminded her of home and how they served the best lentil soup and grilled lemon chicken
When the food arrived and after a few bites me and all the others arrived to the conclusion that Hanny's might be better for drinks the pizza  if you can call it pizza is more like a flat bread with very little flavor and with cheap topping the salads were really small and again with cheap ingredients
The tacos are deliciousI'm in love with the Spicy Thai Chicken Bowl
It was a nice evening the wait staff was good but the food - eh
For a hearty meal the I recommend the Bistec beef  or Pollo chicken dishes that come with salad rice beans and Salvadorean tortillas $8
The food was delicious the service impeccable
The Summer bouillabaisse my husband had was wonderful and my ribbon pasta with fennel chicken sausage was superb
Totally worth paying more for the Kobe beef than the regular stuff and though I haven't tried the regular stuff I was more than satisfied with the Kobe
I tried their chips salsa guacamole and their chicken wrap which was REALLY good
Okay so this place isn't fancy and you certainly wouldn't want to come here for the ambience but if you are downtown and looking for some tasty Americanized Chinese food this is the place to be
Sure it is greasy and you will likely walk out of here in a food coma but their lunch specials are huge tasty and can't be beat
Get past the backyard Hawaiian themed decor and the Tropical Friday shirts the staff has to wear and the food is pretty good
woody looking chips chicken I don't even like chicken and spicy deliciousness that's an ingredient now
Service was good but there were issues with the food
The redone steak came out a little more pink not red but still did not have the deep meaty flavor I was craving
The Fish sandwich we ordered was good as were the cole slaw and broccoli sides
I felt the lunch menu was perhaps a bit overpriced given the quantity and quality of food
25 which was a spicy dish but ordered it HOT
Still the food is good when you can get it and using a Safeway card to get the occasional free sandwich is awesome in my book
I didnt know what I wanted so I decided to try the recommended pizza skins and the numero uno deep dish
I think the restaurant has better options but rating purely on food I was not impressed
Ihappened by during their soft open and I was very impressed with the food
The food in my opinion may have not been superb but was tasty
We eat half in the restaurant and take half homefor that great well-mixed flavor of heated day-old pizza
Will continue buying bread here but will have to look elsewhere for a good pizza dough supply
Ordered the scallops  3 for $18 dollars and they split it for us--good but 3 scallops for 18 think you are starting to get my gest ordered the beet salad for $13 split  good split the Halibut for $36---fish in a sauce with vegetablesbread was good then split the dessert for 9 dollars
When waiting for our car before entering we heard the valet tell another customer that Vincent was not there that night and it was not good when he's not there---should have left then--food was a B-B+-we split glad we did---disappointed in all and will we go back---not for a long long time
We shared a delicious salad the orange fennel and some ceviche then had 2 pizzas so we'd be sure to have leftovers to take home
The ceviche was refreshing and tasty and i really enjoyed the wild mushroom party pizza
The Fallen Angel pizza was good but i was not expecting the flavor of the sausage
Overall we were very impressed with the food and we'll definitely be back
Not sure what to expect I was pleasantly surprised by the location the food and good service
Not really much except that the food has got to be good
Even though my food was not up to par the service was exceptionally good
I had the grilled chicken pita and it was delicious
Sakana is a good place to take someone who really likes crab salad; because nearly every roll is a crab salad California roll
What saves Sakana a bit is they had a nice chicken cutlet appetizer thin juicy nice panko
There were plenty of kids there so if you want to introduce sushi to a child or someone this might be a good place
After 8pm the cooked food at the grill and some of the hot food in the dishes are old looking and need to be replaced
Brooklyn attitude with Dominos Pizza quality
Lots of reasonably priced appetizers and curry dishes
Tom Yum Soup tasty but we won't order it again Lemon Chicken Yummy for the many tender cubed pieces of white meat chicken
Pricing is also reasonable for the quality of food
everything I had sushi wise was very good
I enjoyed this much more than what I had at Kobe Japanese Steakhouse & Tepan & Sushi
Other than that I really enjoyed the sushi and would come back for lunch since my office is close
But let's get to the good stuff the food
My Mom was in town from Alaska and craving some good Mexican food so I took here to La Tolteca to get her fix
The tomato soup reminded me of pepperoni pizza which was strange at first but actually pretty good
I was told the sub rolls were no good so she put me in a 7-grain
If you like a good cheesy-gooey NY-style pizza this is the place for you
I just get my plate of tasty food pay just a little Kashman's is pretty cheap and grab a table
Maybe try the fish tacos as someone else said they were good
Hula's food was not great but it was good and the portions were very generous
Lately the quality of the food has gone downhill and the portions leave much to be desired
I've never had their salad apps or desserts but they all look good
We started eating and the original waitress stopped by to see how our meal was and the food was pretty good so we both said good
The chicken coconut curry was good as well
As mentioned by others the food was pretty good but the portion and price was not
Blue Agave isn't what I would call real Mexican food but it is still a really good place eat
That being said we only always order the gyros with side salad and my son gets the chicken fingers with french fries fries are very tasty
The food is always delivered quickly and with excellent service
The sushi is actually pretty darn good here
The sushi was good but not the best I have ever had but fresh nonetheless
the pizza i ate here when my tastebuds were still vegan-oriented told me that the pizza was good though i still haven't had vegan pizza that supasses a pizza with real cheese on it
Beyond the food I always take it upon myself to really explore the specialty bar menu to see how good their bartenders really are
I tried a sample of the Bourbon Chicken and it was incredibly good
For entrees we got a salad chicken with pesto risotto and salmon - all of which tasted really good
There are lots of vegetarian options on the menu but when I tried to modify them to be vegan ie no cheese no mayo no cream the server told me the dishes wouldn't taste good and discouraged me from getting them
The brownie dish was way better but both of were pretty good
Even though the food was good it's not good enough to make me come back here and endure the painful service
Big  tasty slices of delicious NY style thin crust pizza and a drink for $4 bucks
Upon entering we stepped up to a window and ordered fried pickle appetizer I had the chicken and shrimp dinner and the husband had the crawfish po' boy
Now a $6 appetizer seemed a bit steep but when we received the food it was enough for 6 people
I guess when you get down to it it's all just deliciously spiced fried food but this was really good
all of the accompanying sauces were very flavorful and added a lot to the food
Included with each meal is a delicious fried roll
The vegetable dishes fried rice and especially the Kung Pao 3 Seas - with shrimp scallops and the most wonderful white fish - were all excellent
The only disappointment was the sizzling calamari which had a little too much fried batter but did have an excellent use of onions and peppers on the dish and the Singapore Sling that was too sweet for our taste
This place can get really hectic and yes the parking sucks but the people who work here are unbelievably nice and the food is delicious
In N Out is fast food but its the most fresh and flavorful burger I have ever had and for some reason even the bun tastes better than at most places
If I'm back in the area I would probably go back to try that chicken salad Gabi is talking about and maybe some of the chocolate cake it looked pretty good
Think fish  think tropical flair  think delicious
I ordered the french dip which was OK but the beef was cold and dry which leads me to believe it was made first then sat and sat and sat
I can't complain about the taste or quality of the food but I can't write home about it either
There was plenty of food making it well worth the price
The chicken was freshly grilled juicy and flavorful
The salsa they have to go with the chips is excellent and the food is even better
Sooo quality of the food Salad was comparable to before but there were no mixed greens
As I mentioned the samples we tried were good but I declined purchasing more food
I was looking forward to this meaty delight as I'd heard good things
The bacon-wrapped chicken was very good also
This pseudo-upscale joint which had the most annoying singer-songwriter live music ever has a couple of tasty treatsbut for the most part I would have rather chased down one of the awesome taco stands here in LA than pay the $$ for what they called Mexican food
Hot Mess I was expecting something along the lines of  an NYPD Pizza since this is a local chain but instead got a cool atmosphere and bad food
Lo-Lo himself Larry came out and he made piping hot fresh waffles to order as the employees all dined on the best fried chicken in all of Arizona and some of the most delicious mac and cheese and read beans and rice I've ever tasted
I typically don't bother with the pizza -- it is good but not really an attraction
The food is a tad pricey imho but it is good
The prices are on the high side for the portion sizes but the quality of the food is superb
And pay attention to the heat levels on the menu; some of the dishes are HOT
Ordered the delicious spring rolls as described in the review below mine
The ambiance food and service were all amazing
The chicken rolled tacos were quite good also and they were perfectly fried with a soft crunchy texture
I have always gotten my fall back the Jade Red Chicken Quesadilla it is so good
This is not healthy food this is not food to eat regularly but every once in a while it is a darn good meal
But the food is so good OMG it is still worth it
It is cool creamy with a punch of flavor and I dip chicken and fries in it equally
Sometimes chicken strips just sound good and Raising Cane's satisfies so give it a try
Hard to order chicken at a place that does such good burgers but it was quite tasty
Not the highest quality cut of bird but it was white meat and tender and pretty darn good
Although the food is by no means the best that Japanese cuisine has to offer it is still authentic and very good
I had chicken added for protein-the dish came to the table so fresh-with perfectly cooked veggies in season the rice was beyond tasty and the shredded chicken the perfect compliment
I guess Thai Food is like sex because it is always good but some are better than others
They have really good sushi and the best Onion Soy salad dressing ever
They taste like a fabulous combination of fried chicken and hot wings served with hot sauce blue cheese the real deal and celery sticks
We both ordered salads the BBQ Ranch Chicken topped with onion rIngs and the Chinese Chicken salad which has always been delicious
The drinks are great definitely a strange place to find a great spot but it goes to show that with good food everyone will come and come back
The sushi was good I only tried 2 rolls
This place is a great find if you are looking for a light fresh and tasty dessert
In today's age of manufactured food production it's nice to find a place that produces a wholesome natural ice cream bar rather than high fructose corn syrup injected into flavored ice
wow i gotta start saying that i had the best salmon i had for a very very long time i usually dont order fish when is beef on the menu lol i am 100% beefy person but what it got my eye it was cause it was serve with cold couscous and some pickle veggies that made me very happy  we had a pitcher of sangria n it was very tasty as well
As far as food that I've had here - the JapaneseAhi Rice Bowl was pretty good
The food is amazing the prices are lower and there is so much atmosphere
Food was still great tasting and great quality
Negatives We are absolutely meat lovers and enjoy good flavor however with the exception of a couple of cuts there really wasn't too much to it other than over salted entrees
Food and it was so close to our hotel had to check it out
a spicy chicken penne pasta with a little hot dog thrown in for good measure
The dining room is HUGE and this place could easily accomodate a LARGE partyThe food is served cafeteria style but the quality of the food is way beyond
It looked like their fryer was not hot enough when they dipped rolls for cooking
I don't mind cheap ethnic food and I know that it can be inexpensive but still very good
Again the service is very friendly I kind of feel bad leaving such a negative review but I cannot lie and led other people believe that the food was good
My problem is the limited menu during lunch time and the quality of that food
When I went to brunch my girl did like the drinks and the chiliquiles are good but you could do better from any torta chain with little effort and just suffer from the ambiance for better food
This place is wonderful - fast service friendly people and AMAZING food to be fair I have only tried the brisket loaded baker pulled pork sandwich macaroni & cheese and cornbread
Otherwise the food here is good and hearty
BTW their chicken quesadilla is amazing too
The food was all delicious and came flying out of the kitchen
It comes served on a plastic tray much like you'd find at a school cafeteria I felt special though as the other patrons got styrofoam plates   The food was delicious solid tortillas and they even gave me a char-grilled onion quarter
Everything was excellent the meat the sauce the bun the mac salad and definitely the beans
The Fish Fry is really good fish and probably the best  tartar sauce of any diner I have been too
Even tossing some watered down hot sauce on that pile of bland meat and carbs didn't really improve the edibility
I had the appetizer platter and the chicken with white rice and weird white sauce with a dry side salad
The Korean spicy noodle bowl also outdid itself with sliced beef strips and a wonderfully hot hot hot taste
I was hesitant about the restaurants located inside the hotel but the Sushi restaurant near the lobby is really good and not that expensive and the SWB bistro is also pretty good
A nice cup of hot chocolate and a stroll to see all the lights is a great way to get into the holiday spirit
The place has a great atmosphere but the food isn't worth anywhere near $34
The guest rooms the meeting space the banquet food during the meetings the hotel restaurant - Cafe ZuZu the restaurant behind the hotel - Trader Vics the accommodating staff the pool area and jacuzzi and how could I forget cleanliness
So for NYE my girlfriend and I took my parents out to Beckett's and everyone really enjoyed the food and the experience
For the money you're better off going to Four Peaks where the food is incredible and the beer is tasty
The server was friendly even though we were there right up until close and the food was very good
The 'bowl' dishes are good to but not as spectacular as the sandwiches
Both were good- did it taste like the freshest fish of all time
The rest of our experience with dinner - service restaurant ambiance overall feel and all of our food and drinks before the entrees was AMAZING
The only reason I only gave 4 stars is some of the food quality was only so-so
The others in our party had a BBQ chicken wrap described as good but mostly tortilla
If you are wanting to listen to modern Irish jigs while eating delicious food who doesn't
I've ordered a number of appetizers and dishes here
I don't do much of my grocery shopping at Albertson's since I try and purchase mostly sustainable foods but their french bread is DELICIOUS
Once all was said and done the food ended up to be pretty damn tasty and very filling
All the dishes we had were extremely fresh authentic and DELICIOUS
It is delicious with bits of vegetable and whatever meat you prefer
For dressing I like the roasted tomatillo to really bring out the flavor of the meat without overpowering it
It's not really fast food but like the saying goes more good food served quickly
If you're tired of chains and looking for a place that serves fresh food daily in a few flavorful combinations visit Cafe Rhumba
Nah let's just call this place what it is  a ripoff a place that uses cheap ingredients to make a profit on the poor customers of Phoenix who don't ask questions and assume because they throw alot of cheap meat into the bun it must be worth the price
The meal came with hot thin tortillas and was a better meal than I expected from a food court stand in an airport
They should also include on the table a selection of fish sauces and spices to add to your meals and appetizers
Full size grown up food is always amazing
The grilled bbq pizza is good but it is hit or miss on how burnt the bottom is
The absurdly delicious breakfast burritos the shredded beef tacos with roughly 78000 grams of fat per serving steak supreme nachos which weigh about 3 pounds cheese enchilidas
I'm from the Bay Area and the Thai food there is delicious
Others include a house-cured beef jerky with horseradish creme fraiche a bacon and egg puff pastry bite a melon and basil soup shot with pancetta dust rimming the glass and a date and chorizo bite that was nothing short of heaven
Our food was very good with the only failure of my meal being the overabundance of orange with my salmon
Also many excellent dishes available at lunch and are reasonably priced
When I tried the pizza I wasn't blown away but it was good
The food and beverages here are as good as the cause that this place stands for
I opined on my five-points requirement to get on my sushi-worth-eating list and those first visits did not fail to impress
I spoke about my personal scale of very good excellent and life changing sushi
Besides the excellent food it is that passion which brings me back night after night week after week
I guess if I had never enjoyed GOOD cajun food *cough* Baseline/Price *cough* previously or never enjoyed it at all this place would get 3
If you think this is excellent cajun food well shame on you
All of the dishes were delicious and had enough food for 4 adults
50 and include egg flower or hot & sour soup entree fried rice and the greasiest egg roll that ever egg rolled
The fact that we were less than impressed with the atmosphere really dark decor kind of reminded me of Black Angus and staff our server was overly enthusiastic when presenting the specials but not around when you needed more water or the check isn't enough to make me take away a star or two because the food and drinks were delicious and well-prepared enough to make the experience a great one despite these drawbacks
We actually didn't like the Buffalo Carpaccio as much as we hoped we would - while the meat itself was tender and fresh the chef had overseasoned it and the espresso and cumin flavors were overpowering
Having it prepared this way made it so tender and the meat's flavor was complemented by the bread pudding figs/raisins and flavorful sauce that accompanied it
The beef short ribs were also deliciously tender and came with a hearty but so rich serving of pecan grits
I definitely recommend the chorizo and the spinach and chicken omelette
It was comfortable inviting and the food tasted very good
The pizza takes a little while to come out but it's well worth the wait
As I stated before they do have staple Arizona style Mexican fast-food here and there are a few I would recommend
Very good food after a long long wait for a table at 900am last Sunday morning
Our friends noted that the quality of food had definitely changed since their last visit
The food was excellent and I got the scallops but be careful it makes you full fast and i mean fast
At the hot table our food cooker was so niceand he was young
Bandera's food is quite good and that has led me to eating there more times than I can recall
Their rotisserie chicken and cornbread perhaps two dishes that the restaurant is best known for are very good
I am a big fan of ordering a grilled artichoke for my appetizer and then following that up with the chicken enchiladas
I've been to Maizie's several times and the food is consistently good
You can tell the quality of the food is top notch and service is always great
We sat at the bar right in front of Nobuo and were entertained the whole night by his artistic preparation of what I would call new-style sashimi along the same vein as what Crudo is doing in Scottsdale - small plates of fresh raw seafood dressed with flavored oils and local in-season fruits and vegetables
Each dish excited the palate with creative combinations of flavors textures and temperatures such as the Hirame Carpaccio topped with hot sesame oil at the table
Although based on the mizuyokan we had for dessert I am sure the kitchen puts out equally excellent food
It's a very flavorful dish however the individual tastes are all mushed together
And the meat was blended well with all the flavors of the dish
Ordered a BBQ chicken salad which was adequately portioned and tasty
Had shrimp was really good and burnt but good Burnt like french food  empanadas were good as well as the mussels
Completely flavorless beef that I am convinced had been a hamburger right up until I ordered the taco - it was in big gray chunks
The place was very clean food was fast and excellent
There was a great balance of flavors as well as plenty of meat in the dish
I wish I hadn't as not more than 50 feet from where I sat people where most likely enjoying some awesome appetizers and good food for way less
The bread was good but the sauce had the hint of toothpaste probably from too much tomato paste that peter piper seems to have in their equally terrible pizza
I don't mind paying well for good food but you can't help feeling like you have been ripped off when you have a larger than average bill for crappy food
Let this be a lesson to you and me read reviews on Yelp for recommendations on a new restaurant's best dishes before you go
The chicken was a little dry and the steak while good was not cut in to easy to eat sizes and frankly making up your tortilla was not easy
The rainbow roll was good and what we expected albacore sashimi was good but not the best I have had
I quickly ordered a wine flight for each of us $2 off each flight and an appetizer of chicken satay with pineapple salsa  $8
This place may have some food that could be good but I am not willing to take that chance
I would like to see a little more quality in the food here than what we received
My grandma got a chicken burrito which was good too
I got the Wasabi Soy  chicken which was delicious
The Extra Spicy Gyoza Pot soup appetizer is also good although it's definitely only for people who like their food REALLY spicy believe me on this one - I have a pretty high heat tolerance
The fish especially was wonderful light the spices just right
Texturally the almonds on the top went wonderfully with the steamed green veg and flakey-creamy fish
Normally I wouldn't complain except that the food inside the bowl wasn't very good or flavorful
My boyfriend really enjoyed the Rosemary chicken which came with spaghetti and marinara
Food is always really good Lots of it great flavor and the guy who runs the place is always friendly and helpful
I still think that this place is a glorified cheesecake factory because it is BUT I have been here a few times since my last review and must say that a lot of their food really is tasty much tastier than cheesecake factory so I have to give them that
Additionally I have been to the one in Vegas and all of the food there was good too like the jambalaya
The husband ordered the veggie flat which he really enjoyed he wished he would have ordered it without the broccoli though and I ordered the pesto chicken sammie
I went down here with Melissa because I had purchased a $2 coupon from that online place wink wink that let us buy $35 worth of food for only $10
The food is still as good as it was when 15 of us would jump into Smitty's vw van and drive down for our 30 minuet lunch break
While these aren't Mexican dishes they were for the kids this is sky-high even for restaurant standards- The side dishes are tiny -- my portion of rice and beans was absolutely lacking- The carne asada tacos were decent but could have been more flavorful; including a lime definitely would have helped the causeAs there are many other better and more authentic places to get Mexican food in the East Valley search elsewhere
Sunflower Market gets high marks for having fairly competitive prices vis-a-vis Whole Foods high quality products especially produce and meat good hours they're open until 11 which is nice and an excellent selection of bulk foods
Dessert was the always awesome Roy's Melting Hot Chocolate Souffle
I recommend getting the all white meat version  just a bit extra
The seafood dishes were good Fra Diavolo sauce was right on shrimp a bit chewy
Walking in to Blanco Taco I was craving some good mexican food
I found the catfish burger to be my favorite at the time but still wish it had a deal of a bit more flavor or seasoning its quite bland
Crab cakes were a little fishy imo but good
It was pretty standard but she was really unimpressed with the chicken in it
This was just standard chicken breast with no flavor sliced up and thrown in the salad
The choices were amazing as was the quality of the food
Some items I ate because I LOVE variety and tasting everything Vegetable curry samosa Thai eggroll barbecue chicken Asian sesame chicken asparagus really fresh ones I skipped all the noodly dishes to save room for the other stuff salmon really perfectly cooked smoked salmon and salmon salad ALL great chile rellenoa teeny tiny slice of turkey with a special apple cranberry sauce sundried tomatoes and yellow peppers a blueberry cheese sounds weird but VERY good one ravioli tasted and looked like a pesto-based sauce and tastes of a few desserts that I shared with Gary
95 a great value for the quality and quantity of foods available
I would certainly come here again for the ambiance food choices quality and overall experience
It's never smelled funny whenever I have eaten here and I would recommend this place for both bar and table seating you know how you get screwed when you order sushi at the table at almost any other Japanese restaurant
Came here for a group dinner and wasn't impressed with the food menu
The food we had there was very tasty quite a bit lighter/less starchy than my favorite Thai place Swaddee Thai which is incidentally just a mile up the street at Ray Road and Rural Road
The chicken noodles dish surprised me in its bright homey chicken broth flavor
Slightly less expensive than Swaddee Thai but both restaurants offer such a unique interpretation of their signature dishes that it is worth it to frequent both
Very rarely is the food not fresh and hot
Great weather great food good if not slow service
Been here twice now and the food is amazing and authentic
We had appetizers of lamb chops flat bread with barbequed chicken which were quite good except the lamp could have been cooked a bit longer
HELLO Mr Owners of OE your service and food have changed since your move and it's not a good change
After all the Food Network foodies have tried your place for the first and last time ~ The Yelpers regulars want the old Over Easy service and quality of food back please
They won us over long ago with their consistently excellent food and service but they really won our undying allegiance by being open on Christmas Day
We had shrimp noodles which were well seasoned and had good texture but the pork dumplings steamed pork buns and egg rolls were relatively bland
The pie was topped off with veggies and Joe's meatballs and tasted delicious
Shortly after I finished most of the chilis the server came out with  two fist-size meatball in a delicious looking roll
With a couple of great owners and good food this place should be a no-brainer to anyone looking for a moderately-priced Italian meal
Both restaurants are equally amazing the service is always great and the food is delicious
Would highly recommend Manuel's to anyone looking for great Mexican Food in a casual atmosphere
I also recommend the crunchy spicy tuna roll
I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good sushi happy hour
That said there is no denying the quality of the food
But it's the pizza that's the big star here and I don't know if it's just me but it seems like there's been a slow but noticeable decline in its quality
Chicken parm cordon bleu meatball subs all delicious
Excellent experience great food great service
Satay Sampler - Shrimp beef and chicken skewers marinated in a tasty coconut curry and served with peanut sauce and cucumber chutney
Trust me it was so delicious that I really wanted to finish the whole dish but after all the appetizers and soup I thought I might explode if I didn't stop eating
the food nor the atmosphere is definitely not worth the wait - and there is always a wait
The California rolls were good and so were the spring rolls
Its a smaller place that has good food but space is limited here
Then we got some wings and their wings ar so meaty and delicious
Im not a big fan of chicken and i usually like mt wings burnt to the bone so i dont taste the flavor weird i know but their wings were pretty great
I'm old school so I'm straight with a hot dog and some chicken strips but I'm as good as fucked if I want anything less barbaric
I had tried their sushi as well and have always been impressed
I enjoyed the flavor of the meatball dish the palak dish was bland
Food is very tasty and the daily specials are always right on the money
from the moment we took our seats til the last bite of the chocolate molten cake which im going to say is a definite must we were in awe of not only the setting atmosphere and delicious meats/treats
It doesn't get to much better than Fez great atmosphere great food reasonable prices good service
Their lunch portion is the perfect amount of food and comes with delicious soup
I've tried about 3 different dishes but mostly I get the Panang Curry Thai Hot 1
Chicken sandwich that tasted so good you don't want to swallow
Okay if you actually like the taste of good whole foods and fresh ingredients this place is an Oasis of goodness
The food in my opinion was catered to the nice next door hotel and not towards those seeking truly authentic Mexican food
Which is a shame considering they have good pizza
There are lots of good pizza places in Phoenix save yourself the hassle and the headache order from somewhere that actually knows the meaning of customer service
I was hesitant to try corn as a dessert flavor but it turned out sweet and not too overpowering
My husband was diagnosed with Guillain-Barre Syndrome & Miller-Fisher Syndrome from a flu shot which could have killed him
not the greatest stronger than most Asian food stores you'll get a good whiff right when you walk inLOOK'n for something
Fresh feel good food that leaves you feeling rejuvenated not bloated
The menu is rife with tantalizing options including pita pizzas pastas subs and burgers but I've never desired to stray from the solid and delicious pitas
I don't know if there are any resturant unique items that they have but they serve the usual Chinese food just at a better quality
If you are looking for a good lunch try the Mongolian Beef or Sweet and Sour Chicken
Pick up tins of real French butter crusty baguettes small or large croissants French horns filled with creme anglais tasty hot puff pastries filled will pate crunch friend shrimp and pork egg roll Vietnamese spring rolls or get yourself either a freshly made Vietnamese or French style baguette or croissant sandwich
The food was okay but not worth the price
com coupon so I got about $40 dollars worth of sushi for like $22 after tip
It's not that anything was out right disgusting maybe it was due to blandness idk but it wasn't full of any weird nasty flavors but I didn't finish much of the food at all
firecracker i think which sounded good with spicy tuna and shrimp tempura along with a spicy tuna a vegas and the sushi sampler with various nigiri
Especially in Phoenix where everything is so spread out it's fantastic that you can find great food within walking distance of your hotel
The tacos were excellent and I would recommend the ground beef pernil and chicken as 3 solid choices
That being said Sakana's rainbow roll philly roll and crunchy eel rolls were totally melt-in-your-mouth delicious
Love all the burgers the pizzas are good my hubby loves the beet salad the portabella mushroom sandwich is flavorful and satisfying and if you have a sweet tooth make sure to try the french toast peanut butter banana chocolate chip pineapple strawberry sandwich
It had a lemon grassy flavor the curry was thick not too fishy and a plenty even amount of ingredients
The Food-our 3 course prix fixe was delicious from the lobster bisque topped with crunchy veggie bits to the filet mignon perfectly cooked to the chocolate heaven dessert my mouth was always satisfied
However it lacked that one abso-freaking-lutely amazing dish that deserves a 5 star
The food was good nothing crazy-awesome but good
The VERY GOOD*  The Chicken Chop Suey
The food is so fresh and the flavors are great not too salty not overseasoned just right
We were so grateful Alicia told us about the Summer special Chicken Milanese and Lasagne helping make it easier to decide since it was such a good value
I am so happy about this awesome experience excellent service and delicious food
I can taste the quality of the meat and buns
They offer most of the usual Vietnamese dishes from Goi Cuon appetizers summer rolls to Bun vermicelli Mi egg noodles Com rice plates to stir fry chicken pork beef; also seafood some specials and Pho soups 16 different ones
This isn't the best Asian food ever but it is quick accessible and always pretty tasty
The place is clean plenty of seating and the food was fast fresh and delicious
We're not really huge fans of the beans too runny or rice sorta sweet and bland has corn bits and I usually pass on those in lieu of a nod-nod wink-wink extra side of meat doesn't always work but it's worth a shot
The rest of there food is amazing but pay the extra and get your piece of salsa heaven
The sushi was good but the prices were a little high
First time I ate here maybe a month ago I got the Apricot Miso dish with mock chicken and it was very good
Because based on what they cooked and offered the food was well made and very tasty
I will definitely be back again because the coffee is really good no longer cartel but also a local brand expressions service is excellent and food is well prepared
I will need to come back again to sample the other food choices apparently they serve a good dinner too
Positives  A good example of traditional Dim Sum if not a perfect one                 Good food great place for groups
Oh yes and before I forget GRADESOverall   A- no other demerits taken other than mentioned belowService  A-  The only major demerit on service was that the English                        spoken by some of the cart pushers was not intelligible                       however this is excusable as this is a Chinese place -                        the specials board was completely in ChineseFood   A-  A good example of traditional Dim Sum
Tricks is the only worthwhile option for fresh creative fine dining level food in downtown Tempe
Food came out hot fixings were cooked nicely condiments readily available on the table
That tells me not only were they extremely happy but that the food was delicious and then they were taking bites from our plates too they're 8 & 9
We were served terrible quality food for the pricing of this restaurant
Don't get scared - its not one of those Mexican Sushi types of places its just got a great menu and everything is delicious
They have a daily dinner special w/app entree and dessert - something like Wally's economic stimulus plan for a good price - clever
A couple of beers better-than-average bar food open late-ish for Arcadia you're good
Unfortunately service does not make up for the lack of quality in food or the overwhelmingly inflated prices
The owner chimed in so after further thought I upgraded Streets of NY because their food is good just not my fav and in MY OPINION over priced
If you take issue with some sauces the only pizza I would recommend is their Pesto which I have had and it is delicious
After sampling a variety of offerings you can have a very good experience if you zero in on the dishes you like
Good service great food OK prices hence the 4 stars
I'm always a little hesitant to order chicken because it's often dried out but this was moist and delicious
The food is served hot out of the kitchen as soon as it's ready so there is little wait time
I usually don't like my sushi that way but I ate it all it was delicious
The heart attack was really was like an Asian jalapeno popper I've never seen anything like this at any other sushi restaurants it was amazing
That aside the food here can be pretty good
Shove some storage boxes aside shift the somewhat awkward and somewhat heavy tables and chairs so you can actually sit at them without having to be as thin as a stick figure they don't mind that their clientele shifts tables and chairs around to suit their parties which is usually families of various sizes then step up to the hot plates nestled into the steam table to see the 8-10 dishes offered on that day's menu--it changes daily but is usually the same from week to week
As for the food I thought it was good for the price
They'll be stuck munching on marinated onions since I'm pretty sure the tortillas and pinto beans have got a lovely amount of lard in them plus their senses will be assaulted by the delicious smell of succulent juicy grilled meat
The combos are dirt cheap and delicious at four bucks for a 1/4 beef or chicken and seven bucks for the combination of the two
They've never really messed up my food here so that's a good thing
They have a fairly interesting menu and the food is usually pretty good
I love their zipparitas in every flavor they often have great deals on food and drinks
Let's start off with; the service is mediocre but the food is worth it
But like I said the food is better than RA and Kona so if food quality is on the top of your mind you must try Mikado
The lightening is even pretty dim which appeals to the sushi lover who isn't impressed by the bright flourescent lighting in typical resaurants
I love eating there because the food comes super quick and it tastes delicious
I am in no way an authority on what makes for good Ethiopian food but I know what I likes and this place I definitely likes
All in all an AMAZING sushi place but I wouldn't suggest going for the hibachi tables
The food was fairly good but if you are not really hungrey and just want a small soup or salad no choices
The food here seems to be good and I think its also the ambiance and guys that run the show that make dining here worthwhile
I had the two item combo with the Chicken Coconut Curry and the Lechon Paksiw Roasted Pork Stew and they were both delicious
Both the chicken and the pork were tender and moist and full of flavor
They have chips and salsas hot sauce Ass Kickin' food products prickly pear glass gift jewelry hand-weaved baskets cook books live cactus and all sorts of southwestern knick knacks
The naan was among the best I've had and the ingredients in the Chicken Madras were savory and delicious
Barro's makes some damn good deep dish pizza
Pretty tough to beat especially since their pizza is super tasty
The quality of the fish is top notch it melts in your mouth
In any case the sushi is excellent and worth the price
I have been to Sushi In Motion in Chandler recently and was not impressed lower quality fish overly bright lighting and too busy
The setting and the fact the food when arrived was actually good redeemed them a bit to 2 stars
The only food that looked good on that screen was the chocolate chip cookies
The pork meat tasted like rubber and it was amazingly VERY dry
Even so the service is still friendly and their sushi is *always* tasty fresh and inventive I like to order the chef's creation
In all fairness I cannot speak to the quality of food or atmosphere when it isn't a game day
This restaurant had several good savory dishes including the starter grilled quail with polenta and greens that could be upgraded to an entree $30 roasted Brussels sprout side $7 and the flat iron steak $30 with chimichurra
Delicious desserts that invoke the flavors of the desert
While it is true that it lacks a lot of ambiance I will say that the food is always good
But don't worry the coffee is hot the waitresses are friendly and the food is absolutely amazing
I also heard amazing comments on the Nuts About Berries salad the BBQ Chicken salad and the Pina Colada Chicken salad
I ordered the cucumber rolls appetizer and my bf ordered the pho
The chicken nachos were a little short on the chicken the chips were just a little too soggy but I'd probably still have them again because of the substantial size of the plate and the tasty guacamole
Chicken breast was lukewarm tough and not very tasty
Pasta is okay but the salad is really good I got a harvest salad the chicken was delish and so was the dressing
It was a small plate full of big meaty green olives obviously warmed in a bath of live oil and served with a light sprinkle of salt and oh so good
But an appetizer does not a meal make so lets go on to the main course and side dish
and decided to give their fish and chips a shot for my quick meal
I really want to skip to the best part though so instead of describing how unpleasant our server was how our food was served at a nuclear-hot temperature and quickly turned icy in the arctic corner of the bar as the common area was the polar opposite -- hot crowded and littered with crying children
Just went there this past Saturday and was impressed with the food and atmosphere
We had a bunch of appetizers and ordered the koobideh as a side item - it was a lot of food
The atmosphere was cute but the food was not a good value and never really rose above Ok
This visit was enhanced by a watermelon/mint among other things salad a Schreiner sausage/lentil dish cold fried chicken sandwich not talking just tomato and mayo
Anyone who thinks this is good food has no credibility when it comes to food
Typical bar food that was probably frozen at some point but it was pretty good nonetheless
Let's name themSteamed Edamame with Sea SaltCrispy Fried Squid with Chili and LimeButterfish Tataki with White Asparagus and Yuzu favoriteZucchini with Miso MustardSausage Platter2 Other Sushi dishesGood wine as my friends would say and awesome photographers
However for an average night I'm heading over to Thai Rama where you'll find the same great food excellent taste nearly double the portion and a lighter check
I usually order a steak New York but yes the seafood is pretty good here too
I have to say I have not been impressed with most of the food I have had at the Biltmore Fashion Park and Stingray Sushi did not disappoint
She took our drink order but unfortunately it never came so we just had water which in the end was a good thing since the food did not have much flavor
Then came the 9-11 roll and that was pretty good though for the money it was not a lot of food
I could never recommend Stingray Sushi at the Biltmore to anyone unless you have no clue what sushi should be
And I have to say that tipsy or sober I have never had an issue with food quality or service
The wonderfully thick and greasy pan pizza crust is the best late at night or for brunch the day after a night out
Good food not incredible but on par or maybe a little better than the competitors - Outback Black Angus etc
The pizza is the main attraction here and it is the thin-crust type featuring excellent sauce
The food is not exceptional but very good price wise and there are plenty of games to keep people interested
The food was good nothing special - I ate only one third of the meal
I only like eating food that is special and really tasty
I didn't get to have any of the food but everything I saw go by looked pretty good
We ordered- Thai-High Sweet & Zesty Chicken Salad - delicious- Wok Fired Sesame Ginger Chicken noodles - fabulous & a large portion- Side order of fries - seriously some of the best I had w/ both sea salt and pepper and perfectly friedOverall a great lunch
Meat = GoodSides = BadSauce = Exceptional 5 StarsEnjoy
Everything was very good although I was a little baffled by the big scoops of either cabbage lettuce or both that accompanied every dish except for the stuffed wings and Panang curry
It was fine with the satay and we ate bites of cabbage with the chicken and the delicious peanut sauce it came with although that sauce strangely started to congeal a little bit as the meal went on
The satay chicken was wonderful--tender and moist slightly sweet and aromatic with spices
The fresh rolls were indeed fresh--lettuce pops of flavorful herbs glass noodles crunchy chopped cucumber and fresh chewy wrappers
La's is a very noodle-centric dish but the noodles were perfectly cooked--not gummy clumpy oily--a good chew without being undercooked and loose so each noodle came up separately
We ordered the Rosemary Potato and Olive Pizza which was unique and quite good along with a side of Mac and Cheese which was not so good - I expected a little more flavor or pop in it
Our table also ordered a italian sausage combo pizza which was good and a corn chopped salad which was quite tasty
each one had a alrge deep fried/crusty chicken finger in it  I was expecting more shredded chicken  They were pretty tasty and had a nice spice
It has fabulous tortilla strips seasoned chicken and a delicious dressing
I used to love it but I've noticed the quality of the food seems to be going down lately
The past few times seems to be going downhill in food quality
Restaurant run by jovial proprietor has excellent food--gyros shawarma and best falafel I've had--ordered it four times
The food is not worth jumping up and down over but it is good
The beef chow fun was a perfect balance of saltiness meatiness and the oh-so good charred/smokiness that comes from a fast stir-fry over a jet engine stove
The wine was good and so was my meatball pizza
I do suggest to try to big juicy tasty meatballs
Seriously I love a gimmick more than the next person but the Heart Attack Grill is 100% gimmick and only 60% good food
We have so many mexican restarants in the valley to choose from  but what does impress me is that every time I have gone the food is consistently good
The food is pretty good as well although I'm pretty toasted by the time I get my food it would really matter
The pros - good experience lots of menu choices good food smells wonderfulThe cons - poor parking you will be a little crowded $10 guacamole and $11 glass of sangria
I would really prefer more heart healthy food to give a rating of great / excellent
It was good not fantastic but better than your average bar food
For dinner I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass Hong Kong style which was aromatic and had good flavors but the fish itself didn't seem as fresh as it could of been
Moving on to the food I had the farmers omelet and it was amazingly delicious for a vegetarian omelet
It's a little pricey but the food is well prepared very healthy and good portions not too much not too little
Overall I would go back because I love the atmosphere the food is delicious and healthy and the coffee is yummy
The chicken varieties are kinda plain as you would imagine chicken sausage is - but the pork varieties are all pretty good and they sell them at $2/lb quite often
After getting a few recommendations from foodie friends I suggested to my husband that we give Le Chalet a try
For example we wanted to know what the difference was between the appetizer pizza Flammenkuchin with bacon cheese and potatoes and the crepe with meat cheese and potato
Fun hidden neighborhood bar with good food and relaxed atmosphere
I didn't expect the food to be so good either
The huevos rolls were heavenly but my cilantro shrimp were OMG good
I am still shaking my head because the food was just that good
The service was prompt and friendly the prices were fair and the food was pretty good
You seat yourself which I don't love but I'm a fool for delicious food so I can live with self-seating
Basically The Tavern is a good sports bar offering all of the bar food and beer a sports fan can love - I was impressed by how friendly and fast the service was despite being there on a Monday Night Football day
Chelsea's Kitchen has the perfect combination of ambience friendly service and delicious food
the middle room is good for a group of friends who would like to chit chat and nosh on some food
There were 3 chicken dishes 1 lentil 1 veggie rice 2 appetizer type dishes salad yogurt and various sauces
I enjoyed all the dishes but did miss a lamb dish in the buffet
The chips didn't have much flavor and this dish wasn't that great
Really really amazing food but I just got home and am sitting in my condo still hungry since the 5 plates I split with my best friend and myself really did not fill me up
Just a piece of cheese and 2 mini pieces of breadReally tasty but just not enough food for the money
The sweet and sour chicken was great mongolian beef was spicy and the fried rice was excellent
Another great dish was the veggie hotpot that had some really interesting textures along with the noodles and veggies
The shopping center it is in is a bit run down too so you are assured you are paying for quality food and not the building
I love a good deal and all but the price means nothing if the food is crap
They are one of the best dishes like no other and so very delicious and my favorite when I eat here
but that's another storyIt still isn't very good food
We both decided to skip out on desserts due to the awful service and poor food quality
I keep going to Paradise Bakery expected to be impressed or at least enjoy the food more than I do I've had the chicken salad and paradise club
The meat was cooked perfectly medium-rare & the mashed potatoes/asparagus were delicious as well
The food just wasn't that flavorful or innovative
In my mind the only reason to choose an upscale small plates Thai place instead of an authentic no frills Thai place is to have food that uses different flavor combinations or cooking techniques
Also it screwed up the amount I was trying to spend since I had 20$ to spend on the deal chicken which I guess shows that this place is cheap which is good but for this particular trip that wasn't good
Oh well I would definitely come back here for some yummy pupusas and maybe try a different dessert next time the central american quesadilla looked pretty tasty
It may be hard for other smaller restaurants to acquire the good beef even at the USDA Prime level
But then again even USDA Prime beef varies in quality
The food is delicious the antipasto is excellent as is the Tuscan white bean salad and their wine list is quite extensive
Excellent service great atmosphere and really yummy food
The fish was delicious and if I were not in mixed company I probably could have eaten both sides of mushrooms that were ordered in their entirety
I passed but VERY good just wasn't in the mood for more spicy food ha
The food was great the service was good and the AC was cold
The food was still good but the service left much to be desired
The prices are reasonable and as long as you're not a snob the food is good but be willing to roll the dice on the service
There were Native American ingredients that were incorporated into dishes - but the flavors of 'basic' components were incredible
There looks to be a few complaints here regarding service time but there's always a wait for good food
$59 for $144 worth of food with a bottle of wine seemed like a great deal - unfortunately it wasn't
White the food and service were both good - portions were miniscule
In these struggling times I can understand that restaurants need customers but to say they are giving $144 worth of food when dividing portions in less than half left us feeling ripped off
my friend and i got the sweet potato fries and some fish cake- both ridiculously tasty and both came with sauces that i could have taken a late night swim in
The food was good my brother had some tacos sister in law had a burro I had shrimp tacos
Overall I recommended this spot the food is worth it and hopefully the service can pick it up a bit
Staff was very friendly and food was good
the chicken was rubbery with no flavor possible microwave victim
The best part of the combo was the corned beef very tasty
Popped in on a Saturday night to be treated to a ridiculously nice waitress and delicious Mexican food
While I cannot say it was the best pizza I have ever ate it was good and I walked away a pleasantly full and happy gal
To avoid having my opinion of Pizzeria Bianco swayed one way or the other by a potential 3 hour wait and since I don't feel like any food is worthy of a 3 hour wait I went with a group of 6 friends and made a reservation
I really enjoyed the Biancoverde and the Margherita although the Biancoverde was by far the heaviest of the pizzas and had intense flavors
For the two appetizers five pizzas a glass of wine a coke double expresso and a cappucino our bill came to $111
because the food exceeded my expectations in terms of quality and freshness and our group walked away quite happy with our dining experience despite a few hiccups
Food is good but their advertisement is false
However I wasn't really impressed overall with the food or the prices
This is where my husband and I go when neither of us want to cook and we want good food
I had the Shwarma - which is a hot pita with roasted chicken and all kinds of other goodness hehe I forget - but look it up on their menu
It was a good portion too no skimping on meat or filling
The chicken was marinated to perfection tangy and full of flavor
Food was delicious and the service was great
You can get a good mix of both styles of food
I sometimes wished they had more Cantonese styled dishes but the pho is good and they are the only place in town to get a Durian milkshake
We had the pizza which was okay a little soggy and the vegetabe plate and the hot dogs with fries and fruit
It is way over priced and I believe that if you are going to pay more for your food it should be amazing
And the curry dishes are very good as well
I recommend the chicken sandwich it's amazing
We'll try some of the hot dishes next time
The pizzas in general were really lacking in the flavor department
The food is fresh and smoky in a sultry and hot kind of way
Overall I recommend the pizza and the service was excellent
The food is good the service is adequate and it's not that much more expensive than fast food
If you want some good food cheap and don't mind eating in a balmy 80 degree dining room check it out
Now I know all you Hipster Foodies on this site especially those who have expense accounts and don't mind paying $100 a person for Trendy Sushi will look down on the lack of ambience and menus with photos the horror; so kitsch
Now to the food  I ordered the pork sliders as an appetizer
Mine came w/o certain items but still was pretty tasty and definitely more colorful and more texturally-satiating than the mashed disasters that were the salmon and tuna sushi
Spicy with a good amount of juicy well flavored chicken
The peperoni pie was also tasty with large slices of the cured meat and ample cheese
He wants good food better service and a comfortable atmosphere
The food wasn't the best Italian food and probably not the most authentic either but I enjoyed the aspect of sharing that the restaurant promotes
Our server was very good- the food was excellent yes we had a Rueben
and we also decided to split an order of fish and chips also very good
This is a great place to take your family to have someone else do the cooking  and enjoy some wonderful Az style mexican food
do restaurant owner ruin a good thing when it's going welleveytime i have been there it has been busy and i had been there at all different times of the day and week to see how the food was to compare it each time
This time the appetizer was terrible fried chix toast was greasyfish cakes tasted oldthe spring rolls were inedible
Chix sate was made w/dark meat and the peanut sauce was too runny and flavorlessPhad Thai was bland w/no tofu or eggsthey're actually charging $1
Chaat is basically snack food - dozens of different dishes all with a bit of a kick and real tasty it's hard to screw up chaat and if you do then you REALLY suck and shouldn't be in business
I started tackling each of them and they were all great really tasty aromatic and mouthwatering albeit maybe I'm feeling nostalgic for mom's food but still
I enjoyed my meal - the three dishes together equaled $10 plus change and I was about to burst and I can shovel in a ton of food before saying mercy
I've gotta admit the food is pretty darn tasty
The fish is good it's fresh but it's just that
The chicken was moist but lacked flavor the salmon was ok but really lacked any texture the tomatoes and gnocchi all blended together with the same texture of the salmon
Coming from Austin TX where modern mexican food is the best I was highly impressed
But then halfway through the dish I found the flavors began to lose their pop
While great proportions is generally appreciated sometimes it can very often do a dish more harm than good
Not only do they do Vietnamese cuisine great they also have a number of Chinese dishes that are delicious as well
The food is fantastic - delicious with generous servings
The food was good but we will never go back to either place not matter how cool the lights in the trees are
I would be willing to give this place another shot but to say the least I was not very impressed with it on this visit due to the lackluster food and high prices
The Kabobs Kubiedeh Barg the cuts of fillet and Chicken Kabob are all tasty and the daily dishes are all very authentic & tasty
The egg rolls are not good at either location by the way
He said it was very good but wanted to stop by and get fast food later
Overall the food was good but overpriced and the portions  were  small
Now I liked the waffle it was moist and buttery but the chicken while flavorfull was coated in something that made it rock hard
The pizzas were good but lacking the usual special touch
The server was friendly and efficient and though we waited a bit for our food they kept the hot bread coming which was quite tasty
The employee's have always been friendly the place is clean and the food is always hot and tasty
Our food came out very quickly I ordered the pollo fundido and I have to say I have been dreaming about it since so delicious
Haven't really tried much of the food calamari was pretty good and been told that their burgers are delish
Bring a good attitude to the table and you will be rewarded with top flight food and service
There are more choices of items beyond pizza here and the quality is as good as Bianco's
I'm all about super-healthy food that tastes amazing
The tempura shrimp rolls tasted good but had a rather thick tempura crust and had to much rice compared to the amount of shrimp
I like it because we don't have to commit to a full sit down experience but we can get pretty good food on the go
Thoroughly enjoyable but next time I would opt instead for a cheese fondue or the melted Raclette plate with cured meats which looked delicious
Some highlights include the omelet station where they will also make you sunny side up eggs or fresh scrambled eggs if you're like me and are kind of picky about eating eggs that aren't fresh the area where they do a lot of Mexican style breakfast food including mini breakfast burritos with chorizo and the pastry/baked good area
The spring rolls are good and authentic and the sauce is yummy
From the decor to the service to the delicious food to the sangria this was a perfect evening
I still prefer Zipps for the food but Half Moon has very good bar food too
The folks at Humble Pie know how to make very good pizza
The shredded beef in my chimichanga was wonderfully flavored light and very good
Fresh ingredients quality beef and cooked right
Our food was cold and made incorrectly for the most part
she doesn't like Southwestern food which is what our hotel concierge said it was
I was disappointed with the tacos taco bell style but the other dishes are tasty and like any small Mexican family restaurant nothing fancy in Mexico
Sam was amazing and explained the entire menu with recommendations to the most popular dishes including history and back stories on the dishes including info on the chef
There are SO many good things about this place  GOOD Brews one for every taste great specials on happy hour and food the food is amazing
I can't say it's the best steak you will ever have but for what it is it's consistently good service/food and it's convenient
They were all good and we agreed that the salsa was excellent and the meat very high quality but I was not blown away
Being from the East Coast it's extremely difficult to find good pizza here
I would love to comment on how good/bad their food was but I can't
The Italian beef is unbelievable and I've had a lot of good pastrami but here it melts in your mouth
Summary  Very nice place good food good ambience and just a tad out of the ordinary to be striking
It is hard to say that i would recommend this place maybe i would if I knew that person loved over seasoned food
Food was decent but wait staff was very good
I am not a food critic but the steak skillet was a bit bland but it looked really good
The food was delicious but nothing over the top
knowing full-well that the pizza would take a good 30-45 minutes to come out i knew i had  to have an appetizer
and we were pleasantly surprised at the flavors and intricacies of each simple dish
the simplest dishes were the best and most tasty
The food was excellent and the service was mostly good
The trail mixes in the bulk food area are tasty and the beer and wine is reasonably priced
I don't know how one person can possibly eat their appetizer and a main dish
The food had always been good and that has been maintained
Food was a little slow coming out but worth the wait
As wedding prices go it was definitely reasonable - no idea why the world thinks that in order to have a lovely wedding you need to drop oodles of loot - the Farm is a great option for nature lovers people missing trees grass etc great food amazing service and a memorable location for their wedding it was actually less expensive than 90% of the hotel/buffet options out thereFood there are three dining options at The Farm Quiescence fancy high end dining Morning Glory Cafe breakfast/brunch The Farm Kitchen - lunch I could write a novel here but overall the food is a little expensive lunch is usually $10-$15/person with drinks or if you want desert tack on an additional $3-5 bucks but it is very good plus you get the great ambiance of dining under trees on a picnic table or in their little courtyard area
The bartender recommended the chicken and poblano cheese crisp
I smoke pork and beef in my green egg at home so I'm a bit picky when it comes to BBQ and while this place has potential I'm not sure its worth $50 for 4
While the food was good and I have no major complaints I couldn't bring myself to give it the four stars so many other had considering I didn't feel any wow factor
The chicken was good perhaps even a bit too crunchy for my particular taste
Although I'm not a big fan of almond flavor I do like raspberry and ordered the Raspberry Almond Bar for dessert
I was very pleased with the food here and good drinks
The quality of sushi has taken a nose dive and the service is borderline abusive
and for not much money me and some buddies can plug our beer-filled guts with some greasy yet oh so delicious pizza
I thought it was an above average pizza but nothing that would have impressed Emeril
The dessert is really complemented with the sweetness and coldness of the vanilla ice cream
We then had the chicken the pork the Gaucho and the shrimp and shared them - all were very good
And being half Ethiopian I know quality Ethiopian food
The wait staff was good nothing that was absolutely amazing but they definitely did their job drinks food and ticket were all on time that's all that I wanted and expected
Grimaldi's is the most consistently amazing pizza place in Arizona
The pizza is always uber-fresh with crispy crust and amazing flavor
but to be honest even if the wait staff here was horrible I'd still give the place 5 stars because the pizza is that good
The drinks were SO good and there were a couple GREAT sushi standouts
beef sushi that was dipped in battered and fried - mildest/interesting in a good way flavor of all
calamari sushi - good flavor and the calamari was cooked perfectly5
the standard california roll - fresh and goodDrinksMuai Wowie - fruity and tastyWango Mango - fruity and tastyMilky Way - who doesn't want a chocolatey drink with a caramel rim
SO dangerously goodSo if you want a lively atmosphere with friendly waiters/hostesses and  really creative sushi and some drinks this is the place to go
The Eggs Benedict was perfect brioche french toast was like a dessert the dessert table had small portions of every bit of yummy sweet goodness you can imagine and everything in between was great I thought my husband was going to have to roll me out of there
and my boyfriend's Chicken parmigiana dish were SO heavily salted you could barely taste any distinct flavors
The food is delicious well prepared and comes in generous servings
The desserts are delicious and never disappoints us
Chino's  is very reasonably priced food packed with flavor
Even though I'm a meat eater I recommend their veggie quesadilla
It has burgers fish n' chips and even hot dogs on the menu
Drinks are limited to cans and bottles so getting you food to go and getting a drink at the adjacent circle K is recommended
The Chicken Curry was fall apart tender and the Galub Jamun was very tasty
It is really difficult to find good food in Phoenix
didn't see anything over $102 Food quality - a few notches above average and way above fast food chains3 Service - GREAT
Food was good too - mini tacos are tasty and come three to an order
At some point I will venture out and try one of their amazing burgers or pizzas which all look amazing
Fresh and Easy offers fantastic ready made dishes and other bake goods
I've been to Postinos in Arcadia several times and I always seem to forget how wonderful the food is
I went with the spicy hot and sour soup with prawns and oyster mushrooms and a fried catfish salad with mango green papaya cilantro and lime
I was blown away by the quality and presentation of the food
Their food is consistently delicious for a chain type American restaurant
The food is horribly boring and has no flavor
The Bruschetta is good if you're not afraid of garlic and the Antipasto Misto is a great dish to share
for 12 bucks they gave us 6 really good sized flaky puffs loaded with crab and lobster meat and this amazing sauce
When you eat the Crispy Risotto Croquettes alone - - it's not as good but if you eat it with a piece of meat - - it makes a very big difference
it's kind of bland by itself so the meat adds a good taste to it
I got over my original white-girl fear and smeared plenty of hot sauce on my chicken then dipped that goodness into the syrup and wrapped it all in a bit of waffle
I've eaten the hot brisket of beef sandwiches on onion rolls at Miracle Mile for over thirty years
I know the corned beef pastrami and egg salad are equally excellent but I order the brisket nearly every time
The beer is tasty and cold as it should be but the bar food didn't do it for me
The service is always good and it's a better place to drink than to eat even the desserts and appetizers are good just not an all-around contender for favorite bar and grill
I HIGHLY recommend the Chopped Salad & the duck if available but all the food is wonderful
The Pizza was extremely hot greasy and tasteless
The curry was some of the best I've had since coming to AZ and my dish had great spices and was delicious
Other dishes I recommend Calamari alligator Greek salad crawfish etoufee
Being a well-seasoned Indian food consumer I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for delicious authentic Indian cuisine
The salmon was very mild in flavor; however mixed with a little risotto was very warm and flavorful this dish would be a fall classic
Overall the service was great and the food while tasty wasn't spectacular or terribly distinguished
Way too much food for me but it was all good very seldom do I get pancakes that are not doughy and overly filling including my own kitchen I really liked these
The food may be good but I wouldn't know since this place asked me to wait for over two hours to be seated for a table for three
I'm not eating yet but the menu looks like cheesy southwestern food - good enough if I pound a few more salty dogs from the friendly bartender
The wait staff in the restaurant was very attentive and the food was very good although a little pricey
And the curried lobster spring rolls were so tasty
Came with 3 different hummusssessesss and was very tasty with our main dish We ordered the chicken plate which was Gi-normous a shrimp and pizza app
The good-not-great reasonably priced brunch food was totally betrayed by the most inept service of all time
My husband enjoyed his food I felt my own dish was lacking in sauce and it seemed a little dry in comparison to the sister restaurant at Arrowhead
The waiters knew the dishes and suggested excellent pairings for my wife
The food was very good we ordered all different kinds of rolls- california salmon rainbow crunchy
The chicken was delicious and I mean DELICIOUS
The enchilada sauce didn't bring out any flavor to the dish
For $20 I was expecting to eat excellent chicken
Rec'd only the appetizer & rice but neither of the 2 main dishes I'd ordered
The buffalo chicken sliders were delicious the bacon burger was dry and flavorless and the sweet potato fries were ehhhh and lacked some clear taste
It is good for drinks and service from the girl I mentioned all the rest of them seemed a little stand-offish
After the delicious breakfast i walked over to the chicken coop and thanked the chickens for my delicious breakfast as it would not have been possible without them
It's a little place on the corner that has limited seating and can take a bit longer than a fast food place but that's part of what goes into a good meal
I thought as a courtesy I would let him know that he had a food quality problem that his server confirmed
The clubs are twice that 1/4 lb and a good deal more filling but the sub roll is just insane
The meats are rather meh in quality and there's just nothing special going on anywhere near these sandwiches
If you're dining with children I definitely recommend the PB&J sushi rolls--a sweet treat with sophistication perfect for any tyke
Indian Delhi Palace has good food good service and an atmosphere that will embrace you like a vampire who feeds off of stress instead of blood
Food city has a Mexican deli and panaderia serving up everything from Mexican wedding cookies and cakes to really good spicy guacamole and ceviche
The only reason this place gets 2 stars instead of 1 is because I think their Baja chicken burrito is super tasty &  their Mango Salsa
The vibe is great and the food is worth the wait
Focus on the flavor of the food and be done with it
I couldn't decide between two dishes so I asked our server which he would recommend
Both dishes were delicious and I was so happy I didn't have to choose
Great customer service and pretty good food too
It tasted good it reminded me of the food on what I used to order from a Vietnamese restaurant from San Diego
I think the food is good at Kyoto too and the sushi is pretty decent
I'm not sure why Hertz thinks a Corolla is a mid-size car but considering it was just me traveling I welcomed the excellent fuel economy and new car smell
like i said service and food was good
Our food arrived quickly and smelled delicious
Something about that spicy just didn't click for me though I like spicy food I just felt it was not a good paring with the smooth mild goat cheese and mushroom
We ordered veggie spring rolls as an appetizer the Szechuan Flavored Beef the Thai Curry Chicken and the special Vietnamese Sriracha Noodles with Shrimp
All the dishes tasted ok - not remotely authentic duh but none of the flavors really stood out
It's dubious that food like this is worth the dinner prices but maybe I'll try it for lunch if I'm ever in the 'hood at the right time to see if there's more value
You can't have an Irish bar without fish & chips and theirs is pretty good - a large slab of lightly-battered fish which was more than enough for sharing served with a stack of crisp french fries
Pizza is good but not the best definitely not worth waiting hours for
The menu is varied and the food is good but not great
I will say that the eggrolls I got were very tasty but the pad thai left much to be desired
In most traditional Chinese restaurants low price = small portions and/or very poor quality food
1st course  I chose 'Appetizers From the Sea' because I love fish which came with Tuna Tataki Salmon Sashimi and Tai Usuzukuri
And my date chose 'Appetizers from the Farm' which entailed Kobe beef skewers Fillet Mignon wrapped Asparagus and Crispy Ji-Dori Chicken
My favorites from each yes we shared were the Salmon Tataki which had an amazing sauce Truffle Tamari Soy and the Kobe Beef Skewer black pepper sauce
I love chocolate so the Chocolate Volcano was decadently rich and wonderful in which I dipped the fresh Strawberries from the other dessert; YUM
It was a wonderful experience for us when we were just expecting to try a few different rolls and drinks
As much as the sushi bar looks enjoyable and fun; I wouldn't have traded that for such an excellent dining experience
Anyway I get lettuce chicken corn salsa stuff hot salsa and shredded cheese
My sister said she enjoyed her fish tartare appetizer
Overall good dishes but not across the board
let's start with the stew- though it was just beef and hominy the broth was so tasty and delicious
Consistently good food that isn't your run of the mill bar food
I was expecting good food but nothing to die for
Excellent food excellent atmosphere just a place that is well done and reminds of Something well done in CA where I grew up
Beyond that I know that when I flip on LPGA on television to watch the hottee Paula Creamer some Korean chick is depriving her of a victory and I am none too pleased but it does appear that they understand food
We order gyoza and egg roll appetizers
Egg rolls more typical to my expectations and very tasty - I'm optimistic
- California Rolls AOK - big mound of white rice perfect- pickled vegables tasty and interesting- sweet/sour vegetables tasty and interesting
2nd dad got bbq beef and it was very tasty not spicy much more moist
Majorly recommend in terms of fast-ish pizza
Their shredded beef and chicken tacos are excellent
If the pizza were not so good I would never go back
I try to go there to eat once per week since the food is so healthy and delicious and of course affordable
The fish tasted very fresh and the parsnip puree was enjoyed more by me than the lovely wife
It has a wonderful fresh almost tangy flavor that is complimented well by the creaminess the avocado brings to the dish
Which is essentially a sampler of grilled sea bass shrimp chicken beef and octopus all swimming and sizzling in a tasty tomatillo based sauce
All the meats were fresh tender and very flavorful
We also had the Tartufata pizza which was good but this time I was beyond irritated with the wait for everything
Long wait for drink order to be taken longer wait for appetizer/pizza order to be taken refills on water long extra long wait for drink orders etc etc There was seriously  a couple seated after us in the same seating area with a different wait staff that was served & left while we were still waiting for the check
Very disappointed in the service & deflated after a long day of work & spending 2 hours for an appetizer pizza & 2 beers is not the way I went to spend my evening
I came here at the recommendation of my friend he said it was the best sushi he had ever had I was skeptical to be sure
The california rolls are the same  as you'll find just  about everywhere that is filled with mayo and the vegas roll was good but way too crunchy almost burnt it  should have come out of the fryer about a minute earlier
25 and if Harvard is right you'll be dead in no time this despite it's deliciously marinated beef smothered in spicy tomatillo sauce
Don't get me wrong the pizza is very good
I ordered the Yakisoba Chicken and it was hot fresh and excellent
The dessert counter looked excellent as well with cheesecakes mousse is the plural of mousse also mousse
Finally an airport restaurant with good food and good service
When you can take your friends that eats meat and only full fat dairy products and they like it you know it's good
I strongly recommend a strolling date here
Jellyfish has virtually the same texture and taste as a seaweed saladAnkimo or Monkfish Pate It is essentially a sea foie gras and comes from a fish whose flavor is likened to lobster
It certainly has a lighter smoother flavor - but I prefer more fat and texture in my sushi
This is definitely a place for people who know and love good sushi and would highly recommend it
Not only for the quality of its dishes but the wonderful service
I had the Beef Pho which had a very nice broth once I added the requisite amount of chili sauce - personal preference with tasty meat and rice noodles
My friend had the chicken salad which was basically a salad topped with grilled chicken meat which was accompanied by a very tasty dressing
Good fresh simple Vietnamese food                  albeit overpriced
I am a loving thoughtful and caring husbandWe couldn't have asked for it to go any better especially for going by so soon after they openedThe chicken and waffles are every bit as good as the original location down on Yuma
I can't say enough about the quality of the food
We really enjoyed the dipping sauces that came with the spring rolls
I highly recommend going for the food happy hour
It's from 3pm - 630pm and includes $6 appetizers & $1 off all spring rolls
The sushi's not as good as it used to be and the help
The pizza is amazing the staff is wonderful and the wait is worth it if you haven't been there before or have only been there one or two times
In comparison we just had an AMAZING arti app at a long-standing local restaurant same name as a city in TX that starts with an H where it too costs $10 but was worth every penny because it was prepared & seasoned perfectly moist & meaty and actually made us feel as if we ate something in exchange for money
The selection was huge and the food was surprisingly good
Oh well that is OK if the food is good but the menu was much like a Taco Bell with very little variation tacos burritos chimichangas etc
I didn't expect much but the food came out lightning fast and it was very good
I enjoyed my roast beef sandwich and LOVED my coleslaw
Amazing yummy food delightful service and a great little place
prosgood pizzafancy  expensive but not outrageously expensiveclean interioroutside setting with heating lamps to add to setting
cute friendly and the most amazing food out there
It's a small independent restaurant with good food and nice people
Food came out relatively fast and the service was good
What happened to the chef that cooked the last time BBQ chicken pizza was okay but not as good as I remembered
Atlantic Roll salmon wrapped in rice and topped with tempura flakes and eel sauce was pretty good
The sushi is better than most in the area but not as good as Shogun on Tatum & Shea
The rolls are large and the ingredients are usually pretty fresh and good quality
The salads are pretty good especially the chef/cobb salad - loaded with chicken egg bacon avocado etc
The appetizers are decent with the exception of the Chicken Satay which is delicious
Well because Japanese Italian food is unique and wonderful in it's own way which CherryBlossom captures even down to the ambiance of sushi bar + reserved attempt at provenu00e7al styling
I wouldn't come here specifically for sushi due ONLY to a limited selection but they get some amazing yellowtail at CherryBlossom
The wait was totally worth it and the food had a quality higher than any other pizza joint I have visited
Good food like this fine Tricks take on an old standard needs to be given a medal
I was unhappy to read some of the reviews on this site given the quality of the food and overall business
No restaurant will ever be perfect but the quality and nutritional value of the food at Greekfest is superb and the people that give negative representations of the restaurant clearly have strong biases without good reason
Another person had a slice of pizza This is a great place to go if you're looking for good Italian food and fantastic pizza
For dessert we shared a creme brulee my hubby had the apple tart very delicious and our friend had the bread pudding also outstanding
It reminded me enough of Cali for the quality of fish I came back again the next day because I knew I would be leaving soon there after
The flavor profiles for the food were good the tempura whether as a side dish or within the rolls was crisp the salmon was excellent the quantity to quality ratio was good aside from having to wait for a check each time for a considerable amount I was quite happy with the results
I can say that both service and food quality were consistent SUB PAR
Amazing food in a very unexpected location
Food~ I've only been for lunch is Always Delicious price quality and quantity wise
For $65  you get a great four course meal a shot of good tequila and 3 nice wines to go with the  wonderful food
Definitely a brush of flavor to get your tastebuds rolling
The insight on making this roll was amazing
The food was really good once it all arrived and cooked to order
The food was nice and fresh and everything was good
The food is unique sort of like upscale campfire food and delicious
The food is delectable and comforting which is exactly what I love about a good hearty breakfast
The pizza was also good but again not worth the $16 it cost
I tried the dragon roll first and it was really spicy but tasty the white monster roll was forgettable I wouldn't recommend it  the baked lobster roll came last and was the best out of the three rolls we tried
The noodles were congealed into luke-warm mass of mush and the chicken was cold
The food we had was amazing and we will definitely be going back for more
They have a nice selection of cocktails and nice menu with salads pizzas and appetizers I think that they have sandwiches too but I usually skip over those
Food is always great and I have not ordered anything I have not enjoyed
If you enjoy laying by the pool working out in an amazing gym and eating good well-priced food THIS IS YOUR PLACE
Had another dish called Dragon Tails which was chicken stir fried in  a spicy almost buffalo style hot sauce
The food and drink are certainly acceptable but you'll never walk away from it saying Wow that was as good as any Starbucks I've ever been in
was excellent and fresh as was the curry chicken
But if i had to rate the quality of the fish
If you want pretty good sushi for a killer deal this is the place
If sushi isn't your thing they have a great tempura selection and large portions for hot dishes
The place is cozy and friendly laidback atmosphere with food that is a wonderful culinary experience
I enjoyed the roasted garlic in olive oil with the toasted baguette slices from the start menu though the nosh plate might need some work more types of cured meats and maybe some of those tiny dill pickles
They're busy every other night too simply because they're one of the hippest places around-a hot staff a huge wine selection a pretty patio wonderful food and pretty ambiance
This was the first time I tried that type of bruschetta my favorites are the White Bean with Chopped Tomato and Warm Artichoke Spread and I thought it was amazing-really sweet and it could even work for dessert
Seems like most businesses that serve food near the hotel close fairly early but Panda Express was open until 1000 p
I also asked for the String Bean Chicken which had an aromatic component that was delicious but that I couldn't quite place
--They prepare their chicken in-house and it tasted home made    --The cole slaw was really good and the salads fresh
good smoky tender-chewy balance just rightChicken Fried Steak special gravy kinda crazy looking but still goodBurgers delishOnce again everything was great
With that said Crazy Buffet here slips down to 4 Stars for right now but I'm certainly still a fan of this friendly comfortable place that serves up delicious food at a reasonable price and still including TEN kinds of ice cream
The Volcano Roll was delicious as well although I prefer the raw vs
It's the tang and sourness of the sauce that brings tons of flavor to the dish and this dish was seriously lacking it
They kept it simple with a sweet yet savory broth veg meat which was actually really good to my surprise and even a vegan fish sauce
It's pretty darn good food and it's an accurate representation of the kind of food that our part of the world loves best
I live in the adjacent apartment complex so I am there at least once every ten days and the quality of service and deliciousness of the food and drink are always exceptional
Apart from a woman dining alone we were the only ones there the food was delicious however much like the other reviews found here I too found fault with the price and the service
I even asked the waitress if it had been forgotten about; For a dish being categorized under appetizers it was strange that it finally came after all our tacos had arrived
For all the faults of the service it was more than compensated in food every taco we ordered was delicious
The quality of meat in each taco is very good and the variety here is unbeatable
I have been to several upper-tier mexican restaurants around the country and it is always interesting to see the ways in which the food and ambience is marketed in these particular instances because as many can agree mexican food is not a type of food that is necessarily perceived as exotic and therefore worth charging extra for
The galettes appetizer was very nice the shrimp cocktail was ok and the desserts we shared were delicious
The quality of the burger was good however it normally comes with two patties of meat which I do not care for
They are a little pricey but hey good food always is unless you cook it your self
Nice du00e9cor decent service OK food Good prices for a resort  Service
Nonetheless the food is amazing well priced and offers a welcome treat to a veggie-lover's tummy
I know a good pancake when I try one since pancakes are one of my favorite foods to eat
Second is meat and they use top quality Boar's Head meat
They carry a number of special items in addition to standard fare such as Poore Brothers chips specialty sodas and Swedish goodies
The food is also tasty with half-price appetizers from 3-7 daily I love their crab cakes and jalapeno and bacon flatbread pizza
Relatives from NJ just departed after a family wedding; last Thursday one of them had a yen for pizza a food I normally would not recommend they order away from home because the quality would be dicey at best
The Jerseyites were not disappointed and in fact they proclaimed the pizza to be excellent and delicious
Decor is typical pizza joint restaurant-red and white checkered tablecloths simple furniture for their tables and chairs some black and white photos on the wall
I really enjoyed this dish in fact this is the best dish I had and will order it again
I've had their fried chicken a few times when my friends got take out and i really enjoyed it
it has a good flavor/combination of spices and the chicken is juicy
I've been trying to find a good chicken and waffles place
In the past I really enjoyed Rosco's Chicken and Waffles in southern CA and Big Mama's Chicken and Waffles in Dallas and other places all over
There were def good the waffle and the sweet tea and not as good points the size of the chicken pieces
I was craving for Italian food the other day and what's better version of Italian than having a perfectly good spaghetti
This food has been my most favorite since my sis in law always took me to this place and order the linguine de mare seafood spaghetti that has the black mussels clams squids and delicious spicy marinara sauce
I mean the employees are friendly the food is made to order so it's fresh you have the freedom to basically make your own burger and the egg bread that my burger came on was really good which is all great but for a college kid who's got to be financially responsible better overall value can be found someplace else
However the food was good not great but good
Both pasta dishes were out of this world and the pizza's were tasty and above average
It doesn't surprise me in the least that it has been the hot spot for fish-n-chips in the east valley
The best fish-n-chip communal are few and far between but I would recommend Knock Kneed Lobster or Papa Joe's Fish-N-Que
I am writing this update soley based on the feeling one gets when going to Spitfire Grill the food and drinks are always good
I really like the Capital Grille because even though the focus is on higher end meat and seafood the vegetarian options are particularly good which is hard to come by at most restaurants in the same category
There are buttery roasted mushrooms covered in garlic & rosemary & thyme grilled asparagus sauteed spinach and roasted tomatoes that add a wonderful sweetness and acidity to the dish
The chef/waiter/owner did an excellent job of providing excellent service and amazing food
The portion of fish was very large and so amazingly delicious
**Afterthought**Don't let the less than good reviews about their sushi drive you away
The food is usually pretty good and there's quite a bit to choose from but sometimes I've been disappointed on the food more than once which is the crux of the problem
If I could make one recommendation to management here it would be to improve their consistency on the food a bit
However on the plus side the garlic naan and the chicken tikka masala were delicious and the chicken tandoori wasn't bad
Say good bye to those greasy drive-thru burgers and say hello to some down home soul food lovin' at the new location of Lolo's Chicken and Waffles
Ordering the Lolo's Soul Food Platter $13 is all about eating way too much way too late but with food this good I wouldn't order anything else
Dinner here just isn't complete without ordering you a hot buttery waffle $4 to accompany your fried chicken
Homemade chicken sausage looked delicious but was nearly flavorless and seriously I think I could get a more moist piece of chicken cooking it in the microwave
This place had amazing food for reasonable prices
We ordered the spinach salad and added shrimp which were basically huge grilled prawns which was delicious and then a simple small pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms
Service was a bit slow both times I was there but that is easily overlooked as the sushi was so good and the fish was so fresh
These are wonderful frozen dishes that make a great healthy quick and affordable midweek meal
I will definitely give this place another shot because the atmosphere was great a lot of TVs for watching sports and a good crowd and I think the food has potential when it's not as slammed
Just the right amounts of ingredients making it one light and delicious dessert
Not because the fish quality is amazing or the rolls are great but because it goes everything well
Unlike some other AYCE places I am not afraid to try things on the menu here and venture out and I am a bit of a fish snob and won't do that unless i feel comfortable with the level of quality at a place
Our food came within the quoted 45 minute timeframe but it was cold when we got it
One of my favorite places to go for good subs italian cured meats and antipasto
Back to the subs tho - great crusty loaves high quality meats and made in true italian deli fashion
Every single place out here that I have tried other than PF Changs uses low quality meat large amounts of MSG and overall is disappointing in every aspect
My personal recommendation is to get the Chicken Chow Fun
The sushi is consistently good and they have a great selection
Very very personable staff-amazing food and will do special meals like vegan and gluten free
If you're looking for good Asian food in Arizona this is as good as it gets
During lunch time before 230pm they have these amazing specials which help me afford a sushi lunch several times a week
This usually puts our sushi lunches at $14 together -- making lunch super affordable and always delicious
Overall Shogun isn't amazingly different but their sushi is good
The dishes themselves were quite delicious unlike anything else in Phoenix at least in the East Valley
The dish itself has a slight kick to it with some dried red chili peppers in it and contained a good helping of veggies and beef
Overall my experience at this restaurant was pleasurable and I'd recommend it to anyone else looking to try a more authentic less represented style of Chinese food here in the Valley
Mind you the chicken kebabs cost more than the vegetable ones but I figured getting my money back would be more hassle than it's worth
My beans go cold as I patiently wait the return of my food and pita for which to eat said beans
Given our tiny waistlines and the generally enormous servings at Italian restaurants my two friends and I elected to split a pasta entree butternut squash ravioli an appetizer a hard cheese and sour cherries dish and bread
The food was definitely high quality but honestly nothing to rave about
Carl's Junior is one of those good fast food places you don't find east of the Mississippi
We would recommend any of the burgers but also the Chicken Strips
My favorite dishes  the calamari appetizer the calamari linguini and the sausage and bell peppers
we decided to order two dishes and an appetizer to share
Little did we know the provolone fondue our appetizer came in hugeee portion getting us full before our main dishes came out haha But of course this didnt stop us for digging in
So simple and unhealthy yet so good   The food always comes out hot and fresh and appears to have some older Mexican female at least running the show in the kitchen
Service  Well I've always gotten pretty good service they can be slow on the bill and sometimes they disappear but in general I order get my drinks get my food and that's about all
Food  It's AWESOME it's HOT it's NEW MEXICAN Chili's
I think that their Italian Sub is way over rated and lacks having a good amount of what I consider to be the quality Italian Meats
I was stuck in Phoenix last week and decided to partake of some sushi and it just happened that handily across the way from my poor hotel was this great little sushi bar I wish I had tried it earlier in the week  as i probably would have hung out there every night
historically the food has been great the service has been friendly and the beer has been cold
and were able to speak with Chef Bray about his recommendations for fish
Definitely recommend Roy's for seafood that is excellently prepared
The roast beef sandwich is pretty good but not quite as good as the Wildflower roast beef sandwich my opinion
The serve THE best waffles the fried chicken was very flavorful crispy and not greasy YUM
burger chicken sandwich hotdog veggie burger etc
The Lodge has what every one is looking for in a bar in Scottsdale - good bar food sports on the TV's comfy booths a pool table unassuming interior etc
The amazing odor of the cooking food hits you from the parking lot
WORD TO NON-MEAT EATERSTry their veggie burger thingy - with mushrooms peppers and such all heaped between two soft and delicious pieces of bun
They will make modifications for you; if you can convince them you can handle it they'll even make a dish Thai-hot for you
Oh so tasty with excellent vegetarian and vegan dishes that can taste better than the original meaty versions
The no harm chicken parm was excellent with perfectly crisp breaded seasoning flavorful tomato sauce vegan cheese that was a very close texture to mozzarella on a soft fresh bun
While I'm not exactly a vegetarian I have friends that are vegetarian and vegan and I do appreciate good food when I taste it and will definitely go here again to try more dishes
the chicken was tasty and the tacos are pretty decently portioned
there was definitely some pleasing flavors but were made unenjoyable by overcooked dry meat
But if you dare to go to to the dark side of good old fashioned Italian-American cusine you'll find yourself as I did searching for more out of your local pizza shop
During the wait enjoyed the atmosphere of live music artwork and watching the delicious dishes come out
We ordered the large chicken lahvosh which was HUGE and tasted amazing
The food was damn good don't get me wrong but this place may be more of an indulgence than a regular pitstop
Just worth keeping in mind for friends who have red meat restrictions
If you give a dish a name like chimichurri and the person who tries it has never try it before it might be really good
fish was quite good tasting and lightly breaded
We sat at the bar and took the staff's recommendations on drinks and food
The food is still great the decor has improved and it's still a wonderful hole-in-the-wall type of joint that you can slide into whenever the craving hits
Price increase or not it's still one of the cheapest options out there and definitely good food
The food looked just as good as it tasted
The carne asada is so so so good the chile relleno burrito is AWESOME and I believe it's veggie-friendly for you vegetarian folks out there their fish tacos are delicious
I wasn't expecting this food to be bursting with flavor and just out of sight delicious
I was expecting it to be good average Chinese food
The Hunan beef was nasty it was dry and cold and it wasn't spicy at all
For an appetizer we got this wierd Sushi Cake
The best thing about Trader Joe's is that you can get consistently healthy good food for reasonable prices
All the food I've experienced was excellent but now I stick to the half order of biscuits and gravy with 2 eggs that's more than enough
It is a little more expensive than your typical breakfast place but the quality of the food and service makes it worth your while
I had the salmon teriyaki lunch bento box $13 that included an oriental sauced side mix green saladsteamed riceone large tempura shrimp and tempura vegetables two big pieces of sweet potato one zucchinione onion ring My salmon was tasty and a perfect size for lunchnot only did I get all that food I mentioned but my salmon was on top of pan seared mixed vegetables including baby bok choy
Prices are reasonable and the food is always good
In addition to good food Four Peaks has great beer and drinks
came out and insisted that his food was good
It is a shame because the first two times I ate at Sens the food was delicious
However the hallmark of a good restaurant is that the food is good every time
The pork ribs were a little smoky for me but were meaty and well cooked and the glaze was tasty
The butterfish was tasty and had good texture
Manhattan has a great sauce so the eggplant rollotini I first ordered was absolutely delicious
Now the food portion of the review the other guests that I have been with said there food was delicious it looked to be really good
Well in the end this place is decent the prices are a little high but the food is good and you get your monies worth
I'm from SF so I'm coming from a place with really good chinese food
Took our order shortly thereafter then after asking whether we were ready for the good times to roll The table was adorned with plates a many
But the food is just as delicious as before and the service just as friendly
It was wonderfully authentic rice noodles generously bathed in a thick savory annatto-hued shrimp sauce with tender shrimp crunchy bits of crushed chicharon pork rinds and flakes of tinapa smoked fish -- Filipino comfort food like no other
The meal reminded me of the scene in the Disney movie Ratatouille where the food critic took a bite of the food and was immediately transported to his mother's table when he was a child eating her delicious cooking
served by friendly folk; a good number of dishes to choose from; good prices very informal atmosphere even a patio for alfresco dining
What I got was a good hot pocket full of chicken and some sauce
AMAZING service chris food and ambiance
Our food was fresh and tasty and the service fast and friendly
The first time we went there it was for happy hour and the service was terrible but the food was good so we figured we would try it again
It's about the little things you do each and every day and spending $$ at a place like this when you could easily go elsewhere to corporate iconic wastelands ala Sprawlmart then you understand that buying groceries from a place like this isn't just about the delicious food you put on the table or the convenience in how it got there
I want to give it 1 stars but I give them 2 because 1 is really saved for the terrible places and besides they were able to prepare the food relatively quick *for better or for worse*  Also it's probably because I'm in a good mood because we have inflight wifi
The chicken quesadilla was really good grilled crispy and not oily at all
I'm also quite impressed with how easy the process of ordering food from delivery places was
The omelet was quite delicious though I would say the chicken was a little on the dry side--not terribly so but enough to notice it
The flavor was good but the infrastructure of  pizza  was poor
I was also impressed with the layout and condition of the live/frozen seafood section
We took them up on the offer and sure enough the food was excellent the second time around
If you're in the area and feel like the food isn't as important as the presentation - give this place a shot
The first time I ate here I have to admit I was shocked by the quality of the food
The hot sandwiches are the best and stacked with meat so they actually fill you up as opposed to a Subway
Well now that I have I have to say that Flavors Of India is the best Indian Food in Phoenix bar none
First off when you walk into an ethnic food restaurant and the place is filled with people of the same ethnicity and the place is really quiet because everyone is busy enjoying their food you know it's a good place to eat
The service is top notch the food is excellent and the best part of the dining experience is the Bollywood music videos playing on the flat screen
We ordered the chocolate cream pie $6 for dessert and it was very good
Also why can't a restaurant that carries a limited and expensive menu specializing in burgers Zin Delux serve higher quality beef
Food was excellent - I had the Island Eggs Benedict but I'm fo sho any breakfast is good
Altogether you could probably make a meal out of these papusas which are a pretty good post bar food if you ask me but then you would be cheating yourself out of more food
The thin crust pizza is good and if that's all you need then this is a good place to go
We tried a decent representation of the menu and concluded that only their chicken was even remotely worthwhile
Bottom line if you are impressed with bar food and like to be constantly distracted during the movie in an office like setting this is the place for you
The pizza is really freaking good and what's even better is that it reheats super well
The Food Both times the food has been delicious
this place is not built very well they are constantly having blackouts and they do not compensate for lost food or anything however one time they did put us up at a hotel
Not only is food good but they have a nice cocktail menu and they are known to fill their drinks to the tip top
I have had some really good Thai food in the past so I have relatively high standards
The duck itself was cooked more than I would have preferred but the skin was crispy and the meat was very tender and flavorful
Great authentic New Mexican style Mexican food available with three levels of Hatch chile spice mild green hot green and red chile
Prices are very reasonable for the quality and amount of food
When our food arrived I was delighted by the tender flavorful piece of beef
Though they were the only kids there they thoroughly enjoyed the Kobe beef burgers
The fish taco was good but mine wasn't to die for
The meat was soooo good the shrimp puffs were amazing
I feel sad that the place was not busy but I kind of understand it with the weather being so hot hot soup is not what one craves but once we were inside the place is cool and the food which is the most important thing was excellent
I did like the food but it was not worth the hassle to get it
What I've found is that the food is pretty good but really over priced and they make horrible coffee & chai iced drinks
Love their gyros koobideh  which is like a ground beef patties - delicious- only shaped as a kabob  their eggplant dip all have been great
It's open 24 hours and has tasty inexpensive food
Sushi isn't raw fish it's a vinegared rice prepared in a specific manner to achieve perfect texture and flavor
If you want real sushi Hiro in Scottsdale Shiro in PV + multiple other venues some I've yet to try but are getting good reports
My opinion of Authentic is that the FOOD tastes like you are in Puerto Nuevo Cancun Mexico City and the flavor and smell is something you remember
The service here was super quick and the dishes were delicious
I highly recommend this place especially when you are with large group of friends because they have a large variation of flavors and ice-cream-like desserts
Food was very good i liked the spicy asiago chicken could have been spicier
However I have been here 3 times with my family and every time the Kung-food and the service here has been no less than amazing
The quality of food is always consistent each time and is by far the best that I have tasted in Phoenix
They generally aren't super packed which is confusing given the quality of the food here although they do have a lot of business on the take out side
Prices are decent all around which is also a plus given the quality of the food
Overall I enjoyed my lunch there and even though I know the food isn't great quality it's not too bad once in a while
It would appear that they have good food but the execution was the problem
There once was a Nader that craved delicious food one Saturday morning
Excited he rushed back to the table and filled his cheeks with all the wonderful dishes making sure to save some of the curry for the naan
The curry was wonderful and actually a little bit spicy with bone-in pieces of chicken for enormous amounts of flavor
They stop serving food after 700 their food menu consists of either a hot dog or nachos
I really would like a stuffed pepperoni pizza  sandwiches and pasta are very good too  lets not forget the salads
Thought that was poor planning being a holiday weekend and a saturday afternoon but nonetheless the food wass fresh and good
The sambar could have been a little thicker and was hoping for the food to be a little hotter temperature related
But those places suck anyway so it's totally worth paying a little more for better food and better ambiance
The originality of the dishes are platitudinous however there was some fresh and delicious qualities
The bruschetta flight was decent every place feels the need to put bruschetta on something that has the texture of a stale pretzel but its so much better on a piece of lightly toasted bread like sourdough and the risotto had good flavor but the shrimp inside the dish were puny
Our ticket included a great buffett but we were inadvertedly told that our ticket included the hot dog/brat roast another event they have there  Instead of the steak and chicken we were given a little box with a hot dog or brat to roast on the fire  a packet to make a S'more and a bag of chips
The food was excellent and our only complaint is they brought our appetizer out with our main dishes
It's a good place to take someone who hasn't ever really tried sushi before or people who are scared of sushi
The food was a light meal appetizer barbecue sliders and dessert
This place is way too expensive for the quality of food you get when compared to any of the Greek restaurants around Phoenix
The upside to this somewhat expensive lunch was the food was very good
The service was just fine and the food was good but theres really nothing about this place that moves the mark for me
The bad news the few food items are not so good
They do not offer to warm them for you instead you are handed a cold meat and cheese brioche when you ask you are directed to a microwave out in the dining area
I also ordered a tamale which I normally do when I visit a new Mexican food restaurant to gauge their quality
Tottie Rolls are fantastic and one of the highlights of the menu with a variety of flavors and textures in on delectable package
The neighbors to the left ordered the Lobster Tacos and flatbread pizza both  looked very delicious
Positives good custards I got the last steamer of four har gow shrimp-and-cilantro/ green filled dumplings claimed at 1230pm no more food was scheduled for preparation after that
It allowed them to get a good idea of how spicy their food would be
Couldn't find any decent sit down restaurants but they have some nice fast food style places for hot dogs and cinnabons and such
They had plenty of delicious pizza options
She recommended the pepperoni pizza but that I add olives on top
In addition to a tremendous pizza recommendation our waitress was constantly refilling our drinks and checked in multiple times
Chicago style thin pizza no deep dish that is very very good
Then it took another 15-20 minutes for us to get our bar food carnitas cheese crisp jalapeno poppers and southwestern bruschetta and when it finally came it was all cold
Having worked in many restaurants I know that one of the main rules of good service is that someone should take food out as soon as it's ready so that it doesn't get cold and that as a server I was responsible for doing so even if the food wasn't for my table
The third negative was that most of the food was not good at all
None of the food items was more than $5 but I have been to *many* other happy hours where you can get solid flavorful appetizers for between $2 - $5
The other reviews are pretty much dead-on good food great price dated decor
I am a little reluctant to search for a good Chinese food restaurant here in Arizona but I couldn't resist the 30% grand opening deal on dishes I haven't had in a while and crave
Food was decent and good price with the 30% off
I had the cold salt and garlic chicken squid with black bean sauce and the seafood tofu hot pot
The prices are good for what you all get but the quality of the food was terrible
I would go to Kai just for the bar but then I'd know the good food I'm missing out on in the next room
I actually liked all the seeds incorporated with my food really gave it a unique flavor and texture that I still remember
The espresso rubbed fillet and the fish were both good but not the reason to go
Food A surprisingly diverse and wonderful selection of food to please the meatless palate
As far as food goes I've only tried the egg and cheese sandwich and it was a delicious breakfast indeed
You know those places where the food is so damn good IE Breakfast Club that the long wait is worth it
As far as the food goes it's not 5 star gourmet fair but they make an excellent burger and the garlic fries are out of this world
I love Baja Fresh soooo much more where the food is not only hot--mine being cold from here not the meat but the beans and rice were cold--but so much tastier
I really hate the cold bland food served here and am just scratching my head how anyone--other than those who have never had great Mexican--could even like it
Back to Baja Fresh for me  hot food cooked just for me and good sauces not some Tabasco bottles sitting around
I heard a nice looking man in his early 60's talking to his wife and grandkids next to my table about how wonderful the food is as usual
This review is for food-  On recommendation from the waitress my dinning partner ordered the nutter sandwich I went for the grilled cheese and we started with the wings
The shredded beef was actually quite good
The sushi was good I had the shimogamo and Vegas roll hamachi and creamy hotate
They had a Kobe beef roll and a delicious looking okonomiyaki that was served at the other table
I've watched sushi chefs my whole life really really good ones Japanese born and bred through all the rigor and tests
AMAZING food I've never had caviar or oysters and I killed two birds with one stone and did it at mabels-okay so maybe they were kind of and introduction and may not count as actually having them but they were so freaking good
We also shared the salad and burger-which btw came on an english muffin and for us ladies looking for new food tricks to conserve calories for our drinks what a brilliant and tasty decision
Thanks to Yelper recommendations we added the mac&cheese side dish
I found the prices very reasonable for the portions and the quality of the food
A good example is Durant's when you make a reservation they always ask if you're celebrating anything and if you are Durant's is kind enough to provide a comped dessert of their choosing
A casual and comfortable atmosphere with awesome food and good priced wines
Try the Julia Child's  Beef Bourguignon a Saturday night Specialty that is Hearty and absolutely delicious
I'm not very adventurous I always get har gow steamed shrimp in a delicate rice skin wrapper char siew bao steamed buns filled with very tender tasty BBQ pork cubes cooked greens in light brown gravy I think they are Chinese broccoli or rapeseed look like long thin stalks of broccoli very fresh and green shu mai dainty dumplings filled with chopped meat and a bit of carrot and stir-fry vermicelli semolina-type not rice noodles
My spicy friend has tried most everything else says these dishes are good short spare ribs fried turnip/ radish squares lean sliver-sliced pork crispy spring rolls flavored riced with minced meat and vegetables under glass bowl tripe bowl rice wrapped in a big leaf and sweet custard mini-pastries
Pass on the coconut-flavored gelatin dessert hot dog wrapped in light  pastry note that most kids like that one and chicken feet
For equally tasty shishito peppers you can get way more peppers for $7 at Roka Akor or RA Sushi
While I enjoyed most of the dishes and the atmosphere I felt that their dishes are overpriced
Overall I liked the owner's optimistic approach to the food and the food's fresh quality
If that is a health-diet need one could enjoy a meal there but for tasting good indian food- this is JUST NOT THE PLACE
It was a gentle meaty broth piping hot with potatoes and fatty meat
The food from the take-out section didn't look too good
I was told the portions were a good size so why would I even think about ordering more food especially when this is my very first time ordering from this place
hmm Indian food sounds good tonight well I am in luck Indian Paradise is but a mere hop skip & a jump jump so off we go
Both were lamb dishes and both were very good
AND the food is good life is pleasant -
The beef is high quality so the taste was good and we didn't complain
The chicken fried rice was prepared first I ate it when given to me so I could eat it hot
Being a huge fan of Chicago and the cuisine it creates I'm always on the prowl for a good Chicago style pizza or hot dog
My date's chicken and pasta was spicy but not overwhelming - subtle flavors playing out nicely together
The portions were large enough that I couldn't even think about dessert and was so glad we passed on an appetizer
It's hard to make a corndog anything truly special but the dog tasted like a good beef dog and the corn tasted right
The bar food is excellent - predominately gastro-pub
I think that most of the reviewers with 5 star rating are too embarrassed to admit they paid a hundred dollars or more for Coco's quality seafood
I've heard they have good beer but what I'm reviewing now is their food
And their 'appetizer' food is pretty darn amazing
Although expensive as chain food goesI can heartily recommend their pub tips beef in a nice thick brown sauce with mash potatoes
The fish cod was perfectly cooked and the batter was flavorful
My food was nice and hot when it came and nice and gone soon after
However there are a few independent concession stands where you can buy food items such as indian fry bread fried noodles and other goodies
Elements is truly one of the Valley's fine dining gems thanks to the amazing food from Chef Beau MacMillan and the spectacular setting
To start they brought us rolls with hummus dip that were so good I was afraid I'd fill up on that alone
Oh yeah and you can get some amazing mexican food from a restaurant you might not have heard of but is kind of a big deal Gallo Blanco
The chef was funny the food was pretty good
Each teppanyaki meal came with rice veggies the meat you chose a shrimp appetizer and a sorbet dessert
The California Hand-roll was pretty good it's pretty basic and easy enough and it really didn't disappoint
Nonetheless the tasty food and gracious service are essential in predicting future success
That place is constantly busy and when you see alot of Asians eat there you know the food is good and authentic
I have eaten here about 25 times and I have never had a bad experience or anything short of excellent service and great food
I like when you order the veggies pho and they always ask whether or not you want the veggie broth - that is always a good feeling when you don't eat meat or dairy
They have other vegan dishes as well but I have yet to try them because the veggies pho is so darn good #16 on the lunch menu
Beer is good good with food I ate and drank so much I almost pooed
Tasty bean pupusas made with rice flour instead of wheat scrumptious and moist chicken tamales and delicious fried plantains for dessert
My wife and I have eaten a few time here now and St Francis has consistently served incredibly delicious food every time
Those are the only hot foods I've had here
The only negative things I read were about no substitutions and I don't think that really reflects on the quality of the food so we headed inside
I tried my bf's spring roll and it was very fresh and hot
The honey chicken was also good but didn't have the same pop of flavor as the orange
Beer was as good as ever but not enough to overcome the disapointing food
The food is nice with a beach theme to their salads burgers tacos and other goodies
Their Northshore tacos are pretty good too with their marinated shredded chicken but better if you get a side of sour cream
The food was really fantastic - tender spinach whole cloves of garlic tasty cheese and salsas spicy enough to make this Midwestern gal cough in a good way
The place has a few kinks to work out but I assume that the amazing food will keep people coming back for seconds and thirds and
The cost was just about $45 which for the quality of food seemed to be over the top
It starts with an excellent crusty artisanal roll piled high with just the right proportion of mild roasted chicken and salty prosciutto
Food The steak quality was very good but I have had many more filets elsewhere Gibson's Chicago that have given me much more flavor
The pizzas are definitely worth waiting for
Let me just say for someone who could care less about pizza I would definitely come back again in 2 weeks for these pizzas accompany with their delicious Italian wine collection
The food is delicious the drinks are yummy and the scene is ferosh
Everyone enjoyed their dishes to the point it was a little embarrassing because we did everything to the plate but pick it up and lick the death out of it
He had been raving about the food for some time and I figured it's a Friday and I have not yet tried it so I will give it a shot
The burger is ok the wrap is ok the philly cheese rolls were ok but the wings were good
What's going to give Harry Morton his big tax writeoff is the quality of the food and drink or lack thereof and the music was so loud during both visits I couldn't carry on a conversation with my dinner companions
An improvement in quality of food and atmosphere is going to be necessary to keep this thing alive after the novelty goes away
It doesn't look like much from the outside and without knowing of Green you probably wouldn't do a second take upon passing it however the food here is no less than amazing
but by far my favorite is the BBQ 'Chicken' sandwich along with an appetizer of the spicy buffalo wings
I've 'forced' many of my meat eating friends to try Green and they have all become believers if you could call sharing something so wonderful forcing
She was top notch the food was good she cranked out one hell of an avocado boba
I am talking tons of shit to my co workers about how I love vietnamese food and that you just cant get a good nuoc mia ninh kieu in Phoenix obviously trying to be a food badass cuz I am and Pho Avina goes and sucker kicks my shit in the ballz
If you aren't starving you can get a good sized chicken and rice dish by ordering the Kids portion and it's only $3
I think it's amazing that we have such a great seafood place in the middle of the desert
I've had several dishes and they have all been  excellent
At the time I didn't know if I really enjoyed the food or I just really enjoyed that I was eating it under the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City
The food is fantastic I recommend the Cajun Chicken pasty the servers are really hip and awesome the kitchen is open for you to see how your food is being made and the prices are fair
Just such a awesome atmosphere for small groups or a date and really good food with a very nice beer list
I haven't tried anything else because the above appetizers and ribs are too much food for me
The food is also pretty tasty here too
As I write this I feel myself salivating as I envision a steamy hot plate filled with pieces of tender chicken and hummus and pita bread
I had the roasted chicken which was absolutely delicious and my husband had the hanger steak which he loved as well
The ingredients were fresh and put together to create tasty comforting food
Food is delicious and prices are reasonable
I had the Mega Roast Beef sandwich and the Greek Wrap on two different days and both were amazingly delicious
For the quality of food you get the price is really great
and just the right amount of flavorful gyro meat/veggies
I don't know why but the good Rosati's I have been to are under rosatispizza
We received the extra chicken and it was hot chicken
When this place first opened I was very impressed with the quality of their food but lately I  have felt let down
The curry chicken is a very mild curry and is packed with flavor
Most people's stomachs churn when they think of eating raw beef but it's actually pretty good
I think it would be a bit better if they used a higher quality cut of beef but it was still pretty good
The curry is amazing with rice or with roti - and it's good cuts of chicken a mix or brown and white - not leftover parts you get in other similar inexpensive places
The fish was really good and nice presentation with chunks of avocado and mandarin orange salsa on top
If you want good food and great customer service give them a try
The menu looked good-  Mike recommended the fish & chips which are a favorite of mine but I was leaning toward the crab reuben
When they deliver my order is always right and the food is steaming hot
For starters my husband ordered the chicken curry pastry puffs which were really good he said
He ordered Falooda which is this funky rose-flavored milk icecream tapioca bread pudding and jello strips all mixed into a sundae dish It's quite the acquired taste -- although I like it
Okay and now there is the delicious food
It is a great deal and the food is quality and fabulous
I was pleasantly surprised at the taste and quality of the fish and rolls
The prices in this restaurant were middle of the road but the staff and the fish made it a good value
The bun was a tasty wheat bread and the meat was of great quality good texture and great flavor
The brisket is great the pork is pulled perfectly and all the meats are tender juicy and flavorful
Meat loaf with mashed potato and mushroom gravy Sounded good was not good
The meat loaf had no discerning quality at all so who knows if it was meat or tofu
So to say I enjoyed the food would be an untruth
I think the wine selection is less but the food choices are slightly expanded and the quality is wonderful
***Their dishes taste delicious and homely-authentic
Service has gotten consistently better and the food has stayed very consistently good
The food was really good but it was missing something
Louis ribs were much bigger   While I enjoyed their sauce the meat was rather tasteless
No the meat did not taste bad or anything but there was no flavor like you find at Honey Bears or the famous BBQ places in the country
Their cornbread was really good and the only side dish that really set them apart
My chicken was moist and extremely flavorful - real flavorful not the we-added-fake-smoke-flavoring-to-the-store-bought-barbeque-sauce-we-slopped-all-over-your-chicken flavor
Bandera's food was deliciously memorable
Emerald Chicken-- a nice bright clean flavor with cilantro my favorite
Rolling Hills is great when you want a short easy course with interesting terrain good views and noisy zoo animals
If you don't want a real serious round just want to practice your short game you will encounter some interesting chip shots and just want to stay close by Rolling Hills might be a good option for you
The food was really good but he found a screw yes piece of hardware in his rice
I'd go back because the food was good and the staff responded well to such a weird incident
Yes this can be accurately described as a less refined Sweet Tomatoes; but the food in my opinion is quite delicious nonetheless
Don't go to Pepin for the food and I'm not saying that because of a lack of Spanish authenticity; it just doesn't taste good ever
It's fun to look out onto Vista Del Camino Park at the passers by as you nibble on your food and sip your ice cold beer
How I hate to be one of those people who downs this place but I thought it was waaaay overpriced for the quality of food
This is my go-to place for a Margarita and good Mexi food within biking/walking distance
The food was above average Mexican lacking the spiciness of other spots but more than making up with the quality ingredients
The place is good but the food was not very unique the ambiance is not - well anything and the service was barely average
Bang for the Buck 2/5- I believe there are better places in Phx that have more creative dishes just as high quality food and good service
Food Quality 5/5- very good quality
everything we had was excellentFood Quantity 3/5- maybe a bit under average portions for the price though it is a resort so they are taking advantage of that I'm sure
Food Flavor 5/5- they do very well in this area
But I was let down and ultimately embarrassed because the food just didn't taste good
The meat used in the soprasetta had a flavor neither of us liked
The food arrived quickly The burger was really tasty and great quality
Amazingly all of the food came out to the table at the same time
We had a table full of food getting cold as we started on our soup
As for the food the french onion soups we had were actually quite good
My lemon artichoke chicken was also good but my husband's grilled meatloaf while he enjoyed it tasted more like Italian sausage
They are all amazing to look at but the food is overpriced and frankly mediocre
The food was amazing and I will definitely be back when in the mood for some French cuisine or even just for some wine and desserts
There were three kinds of soup lots of salad goodies really good chicken tenders pork ribs & lots of other things plus a big dessert selection
I had their fish dish with potatoes and spanish chorizo - I enjoyed every bite
I wish we had enough room for dessert because all of them looked amazing
Its a good place for lunch but not the best pizza in town
The goodGreat service friendly staffTasty well cooked pizza crust sauce & ingredientsGood variety of pizza toppingsDelish saladThe badSkimpy on the pizza toppingsI got a no-cheese pizza with red pizza sauce basil broccoli crimini mushrooms & tomato
The pizza was cooked well and the crust was crunch crispy & tasty they've got it down
The pizza is very good but not quite as good as I expected and the price is a little steep in my opinion but not too bad
As a soup fan I was pleased with the heartiness texture and taste of the white bean and chorizo soup I had for dinner following a ground beef empanada good and some coconut shrimp ok; I've yet to have great coconut shrimp anywhere in the desert
Fry's has always been a good deal in the food department
I recommend Pizza A Metro especially for a date
Also had the coconut chicken tenders with citrus honey ginger sauce chicken was cooked wonderfully and that dipping sauce made it extra special
I had a goat cheese pizza with cherry tomatoes and basil that was soo delicious
The food isn't necessarily spectacular but it is good
We come here for the good food great views and relaxing atmosphere right in the middle of one of Tempe's busiest areas
They have a great selection of produce and dry goods plus the meat is always good looking
The food looked edible like it hadn't been sitting out for ages and it was tasty
I had the crispy basil chicken level 3 hot and Jon had the shrimp stirfry level 1 hot
When our dishes were brought out we both loved the flavors but agreed we needed some more heat and our server gladly brought out some chili paste for us which did the job
Food- I had the cutter's choice cut of 1/2lb of beef brisket very nice smoke ring good fall apart meat bbq sauce there are two types spicy and original both have a good sweet bold taste
This time the chicken was fresh and moist very tender and delicious
The short ribs I chose were amazing so tender they fell apart at the touch of the fork and the avocado chicken curry my wife selected was even better
What better way to splurge on calorific goodness than with a thin crust NY style pizza
Ultimately I chose the Kung Pao Soy Chicken that contains spicy classic Kung Pao sauce with garlic white and green onions soy chicken zucchini bell pepper carrots and peanutsI patiently waited for my food while I enjoyed watching the hustle and bustle of the lunchtime crowd
Try this little place its a cute hide away with good food
Yes it's expensive but it's such a treat and I haven't found another organic grocery in town that has the quality produce salad bar cheese selection meats seafood etc
We enjoyed everything from the food drinks & service that we decided to come back and try their dinner menu
It's like being slapped in the face but saying it's okay because the food was wonderful
The spring rolls were a bit greasy but everything else was good
They have a decent drink selection and lots of other italian items on the menu that I've never tried because the pizza is so good
I had a delish salad with shredded chicken and Spouse enjoyed his Valet-style sandwich
So my overall thoughts on the food were that it was tasty but really the only thing that blew me away was the guacamole
For our entree we shared the rotissere chicken which was quite good
The teriyaki was a little bit too salty for my taste but I thought the curry dish was excellent
I thought the sushi was pretty good I'm definitely not a sushi snob as they say but it tasted pretty damn good to me
It takes away from the food when you're being hit on by drunken bros that are twice your age or listening to Snookie's twin loudly explain last night's drunken hook up but generally they're too busy watching the game outside to encroach on your good time anyway
Now I live in NY the food capital of America and I have yet to find a place with such wonderful people and delicious food
Our food was very good but no real risk was taken
We shared the fish and shrimp tacos which were flavorful but I had to add some hot sauce to give it a little bite
Some of our favorites include the Potsickers a must have starter #27 which is a pan fried noodle with light brown sauce meats chicken shrimp and veggies AMAZING the fried rice is out of bounds and John's dad has now been making it a little spicier with basil
Liberty Market is modern stylish and has excellent food and service to back up the impressive atmosphere
The menu is also inventive and I would highly recommend getting the appetizer pizza to start with hummus on the side
Beer selection was good LIITs were excellent - and even better we were pleasantly surprised by the food
The first night we tried the chicken strips with asian garlic dipping sauce on the side slightly salty but very good
Later we ordered a pepperoni pizza and thought it was just as good as Hazelwoods with the exception of the crust which I prefer to be as thin as possible
The food was very tasty and was just as good as any gluten-filled meal
Go see how simple food can still be good food and not scream short-term dabbling in the industry business model
I enjoyed them but I am starting to admit that despite being raised in California and adoring Mexican food I will never really like avocados
All in all very cute place good food and a place you feel happy to support
My friend brought up a good point there is only so much that can be done with pizza
I would not necessarily recommend eating sushi here
I like high-quality sushi and when eating raw fish I don't think this is negotiable
The food just really didn't taste that great and I totally was not impressed
I have a good friend who grew up in Maui and when I would fly out to visit her when they moved out to the southwest her Mom would occasionally cook up a dish but that was the extent of my experience with the cuisine outside of a few places in town
This is one of those reviews that deserve a useless button All I have to say is that it's inexpensive fantastically delicious and a completely adorable fast food counter joint
The counter area was ample while the food quality was average to good
Visiting Phoenix from the Bay Area we were in search of some good Chinese food since it had been almost 3 weeks
The rice was delicious the fried chicken was tasty albeit a tad dry
When we returned to the buffet it was filled with piping hot pizzas
This time I had the fried catfish and it was excellent
My husband had the chicken & dumplings and said his could have been a little hotter but honestly that is the only small issue we had and it wasn't enough for us to ask the waitress who was very attentive to heat it up or get something hotter
Our food was good and we left happy and will return
The simple menu could do with something to compliment the otherwise good not excellent chicken strips
Food and service however have never really impressed me at this location
Appetizers are pretty much on the same page things like pot stickers are literally no better than what you can buy in the frozen food section of your grocery store there was nothing special about them
I never could finish them because they were so huge but at least they were delicious unlike most of the food I've had there
This is a greatly over-rated hotel restaurant with average food
We then tried the kobe beef tenderloin on casabe flatbread which was ok but not wonderful
BIG PICTURE sub-parawful decor cheap Ikea and even worse music Taylor Swfit techno remixFood everything I've ever had here was really good
If you want fast food burgers that are fresh and delicious this is the place to go
Oh and the fact that the staff is friendly the prices are fair and the food is good doesn't hurt either
The kal-bi had a nice flavor although I would have liked more or it in proportion to the chicken
This is a bit ridiculous in and of itself - I mean hummus is not exactly a high food cost item but more to the point neither was particularly tasty
they have a wonderful priced happy hour and food
I had the chicken which was very dry lacking in flavor and almost tasted gamey
I really enjoyed my experience at Pure Sushi
Gallo Blanco is delicious especially their breakfast/brunch food
but so worth taking your own wine to go with the good food
We were really impressed with not only the taste of the food but the presentation of the food as well
The food is good- definitely 4 stars but the price compared to the portion size and tastiness is definitely 2 stars
The food is around but below drive through Filberto's quality at near restaurant prices
Dessert was a vanilla flan not the typical Mexican version very small intensely delicious and a larger portion would have been over the top
Place your order at the counter and try not to be tempted by all of the delicious looking desserts calling your name
I have tried a few different menu items and it addition to enjoying good tasting healthy vegan food the portion sizes are quite generous and very reasonably priced
Feel good and taste good healthful food
I don't normally eat steak but the filet was very tasty and a welcome change from chicken and fish
The food is great the service is great and the beer is wonderful as well
Not to mention they have AMAZING chicken fingers here
I still love the there pizza The white pizza is the best it has a light butter taste pesto tomatoes and wonderful cheese
They also have a huge mixtures of pizza's that you don't normally see such as a greek theme with artichokes mixture of olives feta and more goodness
But one of my friends had the fried green tomatoes which were wonderful and another had the brussell sprouts also wonderful and the butterscotch pudding dessert with the nutmeg whipped cream was simply divine
But regardless this dessert was so so soooo very delicious
so that probably explains why I actually like the placeThe Beautiful Carin and I wandered over for dinner the other evening as you can see I am a little bit behind on writing my little review-like storiesWe have been a number of times over the years because when you live in Old Town Scottsdale Bandera is* Close* Pretty Decent Food* Close* Pretty Good Martinis* CloseWe generally go to Bandera in the summer and fall when the crowds are gone and they seem almost pathetically happy to see us walk through the doorI do enjoy the corn bread
like corny bready candyAnd the martini's are big and chock full of vitamin V and priced somewhat less than the marti's at AZ88The food has always been good the short ribs the rotisserie chicken the prime rib
you know just good solid all-american fareBandera is probably nothing you'd go out of your way for and certainly nothing that I would queue up for a 90 minute wait for during the winter months but worth the stroll over this time of yearSo if you're in Old Town and looking for corn bread braised short ribs and an ice cold vodka marti stop in and see the folks at Houstera
All ingredients are fresh and the meats are juicy and delicious
Go with a couple of friends so you can share all the good food and drinks
The food came out amazingly fast hot and presented very nicely
They completely redid the menu to be more hip and well food court mall-like but in a good way I think
the ribs steak chicken grilled salmon salads fries it's all good
Now onto their regular food I have tried many menu items and all have been good
Iron Pot Nabeyaki Udon seafood was tasty but the amount of actual seafood was dramatically smaller then past visits
The panko shrimp was very good as was the chicken parm my dinner companion ordered what a contrast to Asian menu items
I would come here again to sample more of the beer and for dessert or a Happy Hour-priced appetizer but not for lunch or dinner again
So you can see that for Hiro Sushi to get a good review from me is saying something
Hiro and his son are super nice and always recommend the best dishes for me
Husband and I couldn't decide what to order AT ALL so we asked the server for recommendations and went with the Roasted Corn pizza and Parsnip Gnudi to share
If I could describe the flavors in this particular pizza as both light and rich then I would
If you want to eat til you're stuffed I would recommend either ordering one more thing or choosing a more hearty dish
We enjoyed the dessert but would probably try something different next time
The food was excellent and that's why this place deserves 5 stars
Unfortunately the food at Macayos is just not very good and is WAY overpriced
Not heavy not greasy nice and light but bursting with fresh summer flavor and plenty of food
Hope the food is worth all the effort it took to get the most basic information
The monkey bread  I'm not a huge dessert person but this was REALLY good
The pros - fresh ingredients- attention to detail - variety of foods snacks goodies and drinksThe cons- expensive- location / parking inconvenientBrief reviewAll in all a good place to hang out and grab a drink with a friend when it's nice outside
Everything was delicious and the server was just so friendly and quick to tell us all about the food
I absolutely loveeeeee tai food- but soi4 has much to work on as far as food quality and taste
later on I moved to the pad seew which was bland and flavorless and had to use tons of tai chili fish sauce to make it better
When our food first started to arrive we were told it was being brought out as its done so it stays hot
I get the Flatbread Pizza with Tandoori Chicken every time it's that good
But when you're eating food this good who's going to do much talking anyway
Let me say that the rice was mushy and the chicken was cold
how long ago was this chicken cooked because it is cold now
I was suggested that I have their white pizza and add red sauce and it was amazing
The food is plentiful and delicious a big step up from 'bar' food but not fancy and not pricey either
but this was excellent and really brought out the flavor of my food
Food was good I had the Frutti de Mare with red sauce and boy it is spicy so be warned
The pizza is good I have had it before I am not the biggest wood fire pizza fan because it is always burned on the bottom
I ordered the lamb kisra and Jonathon ordered a wonderful chicken sandwich
Food atmosphere everything still wonderful
Last time I was there I had a salmon salad which was good though in all honesty the salmon was the star of the dish
I have dined at your establishment twice and both time the food was delicious even if the wait was long
The meat was smothered in barbecue sauce which had a flavor I was not wild about
Our waiter had recommended a roast beef and cheddar sandwich that is a Stockyards specialty instead but my husband did not listen to him
Then add in some of the most amazing Italian food and you have a place worth adding to your favorites
My gf who's eaten at the little Italian family places in Pennsylvania says this place is every bit as good; I know the food's awesome
The omelet was huge and looked tasty my food was ok they cooked my eggs rightt which for some reason is difficult but shouldn't be
One is getting quality food at a good price
The food wasn't health conscious at all but if you're looking to fill up with calories and get a good-sized portion then this is your type of place
The carne asada while great in quality of meat was not authentic at all
If there are Mexicans in a Mexican food restaurant it is always a good sign
The drive-thru is fast which I thought was amazing for a health food spot
I can say that the quality took a slight dip a few years ago and the breading on the fish always seemed to fall off the flesh
I have been to Sushi Brokers good RA also good as well as Satori and a Stingray etc
If there is a Wildflower close by that's usually my pick of places to go when given other options based on their consistent good food and service
Soups vary by day but if available both their Artichoke & Chicken Florentine and their seasonal Autumn Pumpkin soups are very good
The decor and atmosphere was great great hangover bar as very dark service was perfect and food very very good
Thank you PastaBAR for bringing simple good food to the downtown area it is wonderful
We ordered appetizers the empanada stuffed with meat and calamari
This tends to turn most people off but this tends to be a side affect of making good food so I had no problem with it
The pizza was hot fresh and the cheese melts in your mouth
Once my curry chicken was dry meaning not enought curry sauce but it still tasted very good
This is Arizona it's June you don't charge for a cup of ice water especially when I'm ordering almost 30$ worth of food from your establishment
The food's very good perhaps not as good as Flo's in Scottsdale if you're familiar but then it's much more reasonable quiet and friendly
It was my first time and I wasn't that hungry so I just stuck with good old chicken satay
The food is excellent quality Chinese food and not just decent fast-food-esque Chinese
It's not worth fussing about when the food is so good
Solid burger offerings - both beef & turikey TASTY
Two chicken cutlets and he could not finish the whole thing although he said it was really good
Good quality fish selected for the sushi and everything blended together nice it didn't taste like eating rice seaweed and fish seperately like other places
Very good meats and delicious sandy's all around
You can get some good beer here too and every now and again I pick up a few groceries to take back home as well pizza dough anyone
Mostly though this place is quality and I would recommend it to anyone over the run of the mill fast food sandwich shops around town
So this is not a review about the food because it is very good
I had the opportunity to sample a variety of dishes and each one was out of the spectrum of my ormal for what I would order and each dish blew me away with its combination of unique fresh tasty  ingredients
The turkey was standard shaved deli counter meat with little flavor the lettuce and tomato was fine the bacon added some much needed salt to the sandwiched  and the avocado was very unripe thus flavorless
While the price for our meal wasn't outrageous the food was still amazingly mediocre
I've noticed that many reviews mention the chicken wings as being especially good but I don't know if I'll give them another chance so I could find out
Their menu is not huge but man is the chicken good
We ordered the appetizer - Ribs and Chicken wings
Stopped in on a lark as I really didn't expect much in this seedy strip mall but since I love Mediterranean food and there are not many up this way I gave it a shot
The food is homemade and very good prices are reasonable service is friendly owner is lovely and all the reviews before me are spot on
3 large meatballs full of flavor smothered in marinara sauce and cheese with 4 pieces of garlic bread
No thanks I know there are good vegetarian dishes out there and if I want a pizza I'll get a real pizza with real cheese
The chef was spot on making a contrast between the luscious crab meat and the wonderful seasoning
The lobster meat was so sweet and delicious I wanted to lick the plate clean
The food was good but for the  lackluster service it wasn't great enough to make me ever go back
Also I recommend you try their Spicy Tuna Roll
I have always had a wonderful experience while dinning at True Food Sauce and Culinary Dropout so I will probably stick to those next time I decide to go to a Fox Restaurant
Yellowtail Sashimi was served like Nigiri without the rice- pieces of fish waaaayyy too thick-Wasabi was dry and flavorless- completely NOT fresh-Dragon Roll was nothing more than crab mix w/ Unagi and avocado on top- LAME
- and overpricedLost our name on the seating list and was sooooo not worth the wait-When complained to the manager he made it seem like our fault that the sushi was so terrible
The only thing this place has going for it is location and stupid local Scottsdale yuppies that can't tell the different between fresh quality fish and garbage
The pizza came out piping hot and was tasty
I had a pinwheel of fishy goodness with yellowtail smoked salmon and tuna
My dog was stuffed with an all-beef hot dog I chose that instead of the standard all-beef brat and was layered with juicy pineapple shredded coconut chipotle garlic mayo and Maui mustard which was one of the most delicious sauces I've ever tasted
The flavors all worked incredibly well together - sweet spicy salty tangy fruity meaty - it was an amazing mix of food synergy
That all said Moira is an excellent on the sushi point too
I had a Philly roll that had just the right combination of salmon and cream cheese not too much cream cheese a caterpillar roll with a great balance of color and flavor and decorated cutely as a caterpillar and a couple of nigiri with a very flavorful yellowtail and mackerel with an interesting sauce that complimented the fish
I mean it was fantastically delicious pizza in one of the cutest little restaurants I've ever seen but I don't think I would wait 4 hours to get a table I was lucky; we had a party of 8 and a friend who had the foresight to make us a reservation 3 weeks in advance so we didn't have to wait even 1 minute
The chicken pressed quesadilla is the best quesadilla I've had in a LONG time The ingredients were fresh & tasty
Food--The fire roasted garlic tomato soup is excellent
The guacamole was however worth it even if it was insinuated upon us ordering it that we were 'restaurant tourists'There were basically no vegetarian options and it was quite the scoffing matter on the part of our server when I requested a substitute of beans on a chicken dish We don't serrrve beans here
They have a Pharmacy and a Photo Counter along with Starbucks and Pizza Hut Express and 18 awesome checklanes with cool ligts to stare at while you wait in line for 15 seconds
I knew she's never experienced amazing Latin food and flavors and boy did we have a great time
Church's has way better food than KFC in both selection and flavor not to mention a better price
On our first trip I had the chicken chimi and could not believe how tender the meat was absolutely delicious
Appetizers at our table included two types of oysters a lobster sushi roll salads and calamari
They have great cold sandwiches piled high with meat
While relocating here and living out of hotels I found myself going back to this place at least twice a week- both for the food and the friendly people
But if you want good Thai- go here ask for the seafood salad- and if you like it really hot say pet mahk mahk
It took about 5 minutes for the food to come and both dishes were very good and very fresh tasting as the basil they used really came through
Loved the tasty meat on the taco and its authenticity
JR size italian beef is more than enough for me Decent price close enough to work but there is another spot on the Arcadia side that is closer to home better service better hot peppers and even better price so now im going to change my rating to three stars
Ashley sales associate in the fish department was amazingly helpful
It's right across the street from my gym and the happy hour prices and food are good
They are grilled and usually burned overly salted void of taste although the salt and burned chicken flavor tends to come through and almost always pink inside
quite possibly one of the most amazing pasta dishes i've had in a long time
The best part is that the food is ridiculously reasonable for superb quality food
The hot food as some other reviewers have mentioned is pretty sub-par
The service was great food was excellent and while it may have been a bit on the pricey side I felt as though it was a great value
The fish had a very fishy flavor and a terrible texture
It is large enough where I can get a weeks plus worth of food without being overwhelming
The food was very tasty all of us at the table really liked our barbecue
They have a good selection of chemicals fish and coral food pellets and frozen tank supplies and live rock
Meals  Meh its airline food I'm not expecting gormet goodies
Jerk chicken was good but not jerked enough
- great neighborhood vibe - small and intimate with a modern Asian vibe than isn't overly 'faux-Japanese' or 'trendy'- quick friendly serviceThe Not so Good- the tuna sashimi tuna had the telltale mushy flavorless that comes from being previously frozen - the 'chef's choice' sashimi A white fish but we didn't get a chance to ask what it was was flavorless although not mushy
The fish is extremely freshit's flown in fresh twice daily so it better be and it is very tasty
The food is always good I am only doing 3 stars because of the service
The food is great and the portions are a good size but wow bring your patience
The first time we went there I had the New Yorker Hot Pastrami Hot Corned Beef and Cole Slaw with Russian Dressing on Rye
It was piled high with tasty meat; but not so high like at those New York delis you see on those Man vs
My boyfriend got the French Dip which disappointingly was not able to be on the French roll because they were out but he said it was good anyway
The boy had the Meatball sub which was really good also
It was not really a classic marinara a bit spicy but the meatballs themselves had a lot of good flavor
When I got home to tell the hubby about all the scrumptious food and drinks we enjoyed I fell asleep telling him because there were just too many items to describe
The ambiance may lure you in but the tasty American food and handcrafted cocktails will keep you coming back
The dessert was vegan and incredibly tasty
They're chicken wings are actually quite good especially the oriental garlic
My buddy and I sat at the bar watched the game enjoyed great food with good convo and sipped out countless mimosa's
While I enjoyed Drift for its tropical-inspired cocktails and decor Spanish Fly didn't disappoint at all when it came to ambiance and food
Overall I'd look elsewhere if you want good Mexican food
Though a bit pricey for the average person the food definitely made up and was delicious
it came out piping hot in a dish and was incredible
My dad has the rotisserie chicken and was so disappointed that they ended up taking it off of the bill it was cold and dry
This is a fine place - the prices are decent for the amount of food you get it tastes pretty good and the menu is quite vast for a deli
The sausage and other meats were tasty minus them obviously forgetting to remove the skin or wrapping from the pepperoni which isn't something fun to discover mid-bite
For amazing noodle dishes try drunken beef Sizzling stir-fried skirt steak with green beans apple eggplant lemongrass chili and basilo spicy wide rice noodles and skirt steak stir-fried with basil garlic and chili pad se-ew pan-fried wide rice noodles with pork chinese broccoli egg in Thai black bean sauce
The food was decent not outstanding and the atmosphere was excellent as this is such a nice restaurant setting
The pastas are very tasty and the specialty pizza combinations are wonderful
rice egg veggies beef in a hot stone bowl
We shared the calamari excellent the spicy tuna roll very good and the potstickers pretty good
Putting everything aside both dishes were excellent and the portion was huge but we know that's due to them trying to gain loyal customers and it will only go downhill from here
We just ended up ordering another beef appetizer which was pretty good
Also for the food being good half of the time
In one episode a very nice French restaurant was having trouble and he explained to them that their dishes were too complex and it hurt the flavor
The dishes I loved were simple and absolutely delicious
Still it's amazing food that's probably some of the best authentic Mexican food in the area
food is pretty good but with that being said i will not go back until they have some time to settle in
Started with Egg Rolls these were top drawer complete with fresh lettuce and mint to wrap and dip into the Nc chm amazingly delicious fresh and piping hot against the cool veggies
If you arent familiar its basically a wonderful beef stew with either noodles or french bread
Very good meatballs best egg plant parm on the west coast and did I mention veal
Dishes that made me ashamed to be Chinese yes the level that C-Fu dimsum brought it down to was that bad-  Fried glutinous rice  The preserved meat that was supposed to flavor the dish was MIA
Dishes I was amazed by and no not in a good way-  Deep fried taro dumpling  Have never quite had it in that simplistic way before where the filling literally was just mashed taro held together by a prodigious amount of oil-  Steamed bok choy  How the heck do you get oil into steamed vegetable
We did keep on ordering more dishes hopping that something good would pop up
Offering up inexpensive tasty breakfast pizza is a great marketing move
The pizza is good especially the crusts you can self-select
Mostly good service and we like the pizza
I wasn't crazy about my soup but my husband's noodle dish was good and our friend's Pad Thai was excellent
I highly recommend honey seared chicken on white rice with extra sauce no charge
I didn't think the food was quite as good as last time though so I'm dropping it down to 3 Stars
Straight up authentico feel to the place not a whitey around and just some really smelly in a good way grub sizzling away there is a sneeze guard but behind it you can see all the various types of meats they offer from Carnitas to Pastor I was in hog heaven
Appetizers Ravioli in cream sauce Pan grilled soft cheese NOT mozzarella shredded chicken nachos hot & spicy shrimp
If I had waited in line for this I would have been even more disappointed in the quality of the food
I had the Mediterranean pizza and it was good but needed salt
The pizza's crust had a great flavor and was crispy without being dry
She insisted we go eat here and as such we had to get the Adam Richman's Bases Loaded Big Unit which for those of you that haven't watched the show consists of a massive 22 vienna all beef hotdog ightmare chili bacon cheese sauce sauerkraut jalapenos diced tomatoes diced onions sweet relish and shredded cheddar cheese and served on top of a bed of a fries I think a pound of them
Food is always good with a great selection
Divine thin crust pizza great salads appetizers wings and pizza cookies left a little doughy with ice cream on top
The wait can be a long on weekend nights but the food is worth it
I have to give it up for this place because as far as I know they are the only place in the Valley that serves my all-time favorite dish dolseot bibimbap rice with vegetables and eggs served in a sizzling hot stone bowl
The rest of the meat selection is also no good
Only reason I gave this place three stars was because I have not tried the food yet BUT I will say this place is a good place to stop by and go to the bar for a few rounds of sake bombers
We had such a good experience just having drinks at the bar that we will def be back for a full experience with food
Next time i come here i will make it a point to come early and order food which looks delicious cloister myself and my company in one of the rooms and just hold down the fort all night
I got the cuban chicken panini which was good not anything extraordinary
Entrees1 Burger Au Poivre II with peppercorns crumbled bleu cheese & bacon2 Picnic Chicken Sandwich sliced chicken breast sliced pears pecan halves Gorgonzola cheese mayonnaise mustard and Romaine lettuce on pumpernickel breadBoth were very good and the portions were big
Food was reasonable enough but we both felt our food just wasn't good enough to bring us back
This restaurant should have really good food
The steak and chicken seem like they should taste good
Very limited menu with nothing you want except maybe guac 'cause the chips weren't even good and pretty pricey for the dog food beef you get
As far as meat goes the HK Style/Peking/Sweet & Sour Pork Ribs are deliciously sauced and have the right amount of meaty bite to go with it
They make a pretty good steamed fish it's served whole with a head- so don't freak out if you're being health conscious
I'm sure that stuff is good here but I dare you to venture out of the boring and try some more authentic dishes
I'm giving this three stars purely for the quality of the food
The food needs to be good and anyone who considers this food anywhere close to enjoyable should have their Yelp
There could have been more meat but it was still good
But it becomes so much easier when the food is delicious
While I was enjoying their flavorful Carpaccio a drizzling of oil and lemon over the arugula and Wagyu beef someone was seated at the table next to me
This method allows for the searing in of the outer part of the meat thus keeping in the flavor
I went back a few weeks later and enjoyed the Rondelle Four Cheese which is pasta sheets rolled with mozzarella fontina blue cheese Parmesan and spinach and baked in tomato sauce absolute heaven
My friend had the chicken parm which is basic but their sauce is so good you don't notice that its something as simple as chicken parm
Of course good food jeez let me get to that but as far as elemental funtastic vibes are concerned this place hits the mark on many points
I like Corbin's - it has a decent vibe clean design nice service and good food
We've really enjoyed their wings tasso ham and caramelized onion flatbread pizza-thing and pulled pork sandwich
With that being said Grimaldi's Pizza is just as good minus the wait
The food here is absolutely delicious
We thought Big Earl's best dishes were the brisket full of flavor and juicy mac and cheese it's the cheesiest and collard greens with pig part goodness
Dessert was so good I was licking the plate at the end
The dish is serve hot with the kebab meat beef lamb both - who knows
There is an amazing variety on both the food and drink menus to choose from
Amazing and inexpensive food great big drinks that are masterfully crafted and waitstaff that knows what you need before you even know you need it
And - not joking - this place has had the best Greek food I've come across since I've moved to AZ in a large part because of the amazing Tzatziki sauce
From the tender tasty and juicy flame broiled chicken to the creamy sweet and aromatic Persian ice cream homemade with rose water pistachio pieces and honey this place does it right
My friend Ayesha also on Yelp is a Thai food expert and she recommended this one over some of the others recommended by Yelp
To begin with the food and beverages were good
Considering this is seafood and they give you huge plates I think the cost is definitely worth it but don't be surprised to see those $20-$30+ entrees
5* at best- Sausages were awful; really dry and cold- Coffee was lukewarm; not very tastyEveryone else's food looked pretty good including the benedicts and tacos
We took some Thai food lovers here from out of town and they agreed it was as good or better as any Thai they'd had in a variety of cities
So basically their meh food doesn't make up for their UGH service therefore making take out not worth it and dining in miserable
The pricing is what you would expect to pay from a trendy sushi place my husband and I had an appetizer a few rolls and drinks for under $40
BUT the food creative delicious sandwiches and desserts speedy service and reasonable prices really do deserve 5 stars
The chicken/asparagus/havarti sandwich almost killed my taste buds with its deliciousness
After a manager got us to sample some of their fresh chicken however we ended up staying out of good faith
People have to wait so long that they either go get drunk or get so hungry that the food tastes amazing once you finally get it
The waitress was nice and very apologetic about the wait so at least this restaurant knows to be courteous to it's customers unlike a different restaurant I recently went to *cough*postino*cough* There were four of us and we ordered two appetizers and two pizzas
Good service good food awesome beer and the company that goes along with all of the above certainly doesn't suck
Half price drinks and carafes of sake rolls and appetizers
The chicken gyoza is amazing and I always get two orders for myself
Their specialty rolls are delicious and they have the most creative names like Dragonball and Bye Bye Kitty
The food and drinks at the Spotted Donkey are consistently good
The meatloaf is a little blander than expected but the Chalupa's are oh so good - with guacamole pulled pork and some special ingredients on a corn tamale
An interesting menu great food and a wonderful view
This place gets a solid 4 stars due to good wine decent food and the enjoyable and somewhat surreal time I had there
Eventually we moved to the other side of the restaraunt where it was a little quieter but much colder--I was practically hypothermic by the time we left-- and ordered some food
There were about a dozen folks there at various points in their meal and that nice homey smell of good food
It's good that they serve pitchers of water along with their food
But it was really really good food and it's definitely somewhere I'd want to bring my friends from out of town
That's fine the veg was really tasty and just COATED with cheese which is one of pizza's finer qualites in my book
All in all a delicious handmade pizza
We had the Calamari appetizer and my boyfriend & I both ordered the Butterfish but had it prepared in 2 different ways
I can't rate it higher because Malee's is too far a superior choice for me and using Malee's as the 5-star standard for Phoenix Thai food this instinctively comes in at a 3 which is my standard for good aka I'm not complaining but I'm not blown away either
Although I would have no problem with that if the service was good and the food was above average
The meat was perfectly cooked not chewy like the last sandwich I ordered at another place the coleslaw was so good and flavorful juicy without dripping all over the place
Most all are filthy in lousy locations & neighborhoods but the food is usually pretty damn good and inexpensive
Not only is this location 24 hours but it's also clean & in an area where I don't feel like I will be shot at and the food is really good and very reasonably priced
I was actually taken here as a guest of my aunt and her husband and I felt very guilty because even though I do eat meat I feel like I did not eat enough to make it worth it to bring me
When you are finally done with all that meat and you somehow amazingly have more room then totally go for the desserts
I really like Pita Jungle-- laid back atmosphere beautiful interior delicious food
After you've had pizza in New York and Chicago and even local joints like Pizzeria Bianco and you have places like Spinato's in your rotation an uninspiring pizza is not really even worth eating for lunch
The kindest smartest nicest wait staff in the morning and the food is just so creative and different yet so tasty
It comes with an appetizersalad soup shellfish buffet an entree  with sides and dessert
The food quality was fantastic Kobe sliders duck burgers Olympia oysters king crabs
I had the Coconut Curry rice bowl which was pretty good and a bite of my friends Chicken Parm which was also tasty
Being a gentleman I didn't eat her food but she assured me via text message while writing this that the food was really good
The food has been pretty good although it did not knock my socks off
Again I was not very impressed with the chicken chunks
While initially missing my Indian favorites with chicken paneer lamb or goat I quickly pushed those ideas out of my mind and begin to enjoy the wonderful flavors of the various and different dishes
Well it's cheap and novel not too many conveyor sushi places around and the only reason I went was because of this  But the food not so hot or should I say cool
With a plethora of other decent sushi options in the area it's worth springing for the real thing or as close to ad you can expect
On a positive note the food and wine was reasonably priced as well as delicious
I like good food; I want good food even in a middle of the road place like this
The food is delicious and the drinks are really good
I can't believe each dish is 475 calories or less and the portions are still a good size
The fish tacos were delicious succulent with just the right amount of spiciness
But even if you're not a calorie counter this still ranks right up there for the food quality taste and presentation
The Famous Grilled Chicken Salad Classic French Dip Spit Roasted Turkey Dip are all pretty freakin' amazing
The portions were generous and the quality of the food was about standard diner fare
I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you're looking for a quaint sit down place with decent food that is open 24 hours
As far as the food goes it was all pretty good with most of your typical Chinese buffet selections
So the food was pretty good; nothing SLAP-TASTIC-BLOW-YOUR-MIND-INSANE but a solid 4 stars
The food was delicious in its own right and insured that I would be a repeat customer but the service just made me a customer for life
I dislike meat on top of pasta or potatoes  because when you cut it you crush it into the pasta  The wine list was good the teramasu was good
The House Special Sesame Chicken was good but nothing special and a bit too sweet for my taste
The ground beef is so orgasmically delicious
The Pilgrim is undeniably yum the Reuben was chockfull of flavor the meatball delighted my daughter but was so-so for me
The Indian spiced chicken was so tasty I wish they made it into a Pasty too
I got home and dug into the delicious spicy chicken and rice with sugar snapies and carrots
Our pizza crust was a bit doughy and had that industrial cheese flavor you get from a frozen pizza
The flavor is good but the dish is pretty oily
The cinnamon dusted sweet potato fries are good for a sweet side dish
Better quality food in SF seems cheaper than Chelsea's kitchen
Three words mean big flavor at the Fairmont Scottsdale's Michael Mina group restaurant DRY AGED BEEF
plenty of Fat Tony types mililng about and chit chatting with the regulars the food is unbelievably good
Huge portions reasonable prices great service and good food
Had a taste of hubby's chicken fried steak and it was AMAZING
Both were flavorful and well prepared though I thought the sauce to meat ratio was a little high
The yellow tail appetizer was also good but you can find the same at alot of other sushi places around town
Avocado and spicy tuna rolled in shrimp with rice paper cilantro and some hot sauce
that was with NO dessert and only $4 worth of beer
What I got was a really good grilled chicken breast great avocado two tiny tomato slices and the worst bun you can imagine
The food was relatively good - not the best but certainly not the worst either I got the salmon
I love their Ultimate Shrimp Tempura roll and their Ahi Tuna is good
The taco was an honest legitimate fried Mexican taco fantastically crunchy & full of juicy shredded beef then laid on its side covered in a flavorful red sauce and then sprinkled with crumbly queso
The tostada was mounded with the same shredded beef crunchy cold lettuce and crumbled queso
The service was great I was a little nervous when we walked in and no one Else was there I had the sweet and Sour chicken and my boyfriend had the Duck My chicken was very tasty as far as the duck the skin was good and crispy but to greasy for the actual meat and would not really recommend that but the egg rolls and sweet and sour sauce were out of this world I can't wait to go back again
I had the king tacos  client's recommendation and they were Delicious 3 soft tacos with really good chicken I don't know what they marinate it in but moist  flavorful and cooked to perfection perfectly sauteed onions on top with just the right amount of cheese
This is a beautiful inviting and absurdly delicious plate of sliced butterfish marinated with olive oil spices and what tasted like candied nuts
Sorry ladies it was late in the afternoon and I wasn't about to gorge myself on bar food before a tasty dinner with the in-laws
I use to eat here all the time because the food was delicious and I did not mind paying $10 for a delicious and stacked meal
I understand about the portion sizes but the quality of the food should still be there and I strongly urge them to reconsider their lead cooks if they're putting food out like this
T___T But all the same the food was good I had the chipotle chicken sandwich with fries very typical of a chain restaurant
Service aside I would've given the place 5 stars but the food is too good
All the food is hot and fresh and they are constantly bringing in warm bread and new refills
The chicken curry is even better with the addition of red and green bell peppers but everything else is just as tasty
The food was pretty good spicy but seemed to cool down quickly once left on the table
I'm as sustainable as I can be and Goober Pet Direct is a fantastic resouce for me to easily get the high quality food and other items that my dogs need
The sandwich was good enough although a bit heavy on the fat but it really wasn't enough food and it looked very forlorn sitting there on the plate with the tiny plastic ramekin with a few grapes and slices of cantaloupe
We ordered egg rolls for an appetizer and they were your standard egg rolls with pork
I ordered the pear-chicken salad which was actually very refreshing and tasty
Every Pasty I've had is delicious and I am particular to the Cajun Chicken
The food was a  good quality and tasted pretty good

I like a good thin crust pizza & this place fits the bill
Z pizza is worth a try if your curious but I'm not so impressed that I will go back often
The combos are a good start if it's your first venture into korean food although I will say that if you really like spicy spicy food ask them to make the soondubu tofu stew spicy
Their galbi tang beef short rib soup is also pretty good and is CHEAP at $8 usually 10+ at other places
The service - Nice and fun peopleThe chicken - Bigger and juicierThe waffles - Bigger and tastierThe mac & cheese - tastier and cheesierThe stupid fries - Stupid Good and Roscoe's doesn't have it
They had a good variety of menu items appitizers ribs fish and chips fried shrimp salad sandwiches and pizza and pasta
The service has been really good both times I've been the people that bring the food to you have a real smile and when they ask if there is anything else they can get you- they actually stand still long enough to listen to your answer
I am so sick of going to places that are so busy being really cool and overpriced that they forget to give you good food so this place is refreshing- Score Wildflower Bread Company
The beer is excellent the service has always been attentive and the food is above normal bar standardsThe fish and battered fries was very good the tartar sauce is good but ask for the cocktail sauce
Short formordered our food15 minutes elapsewe get our iced teas15 minutes elapsethe tables next to us that had ordered and were seated before we got there get SOME of their food one sends soup back because it's cold
The food was just average nothing to write home about but the decor was worth it
I'm not sure if it was because the ensalada drink looked like a liquid highlighter or the fact that an ice cold beverage was served with a hot soup but being the starving beast that I was I took a sip of the glow-stick and devoured the tasty chicken soup
By that I mean it is not spruced up with glazes and sauces to mask the true flavor of the fish you ordered
But I think if the chef masked the fish with other flavors he might as well buy it frozen
All the meat that we ordered was not hot off the grill
the good  their chicken was a good as can be very tender
The flavor of pizza in the air takes you back and right in front of you are traditional pizza makers and spinners
For specializing in chicken I felt it was lacking in flavor
FOOD 4/5 stars - There's plenty of food options pizza hot dogs ice cream burgers even Chinese but I'll just recommend the best places
I've had their special Thai Basil Chicken as well as the red yellow green and masaman curries - and they've all got good flavor
I'd definitely recommend their food if you're in the Tempe area as again it is decent Thai but either order it to go or be in the mindset for a very leisurely lunch or dinner ie
it is NEVER a good idea to bring food dog OR human into a dog park
My wife ordered the chicken salad and it was very very good
Didn't get a chance to try the kobe beef or the hot pot but the sushi was excellent
The chicken was tender and the tortilla it was wrapped in was nicely deep fried and came with a good amount of guacamole and sour cream
I find that because they only make chicken fingers they actually make a better quality more consistent meal don't forget that we are still talking about a fast food restaurant
Anybody that knows truly good tasting NY style pizza knows that this is a legitimate pizza joint somehow located in Scottsdale AZ
This place gets two thumbs up for the quality of their food
I guess that's a good way to make extra money but all the items on their menu besides the pizza are top notch and would be perfect for anyone that truly knows quality when they are tasting it at any time of day
Those that don't know quality are people that eat at chain pizza joints and think that California Pizza Kitchen is the best
Overall the food was pretty good and the service was as good as the food
I was running out of time to spend in Phoenix but I just couldn't possibly pass the opportunity to try Hiro Sushi especially after reading these amazing reviews from you fellow yelpers
Both rolls tasted delicious even though they were made an hour ago
There were plenty of Tools Hotties and Chicken Hawks present
Thank you Yoli's for reminding me that there is goodness and deliciousness all rolled into one place right here in Chandler Arizona
The food was super tasty I had the creamy corn porridge with maple glazed sausage and cinnamon sugar roasted apples
Not only was the service impeccable and the atmosphere ideal but the food was beyond amazing
Our food was good but nothing great as we had been hearing
It has great flavor I'd recommend it to anyone wanting more than thee common spaghetti or fettuccine alfredo this dish has a lot more to offer
The wings were excellent though by the time they got to me the two blur moons had inhibited my ability to properly taste food
I found the prices to be pretty steep for smaller portions than most places and the food to be of only moderate quality
Having moved out to Chandler from Phoenix I was pretty spoiled on good Mexican food there so I had to find some places out here
The dessert was excellent and the service was excellent as well
So the expensive $8 meal was so not worth it and I 'm sure when Diners Drive Ins and Dives visited the food was great but today it was the grossest thing I've ever had
I prefer to order carry out - sometimes the delivery takes too long when they get busy and you end up with cold pizza which still tastes great and not rubbery like those places that use cheap imitation cheese blends but when you order fresh pizza eating it hot is just sort of an expectation
Anyways I highly recommend their fish tacos
The carne asada is very good too - but I actually like the soup and fish tacos so much more that I rarely get the carne asada
Had a delicious pizza here with my husband tonight
We're always looking for places that offer decent to good food at a reasonable price where we can get in and out quickly if need be
I ordered the Siamese Basil with chicken and it was delicious
Ticoz is very affordable has great food and good customer service
It's not really a cafe more like a cafeteria but the food is good and also super cheap
You can get great deals on whole pizzas or hot dogs pretzels frozen yogurt and more
Without going into a huge story about all the times I've been here I'll just list all the food I love Portales Portobello Sweet Mash Boneless Chicken Wings late night menu only Cheese Crisp seasoned fries Spinach Salad Spicy Crab Cakes Green Chile Burger Habenero Burger it is good freakin spicy and comes with a glass of milk Tortilla Soup Green Chile Stew Chile Rellenos Carne Adovada Plate Green Chile Mac and Cheese late night menu Key Lime Pie and Basket of Sopas
All in all the food is pretty good but the prices are too high to justify getting dinner there
I would go back for lunch or happy hour since the food is pretty good and the items on these menus are priced pretty appropriately
Yep the word is slowly dribbling down the mouths of Phoenix foodies that Panne Bianco has now expanded into the old LUX location next door and they are open for dinner with a limited yet delicious selection of pizza's salads and pasta selections
I recommend that local fans of the now insanely crowded Pizzeria Bianco downtown make a stop here soon pizza after 4PM for some of the best pizza on the planet
Los Compardes is pretty damn good cheap Mexican food
All of the food is packaged to go no matter what which was a total plus back when I was an EMT and occasionally we had to head to the hospital in the middle of a meal Everything I've had here has been really good and if you're starving you can fill up for pretty cheap
And you know they use the worst part of the chicken because its juicy and greasy and dark coated with golden crumbs and served piping hot
The food came very hot but a little soggy from the steam built up in the box
Gallo Blanco Cafe has amazing food however the service needs a lot of help
The wonderful smoke aroma mildly permeating the restaurant gave me further hope that I was getting into something good
My attempt at a healthy buffet experience included* Salad bar - romaine tossed w/ a light italian dressing mushrooms black olives cucumber/tomato/red onion salad fresh oysters* Sauteed green beans extremely fresh and delicious sushi no deep friend rolls edamame teriyaki beef on a stick spring roll I cheated *Vanilla frozen yogurt - really yummy
The quality of the food good-- no better no worse
Pita Jungle is a casual and slightly hip place to enjoy some good Mediterranean food
The broth was flavorful and there was a good amount of seafood for the price
If I'm just leaving campus and can't decide what to eat this is usually my go-to restaurant for some good quality and affordable Mediterranean-inspired food
If you aren't sure what you're in the mood for then BJ's is a good place to go as they have descent food and tons of it
We asked for his recommendation -- the yellowtail fish
But if you know good sushi you will never want to leave this place
The meat is fabulous the sandwiches outstanding and the prices are wonderful
HOWEVER my partner said if she had to choose between this dish and La Salsa's Baja Shrimp Tacos a lot less costly and just as tasty she'd stick with La Salsa
Even more amazing than the fresh bright and innovative flavors attention to detail and quality of the food - is the whole operation is a one man show
This is one restaurant that masters the basics very well like food quality stunning sauces and scrumptious cuts of meats for every taste all presented in a nonpretentious environment
hot entrees made to order sushi Mongolian BBQ soup fresh fruit and salad and dessert
For a Chinese buffet they offered some quality desserts since some of their offerings probably came from Costco like the red velvet cake and cream puffs
The real meat lies in the approach shots which require more precision and allow for different playing options bring the ball in high or run it up
I always get the wings because they are delicious and meaty and I really wish I had some right now
being drunk is a blast so when you combined all three and then add in some delicious chicken wings and hot servers how can someone not recommend
We shared a bowl of their crab/seafood chowder that was on special that night and that was excellent
Tasted almost as good at New England Seafood chowder
This is a testament to the quality of their food
Great service delicious food and the price is really not as expensive as the restaurant appears
Well maybe not everyone I did not see if they had a good vegetarian selection but pretty much a good place to bring friends who dun eat certain meats like beef or seafood
We ordered a main dish the goat cheese tortellini as an appetizer to share
Few foods are worth waiting for as long as we did
Until they get their act figured out I recommend going somewhere else for Thai food
So the food was good  service not so much
All in all although our food was generally good I had expected more
That menu while small is full of interesting flavorful food
4 out of 5 stars as its no gourmet place just inexpensive hot fast and delicious chain store pizza
The Breadfruit is wonderful place to eat healthy yummy food
The first time I went when they opened I wasn't impressed with the food selections and slow service thus my first bad review
I love that it's small and homey the food is good and it's not too pricey
I have to say the service was as wonderful as it is in Chandler and the food was equally as good
I know you're thinking good luck but aside from Fast Food places there are several out there
In addition to the great pizza Frasher's offers amazing toasted raviolis which are also a St
The quality of the food was poor to say the least
The restaurant is nice and the sushi is good but the service was so poor that I would not go back
The flavor of the orange chicken was good the chicken was all white and had a good texture however the breading slid easily off of the chicken which was a bit annoying
The fried rice was pretty good but there was too much chicken in the chicken fried rice
Other than that they have good produces and everything you need when making an Asian dish
Wings that are meaty enough to be worth the price and spicy enough to satisfy
I still prefer Houston's quality of food/serfvice better BUT when it comes to menu selection price points ability to make reservations and THE DESSERTS
The meat was tender but didn't quite pack the flavor punch we were expecting
However you get tasty no-frills Chinese food for little out of pocket expense
I would recommend this to anyone that is on a budget and wants some relatively authentic Chinese food
The foodMy sister's coconut fish was very tasty
My bro's seafood curry was a hefty portion as were all the rest of the dishes in our party but I wasn't a big fan of the flavor
Im not sure how authentic this Thai food is but it was tasty
Thai food is quite healthy yes I do believe coconut fats are healthy but all the sugar added for flavor enhancement of the currys is not very Thai
The food options are good and of course you have those Harkins plastic re-fill cups
Great staff Good food High Price TagFood and wine was great
Even though the food was good the portion sizes were very small
And the food was not that amazing to lend to the cost either
I have been to plenty of other restaurants where the food was amazing the atmosphere was exquisite and the cost was about $10 less per plate
The chicken and waffle were still as good as ever
My friends agreed that the sides could've been better but really enjoyed the chicken and waffles
Their chicken is way too spicy usually very nicely flavored at other locations and the bloomin' onions seems smaller than usual
99 wines that could rival two buck chuck prepared foods are very tasty and they have huge price cuts on things about to expires produce meats dairy prepared foods which is perfect if you're stopping in for dinner that night
It's clean and has nice seating and good food and beer selections
If from the limited menu you think you can picture the four tubs of ingredients and sauces in the kitchen mixed in all the possible 10 ways on the menu it's because you can the Dole European Lettuces variety salad mix is the same on every single plate the same olives and olive oil or orange and apple wedges garnish every dish and the same bread yes it can be good if you buy it first thing in the morning is sliced and toasted to make you think it isn't as old and hard as it actually is
Friendly privately owned focusing on not only delicious food but wholesome food
Every dish is made with high quality ingredients
The tables where clean and the dining room was free of clutter and dirty dishes so far so good
The food was filling and tasty and it was really fun to eat outside and enjoy the crisp winter weather if you can consider 50 degrees winter
I don't know if their food is good and frankly I don't care
The couple who ordered the hot pot were then asked to move to the other side of the restaurant so they could eat at the hot pot which gave us our first hysterical bout of the evening wondering if when we came back we should bring our OWN hot pot or what if dishes were only available to diners based on geographical location in the restaurant
I'd steer towards the beef dishes which had more flavor- the crepe which we had high hopes for was tasteless
I was getting hungry for Thai food but don't know the area well enough to know where all the good Thai restaurants are
The food was good and I didn't have to wait long
I order a Kobe beef hamburger which was simply amazing
The Kobe beef flavorful and buttery soft
So the menu prices keep going up but the food quality investment is going down
The appetizer was very flavorful the only thing I didn't like is that there was more meat than queso so it was kind of hard to eat
The meat was amazing and melted in your mouth
The pizza was a good attempt but didn't not replace Monical's pizza as the best thin crust
Their beef is pretty darn good but good luck savoring that as it's overwhelmed by what is practically a salad between the buns
They have good food and this latest visit was just bad compared to other previous mediocre visits
The hot side portions are large but unless you pay extra you basically only get three things to eat - I much preferred the old Sweet Tomatoes where I could take a little of this a little of that some salad some soup some pizza some Italian some muffins
The night I was there it was Chicken some other kind of chicken turkey brisket very fatty and kept in hot water - ugh and something else
It took FOREVER to get thru the food line on the hot side and this was on a not very busy dinner hour
She recommended the Chicken Thai sausage with the apricot chutney after hearing me say I wanted something spicy and was once again steered in the right direction
The music being played is great the atmosphere is comfortable and completely unpretentious the service is excellent the food perfection
Taco Bell isn't authentic Mexican food either but sometimes it still tastes good
Got the combination plate I'm not very familiar with Middle Eastern food so I'm not sure I'm a good judge
The chicken kabob koobideh and beef kabobs were not very flavorful and slightly burned
We've had the Thai Chicken pizza which is good but a little on the spicy side and I also leave off the cilantro
Patience is worth it in this place the food and beer and atmosphere is just awesome
The pizza was pretty good the dough and mozzarella are made fresh
Service is friendly iced tea and of course it's the same delicious food as the original location too
Quaint atmosphere excellent food outstanding service and reasonable prices
The chicken itself was flavorful and had an okay spice level
The salad was actually very good but I wish they used chunk chicken instead of sliced deli meat
Super tasty food and surprisingly affordable
The mac and cheese was very tasty - served in a little cast iron dish so it stayed warm for a long time
I didn't have any food but the 'Sliders' were delicious
The margarita is wonderful and I like the unique flavor of the lime & avocado pizza
You cannot go wrong with great pizza sandwiches gelato & a wicked good  bakery
I had a seafood cobb which was HUGE and very tasty
The pasta dish someone else ordered looked quite good
They have an array of Chinese and Korean dishes which range from $5 for appetizers to $16
The beef with spicy XO sauce was good - could have been a little more spicy though
The prices are excellent for the amount of food you get
You might have to wait a bit for your food but its worth it
The food was delicious and the setting was as cute as it can be for living in the dessert
The pizza is always amazing and well made
well my patty was as well done as zanything I've ever had zero juice zero flavor jusym  VEY well done patty  meat
Possibly the best friend chicken I've ever had - golden brown and moist & juicy with excellent batter
The straight-up fried chicken is superb but I ordered mine smothered with chicken-onion gravy and it was soooo good
The restaurant section is pretty small and the decor is a bit old but the food is really good and quick
the fish tacos are tasty and the ahi tuna was ok not the best i've had
The times I have eaten there though the pizza was really good
This is a good place in my neighbourhood to pick up some fast food when I don't have the energy to cook pretty much always
Their fish burrito is huge and the tacos are small and super tasty just like in Mexico
Large shrimp fish good veggies and Crab What this place out did themselves
I also always do like enough sauce with our dishes so you can have some on your rice and its not dry and they did an excellent job
Just imagine perfectly cooked shrimp in a dish filled with flavorful garlic and butter sauce
I think the quality of the fish isn't super fresh but the rolls make up for that with the extra ingredients
I had like the cowgirl or something that was pretty good and spicy - perhaps that masked the fish more
Same thing when we asked for recommendations for a seafood plate which was very unhelpful
The food itself was ok my only favorite was the flavorful bulgogi
hee heeSo cool  I had the Sangria it is made with brandy I have never had  it that way before I had the chimichangas because I was told everything was pretty spicy I only look spicy I actually hate spicy food Flavorful yes hot spicy No
and the crema mmmm tasty but hot The atmosphere was cozy candles and great music  seating spread out I like that nice decor My honey had the fish tacos which had a sauce that was also hot hot hot but he said really good besides that his looked way more interesting than mine but what do you want I ordered a chimichanga lol  we also ordered the guacamole YUM
The food is surprisingly fresh and nice quality
Its ideal if you want to get good food for a good price on your lunch break
My friend and I were enjoying ourselves at a beer festival down the street - and decided that we needed better food than the hot dogs they were serving there at the Venue
When you ate the meat with the rice and beans it was alright because the rice and beans were actually pretty good
I have also had the Margherita pizza which is very good too
The food is good better than I thought it would be and served in big portions
If you can deal with that the food is incredibly cheap and delicious
I order the ca kho to carmelized catfish - my boyfriend said this smelled and looked awful but I love fish and this was really tasty
My boyfriend ordered the veggie rice noodle dish - he wasn't a huge fan of the veggie mix cabbage onions bok choy and carrots but I thought it was really good
Bland watery chicken salsa had no flavor even the mango salsa
Food was on the whole delicious w/ a few exceptions but it was the timing that ruined the experience for us
prices change across similar products by 2-3$ sometimes so feel free to shop around for water bottles and other food staples; the staff running the rides were decent people not creepy which can be the status quo; the ambiance is good not OVERLY ghetto but caution that after 7pm it gets more crowded with high school kids
Lots of other yummy dishes are served at Wally's such as burgers other pasta dishes salads that looked so good soups and they have daily specials like pork chops which that night came with a salad some sides and dessert
He even enjoyed the cole slaw which is a dish he usually detests
We all had sandwiches I the Curried Chicken Sandwich - how have I not had this before it was outstanding in flavor
When we had first walked in this girl's big FAT delicious looking cinnamon roll had caught my eye
The prices were a bargain relative to the quality of the food and I hope that people support innovative cooking like this
You'll find a festive atmosphere in the hot foods section the huge produce area and the rest of the market
This is a fun restaurant and the food is good
The selection was stellar and each of us thoroughly enjoyed our dessert
In terms of food the quality was the best we had all trip
Freshly sautu00e9ed spinach & onions ripe roma tomatoes tasty feta juicy button mushrooms and grilled chicken bathed in a zesty sauce and bundled into a tomato/basil tortilla
Even though you'll most likely have to wait in a long line for your food it is so worth it
I really hope they maintain the level of food quality and service
I highly recommend slowing it down a bit and concentrating on your food quality - isn't that the hippie style anyway
Overall a great dining experience with really good food and fabulous attentive service
They have a couple of vegetarian options for my herbivores some hardcore meat options for my carnivores and some delicious soups for those who don't want a sandwich
The taste of the food was good but nothing exceptionally special
The food here is good and better than average bar food
I've been there enough to have settled on a favorite dish the baja shrimp tacos also available in a tasty grilled fish which are amazing
Not the best pizza in the world but it's pretty good and VERY convenient
We did think the pizza salad and anti pasta plate was fresh and delicious and the wait staff was wonderful but really it isn't the best pizza in the country
Its a beef hot dog slather in lava which is their house made chili then topped with cheese and coleslaw the later making it shaggy
Anywho the food came out pretty quickly and everything was good and the employees were friendly
Torn between three and four stars definitely needs the half here but I'm going to round down mainly because I was really annoyed with the small menu board and while it was good I doubt I'll be going here again as I can make a pesto foccacia pizza at home that just as good and only slightly more work
The complimentary boiled peanuts and pickled carrot radish appetizer does wake up your taste buds
but mainly because I've eaten all over the world and have had some amazing food in a lot of cities
but this place is darn good and could compete in SanFran Toronto LA and a few other asian centers known for good food
see picsWild Mushroom pizza with pancetta green onions and mozzarella see pics  Boring  really lacking in any flavor at all
The sushi at pearl is really quite good
Probably a good place if someone in the group is afraid of hardcore sushi/sashimi
The only thing that could possibly improve are the chairs but with food this good I'd sit on cinderblocks and LIKE it
Food - always excellent especially Thai Salad sushi artichokes chicken soups
Nonetheless if someone ever asks me where to go for a nice slice of Sicily I will happily recommend Crust Pizza & Wine Cafe
I can't wait to go back and take more time to discover some wonderful products and new foods
I ordered my usual sausage roll which was delicious
As others have mentioned the food here is good
The food was good especially the ravioli and tiramisu
I remember walking into the restaurant thinking this will be a pricey dinner but to my pleasant surprise the prices they were charging for the quality and amount of food was a steal
The vegetarian pizza was very rich and flavorful although the caramel onions were almost TOO sweet
Sure the tasty burritos the size of Mom's meatloaf should be worth a few kind words and their delicious guacamole is some of the best at a fast food style Mexican place that I have had
Food*Bruschetta toppings are really solid but bread is a bit soft*Vegetable salad is really fresh but could use better lettuce*Tuna panini was really good and quite large for the priceDrink *Bloody Mary Martini with jalapeno vodka and fresh mozzarella garnish is where it's at*The glass of Albarino $5 during happy hour was really crisp and goodWhat makes the Living Room different is that it's much more of a swanky/loungey feel while the 5th and Wine spot feels a bit more cafe-like
Typical bar food cheese sticks fries wings burgers is sub-par - though we totally lucked out recently with a Rocky Point-style taco special that was actually really really good
I've tried the chicken version which is also very tasty
I tried the chicken only and it was also very good
Our piggy asses stuffed each light crispy and bursting with flavor chip into our holes dipping in all the different sauces waiting for our meaty burgers
I don't quiet know what it is about the pizza but I just can get frenzied about the goodness of it
Not fan-boy good nor brilliant and pretty much like the pizza - average
The chicken was good but not as good and there is ONE type of sauce for dipping and I do not care for it
We ordered 1/2 dozen oysters served on ice-cold black rocks porterhouse steak melts in your mouth scallops mesquite grilled shrimp and my grandpa had chicken livers though I've never tried them I don't recommend them
Had a business breakfast meeting on the patio this morning and I enjoyed the atmosphere the food and the service
Tempe has no shortage of Middle Eastern food and this is one of the good ones
The staff is very friendly the food comes out quick and is quite tasty
This included tender pork roast a beef roulade  a very tasty smoked pork loin a gigantic but light dumpling and red cabbage which I requested in lieu of mashed potatoes how stuffed can you get
I am not a Latino/Mexican foody but the scallops black cod white bean puree green beans forget the mexican term on the menu and the fried banana were amazing
That aside the food here is really good
There are exactly two things to go to Zoe's Kitchen for1 bland uninspired food2 pimento cheese sandwichesAll sandwiches or pitas I've ordered in the past have come with shredded iceberg lettuce and mostly-tasteless tomato so they're not exactly sourcing the highest quality ingredients here
Enjoyed the dumplings; Ahi was ok; pulled-pork nachos were meh; catfish tacos not so much
This dish came so highly recommended including a recommendation by the couple sitting next to us who couldn't hide their enthusiasm for this dish
The food is comforting to me -- delicious black beans & rice unbelievably tasty maduros fritos and wonderfully scrumptious pollo cubano and chicharrones de pollo
Aside from the pizza I found the appetizers and salads to be quite enjoyable
We ordered a small Works pizza which was excellent
I would only recommend going to Buca if you were in a group of 8 people or more so that everyone's cravings can be satisfied instead of having approximately 6 servings per dish and finding out that only one or two people in your party enjoy that particular dish
This is the worst quality of food I have ever had
I don't know about their normal stuff like tacos burritos or tostadas since I prefer to  go for what reminds me of authentic dishes but I'm sure they're good as well
They have a lot of interesting rolls and the sashimi is top quality as well
The prices are pretty low considering the quality of the food here
Their service is great but more importantly their food is amazing
My salad came out with their appetizers and thus I had the pleasure of sitting there with no food while they ate their entrees
I was excited to see the groupon for The salt cellar since it was pretty good last time and seafood is usually expensive
My husband's lobster was good however my king crab legs were fishy tasting and the texture was a little weird
All in all though I had a good time I enjoyed good food and there was a ton of stuff on the menu that would bring me back
Not only did it taste disgusting but I am allergic to cinnamon and having it in my food obviously isn't a good thing
I guess because I had always enjoyed their food before
The food was standard Paradise Bakery items with the same quality that you obtain outside of the Airport
Fortunately my first experience with Cracker Barrel was an extremely good one both food- and service-wise so I'm not going to say that I'll never come back to this chain due to this one experience
Being an Italian from NY whose great-grandfather owned a pasta company in Italy I take a lot of pride in my appreciation of good Italian food
The food came out in reasonable time was presented wonderfully and would have been photographed if my phone had flash
Most dishes fall into the $15-25 range which is a good value for the quality and portion size
I know it's a chain but you ask Beyoncu00e9 she'd tell you it's freakin tasty chicken
Anybody who likes some good ol' soul food knows this place delivers
Corned Beef Hash -- order extra crispy if you like some crunch like I doAll very good
We had the appetizer two entrees a soda a cappuccino and the dessert for $70
We later ordered our main dishes Tim got the Pollo Cubano and I ordered the Chicharones de Pollo it was all pretty dang delicious
This on the contrary was just OK it lacked cinnamon i think I have made way better arroz con leche myself If you like I'll share my recipe but the appetizer and our chicken Cuban plates were bomb
Thank you Havana Cafe for the great service and good food
All in all the pizza was good I can't take anything away from that
I've had similar quality pizza right here in Phoenix i
Also tried the fish rolled tacos and couldn't figure out where the fish went BUT the white sauce and cheese were good
25 beers in a mug and $5 pizza's and appetizers
The others tried the Fish Schticks or some other witty way of writing it and some chicken appetizers and the spring rolls
They all enjoyed their meal although the picky eater didn't like the chicken appetizer and apparently is now prejudice against all aioli sauces
If you haven't been here yet and you're a pizza enthusiast Classic Italian Pizza is worth your drive to Tempe
Takes forever to place your order then longer to get your food- even though with the open kitchen atmosphere you see your food sitting there getting cold
I was hankering for some good Chinese food and decided to try something new and I was sadly let down
I ordered the crazy hot chicken which was not so crazy hot it just had a few jalapenos in it
Also was not impressed with the sesame chicken or the super small sides of rice that came with our meal
Normally I would make sure I got the name of the dish right but since I am recommending that you not go there why bother
My friend is a pescetarian/flexitarian doesn't eat meat except for fish and we were really pleased to find that all of the dishes we ordered that we usually get with meat were still absolutely delicious
Specifically the Pad See Ew which we usually get with chicken or beef was still savory with just the fried tofu and perhaps even more amazing the Mussaman curry which usually comes with a deliciously braised beef was still really flavorful and was complimented nicely by the tofu
Inevitably this ends up as a free-for-all alcohol orgy that will always involve several Mechiladas they will make em for you if you write the recipe down on a napkin with the special final ingredient being lots of love as a reminder not to forget the extra love that goes into a perfect Mechi some chick-shots that sadly include Red Bull and something else equally garish so that it tastes like almost-flat Squirt a death swig of Wild Turkey out of the fanciest slingback shoe in the group If you do two consecutively we call it a Bingo-Bango several double-tall Vodka/Soda/Lemons 250 Parliament Ultra Light cigarettes and a single Chicken Caesar Wrap
I'll admit I had a good time catching chickens
The beef tacos are pretty darn good but everything else is just ok
He told me that they were a good size so I ordered 2 rolls for myself -- the Volcano Roll and a Crab Crunch Roll
My wife's roll had too much eel sauce for my taste but she enjoyed it
Anyway the food is pretty good for a sports bar
and delicious Blackened Chicken Caesar Salad huge
The food is always FRESH the service reliable and the flavors amazing
Food was on point the beer is good the happy hour specials seem promising and the staff is cool
The Spicy Ginger Soy Beef and the Pad Thai are both excellent and the Mint Lemonade is refreshing
If you want to see how good vegetarian food can be this is THE place to go
It came out pipping hot and we thought it was a great pizza
Everybody else enjoyed their food as well
The food was good and the service issues can be worked out but the concept seems confused
If you're okay with a noisy gastroclub instead of an intimate gastropub go ahead and come here because the food seems worth it
The wine itself was delicious but with the USDA Choice all-natural grainfed Certified 4 Diamond Angus Beef it was to die for
Been awhile since I've had a good NY style thin crust pizza
The white pizza was good but I would definitely say the regular pizzas that include the tomato sauce taste a little better and hit more on the savory and sweet parts of the palate
The ribs are the shining star of their happy hour food selection - they are very flavorful and actually have a lot of meat on them
The pizza was a very nice thin-crust not as thin as say Lamp's plenty of toppings sauce was good
The food was not good and not worth the money they are charging
Overall a very good place for vegetarian Indian food and groceries
They focus more on the quality of the real meats
i have always loved  whole foods but this one tops them all as they have an amazing bar with at least 20 beers on tap- microbrews and imports

it is worth it for the experience alone but the food doesn't hurt - that's for sure
If you want good food with friends and family this is your place
Both the Beef and Chicken were flavorful the sauce did not overpower the natural flavor of the food
The chicken was pretty good although it left a terrible aftertaste in my mouth I'm still tasting it 3 hours later
The food in the snack shop is good and very reasonably priced
I was very impressed with quality of the food and the establishment is fantastic
Down to the slightest detail they will provide you goods and they are surprisingly health conscious when approaching even the comforty foods that would seem otherwise
The food is always fresh portions are generous and the taste is amazingly authentic
They have burgers hot dogs and chicken sandwiches
Tasty Mexican food with reasonable prices
It was pretty good although I wish there were more chorizo in the burrito for the flavor of the meat to fully manifest itself
After coming to Phoenix I realized that good reviews don't necessarily mean good food
The food well it was good but did not blow me away
It was not a roll I would have ever ordered but my dinner guest thought it sounded good and to my surprise it was and at $4
Plus their milk shakes are excellent food is made to order and not under a lamp and if you stay and eat there seating is in abundance there are misters outside and the drink selection is plentiful
So hard to find good chinese food we lived in Avondale for 8 years and LOVED Wongs
Overall we had good down home food at a fair price
Good food great environment and a wonderful way to catch up with friends and the fact of not know what dish would be next/taste was a nice little conversation starter for everyone
I guess its meaning I was impressed without catching an uncontrollable itch
They have good polish food I notice a lot of european nationals come here - I recognize the languages
For someone who doesn't eat sushi much found out there are some very good choices besides the basics
The reason why I gave it a three was the quality of the food
Not my favorite all time pasta dish but definitely worth getting again and better than plenty of places I've dined before
Their chicken quesadilla is amazing and their food is decent but definitely go for the chips & salsa
You'll pay a bit much for the food but it is definitely worth it
The sandwich meat was extremely tasty although the bread was admittedly about average
Overall good service good safe food and a relaxed atmosphere
It was so succulent and fresh tasting and delicious but since this is a sushi place I need to judge them on the sushi
I would surely come back and try other things on the menu their pizzas looked really good too
They have pretty good selection of food choices in addition to the regular subs/sandwiches
But like I said the food was above average i had the burger and it was good the fries are exceptional
Teharu is a wonderfully inexpensive way to get to get a quick sushi fix especially if you're looking to try new maki or nigiri without shelling out too much cash
If you want to try higher quality sushi this is not the place you're looking for
Whether the food is good or bad one has to appreciate a place where the owner all-too-conspicuously wanders about the dining area during peak times visiting with the guests monitoring the staff and demonstrating her full control over the operation
At least the orange peel chicken was excellent but after starving that long anything would taste like fried manna
Delicious food - the chips are fresh and warm and the three different salsas are all amazing; the grilled peach salad was more like canned peach salad but still was light tasty and refreshing on a hot summer day; and the jumbo grilled burrito
The restaurant while said to be one of the best provided a meal that I wasn't overly impressed with but again the wait staff were so wonderfully friendly and accommodating the food didn't really matter so much
Streets of NY in Scottsdale is around the corner from us and they def have amazing pizza and killer good chicken parm sandwiches
Either way very good food and I've ordered many times since
If you're tired of the crowds that frequent the clubs in Scottsdale want some good food and live music you will have a great time at the Dubliner
Good food and airports are usually mutually exclusive
In this case the food is amazingly great probably the best simple food a busy traveller has ever had
Please other airports realize that simple good food is possible
You get great food great atmosphere good service parking a little bit of a challenge but I live right across the street so I just walk
The menu is minimal about five different pizzas appetizers and salads
We enjoyed the pizzas with Peroni which is a perfect pairing
Took out two sandwiches the hot chicken with Gruyere and a turkey and Brie
Turkey and Brie was good piled high with meat
I had no perception of this joint at all in terms of the space itself only a few word of mouth declarations of how good the food was
The only dish that was identical was the foie and thank goodness as it would have been a fight to the death for this slice of pure bliss
Very nice flavor here especially the Valdeon cheese a rich creamy Spanish blue cheese really made the dish for me
As for the food the sweet potato fries were amazing
That dipping sauce is so perfect and the cinnamon sugar on the fries makes you feel like you're eating dessert in a good way
They were very tasty fresh the chicken and turkey were tender pretty sure they make it in house
A surprisingly tasty soy-based sauce mixed with something vinegary made a wonderful stand in for nuoc mam fish sauce
It's more expensive than most Viet places I've been too but the quality of food service and decor more than build enough value for me to pay twice as much
Sure scoff stare mock; I'm Vietnamese and proud of it because our food is absolutely amazing
Its all good in the hood because the food is still good and the service is never mediocre and the atmosphere keeps me happy and comfortable
Then came the Mediterranean salad very good then the Kale something pizza which was totally completely unique
My son just loved it i mean i know my son he is so picky and fussy about his food and it was just 6 o clock and he ate his meal very nicely that means it was sure was delicious
I once went to a perhaps unsurprisingly now defunct Trader Vic's in Washington for happy hour and was impressed by neither the food nor the drinks - this is not that story
An almost empty restaurant making our reservation comic relief excluding the bustling bar area slightly after the end of happy hour on a holiday despite a well-decorated hall brimming with Tiki kitsch should have given us an indication but since I was there for a family dinner with a picky family and this was already a compromise location it was a bit late to change courses and among the goods for which we bartered were- Cosmo Tidbits $22 Enough fried and meaty flavors for three but nothing of note
I have a theory when it comes to Chinese food - if there are lots of Asian people there its prbably good because for them its food
The cheesesteaks are AMAZING; the fresh meat sliced and cooked to perfection and just oozing with cheese or cheese wiz
But eating is believing--you get a LOT of delicious food for your money here
AMAZING service food home made sauce and atmosphere
The salad was fresh and of a good size for an appetizer salad and my adult Mac and cheese was saucy with plenty of chicken bacon and mushrooms
Another tried the pepperoni pizza which he said was equally as good as any he had had
The food we enjoyed  at your restaurant this evening was equal to what we enjoy at home
Dined here again and was pleasantly surprised to see that they added more dishes to their already delicious menu
The food is high quality but not pretentious
We also shared the meatballs they were very tasty and a Mediterranean Salad
The sauces are pretty neat and the honey truffle sauce was pretty tasty but I don't know if I should have to rely on sauce to jazz up something like roasted chicken
For that I'll give it a few more months and give them another shot to see if they get their sea or chicken legs underneath them
I decided to stop by at this place with a friend of mine several months back-All we can remember was that service was acceptable food tries way too HARD and is very expensive for such small quantities- and we've both done extensive traveling and had amazing pizza this is not it
The bacon was good but the ends were strangely beef-jerky like
I was ready to love this place and all it's kitschy decorations but the food was just not nearly good enough
Blowing the whistle in the first paragraph might stop many of you from reading further but let me just say that Orange Table definitely has its merits the tasty food
I love hot egg yolk flowing over pretty much anything but on top of corned beef hash its like the best breakfast gravy
They take their delicious corned beef white onions mushrooms garlic and potatoes then spoon on sour cream and pair with 2 eggs your choice
I love the taste of good sausage paired up with pancakes so when the 2 thick meaty shafts arrived I couldn't wait to try one
The food was very good especially the hot & sour soup the sa cha beef and the fried rice
Tasty food and a cool atmosphere and with the weekday happy hour from 11am to 6pm your bill will make you almost as happy as the food
Their pizza is not bad by any means but they are more expensive than comparable quality places IMO
Joe's Sauce for their wings is a mix of their medium and Italian dressing and it is quite tasty but their wings are very low on actual meat quantity
As much as I enjoyed the food I cannot come here too often
If you want to stop by for breakfast on the weekends come early; I'm not the only one that thinks the food is good and is apparent by the lack of seating
Go in knowing that you're going to get good food but mediocre service and you won't be disappointed
After several places closed between 2008 and 2010 good food was getting harder and harder to find in 85259
I may not be a great judge of donuts as generally donuts is one of my least favorite desserts but these were some very good ones
Yesterday I had the Sonoma chop salad which is amazing and also grabbed a thai chicken salad for a friend and it's my new favorite thing
and the food is far from fresh  or tasty
Me So here I am at Uno's and this pizza looks good
Their pizza is delicious and their salads are fresh
So a couple weeks roll by and we decide to give it another shot
The place is a shite hole their rolled tacos are over priced and not so good
And if that doesn't fill you up there's del piero their small bistro that features sandwiches tasty fresh side dishes soft drinks  pastries & coffee drinks
The chicken and waffles were good chicken better than the waffles but my husband had the gizzards and gravy over rice
The chicken strips were plenty and they were good
The french dip was GOOD tasty beef slices and au jus was perfect normally I think most places makes it salty
The sushi isn't the best in the city - by far but it is good
Here goes-amuse bouche #1 - sherry scented duck consomme-amuse bouche #2 - chicken liver mousse served with a rye crostini whole grain mustard caper berry brandy gelee pickled pear onion and egg mousse-amuse bouche #3 - flash frozen fruit cocktail - this was delicious
-nantucket bay scallops served with gnocchi chorizo corn avocado and confit tomato great choice-amuse bouche #10 - bubblegum and lemon passion fruit lollipops-amuse bouche #11 - strawberry souffle served with a banana creme anglaise-amuse bouche #12 - vanilla whipped cream with a candied mint leaf - oooh; one of our favorites-brown sugar polenta - amazing dessert
This is not a Sports Grill you go to for crappy food and good beer I'd say it's a Sports Grill you go to for good food and crappy beer
There were performers fun and delicious food at reasonable prices and cute little shops everywhere you turned
The way you get quickly taken to the top and quickly dropped to the bottom floor of the hotel caused my ears to pop on both our arrival and our depature from the resturant but other then that the food was great and we enjoyed the view of Arizona
While I concur with many fellow reviewers that the place did not bowl me over and was a bit pricey I did have great service and good food overall
Not good enough especially being that this was one of their signature dishes
It was better than your average bar food but I think in this day and age of gastro-pubs and high end wine bars you have to have quality food
Plantain avocado spring roll with seasonal chutney - this overpriced appetizer was a terrible mess of mushy vegetables warmed inside a pastry and layered with mashed mandarin oranges
The fish seemed like it was cooked well and the escovitch sause was excellent
She is not one to eat spicy food and this was too hot for her
I couldn't imagine drier chicken than at Zoe's before last night but the jerk flavoring added to the bone dry chicken was the perfect storm to absorb any liquid from my body
Desserts were pretty limited and  not very good
While the food is good and the service is quick if not a tad over-bearing I think this place needs some tweaks
Language lesson aside this place can be summed up in three words; Poor quality sushi
The sushi was also of a lesser quality so I was just disappointed in general
You would probably need the drinks to mask the poor quality of the food
Gyro meat was pretty good portions were large and I liked the Tazaki sauce
I went and sat at the bar and ordered the food came out fast was good but service was ok not the best
JD's had good food and not just limited to fried bar food
I was very impressed with this pizza delivery place
Their pizza was delicious and their chicken wings were bigger than at most other places we have eaten
I would totally recommend this place for delivery pizza
Everything was beautifully plated in portion sizes that are appropriate for such rich flavorful food
We left no room for dessert but we can vouch for the bar  fantastic cocktails Bitter Bees was a really good one and if you're a white wine drinker either of the albarinos are great but the Licia was a perfect pair with the rich salmon
I think it speaks to the quality of food here
Food=amazing  We had the sea bass and filet and can't give enough props for how great it was
I take everyone I know there just so they can experience truly excellent Indian food
The cilatro-pesto appetizer thin crust pizza is rich and highly recommended if you're into pesto
But lucky for us we all truly enjoyed our food and time
super personable apparently I'm not because I don't recall his name and was really good at explaining the specials happy hour and tempting us with dessert
Oh and they sell high quality dog food at great prices
The Chicken Critter Salad greens jack & cheddar cheeses egg tomato and bacon was filling and pretty tasty
Go for either their glazed Chicken Lavosh pizza or their roasted Garlic and Portobello pizza both are full of flavor
well besides their~ -the most awesome location you can do dinner and a movie at Norterra -the young and uber friendly and accommodating staff -the fresh with healthy options and delicious food is their Happy Hours from 3pm to 6pm and then again at 9pm till close
Pls go to sushi Ken that is really the only good place for good ramen
The service was good for a party of 30 and the pizza great
We tried the Buffalo Chicken which was good and just a bit spicy
I've also had their chicken dishes a time or twothose are quite good if soup's not for you
Okay so using that I can marinate some pork chops and have these amazing orange-zested pork chops along with lovely saffron rice and vanilla ice cream for dessert
Decent flavor but small and it was one of those pizzas where you take a bite and all of the toppings & cheese come with it leaving you with nothing but tomato sauce covered crust
So that's what the boyf & I did & we were seated right away but then the pizza didn't end up being as good as the first visit
I would only go back here to sit at the sushi bar because they were good and the sushi chefs looked like a good time to have conversations while you eat
The spices weren't evenly distributed though so some parts of the meat weren't as flavored as other parts
I am going to try out a few other items before allotting them their fifth star but the fajita chicken wrap was pretty tasty
Truly not your high end restaurant with almost the same quality of foodIf you hungry and in this area I woulod recommend that you try the Good Egg
Their Best Chicken Sandwich is not so much a sandwich but a grilled chicken burger with lettuce tomato red onions avocado and some sort of amazing dressing that made the entire thing mouth-watering
$10 is not cheap for this dish but it's GIGANTIC and delicious comes with chips
It's unfortunate that their line is so long all the time but that really speaks for how good the food is here
Expensive is good when it comes to putting raw fish in your mouth in the middle of the desert
The sushi here is quality to the point that if I had no clue where I was in the US and was served what I ate here last night I'd have to say Hawaii or NYC
Breadfruit is a refreshing restaurant for anyone in search of delicious fresh and filling food
They have a good variety of dishes to choose from all prepared with fresh ingredients and all perfectly cooked and attractively presented
I had the guacammus and calamari and both were excellent but the seafood fresca really stole the show
You are sitting in a lovely place with fresh flowers and quality food where the napkins are linen the salad plates are chilled and the wine list is extensive and extremely reasonable
Lucky for me the owner was working that day and even though I was only going to be in town for a few days and I needed my bike up and running before I headed out he was able to use his good relationship with the manufacture to speed up the process of getting me a new meaty fork
ALL the food was good and it was still a little chilly this week so the bartender came out to the patio and lit the firepit to warm us up a bit
This place is nothing special to look at located on a pad in a strip shopping center but the food is very very good
I haven't had anything that's blown me away but I have had some good food that isn't too expensive and leave me satisfied
Last time we went I had the chicken and rice soup which was light but flavorful
While the food is good the service leaves a lot to be desired
The seafood tofu soup was good per a nearby taster
The food is first rate it really is good
I can't give it a 5 simply because eventhough the food is good and the prices are on par with many other places waiting 35-45 minutes for a sandwich is insane
Service is good and the food awesome time to get food not so much
Next came the jerk chicken salad--again--a wonderful complement of spicy chicken and mangos--the perfect marriage of spice and sweet
Unfortunately--I will not be going back to breadfruit--the food was generally good--but I would rather spend my dining dollar in someplace the recognizes that it is so easy to accomodate simple requests and the benefit to do that is repeat customers
Service was great drinks were fast the food was very flavorful with a nice presentation
The spanikopita and tsatsiki were pretty good and the chicken kabob platter that included attractive looking grilled vegetables was nicely cooked but also no seasoning
Although we only ordered appetizers salad and one entree between 3 of us we left a lot of food on the plates
I thought it was surprisingly cheap for how good the food was
Great prices and awesome access to source to high quality meat
All of our food was prepared fast and it was quite delicious
The food wasn't horrible but it wasn't even close to good for how expensive this dump is
The broth is flavorful and the meat is cooked exactly right
Other dishes on the menu are just as delicious but for me when I go to a pho place it's all about the pho
As many others have commented it is hard to keep food fresh warm and tasty in a steam tray
The atmosphere is fun their selection of music is amazing and the food is excellent
You get to grub on DELICIOUS sushi while also people watching mostly middle-aged folk cougars mostly going through what seems to be a mid-life crisis
But damn if I had a choice these dishes may just be the ones I'd want to eat before my final goodbye
That may be ok if you want to grab a slice of pizza maybe a hot dog or something else small and easy to carry from one of the nearby restaurant; but it seems like more of a hassle going from place to place just to find something to eat and carrying it back here
Pita Jungle is a great green location where not only the food is healthy but it is so delicious
So my dinner was a veggie burger which wasn't the most delicious meal I've ever had but sure beat having to order a plain side salad or tiny dish of steamed veggies
My first visit was marred by my expectations of the food and although quite good in itself with taste and quality ingredients it took awhile for me to come in for another visit until this morning
We loved their antipasto platter the first time around - it was almost a meal in itself with good quality cheese and meats- for $11
The pizza crust was good but we order sausage and sundried tomatoes and there was hardly any sausage on it and the tomatoes were quite dry
Last time they brought a pizza like this to our table by mistake and it looked so good we knew we would have to try it next
I was up sold with sliced cold chicken to go on top an excellent offering
My drunken noodles with veggies and chicken was also very tasty
They didn't hound me for anything anddidn't ask if my food was good when my mouth was full of food
I saw another friend there and talked to her the next day and she said they had the roast beef panini and she also said it was amazing
Like most establishments in this niche they are what some would call pricey but the food is good and if you're a Midwestern student you get a discount
We order the server was knowledgable however after a long wait our food arrived they had forgotten our appetizer
The food's flavor was good and our server was attentive and pleasant
The curry chicken my girlfriend ordered is thinly cut and good quality meat
The service was terrible and my chicken was made from low quality parts it seemed
We got an appetizer of the Chicken Satay
The crispy honey chicken lunch bowl is delicious and the employees are nice
The decor is still outdated the service was excellent the food was great
We split a caesar salad huge a meat and cheese plate good and the Toscana pizza yummy if a little soggy
The hot dog and chicken panini are also tasty and who can forget the Classic Standard Burger
It's a problem I know I need to work on not eating when I'm not hungry but food is so GOOD
My gf didn't share the chicken taco with me but said it was very good
An amazing restaurant has three basics covered1 customer service 2 great food offerings 3 an overall great experience
I tried the egg flower soup yummy pork fried rice good mongolian beef not bad and shrimp chop suey not bad
It was basic fast food chinese fare good but not great
I had gone to the Yelp event at the Science Center and was absolutely floored by how delicious the beef tongue with bone marrow au ju was at PM
They were good-but after having to wait basically an hour between the appetizer entree and dessert I was just looking forward to getting out of there
Goodcents at least slices the meats and cheeses in front of you
Can use some work on some of the dishes but overall good but not great
I ordered the chicken tikka masala at a hot spiciness level
I was disappointed in this naturally as usually Indian dishes can offer both flavor and spice
I doubt I will ever return here as the food really lacked the flavor that most people expect when enjoying Indian cuisine
I think Buca thrives on the quantity versus quality philosophy of most Americans when it comes to food
and the sweet potato chips that come with the dish was just so good i was full but couldn't stop eating
I had the buffalo chicken snackers/sliders which came with the salad bar which was fresh and had some variety; however not worth $9 on it's own
As to the food we ordered several appetizers entrees and dessert
The fish was fantastically fresh and delicious
The house chardonnay was perfect for winding down after a sweaty day and the food was delicious
I definitely recommend the fresh spring rolls such fluffy noodles
So diners I still consider this place a good choice for authentic foods
It's a little pricier but worth the quality and amount of food you get with each plate
Ordering the meals went smoothly food came out in a decent amount of time and the margarita drink was good flavored not that strong
The pizza came and was actually very good the mozzarella was the fresh kind not too much cheese the sauce was a thick puree without being chunky
I would have liked the horseradish sauce to be stronger and the aus jus to have more flavor but all three were ok
The meat had a good amount of fat on it which is typical for prime rib
The fish is not fresh and the rolls often have little differentiation in flavor
All four of the meats are pretty good - they're all pretty much equally good so no real favorite
As they prepare the dish there's a few minutes to put together a bowl of rice a bowl of pretty decent hot beef soup and some chips and sweet and sour sauce along with my drink all of this is included in the price
I haven't tried the frozen yogurt but I think it was pretty cheap like a buck so if you're in the mood for dessert it's definitely worth it
Despite my preface of I'm going to skip on the apps and order an entree because I want to have dessert later Ana asked me AT LEAST two times And what would you like for an appetizer
While I enjoyed both desserts I'd had two tastes of the pie before I asked for one to-go I favored the pie
Now one could suppose they had a busy lunch time and the food is good or not
I chose to think it was good food and a busy location
To break it down I would say the food was good but not exceptional so 4 stars
chicken corn chowder introduced to me by the harbinger of good soups and even better taste my dearly departed best friend Andre mushroom and spinach soup HUGE meaty mushroom chunks with tofu and spinach in a light chicken broth
it's light but flavorful and my aforementioned sparring partner/boyfriend is crazy about the salt and pepper beef which is a reasonable and edible facsimile of pepper spray when you get it made like he does
As far as the food goes I love the Devils Chicken Fingers and the Blu Burger is absolutely amazing
Good if you want to see the movie they are playing bad if you just end up going to meet up with people for conversation and food as you cant really talk when the movies are on
Totally about 4 escargots here not a lot of food but very tasty with the escargot's cooked to a perfect texture
Easy atmosphere good food  a young friendly staff
OK she loved the pesto chicken I enjoyed the Mexican
The meat section is ok but it doesn't shine when it comes to quality and selection
I am a very patient person and I was shocked at how long the food took but the food was so good that I had to keep it at 4 stars
I've heard good and bad about Grimaldis but I love all styles of pizza so I had to try it
If you are looking for good brick oven pizza Patsy Grimaldi's is a nice choice
This is a nice joint with a relaxing atmosphere and good service but I still much prefer the other NY style pizza joint La Piazza al Forno
This was a very good quality pizza with fresh ingredients
We also ordered the white pizza which is mozzarella garlic basil oil and absolutely delicious
Again though we prefer the La Piazza's take on the white pizza but this was also very good
I wish Zen32 was better -its one of the few sushi places in the Biltmore/Arcadia area but its just not good
We were very impressed by the quality of the food and service there
J and I also shared the fried crawfish as appetizer
The broth was salty and not very tasty and the rare beef wasn't very rare
And nothing beats good food for not much money
I started with the Butterfish and it was really good
The main flavor profile was the sweetness that permeated the beef brisket the pork rib the hot links and
My favorite was the baked beans and the house made rootbeer which had an almost medicinal kick to itOverall the food was ok and the fun retro atmosphere is worth the vist if you're in the area
The poor economy has kept the 30000 dollar millionaires at bay and the childish attitudes of the hotels employees' with it
I was so stoked for the Crepes and Craft beer event@ Hanratty's w/Truckin' Good Food but I can't say I could 'rave' about any of it
Anyway their regular food is good too - steak sandwich salads etc but just make sure you leave room for the bread pudding
We had also a deli meat/cheese plate and holy crap was that good
It reminded us both of our trip to Italy and the quality meats there
they are done on quality breads and stacked with alot of meat
The starter pizza which is just seasoned bread with cheese is SO GOOD
I'd recommend trying it out on the weekdays for lunch if you're going for food night time if you're going to try and work your game or Saturday nights if you're into the whole TAP OUT and AFFLICTION scene
The food isn't really that good and the place is not clean
The food was not worth the price it seems like this restaurant thinks they can get away with murder because they are all over organic ingredients and gluten-free crusts
Could be great just seems like they've got no soul and there is no real attention paid to the quality of the food which comes across as just profiting from the bandwagon
SERVICE The service from both the sushi chef/owner Mo and the wait staff was excellent
FOOD As usual I can't recall everything we ate but it was all very fresh and delicious meticulously and attractively presented
I realize that fresh quality food isn't cheap and takes some time to make but I have time constraints and a different price point for a work lunch
The latter order is a ridiculous amount of food at an unthinkably low price which happens to be ludicrously tasty
The sesame studded bun was large enough and dense enough to hold in the mound of meaty goodness
What I Liked Quality meat fresh baked buns tasty ingredients top-notch service
However if a burger is about the meat and the bun then this place has got the goods
They all said that the food was okay but too pricey for the quality
My question is does Phoenix simply not have very good Thai food and so everyone thinks that this lackluster spot is delicious
All the dishes and sides were wonderful and the service was super friendly and prompt
He made some good points - that exercise alone doesn't suffice when it comes to health and that food plays a major role
It's definitely a WIN when you can feed two hungry college aged boys and yours truly for under $15 bucks with some delicious food
Here is my rundown* #14 Bootlegger Club = very good and the meat looked to be less processed than some other sandwich places
Every time I've gone the food has come out quickly and the water has been replaced quickly but man it's so good I really have no problem waiting for it while I suck on a margarita
I know it's New Mexican cuisine and not technically Mexican but it satisfied the gaping hole in my heart for delicious Mexican food of the variety I enjoyed while living in So Cal
My wife had the seafood halibut and it was simple yet delicious
The kung pow calamari appetizer was really a very busy dish
Dinner for 2 2 drinks 2 appetizers 2 main dishes 2 desserts
And while the dinner menu is a bit small the food was excellent and reasonably priced to boot
I have been to True Food 3 times now and i am very impressed
Now to the food- the only time i have ever heard of olivelo juice and it was delicious
The food is very VERY good and the prices are reasonable for the large portions they serve
As a vegetarian it is sometimes hard to find delicious and flavorful food when going out
I wasn't sure I'd be able to find a light bite to eat I was expecting heavy Irish bar food but I was pleasantly surprised and I really enjoyed my house salad with salmon
My last night in AZ I thought it'd be good to attempt to get good Mexican food again
They have good bar food and there always seems to be a fun crowd having a good time here
This is some downright good food with affordable prices
This hotel is like a little piece of paradise; the lobby is open to the outdoors allowing a gentle breeze to permeate the hotel air
The Southwest restaurant becomes a breakfast restaurant in the morning with good food and very fresh fruit
What I enjoyed even more was the atypical meal offering; a big curry chicken sandwich my first experience
As far as the sushi goes the shrimps were good along with their fried heads
Hard not to appreciate this place when they give you reasonably good sushi for such a reasonable price
The pizza has a garlic flavor to it in the crust which we do not mind
We had the 5 cheese plate you choose 5 cheeses from a list accompanied by dried fruits and lavosh crackers the green chili pork stew delightfully spicey with chunks of potatoes tomatoes red onion and just the right amount of cilantro the C4 Signature salad mixed greens with pulled chicken mangoes avocadoes and an amazing habanero raspberry dressing and
The food was really good but not anything unique or out of this world
Service is still pretty good the wait can be a bit long the food now is just ok
And The Parlor is more than just pizza salads sandwiches and friggin' good apps
The choices were not many and the food was not good
The sauce is fantastic the ribs are delicious and very meaty and the chicken is delightful
The staff is friendly and helpful and the food is prepared with exceptional care to be absolutely delicious
the chicken shwarma is also really good flavorful without being weird
My drink was never empty food was hot and fast
Based on service and quality of food I give this establishment 5 stars
Food is very good though pricey and cost of drinks is commensurate
While both the restaurant and banquet food was good it was not 5 Star
When a counterperson asked me what kind of mayo/dressing I wanted on a chicken salad sandhich and I asked her what the choices were she pointed to 8 different bins all of which looked tasty but none of which I recognized
The quality of the food is nothing impressive but I can't really say I have ever eaten anything there that was bad
all dishes were good tasty not bland and definitely filling
It came with cold chicken tasting as though it had been boiled
I had the pasta all'amatriciana dish despite the fact that it not being traditional with the addition of onions and hot peppers etc
Their style is like a gastropub a modern house which specialize in serving high quality food in Europe with a splash of Southern Mix
We appreciated the chef really focus on the food freshness and quality
I personally had the Philly Chicken Pita and it was smothered in delicious melted swiss cheese
When my food finally did arrive it was amazing
The chicken lettuce wrap looked amazing but upon tasting it tasted like you were eating mainly salt
I enjoyed the vegetarian pizza when I was there last and thought it was mighty tasty
The only thing I ate yesterday was the chicken quesadilla which tasted good at the time but wasnt worth the throwing up and food poisoning pain for the last 6 hours
I am Vietnamese and this restaurant has my stamp of approval for authenic cheap good food
I also appreciate that Jackie makes an effort to have a seasonal option on the menu at all times and prices all the food at what seems to be a very fair value considering the quality of the food
It was super crowded pretty noisy these are things I can forgive if the food is good
Only sat for a few minutes when my food was delivered and boy did it look good
Yes the food is good but we had a breakfast sandwich and a small salad
For dessert I would recommend the cake n shake
For the quality and the attention to detail that is spent to create the variety of cocktails and food the value is definitely justified
I cannot stress enough how wonderful the service was and how delicious the food tasted
Food- Grilled artichoke appetizer was $9
I ate here with my sis n her hubby bubba it was good i have not ate at one of these places for a long time i skipped over pizza section of the menu and had the jambalaya not sure how to spell it but it was good could of been spicier i prefer mine with rice instead of pasta either way it was yummy to scarf down like i hadnt eaten for a week also had some appetizer items asparagus n arugula salad light n yum n some guac n chips also fresh and tasty and some egg rolls of some sort also on the app menu they were too effin good
A photo shoot began at the table next to us towards the end of the meal so the chef comped us two desserts for the inconvenience
I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to eat here but if I was in the area this a definite bargain lunch place for the quality of food
The sauce was absolutely flavorless and made the entire dish including the tortilla chips into a soggy mess
But I'll deal with my steak being just warm when it's this amazing - not an ounce or gristle or fat just pure tender beef like butter perfectly seasoned
I ordered the seafood pho and while it was okay it definitely lacked flavor
Both had a very authentic Italian flavor that accompanies food made with care
I have no complaints about the food delicious
We never felt rushed and simply enjoyed some of the best pizza we ever had
They flavor their food in unique ways I would never even think of and it turns out great
My friends got the chicken bbq burger and turkey burger and they were both impressed as well
They should call it Mongolian Onions flavored with a few pieces of beef
and soup is good when your sick and the portions are large I also went ahead and got my regular crab puffs and orange chicken
The chicken still could of been a little more juicy but for the most part I would say this place has improved on the quality of food since the last time I ate there
This is such a great Vegan coffee and dessert spot even though I am not a Vegan or Vegetarian I love the yumminess they have here and once you have a Nami you will fall in love with their soy goodness
The food also looked excellent but as I mentioned we had to run but I wish we had more time for food
Well folks I'm here to tell ya - this is some good pizza and wings
These guys are about eight dollars cheaper for a large pizza and a dozen wings than those other guys and while I don't think they're *quite* as good they're definitely good enough
The rest of us can just stare at our iPhones pick up the delicious pizza and wings and run back to our sign-free homes
It's always a lot of fun to take my Monstah there and scrub him down with the high quality shampoos and temperature controlled water
Sacred Hogan has very good authentic Navajo food
The meat itself was good as were the tomatoes and red onions
you have seen me three times this week and although I am slightly burned out on your delicious Americanized Mongolian BBQ I must admit that you have become my new favorite mall fast food
If you are unfamiliar with choosing your own adventure so to speak it is a pretty good idea to go mild the first time and go easy on the complexity of your chosen dish
My Fiancee and I are quite familiar with this sort of food and as such went hog wild and went for broke when piling up the topping and experimenting with the vast combinations of delicious entrees
The Bad;While overall delicious the sea food selection could use some work scallops were very fishy gross calamari was still frozen and the shrimp was bland and tasteless
The Good;Steak and Chicken seemed fresh not frozen although couldnt be sure tasted pretty good for an inexpensive meal
Unfortunately for those of us that like good food AND good service the food is crave worthy- better than any breakfast I have ever had so simple and so so yummy
We'll see- life is too short to hold grudges especially when good food is involved right
We ended up with an appetizer of 2 crab cakes and she got a shrimp Po'boy which came with fries and I got the chicken Florentine which came with a salad garlic mashed potatoes and some sauteed vegetables
I should have known when the waiter guy a chick appeared later said in response to our stuffed cheese pizza order I don't recommend cheese only
He wasn't from Chicago but had been there and had pizza from there and thought this Oregano's pizza was so good
the food was good but not something I'd crave
see pics I really don't care for red meat anymore but their Rib-eye is Delicious if your a steak eater
The fish was the sweetest most tastiest Cod I have ever tasted and the Corned Beef was cooked to perfection and complimented by the extremely flavorful caramelized onions mixed with melted swiss cheese
we had to skip dessert but definitely next time as it is a very good looking dessert menu
If you are looking for really good cheap and somewhat late night I think they are open till 11pm mexican food you've got to try Rosita's
But on the bright side I had most of the appetizers sushi satay and grilled shrimp to myself
If you want a Scottsdale vibe with overpriced drinks and unauthentic food then this is not the place for you but if you want home flavor cooking with fresh ingredients with an authentic smile then don't miss trying out this great new hot spot
I was hoping to try the spicy squid which the other reviewers were raving about but it was no longer in the menu so I tried the spicy beef instead; it was a tasty stick-to-the-ribs meal especially with the kimchi and spicy beansprout sides that came with it
Describing the food and the flavor is hard to do because it's not as hot as Thai not as spicy as Indian but definitely not Chinese
The sauce on the white pizza was so good and the peppery arugula made it melt in your mouth
And the Wild Boar Meatballs with the delicious cream sauce
If you like good margaritas and good food than this place is perfect
Cool place nice atmosphere and good food to top it off
The swordfish was served with some kind of barely side dish VERY good the fish was terrific would definitely get this again
Unique atmosphere friendly service very good pizza and fresh peanuts that you can throw on the floor
The prices were great food was tasty the service was excellent and they even treated us to some complimentary desserts
Instead of a small amount of fresh sushi going around it was packed full of rolls that could've been there for hours getting warm I didn't notice any quality control
Tasted like grocery store sushi; very fishy and didn't have a really fresh flavor at all
I was especially interested in the ones that said the sesame chicken was not good since Ashley L
The price for both of us was $19 and was well worth the food and the service that we received
No I am not a street performer but work for a local advertising agency and the restaurant options if you are looking for good pizza and wine or beer is non existent
I would recommend for lunch either going for the turkey & brie sandwich or margarita pizza with your favorite topics
To sum it up if you want some good food cheap with the risk of getting killed in a drive by shooting then this is your place
Look it's a slightly upscale diner food that is well worth every $ you spend and every calorie you consume
Maybe I hit it on a bad night but the food was not good at all
Having just moved here from the Bay Area where there is a Whole Foods almost everywhere I have to say it was a pleasant surprise to see things here not in the CA stores like the wine/tapas bar the cooking demo station in the hot foods area and a wider variety of pre-cooked/smoked meats and chilis
I ordered mine without lettuce cause that's how I roll and the tacos were excellent
It was really good one of the top pizzas I've had
The sushi was great everything was fresh and tasted delicious
The crunchy roll was delicious and the spicy crab rolls fantastic
Pros  Quick service nice ambiance tasty food
This is just the type of hole in the wall type of place where you can always count on a cold beer in a frosted mug and some really good options when it comes to really unhealthy food that rocks
I forget what dishes I've had but I know the few times I've been there everything has been damn good
You really can't ask more than good company and unreal Chicken Fried Chicken with mash and gravy
The delicious soul food spot I've only ever been to in downtown Phoenix is coming to my neighborhood
Overall though my table loved the food and agreed it was worth indulging
The food was fabulous and the drinks were amazing
The food was great I'm picky about my jambalaya - and it was very good
We went to order our food and the people who work there know us and that we're very good customers
The fried rice was a good tasting dish though
Elegant setting Knowledgeable waiter amazing food
Regardless the food is definitely decent here not fabulous not marvelous but very good sick or not
We were the only two people in the place and would have thought that the owner to make a good impression and show gratitude for what business he did have might have come by the table to ask how the food is make small talk or anything
The food Pork - Great Beef - Good Chicken - Good Ribs - Sucked
The egg roll was big thick and loaded with goodies
Always enjoyed the atmosphere which has not changed usually the wait staff is competant but the food was always great
Good condiment to meat ratio and flavorful
The other thing I really liked was they have a value buffalo chicken burger which was actually really tasty
All in all yes its fast food but its a different flare with unique options and arguably better quality in some areas
The concept does not stay away from making their food delicious while using the freshest and most organic ingredients
For dessert the flourless chocolate cake is just amazing
If you can get past the freaky blue wasabi that does look like playdough as someone else here said you have to try the following-Ahi Tuna Poke - so fresh and yummy-Seared Yellowtail with jalapeno sauce - a bit of a kickThe special rolls are good too
Probably because the prices aren't bad the menu looks like it should be excellent and the quality of the food isn't that bad considering the restaurant is quick service
The Honey Chicken which was quite flavorful only came with five or six bite sized pieces of chicken and the Mongolian Chicken was so over sauced that the rest of plate had no other taste
The inside looks like Mexico the food wasn't very good and the cafeteria/microwave issues pretty much summed up this is not a place for a nice night out dining
I; however only slightly fancy basil and found myself scrapping a good deal of it off my pizza
The pizza at Humble Pie is okay but not worth the 35 minute wait to be seated
The fish is so fresh and selection is amazing
Friday march 4thAn amuse bouche appetizer  salad entree and dessert and sweet for UNDER  $30
In fact the uglier the better as I suspect there is an inverse relationship between the quality of Greek food and looks of the restauranteur
The meat was cold and tasteless and had been carved hours earlier
Now  The pizza is good prepared well and quite tasty
the selection and quality of their meats are the key selling points at von hansons

I did learn last night that if your legs start shaking uncontrollably that's a good thing
Aside from that debacle their food was very tasty
Since the food was good I'd give them another try
The sandwiches are tasty and fresh the soup is always good I recommend the chicken coconut curry and the pastries are top notchchocolate croissants
The boy and I made our first trip over to Dragonfly Cafe for our usual late Sunday morning breakfast 230ish by the time we got there and were pleasantly surprised at how tasty the food was
The beef is high quality with no grissly bits and the toppings choices are many with plentiful almost too much volume
My theory when it comes to pizza is simplicity and good ingredients
Get the margarita pizza and nice salad a great bottle of Italian wine the wine list is extensive and priced well a seat on the patio and you'll have a wonderful evening
But pizza connoisseurs like us have tasted the finest Napoli treats and I'm sad to say that although topping wise Lamp does a truly good job to source excellent product the one singular ingredient to create remarkable pizza missed the mark and that my friends is the pizza dough itself
The price is not expensive for all you can eat and the quality of veggies meats and noodles are excellent
Both slices were good but after one bite of my cheese pizza
I wanted to lick the plate clean and then go back to the kitchen and demand they fill my pockets one with the smooth creamy more-like-custard-than-flan flan and the other with the wonderfully sweet and subtle citrus sauce they coated the dish with
I have never in my entire life enjoyed a dessert as much as this one
We topped off the whole thing with a little lunch pack for Cadie from the cafeteria and got some amazing Mexican food from La Tolteca right down the street for Michelle and I
Scottsdale prefers looks  over substance so it likes nice decor in favor of good food as exampled by the many large formula restaurants with million dollar decors but mediocre food
But when I ordered Cha Gio egg rolls the 6 little crispy rolls came out beautifully plated on a large quality made and decorative platter and unlike most orders for this in those dives which usually come out on a plain little white saucer plate by themselves here they were accompanied by several large leaves of romaine lettuce pickled and julienned slices of cucumber and carrots sprouts basil leaves cilantro and of course Nuoc Mam fish sauce to dip them
But I took the leafy lettuce put an egg roll on top of it and sampled the veggie ingredients on top of that rolled up the lettuce and dipped all of that fresh tasty goodness into the Nuoc Mam
So I was impressed and happy with the refreshing mix of fresh veggies crispy rolls and tasty fish sauce exploding into my mouth
95 fancy appetizer with Scottsdale pizzazz
Perhaps a little sweet for the Low Fan but very beefy savory and not too mucked up with masking ingredients to distract from the true flavor
The meat pieces were whole and higher quality than most I have had with good tenderness
I had to ask for the separate condiment dish where I mix the half Hoisin and half Sriracha to dip my meat into so as not to destroy the flavor of the broth
I even called up my Viet friend in San Jose who could tell I was smiling over the phone which they usually only notice after I have had good authentic Japanese sushi or tasty and cheap KBBQ
50 bowl dives on the coast but the decor and quality of food and the service from the owner all combine to make a quality experience
So this is perfect for Scottsdale with the nice decor but with the added bonus of tasty quality food
We were craving some good Vietnamese food and after reading all the 4 and 5 star reviews of this restaurant decided to give it a try
Meat in all the dishes was tender but not very flavorful
Won't be back and with all the good options in town for excellent Mexican food I was sad that we did not find a good new place to frequent
They had some nice combinations for their pizzas and the calzone sounded good
The pizza hoagie came with a generous amount of cheese and delicious tomato sauce
I ordered the meatball and it was amazing
The Why  Helmed by Chef Cullen Campbell and highly praised by local palates I respect Crudo seems to have all the things I'd hope for in a local restaurant; high quality sourcing a strong sense of community and a unique but focused menu - in this case raw seafood hand pulled mozzarella and house-made pastas
Additionally while speaking of my waitress considering the fact that I was obviously interested in the food it would have been nice if she acted more interested in me as a diner - instead she did not inquire even once as to how I enjoyed a dish and asking questions felt more like attempting to drag forth information while she instead spent time describing the menu at length to a needy woman who wanted all her dressing on the side and modifications to myriad dishes
Crispy Pig Ears - chili vinaigrette  Setting the tempo early this dish is all about flavor and while the texture is largely that of the crackling pork ears and chewy cartilage within the flavor is a bit sweet a bit sour a lot of heat and a lot of porky sapor
Butterfish - tomato lardo arugula  Call me crazy but I don't really get the fuss over this dish; sure the smooth texture and mild flavor of the fish are conducive to the overall flavor arc but with the lardo shaved particularly thin and the oven-dried tomatoes quite intense there simply was not much here that could not have been achieved with a bit of salt and fresh sliced tomato; the flavor something akin to a bland BLT and the arugula not particularly notable at all
Grilled Mozzarella - tomato grilled date basil  For my money the best savory course of the night - a strong compliment considering the fact that a lot of the food was quite good - this was simple and intense each ingredient packing serious flavor and all brought into harmony by the smoky warm mozzarella
Risotto - Squid Ink Chili Tuna Tomato  Apparently a bit of a signature dish at Crudo and the only one my server would offer an opinion on aside from 'everything is really good' I must say that although I've had better risotto in terms of texture the balance of flavors here was really something else - a subtle sweetness from the tomatoes melding beautifully with light heat from the chilis and the confit tuna' bold flavor standing up admirably in the face of the slightly gummy rice
Apple Frangipane Tarte  Outsourcing their desserts to Tracy Dempsey Originals I knew the quality here would be high and with a boring sounding panna cotta vs
The vegetables are fresh tofu is good and meat quality is okay I don't eat meat often but my husband who does gave this assessment
Tucking into the food though nothing is mindblowingly good so much as straddling the line between yummy and blah
Case in point the matzoh ball itself was bursting with the flavor of schmaltz chicken fat - essential for a great traditional matzoh ball but the broth was so flat I found myself seasoning my soup at the table
I'm very happy to find this place so close to work and the prices are a bargain for the quality of food being served
Craving a delicious artisan pizza and bummed to discover that Bianco's is closed on Sundays we were determined to track down the next best thing
The sandwich was the best of our dishes juicy and tasty
Dinner review ;Mediterranean Chicken was really delicious served over spinach artichoke and broccoli
The pizza looked wonderful - will have to try it when i allow myself carbs  and update my review
The food was definitly good but I cant say I was like holy crap that was like a angel farted in my mouth
Mind you there's nothing wrong with the food it's still fairly delicious but it just didn't seem as spectacular as it did before
For the dessert their cookies and milk it comes with this amazing ice cream not milk and the flour-less chocolate cake are recommended
It looked like soggy roast beef that surprisingly tasted very dry due to overcooking served in an old hot dog bun
Food inside the stadium is disappointing so we recommend you either tailgate or go to Westgate before or after
We had great gellato sushi and would have gone to Yardhouse which in addition to beers from everywhere on tap has an excellent menu
The best thing about the gluten free menu was the GF Flourless Chocolate Dome- it was an amazing chocolate dessert despite the $5
Aside from the beer the food is AMAZING
I highly recommend stopping by for a brew and chicken rolls to watch a game
There are also hot baked potatoes macaroni and cheese and other homey food offerings for Souper Salad diners
I didnt feel good after eating the food
If you want good vegetarian/vegan food and don't want to spend this much or deal with the cramped atmosphere go to Green
From simple chips to salads to the amazing chicken sandwich I ate I can't find one bad thing to say about them The decor in the lovely place is stark and white and very contemporary
The salad was good too except that most of the chicken was burnt
Not only does it have some of the best food my husband and I have ever tasted but it has wonderful and friendly service a nice atmosphere and is only 2 minutes from where we live
Everyone thought the food was delicious I had the Chicken Avocado salad it was okay
I think it would be a good place and would try the other dishes as well as come back some evening to see how it is
Aunt Chilada's still slow roasts a variety of delicious meats chicken and vegetables over aged mesquite wood every day
I also ordered the orange chicken and the spicy chicken general tsao's which were exceptionally good too
I love the diverse beer selection and after telling the guy what I liked in beer he picked the Kronenberg which is what I drink on tap at Cornish Pasty which I get to drink with delicious food so he was totally spot on
I gotta lose 15 lbs so I had the Chinese Chicken Salad and thought it was very good and a decent size to make a meal for a guy
+1 for pretty good food +1 for good service -1 for cost
We had the hummus which was very tasty but a little thin and a mango tandoori chicken pizza
The menu reminded me of the Good Egg but service was awesome and food was good too
Jamie had the roll-up breakfast sandwich - it looked good too
I just had a wonderful evening at Atlas Bistro and I have to say that the food there is some of the best I have ever had
The building looked like it belonged in the midwest or even the dirty dirty so I ordered the fish sandwich which in my starving haze looked and sounded good but was horrible
I was not quite ready for dessert yet so everything else I ordered was to go a pint of salted butter caramel madagascar vanilla & peanut butter chip ice cream sandwiches a bag of housemade marshmallows & a bag of sea salt caramels see photo
Been here a few times and the Sushi is fresh and amazing
While the sushi and ramen here are pretty good I must say that their Teriyaki Chicken is a rather regretful order
Don't let the run down strip mall and the location right next to a DES office turn you off; good food keeps this place going
For my entree i usually get the Gaeng Ped pork Thai hot which is a red curry dish with bamboo shoots
But if you tend to buy high quality food/cooking items you'll probably find they have the best deals on what you're looking for
Growing up with my parents owning a grocery store you learn a lot about food selection and quality
The fish really melted in my mouth the breading was flavorful but not overdone just a bit salty but I've been cutting down on salt so it may have seemed moreso to me
mainly due to the fact that my experience with crab cakes in Phoenix has involved too much filler and low quality crab meat
I just expected an amazing out of this world pizza for that kind of time
Food is meh; greasy bar fare that is only delicious when you're 5 sheets to the wind
Great food and well worth the drive to Chandler
So TL;DR        For our first time here food was excellent but service was so bad we won't be back
The food itself is not really bad but not like mind numbingly good either
The place has a dedication to serve high quality food and is ready to get you wasted in a family environment
But the food was good enough that I will come back again next time I'm downtown
food and atmosphere are not worth the trouble
This is truly a mom and pop locally owned restaurant serving up delicious South American dishes
I was excited to try their shrimp and fish ceviche served the same way we get it in our favorite Argentina/Columbian restaurant in Miami which is in a large goblet tons of flavor and spice enough to serve two
I recommend getting their Tamales Sampler which consists of a red shredded beef tamale which was excellente' ~ wound up ordering a couple to go a white green chili with queso tamale also excellente' and their Ecuadorian tamale which had pork tomato carrots and cheesy goodness wrapped in a banana leaf
My friend had their Seco de Pollo ~ chicken stew which was a wonderful dish and a chicken empandas for an app
Who knows these writers may be from Ecuador and somewhere in South America but what I do know is the food at Mi Comida Resaurante Latino taste as good as or better than some of the best South American restaurants I've been to
My full review with photos can be found at http//forkvsfood
The grilled meats are good but it can't compete with other restaurants that have the burner in the center of the table where you can really char the meat up
I had the Chicken Taook which was amazing especially the garlic dip that accompanies it
The Chicken pasta I had was very good but this restaurant is just not my style
The prosciutto and artichoke pizza is absolutely delicious -- always
Been there all times of day and the food is amazing
Do not agree with one writer here that it's too spicy but I am a native having grown up on hot food
The food wasn't all that good and if the customer says to go then you should put utensils and napkins in the bag for me
I had wanted to go for awhile even though they got a large amount of negative reviews but they were mostly about the restaurant and the fish quality which I don't eat anyway so I figured it would be fun to try the vegetarian rolls
So after we finished our appetizers the rolls came out and started filling up the table
Everyone else said their fish rolls tasted really good
The food was good the service was not too bad
Nestled in a condominium complex this wonderful 26 seat food bar gives front row viewing to the complex culinary skills of the kitchen staff
I highly recommend the cinnamon dusted sweet potato fries - they were excellent with a really yummy dipping sauce which helped them from being too desserty-sweet
I shared a few dishes with my brothers girlfriend - started with the Hot Goat Cheese and Wild Mushroom Arugula salad - it was pretty big and the dressing was incredible
While I was waiting for my food which wasn't long it was done pretty quickly I took a good look at the place
I'm used to great flavor without the bbq sauce and meat that falls off the bone
Pretty good selection of freshwater fish about 10 tanks of saltwater mostly invertebrates and your common clowns/tangs/angels and reptiles - bearded dragons sulcata tortoises corn snakes etc
They sell the exact same things as food city for 4x the price same company owns fry's food city and AJ's because they know that a tamale will be something the whitebread customers of AJ's will consider a delicacy unavailable outside of the Spanish Mass at their local catholic church and worthy of more than $2 apiece
Not only are the pizza's great but their burger is AMAZING
They are also a good place to take the kids since they bring out gold fish as soon as you are seated
I have had the pleasure of sitting with several Yelpers each time and I don't think any one of them ever complained about the taste of the food which is pretty good as Salvadoran food is not near as common as Mexican
for in betweens we had some meat balls which was pretty good something lamb which was very tender like pulled pork and sauteed calamari without breading which wasn't bad if you like lighter flavored marinara sauce
It just might be very well my new favorite quick food place It aint no fast foodI likeVery niceEugeneEdit Been there a bunch more times and its always good
We finally ordered and our food beat our first round of drinks by a long shot
The food was good and the rolls were unique I was just disappointed there were so many rolls with spicy in them
We ended up ordering 2 appetizers 3 specialty rolls 4 martinis and a bomber and had more food than we knew what to do with
I think the food is worth the price and the porch is great for casual wine drinking  I'll definitely be coming back
precious little I'm sure but I will say the following-- I always get the Casablanca Chicken Sandwich and I continue to love it each time-- The cinnamon dusted sweet potato fries are so good but if you're afraid of the cinnamon being overpowering ask to have a light dusting-- The music inside is usually a bit too loud for moderate-decibel level conversation; if the weather's nice outside go for the patio-- 8pm on a Friday or Saturday night will be packed and filled with slick-dressed diners you may have to wait for a bit-- No matter what if you live here you will be coming back at some point because your friends will make you
There was a cab driver who was very helpful in explaining the different dishes and even recommended a few items
We also chose to sample the small spinach pies which weren't that good btw and cheese pie which I could make at home with pizza crust & some cheese and the yummy yummy hummus that came with some pita bread
The food was good typical bar food but the service was really lack luster
The food is alright there are dishes on the menu that you won't find in normal thai cuisine like the Crispy Calamari Salad although it was good
95 for some seriously good authentic pho at that hole in the wall place across from MCC but hey I guess you pay extra for the atmosphere and location just don't expect the food quality to match the price point
Both of them were good in recommending the food to us
I think it is a bit above the average restaurant price but with its quality in food and service we will definitely check back
We got a 2nd serving of bread to sop up the yummy broth but it's endless bread with the dish so they really want you to get all the goodness out of that bowl
Sometimes it's just the simpler things in life which stand out and when I can enjoy a delicious lunch for under $5 I'm a happy girl   I LOVE this hamburger and I generally don't eat red meat 99% of the time
Soft Buns that hold up to the fixings Don't get Soggy Flavorful meat 80/20 most likely
We were looking for some good Italian food so we decided to visit Tomaso's
Luckily his counterpart who was serving the next table over took pity on us and refilled our bread basket and water glasses offered us fresh ground pepper for our appetizer and  answered our questions about the dishes our own waiter had abruptly plunked down in front of us before bolting back to the hostess station
Produce looks good nice liquor selection great deli with a wide variety of heat and serve entrees that are actually good sushi etc
They have a way of always cooking the bread perfectly so it has this slightly burnt crisp to it; it's almost like you're eating a sandwich made out of really good pizza crust
If you do have a little wait time to get your food be sure to go next door to Lux where you can get a pretty good cup of coffee/tea and laugh at the sheer volume of trendy hipsters completely enamored in their MacBooks
You know the food is going to be good and authentic when Engrish is involved the online menu lists Stirs Fries and Fried Rices
Recently everything has gone downhill and the quality of food is terrible
The overall quality of  the food is going down fast most noticeably with the wings
The fresh bread and butter was an excellent start the chicken-cilentro and boston cowder soups are great
Yes there are times when the place is overflowing and you may feel like you're eating with the table next to you but the food is delicious
The flavors come together in a tangy sushi-licious yes I made up a word kind of way
The quality of the fish is so-so and the portions aren't really all that great
Sundays 1/2 priced bottles of wineRetro modern spacious designTasty pretzel buns n' brew combinedAre simply divineDidn't like the crabmeat and artichoke dipFlavor was out-stripped By competing with the spicy pita chipsWill be back to try moreAfter all there's a new menu to exploreAnd plenty more beer to pourHope I don't pass out on the floorA great place to flirtTo hear the latest dirtIn the women's restroomWho's dating whom
but in rating the restaurant i would give it 0-1  food was not tasty at all
With food and service worthy of a long-established restaurant you'd be surprised that FnB has been open only a few months
Smaller than your standard chicken it's amazingly flavorful and juicy
What came out was 2 okay ribs 3 piles of cold shredded meat all of which tasted very similar that each had a drizzle of generic bbq sauce on top and weird not-good-at-all bun
The food is high quality as would be expected from a restaurant such as this
In a city lacking in quality Chinese food and no Pei Wei does not count The Prime is a welcome addition to my takeout rotation
Good sangria interesting patio area felt more like an alley but cool great chips and salsa and good food at a good price
There were no complaints about the food one bit - it's worth the money and memories of a special place for an excellent meal
The food always tastes so fresh and full of flavor
I always like a little extra oil on my pizza and this was just what I like a little extra flavor and a bump in heat
The naan is delicious all of the lamb dishes are incredible and the veggie curries are top-notch
Their food doesn't inspire me to eat there so all I've had are appetizers so far
the food is consistent excellent and affordable
My wife and I don't need that much food very often but it is an amazing deal
A charming comfortable spot with good food and good service
I've had in my opinion 5 star sushi and this is not it but it is still good
But I did see the cutest pregnant server who I was very impressed with her running around serving food-- she must be tired after work
We got a nice variety of sushi and it was all tasty
We orderedSpring rolls appetizer Fabulous phochili burgerblissful fried riceThe food is delicious and the menu is great as it shows pictures of every item
Definitely worth a try if you are vegetarian vegan or are interested in introducing your family even kids to healthy meat-free food
The shredded beef taco's however were pretty good and so were the tortillas
The pizza always tastes fresh and delicious so I love going to eat there
I like this Los Dos Molinos because you still get the amazing food without the wait
I have a Boston Terrier and after I saw someone else post on here the pets welcome sign they had featuring a BT this was tops on my list to try to get to - and luckily I was rewarded with amazing food
While the bar food nachos was edible it was served cold
This is good Mexican street food small hand made corn tortillas with flavorful moist meat on them and some warm salsa on top
Again the dough was so overworked that the pizza was too chewy and not in a good way
The dessert they push is the Salted Caramel Budino it is good but as a sweet tooth person I didn't finish it and that is a lot to say
On the other hand my hubby's dessert the Affogato was delicious
The flavors are real simple and has a soul food feel to it regardless of what your ethnic background may be
They were very busy that night so the food did take a little while to get but other than that the service was good
Sometimes the ribs & chicken are too dry other time they are good
The sides are nothing special but apple crisp dessert is worth a try
As for dessert the warm butter cake is amazing
With so many 5 star reviews and a number of people on here raving about the freshness and quality of the food I had high hopes
Our favorite appetizer is the Kilt Lifter fondue and you can't pass up their infamous chicken chopped salad
The grilled chicken salad was tasty but it was overwhelmed with tortilla strips
My overall experience was wonderful and I would recommend if you're one of those foodie bagel types
As long as the food is delicious and plentiful the service fast and friendly the cost is palatable  and the atmosphere clean and pleasant I will be a fan of any place
Yes there have been a couple of waiters that are a bit slower then others and some of the dishes were not as good as others but I can always say that Cheesecake Fac is a safe bet if you want a nice meal that will fill you up along with decent service
Here are a few of my suggestions of what to order so you don't go wrong Appetizers- Sweet corn tamale cakes- Fried chicken sliders- Avocado Eggrolls- Fried Zucinni small plate - Their small plates actually have alot
They are like the size of a normal appetizer that is not on steroids- Clam chowder or creamy chicken and artichoke soup - Believe it or not their clam chowder is the best I have ever hadEntrees- Chicken Costelleta- Chicken Chipotle Pasta- BBQ Ranch chicken salad- Salisbury chopped steak- Crispy spicy beef- Bang bang chicken and shrimp - Only order this if you like Indian spice flavorsKeep in mind that everything is massive in size so in my opinion the prices are pretty decent for the amount of food you get
All of the food was delicious and well worth every penny
Had this gone unnoticed I don't think that even the wonderful food could justify a one star rating
In the end you can't argue with the quality of the food or the prices
Everything we had was pretty good but it is more chick food than anything else
I also love the idea behind this place - a place that specializes in quality Arizona foods AND wines
They are only getting three stars from me because while the food was delicious the service was abhorrent
We ordered a lot of food and enjoyed that portion of it but when it came time to leave we also had to flag the waiter down to get us our check
But I have to say that it was pretty good for AZ Pizza
Shortly you end up in front of the meat guy tell him which sandwich you want what kinda bread you want it on and so fast his hand will blur he slices the bread puts some delicious pastrami brisket Corned Beef or whatever on it plates it and slides it down to the fries guy
I've never really tried any of their hot specials although they always have something like a baked fish on Fridays some days enchiladas BBQ chicken Cabbage Rolls and of course like any good Jewish Deli Matzo Balls - These dishes are all very tempting to me but I cannot break away from the sandwiches
let me preface by first saying that i have never had salvadorian food before so therefore i do not know what good salvadorian food tastes like or is supposed to taste like so this review is strictly from my american palette and what i think tastes good
got the appetizer platter with the meat pie pupusa rice beans and tamale
the meat pie was cheesey and delicious as was the pupusa
So far I had one sandwich with fake chicken with BBQ that was pretty good
My husband and I have been looking for a place where the food is good and has a great atmosphere and we definitely found it here
we both ordered the california chicken sandwich and it comes with those delicious fries red robins are known for
the food was tasty but don't think i would return to this location because it is not close to me
If you're a Fili-food rookie I highly recommend you order from their all day breakfast menu
If you prefer beef try the Tapsilog also super good
This place has a good selection of signature pizzas
I have been to True Food twice now once for breakfast and once for dinner and both meals were excellent
The food was great and I found the service to be excellent
Pretty girls good food and a surprising selection of decent beers
The lovely duo of Megan and Gretel took care of me with good food and drink and everybody I met there was really quite friendly
We started out with the Ahi Tuna Salad which was amazing however 5 minutes after we got that our food came out
Chicken feet -- Overboiled skin and not very flavorful sauce
This was one hell of a good meal best chicken fingers I have had in Arizona and real deal waffle fries the whole meal was so good
Pita Jungle's food is still delicious and insanely cheap for lunch or dinner and I will continue to go back again and again
Go for lunch and you pay a fraction of what Modern Steak gives you in return - an upscale experience top notch food good selection of wines and a full fledged coffee bar
Quality service quality food and quality atmosphere
When I can walk into a restaurant sit down and not have to wait long for my food then I'm impressed
They have ALL the important Japanese standards Ramen Soba Donburi as well as tons of fresh fish and amazing roll creations
Given it's location Hula's is a good place to go but don't expect to be blown away by the food
The food I had the chopped salad was amazing
The menu had a nice selection of seafood pasta and a nice steak but I settled on a burger which was cooked to perfection very delicious
Not only is the food good the owners are warm and genuine people who care about their customers and the community
My recommendations The hummus the steak and mushroom sub w/fries or the chicken salad-stuffed avocados
I met a friend for lunch and just got a appetizer because i wasn't that hunger and of course I got the beef on a stick
I thought I was going there for the kids fun and for good food
Really instead of spending all that time trying to make your place look like Jersey and NYC spend that time practicing making good food
Their pizza looked good and I want to come back and try the po-boys
Killer platters -- I recommend the New Mexican Platter tamale relleno chicken burrito beans rice
After I moved the relleno off the other items I would get a piece of tasty chicken ahh the burro
I have never seen this dish anywhere else it's worth a try
Of course once 7am rolls around I head on down to New York Flavor a few units away as they have more of a breakfast menu and I think a tastier brew of coffee
I have to say the fish was very fresh and delicious
We both enjoyed our sushi and I have to say the combo my husband had was delicious as well
If you want some really good sushi you have to check this place out
The beef were good too but the shrimp was better
Overall the service was good the atmosphere was nice and the food was very tasty
Food was well-portioned and delicious --everyone raved about the chef's creations and no one took home doggie bags
*To complain about the tuna in a spicy tuna roll being mashed because it ruins the texture and the flavor of the tuna
Sincerely if its texture and integrity of tuna flavor that your looking for perhaps you shouldn't be eating a roll where traditionally you mash the tuna adding a slew of spicy seasonings into it
PROS *Pleasant server              *Good sushi quality fish nice cuts
I know what you are thinking Well this guy is cheap a$# and unlike him I'm willing to pay for good food Yeah I am not that guy either and I'm willing to pay for good food too  but when 3 people have lunch and your bill ends up being over $150 for some small enchiladas and a few margaritas you soon realize the owners are banking on its hype and jacking up those prices just for the heII of it
this place is another trendy flamboyant read Gay owned restaurant that serves good drinks offers trendy waiters that pretend they are the food version of a Sommelier and act like they have a PhD in food and know so much more about chicken enchiladas than you do so for the average Joe white dude in Phoenix they are impressed by this
Salsa is tasty if not a revelation like the rest of the food
The food's good enough that it's still worth going however
The food we ordered was good - my wife had fish tacos I had calamari
Several things made this lunch fantastic in addition to the great friends and delicious food two specific things earned Switch the extra star
There are myriad ways to get this point across- they could bring my food half an hour late with no explanation or apology which of course means cold food
They could also change the quality of food for the worse that's a big one
However it seems that David's Hamburgers and Mexican Food wants me to continue to give them money because the quality of the food is consistent and delicious the delivery is right around the proposed time and the customer service is perfect
The selection is great and was also very much enjoyed by the two non-raw foodists/non-vegans in my party
I really had the feeling that she cares about her customers and goes out of her way to give them a great experience and delicious healthful food
I ordered the creamy garlic chicken pasta which had a very tasty sauce but the chicken was just alright
The food always comes out fast and the service is usually pretty good; someone will usually offer to refill your drinks which is nice for a fast food-type place
My friend had the roast beef panini and he said it was pretty good
You can argue about which city has the best pizza but those kids up near Lake Michigan have got the hot dog market covered
In all honesty their Meat lover's pizza was good but it was nothing special and same goes with their other pizzas
All the other pizzas were good but not good enough for me to come back
Delicious generous portions of Chinese in every chicken pork beef and seafood option you can imagine
For dessert we had the stuffed sopapias and they were very good
Their clientele is also well to do but they welcome every one even folks like me with kindness good service and good food and I happily pay the higher prices
I need to be able to remember it when I'm away eating normal people food and doing those things that reasonable rationally-minded people do with their free time when not eating hot dogs in heathen rituals and talking to dolphins
Oh also they charge extra for all-beef hot dogs
We have been to NOCA a few times and it's going downhill in food quality
The service has been a bit underwhelming but the food has been small but good
I had the italian beef from Al's and am not impressed at all
Given our hunger levels we also ordered a couple of fresh Spring Rolls and shared a pot of hot tea
Mom really enjoyed her savory dish Mine on the other hand was just fine
But to be fair I am giving them 4 stars for providing a clean establishment good service and reasonably priced dishes
My boyfriend ordered the spicy Ahi sushi roll as an appetizer
The poblano mashed potatoes was a good dish but again a very very small portion hardly more than a couple mouthfuls
I would never complain about that we were on vacation and expected to pay extra for everything but it just wasn't good food or enough food and that's the problem
They delivered my food was spicy and delicious
The Caesar pizza is delicious and perfect on a hot summer day
Bottom-line good food good service and affordable prices who wouldn't be a fan
I hope that it beefs up in buisness cause it is good
The descriptions and ingredients in the dishes should make for some very flavorful and decadent dishes however when tasted there's nothing special about them
But when you take a bite you are left feeling empty unfulfilled confused how such a great sounding pizza can deliver such little flavor
The sauce is very good and the oven-baked pizza is very tasty
The ambiance of the restaurant was cool and the pizza was good but with horrible service its hard to support this place
fresh hot and yummy Mongolian food cooked in front of you in minutes and I can say not only is the food great but the price for a family of seven is great
We saw a few hawks and eagles learned about the local vegetation including a really cool clubbed saguaro found out when the fishing season was and enjoyed some great local beers Four Peaks on the boat
The inside of the boat is climate controlled the front gets filled up very quickly and while the top deck is well-shaded the end seats can get pretty hot in the warmer months
So good that I suspect they're slipping in fat kid crack into the food
Good food great beer selection really bad service
We were pleasantly surprised at how good  the chicken isThey have no parking lot or waiting room you wait outside for a place to sit
We had appetizers and sandwiches one day and a salad and pizza the next
That said they do a decent job with bar food like poppers fries & hot wings now
They have a wonderful selection of produce seafood frozen items dried goods and even pots and pans
Since they were offering a really good special on a 2000 bottle of Perrier Jouet of Champangne that topped off the night while flute in hand we strolled the gorgeous groundsOK seriously
We both enjoyed the spinach artichoke cheese fondue and the cookies and cream chocolate fondue for dessert was divine
The emerald chicken which everyone seems to like is quite good
The bagels are excellent and there's nothing wrong with the food
My sis fighting a cold wanted the Baja Fish Tacos
This place has to be one of the nest values in The Valley- inexpensive with great food and desserts extremely clean and with excellent service
We've tried the little pizza roll and it was good just a little heavy to get as an appetizer if you are getting pizza too
The food was amazing but at $50 a plate it should be so I won't elaborate too much
I'm also surprised at the number of reviews here claiming that it's nigh impossible to find good Mexican food in Phoenix
althought i would be the first to say that there is an extreme dearth of good Chinese food in the whole frickin' valley this is definitely on the LOWWWWW end of the spectrum
Clean place good service good energy not so great food
The appetizer courses were separated by a serving of sushi
Def worth a try but I would warn them that there are a few things they could work on food isn't one of them
They had good beef chimis and a yummy green salsa
The quality and temperature of other items like the red chili beef seemed to vary quite a bit from visit to visit
Their roast beef is an excellent choice too hot or cold
The food is so hot that even when we get it home we still have to let it sit for a few minutes
If you can afford it and understand that pricey doesn't always mean a large portion but does mean excellent food then I highly recommend The Compass Arizona Grill
Other than the food being pretty good amazing for fast food but they have Family Nights on Thursdays http//www
Scale of 1-10 multiple visits8 Food9 *DRINKS*8 Service8 Atmosphere7 ValueDon't underestimate the power of a good Marg
The margs are strong the food is yummy they have Hatch chilies galore four delicious sauces in the free chips&dips and sopapillas included at the end of the meal
I'm not a huge fan of most egg rolls as they tend to be greasy and flavorless but they have one of the best egg rolls in town
The wonderful Audrey & I decided to share a burger and a pizza
I'm not going to tell you that the rolls are amazing the nigiri mind blowing and the alternative menu super creative
The pizza was good thin crust good on toppings
Portions are balanced and food is tasty & presented well
It is only a short wait from when you order your food until they bring it to you and it comes nice and hot
Taste  There were many many delicious choices on the menu and sadly the food is not as appealing as billed on the menu
Plus they have an amazing array of prepared foods throughout the day
Mega sports bar meets the style of Hard Rock Cafe and food quality from a local delicatessen
The fried rice was the only thing I would consider worth eating but was full of the same canned-chicken processed crap
They pride themselves in making their delicious homemade Italian dishes but most importantly it's all about their pizza
Recommendation start with the antipasto salad 4 can share this have the pizza and end with the most delicious cannoli and a cup of coffee yum
Mom had the Japanese chicken curry noodle bowl that was full of flavor and the noodles were just the right texture
Consistently delicious South and Central American food that you can't get anywhere else in the valley
It's better than mom's cooking good thing she's in Miami and won't read this and defines comfort food
To finish off your meal order the coconut flan dessert; a delicious combination of custard and coconut in delicate proportions
The pizza was good but totally gave me the bottom bubbles later hahahhahaa i know TMI so be careful
It is good for a more authentic Asian food
Their stir fried chow fun rice noodle is good the boys tend to Really enjoy hunan beef
Overall Great service Comp valet A bit hard to find if your flying down Camelback Quality food
Aside from being pretty the parlor serves up good food too
I ordered the pizza of the day which was an amazing combination of peaches and pruchuitto
They only carry premium high quality dog foods
True Food Kitchen is about as healthy and tasty as food can get in the Valley
Anyway the food is to be experienced and it's well worth it
This was my first experience trying Cuban food and I really enjoyed it
My wife has Ciliac disease no gluten diet and they make a wonderful gluten free pizza
Went here for lunch and the food was pretty good and I liked the Breakfast at Tiffany's inspired decor
We ordered buffalo and beef sliders with hopes of juicy delicious meat
This review is based on delivery service and food quality as delivered
My hot sub is ice cold there's nothing like the taste of cold greasy bacon and chicken close to 100 AM on a Monday now Tuesday night
Unfortunately like most hot food the taste quality substantially decreases the longer it sits
Food wasn't quite paradise but it was tasty and filling
I don't care if the logic of the theme fails as someone noted humorously - the food is good awesomely good
I think what put them over the top was the strong mesquite broiled flavor from the chicken
The food was good but the SERVICE SUCKED
This place had absolutely amazing hangover food
Focus on the cheap drinks and the amazing food and you will love this place forever
I can't wait to go try their FOOD and see how it holds up to the amazing reputation of their salsa and tortillas
The E61 espresso bar is separate from the main dining order line but you can order food while sitting at the bar I recommend this option
If the food is from Chris Bianco you know it's going to be good  but was tad dissapointed at our antipasto plate
The menu looked good actually and I'll definitely try the food in the future
That being said when they do have my order the food is always fresh and flavorful
My friend had a killer salad with buffalo chicken and I had a tremendously delicious burger with avocado jalapenos and salsa
I first had Z Pizza in Long Beach and I thought it was pretty good
I really wanted to like this place and maybe it was because I didn't get the pho but the quality of the food was just bad
It's perfect every time & on top of the great food the service is excellent
We took home some GF cupcakes and the cinnamon roll delicious
Had I not been with colleagues the resulting exchange with the general manager when my food arrived would have been something worthy of a youtube video
Add to this a scoop of the normally-a-side-dish red bean soup which was probably pretty good on its own; the bean mixture had bits of something like ground beef
I'm told the huevos rancheros with beans was an excellent dish but it is no longer on the menu
And one would think that a pita with only lamb meat and lettuce sounds too simple to be so tasty but it is
Usually I can eat a lot of pizza but when you get something that tastes so good you can have a few pieces and be set
Though I've never tried any of their more typical Italian offerings their sushi and Asian noodle dishes are delicious
My companion had the aroz valenciana which was tasty and I had the Elianas favorite which was grilled chicken with that terrific latin american creme cheese
The service was consistent and friendly and the food was tasty and a nice break from all the Mexican joints in the area
I was wary of trusting Yelp after the debacle of culinary excrement served to me at Wineburger but Rocket Burger delivered the beefy goods
After a while I ditched the bun and went to town on the meaty goods
If you're patient the food is pretty good
My boyfriend and I decided to take a trip to Scottsdale from Flagstaff mainly for business but someone recommended we go to Fashion Square for food and shopping
Omelets were good spanish corned beef and spinach/feta were among our orders and filling so we took our bagels smeared with cream cheese to go for eating on the road
Added to the authentic flavor of the placeFood was delivered to our table despite the counter ordering
The food is AMAZING and they have a great wine list as well
She opted for the Gagou Dog which is a hot dog topped with cheese and pepperoni ultimately converting it into a pizza dog
The whole novelty of the pizza dog is so simple but really good
That's a good indication of what's to come if the chef if is that confident in his food that he assumes you will like what's on the menu
The whole dining experience is very inviting and the food is unique and excellent
You're getting Original level Garcia's food overseen by Garcia's family members in an amazing location and it will actually cost you less
I had a chicken dish while my hubby enjoyed the surf and turf special
All the other food corn veggies Frys were cold but we did take out so I'm not going to go too far with complaining about that
Nothing better than great jams while enjoying yummy food with good company
The food gets its own category because holy miss moly this stuff is good
Also just a side note they have the really cool new Coke machines that allows you to mix flavor into your fountain drink as seen on Food Network
We went for a couple of appetizers to share and a dessert along with wine pairings for each dish
But hey it is still very creative yummy tasty food
Delicious food with beautiful presentations nice ambiance super friendly staff and excellent services
What we had today might not be yours even if you ask for the same four course tasting menu because the chef receives different fish and other ingredients based on availability and seasons but no matter what you have i'm sure it'll be just as amazing
My friend's marlin was good but my other friend's catfish gumbo was really salty
They even gave us a complimentary dessert which was their butter cake with vanilla icecream and it was really good
The pizza dough they use for the crust is very good
My boyfriend and I are always on the hunt for good sushi places and were thrilled when we stumbled upon this place
There is a deli fresh seafood in some cases so fresh it is still alive beer and wine saki and other cooked meats frozen foods packaged products cookware and utensils and an entire aisle of every kind and flavor of ramen you can imagine and guaranteed to be the best you will ever have
It comes in a big bowl with rice noodles tasty beef and lettuce
The place is minimal and nothing special but what does make this special is their staff and of course their food it is not great but just good enough to fulfill your need of Buffet Chinese Food they have many selections i would have to say about 20 different offerings i have never seen any buffet offer Egg Foo Young and that was such a great treat only because i love the dish
Eastwind is one of my lunch go to spots because it is delicious fairly-priced you can get some of the same dishes as Cherry Blossom for cheaper and has a friendly staff
Branching more into unknown territories of International foods Burmese has been on my radar since reading about a wonderful place in San Francisco
However they have a pretty good selection of other foods - the seafood section had crawfish king crab legs fried crab shrimp periwinkle scallop salad on the shell and cooked salmon
The sushi/sashimi I had however was not so good -- the salmon sashimi was warm so was the mackeral sashimi and the one hand roll I had was not really edible - it was chewy and I was a bit afraid to eat the fish cause it didn't seem so fresh after all
The other food sections they had were meats - bbq pork short ribs good taste but chewy roasted duck sausages korean bbq ribs teriyaki chicken and some grilled octopus and zucchini
Besides the Frat Boy atmosphere my only beef is one time I was shooting pool and the waitress somehow got about 8 shots on my tab in addition to the 5 beers that I did actually have
She said that all of the soy protein has wheat in it so she recommended the tofu dishes
We usually order take out the 2 times I ate at the restaurant service was poor and food was not as good
Luckily every time we order for take out the food has been very good
They fixed any issues with their rice but the Crispy Orange Beef was tough and flavorless the Mongolian Beef was so salty I practically had to give myself dialysis
The service is pleasant and attentive but there is a LOT of room for improvement  in quality and consistency with the food
The parking is a nightmare but the food is really good and healthy
The BBQ Chicken Pizza was also really good
The Chimayo Chicken was $24 so a little pricey but considering it feeds more than one or feeds one for multiple meals it's worth the price
We were originally a bit impressed -- they seemed to have a wide selection of interesting and different rolls
The rolls came and looked great -- presentation was definitely good
Overall even without the hair in my cream cheese I probably wouldn't have gone back -- the food just wasn't that good
You can really taste the true smoked flavor not sure why one reviewer didn't believe the meat was smoked in a smoker it was obvious to me
Their complimentary chips are delicious and they don't give too large a portion so as to avoid not having room for the main dish
He was a huge fan of the meat believing it to be of a higher quality than others he had at Mexican food restaurants
My fish tacos were delicious and gone in about two minutes
I tend to judge authenticity and goodness of Mexican food by a how much beans rice and cheese do they pile on and b if I ate nothing but beans and rice would it be delicious
On the recommendation of the server I got one of their chef's special dishes the Ciambotta Di Pollo e Salsiccia
The spicy and regular BBQ sauce that they served on the side was excellent for dipping the meat in
They didn't season it with very much so it is an excellent steak if you enjoy the unadultered taste of meat
The quality of meat here is indisputably excellent
But overall the waitstaff was good  and the food was satisfying
Spicy but yet I could taste the flavors of the red curry dish
For starters I had the Mongo salad which to my taste for spicey foods was nicely flavored but overly dressed; the husband unit had the calamari which was nothing special other than a HUGE starter with rather pedestrian rounds and lacked the authentic quality of true calamari fritti such as Kuleto's in SF
Great staff salads wings and thin succulently tasty pizza
The sushi was fresh and tasted pretty good
The food was good but not super however the chef will accommodate any food cravings you may have
I've gone with the Kosher beef hot dog fries pickle and tiny pop for a grand total of $5
Didn't care much for the thin crust pizza appetizer
On a perfect night I recommend that - good food and good weather -- sign
We had an appetizer two entrees dessert 2 glasses of wine and a beer and our bill came to $68 pre-tip
For dessert we had the dark chocolate with almonds - typically I don't eat dessert and I definitely don't eat chocolate very often but for some reason it sounded really good on Saturday night
The chicken drumette was crisp and flavorful
The egg rolls were good but not great and the wings were a little disappointing
I'll definitely go back for the pizza but may wait a while for the hotness factor to wear off a bit
Although it is a good spot for friends on a fun night out I would recommend lunch or a mid-week visit as a good option for anyone wanting to check out the food rather than the weekend scene
I think I got  lucky ordering the one tasty dish
The ground beef and shredded beef tacos are excellent
I was traveling solo and did not feel like the restaurants were conducive for solo dining; however I did have room service several times and the food was always very good
It's a solid choice if I need a quick pizza but it's typically a bit too greasy with no flavor to the crust
Pita ComboAs for the food the chicken is tooo good and the fries are too crispy and tasty that my taste buds were showering with joy
Pros mac & cheese and fried chicken are very good
Good food and yes if I head out of Cali to Phoenix again I will go back
I actually crave the consistent flavor of the special sauce I tried the double burger yesterday but I have to say that the single patty isn't much meat but it is a perfect amount because it tastes great and of course I am consuming less red meat
American Breakfast Staple Done RightSkillet corned beef hash is delicious
My one complaint is that the restaurant in the hotel offered really crummy kids food
Doesn't a hotel of this size have the capacity to make a pot of chicken noodle soup
It seemed to me that the food booths that were set up were mostly chain restaurants like Chipotle and that hot-wing place
The 12 Salcicca with caramelized onions and Barbecue Chicken pizzas with Hibiscus lemonade and Calamari for appetizer
While we scarfed down the pizzas we were comparing the quality of the ingredients of Parlor vs
Although it was really REALLY good pizza we both voted that Cibo is our FAV still
The food has been consistently good after five orders
The taste is good and spicy but there were hardly any peanuts and a lot less chicken than the other three chicken dishes I have tried
Tasty but not a filling as a normal thin crust pizza
It is a good choice if you are feeling like a gourmet style chocolate dessert
Good portions of meat in the red and green curry but I'm not really into flavored water
and I had the most excellent idea to order pizza for everyone after partying the night away for NYE
They season only with salt and pepper to really let the true beef flavor come through
We got the lobster chowder one of the best I've had creamed corn very good sauteed spinach excellent alternative to creamed spinach surprisingly very good and chocolate lava souffle for dessert which is a must
Today our server recommended I try the Chilaquiles Verdes with chicken
With each additional mouthful of this strange dish I tasted flavors that I didn't know existed
It's so the egg will be light and flavorful not charred hard after 8 minutes of food play
Was looking for some good vegetarian food in the area and Wy-Knot popped up so I say wy-knot give it a shot
While the drinks were all very delicious and strong the food was not spectacular
The food is excellent and the service is seriously so good you almost want to tuck one of your little Asian servers in your pocket and take them home with you and make them an indentured servant of some sort or slave
The albacore with crab roll forgot name was very delicious
And before I could start thinking about seconds actually I had already planned on seconds while pilling on the firsts a steaming hot plate of chicken biryani with a few mixed vegetables arrived just for me as part of the buffet
It started with the tasty and potent pear martini and the complimentary trio of duck-fat fries with dipping sauces and by the time our crispy chicken was presented at the table I was single-handedly ending the drought
When we went to the new grand opening of Richardson's we were all so excited but that soon faded with the horrible service cramped eating areas and food with no flavor other than hash or ancho chilies
The sandwich was just ok it was grilled chicken on some sort of wheat roll and some sauce that tasted a little off the best part of the meal was the cilantro on the sandwich and my salad whatever kind of dressing they used was delicious
The menu had a variety of salads burgers and sandwiches & the food was tasty and drinks are even better
Food plus several enthusiastic recommendations by our friends won out and we had to go to try Los Reyes
They have things on the menu I haven't even seen since the last time we visited Mexico City like alambres and an amazing selection of food at good prices
Overall it's tasty but I've had better Vietnamese food
I guess I just felt that the food wasn't worth the price
Portions here are on the smaller side however the food is so tasty I'm not complaining
The menu selections were fresh and my dish had a good mix of sides I haven't seen on many menus such as hominy and white grapefruit radish
Unfortunately the food just wasn't very good
This restaurant is a lot of fun has reasonable prices and very good food
The calamari appetizer I don't know why I always want to order seafood in the desert - glutton for punishment I guess was ok probably because it was deep fried and smothered with sweet chili sauce and served over fried tortilla strips
They bake all sorts of delicious treats daily and they have a food menu outside of the restaurant
We ordered the  grilled artichoke which was of course amazing a vegetable pizza and another round of drinks
Didn't have to wait long for our food which is always good
Really have enjoyed the food and the service was pretty good
Some of the best asian food we have found in the Avondale/Goodyear area
The Tomato Mozzarella is good too if you don't like meat
Been searching for good pizza since we moved to midtown
The wonderfully fresh spring greens were falling out because there wasn't enough room with all the meat
Overall this is a good location who knew that they closed down the food court at San Tan
The mac-and -cheese appetizer is comfort food nirvana the lobster bisque is the best I have had bruch is relaxed with a choice of everything from pancakes chiliquiles to burgers
so when you want a quick pick me up head over there Music is upbeat place is colorful food is delicious and fresh made drinks pretty darn tasty too
Nothing beats the cheap prices for the quanity and quality of food
Our server was laid back and friendly the food was healthier than most food  places and the quality was pleasant
My partner had a burrito with grilled chicken and said it was excellent
I like the idea of healthy fresh food but not at the expense of flavor and mediocre service
The fish was tender and delicious however the rice and beans inside the taco was a new twist next time that goes on the side
I have been to this location several times and have always had fresh food which tasted good
In fact the palpably bad attitude left such a bad taste in all of our mouths I don't think any of us could really appreciate how good the flavor of the food was
I highly recommend this place and for those who are sensitive to sodium stay away from the curry dishes
The meatball sub and sausage sub are huge and delicious
The pad thai and pepper beef are tasty enough if a bit dried out and greasy but the service and atmosphere are rough around the edges
I'm typically someone who will like a place for the food despite the decor/service if it's good enough
I hope they can pull it together because the food was very good
sarcasm  Food and service were otherwise really good
Combine that with the good food and Brio has all the makings for a stress-free brunch
When the food came we said OH NO as it tasted very different and not in a good way
I have always loved Pei Wei as I'm an asian food lover from the SF Bay Area and I definitely have a sense for what's good and what's not
I do however LOVE the Pad Thai with chicken and tofu and everytime I order it I'm in heaven   The portion is huge seriously enough for 2-3 meals the flavor is excellent it's a little greasey which adds to the texture of the rice noodles the chicken breast pieces are more than abundant and the tofu has a fabulous texture
Really nice people and amazing delicious healthy food
Speaking of yummy I have not gone over the edge and indulged in their dessert but  they offer plenty of options and they all look amazing
We both agreed that our food was good but nothing notable or spectacular we like the feel even though the decor seemed a bit random and we couldn't figure out what they were trying to go with
I agreed to join her and must say was fairly impressed with the Lobster & Asparagus burger natural meat cooked perfectly medium rare
We got a cheese pizza and a meat lovers of some sort and I've never once actually enjoyed a cheese pizza before Spinato's
The food comes out super fast and is always hot
{Dates of Actual Visit 3/9/12 & 3/14/12}Good food good service
The Veggie Combo and the Curry Chicken were good
I was pleasantly surprised by my food and I really loved those little tasty fries
I've only been here once but due to the fact that the food was excellent and the experience was wonderful I have to give up the 5th star
Then we split the flat bread sort of like a pizza and it was equally amazing
It is so refreshing to see vegetarian food with variety flavor and creativity
They were soooo good I would have never thought to use walnuts as meat substitute brilliant
as far as reliable food with good service near the university this looks like a very good choice
The crust was think and delicious the pizza burst with taste when I bit into it
maybe a breakfast dish which I hear they are good at
I haven't eaten there yet but what I saw of the food looked good too
A long line of steam tables keeping that food hot and ready to go
Ok so here's the um amusing part when I asked the server which dish she recommended the ahi salad or the ahi sliders she answered that the sliders have
Trucks may be trendy but so far the food quality has yet to impress me
I may try this place agian if someone I know really wants to go but i will not go out of my way and this is not a place I reccomend as good mexican food
I think alot of the good reviews were people who think taco bell is mexican food
It is a nice day out and they have good price pizza specials
The salsa sauce stuff combined with the chicken and cheese made quite a tasty treat
She loves seafood so after reading all the reviews about Wildfish I thought I would give it shot
Sugar cane pork chicken lollipops and quail all turned out to be good choices
The food was great as always; had my first MM calzone and I actually liked it better than the delicious pizza they have
Ha maybe TMI for a food review; however really impressed with the privacy of the stalls
Anyway like I said they seem to have really improved here and I definitely recommend them; for the food if not the service
and that's a good thing because the dish I had was insanely delicious
Excellent presentation and meat but since I'm not a giant fan of peanut sauce this app
The food is amazing and the customer service is excellent
Would recommend to anybody looking for authentic Mexican food
Good food filled with business types and ESPN
The pizza is so yummy thick chewy crust and good sauce makes it one of my go to places for pie
You sadden me  even with it being Sunday you could have done betterMy suggestions if you want to inspire and draw in new clientele1Get rid of the Helga manager/ hostess she looked like she was miserable she  seemed to be pissed all these customers were  around 2 Be prepared for the Sunday Crowd  when I see a empty unbused table right in front and you tell me it's going to be awhile  after already  messing up my groups table assignment I  would have left if my family wasn't  with me3 Try a little seasoning in your food it's this miracle substance that gives flavor to food 4 Have food ready fast
I didn't have any but the fries that came with the fish looked good too
The desserts are actually listed at the top of the menu so they stand-out - for good reason
but now I am wrong I went to Sushi Eye on Friday with my wonderful and lovely friend
Items broken and reported with issues are a broken fan in the gazebo a broken sprinkler head that flooded the area around it a faulty light in one of the common areas that strobed in an irritating fashion outside our balcony a washing machine that had gashes in the rim that would snag clothes a dishwasher that would etch dishes and never clean them properly and was characterized by maintenance staff as more of a dish rinser than a dish washer gates to the complex were frequently broken no remote was provided to the gates and ultimately we received one remote that had to be replaced multiple times before we finally got a working one air conditioning breaking on a hot day and not looked at until 6pm when the issue was reported that morning maintenance guys using very loud gas powered leaf blowers at 7am on a Sunday and other mornings and the list goes on and on
The drinks are pricey and so is the food but it's worth it for the customer service and quality
The sushi wasn't offensive but it was relatively flavorless and the spicy tuna wasn't remotely spicy
The Santa Fe Eggs Benedict eggs poached lying on top of cured ham with jalapeno corn bread below it and a yellow chipotle hollandaise sauce covering the dish I also switched out the rosemary potatoes for the sweet potato hash visually this dish looked freaking fantastic however everything was lacking in flavor and my poached eggs I think came from a mini hen barely any egg whites and small yokes  the ham was good had great flavor I had high hopes for the jalapeno corn bread taste buds were expecting to be hit with bits of jalapenos sadly that didn't happen just seemed like dry corn bread oh and the hollandaise sauce have I told yall how much I love hollandaise sauce oh high hopes for the sauce too because cilantro it has its own unique taste and smell and I just love the stuff I love how it can go from a spicy dish to a sweet dish and add great flavor to what was already perfect
They have this amazing Chicken Pistachio Pomegranate salad
Smooth jazz and good food makes a night a little extra special
I usually get the chicken kabob the chicken is tasty however the other items in the meal are inconsistent sometime I get tomatoes and peppers sometimes just peppers sometimes some lettuce etc
I find the breakfast food pretty good and like I said the smoothies are great
NY pizza requires a sweeter crust doughy but still crispy on the bottom and sause with actual flavor
The only thing I have a complaint about are the tandoori appetizer wings as there was less meat on them than I have seen on any chicken wing plus it was WAY too spicy
Had they toned the flavor just a bit on that dish I might have given it another try
Food here is a little on the hot side so be warned
Up until 4pm this place is a casual local draw with close to the earth good food and plenty of seating
Incredibly friendly service here and food was fairly good as well
As I see it portion sizes of tasty food like Five Guys are contributing to America's obesity epidemic
I've grown used to a world where my quick stop options are a hot dog or some cleverly named toquito but this place has chicken strips slowly rotated over the grill in buffalo sauce red hots corn dogs tomales it's more than I can bear but the best without question is the Jalapeno and cheese sausage roll
My wife thoroughly enjoyed her chicken breast sandwich
Their Philly Steak sandwich meat and cheese in every bite honestly very tasty and only $5
I can definitely relate to fellowing Phoenix-ans when they say there isn't much good Mexican food available which is surprising and disappointing
The decor isn't much of a date place if you were trying to have the whole package of aesthetics and good food so don't come in thinking it's a Ticoz or Tuck Shop
72- 5/5 Vegetable fried rice with chicken medium spice 5/5 - This is the freshest most flavorful fried rice I have tasted
25 - 5/5 Chicken onions and peppers in medium spice sauce that must be made by the gods themselves it is so flavorful
Beef Panang medium spice 4/5 I am not a curry fan or any thing with similar flavorsexcept here they just know how to make brilliant dishes
22-  4/5 chicken with oyster sauce and veggies with hot spice
Really great also40 - 4/5 with chicken instead of shrimp with hot spicePretty much every dish I have tried from Mango delight to their soups are great
3/5 bbq chicken2/5 fried combination some veggies are good some aren't2/5 thai toast2/5 eggplant2/5 pad thai personal preference though as I dont care peanut sauce2/5 anything with duckThis review is specific to the Camelback location as the Tempe location started out great but lost a cook and multiple employees most likely due to a ego maniacal manager
That local does have an excellent building and decor and for a time identical food just in smaller portions but having two waitress/waiters for lunch rush lead to bad service and the cook change threw off the taste
I hadthe  Brittany Crepe with roasted chicken roasted tomato and creme sauce which was delicious
Maybe it took a while for Chez Vous to find its rhythm but during a busy morning the food came out in a reasonable amount of time and our waitress was very good
The food is really amazing-but there is a catch
Now I'm not an expert on Vietnamese cuisine but I do consider myself a fan frequented several Vietnamese restaruants across the US and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food at Noodles Ranch
I have ordered the Mango Chicken and the Curry chicken as well as the sampler appetizer
Even with a stuffy nose my taste buds were delighted by their succulent and tasty dishes
With each dish came three hearty sides garnished by their own tantalizing flavors
I must warn you you will wait for good food
1/2 price bottle of wine from 3 pm to close great bar drinks pricey yes and simple but good food
Good food in a unique setting with fantastic service
Our server Alexis was very attentive friendly fast and really knew the menu or at least was good at selling every dish with a very thorough description about the technique and flavors used to create it
Eh this pizza was pretty good I suppose
Wow this stuff was so good and tasty I could barely finish it because it was a lot of food for one but I loved it
It came with rice and I also asked for their tray of spices which I recommend to compliment your dish
As others have said they don't have lunch specials but the prices are within reason considering the quality and quantity of food
His burger was cooked to perfection and my chicken lettuce wrap was very tasty
We kinda wandered our way into the Chinese Cultural Center on a lazy Sunday afternoon I needed to pick up a couple of things from the market and have been craving some genuinely delicious Chinese food I was experiencing bad nerves exacerbated by systemic and repeated bouts of disappointment with my takeout and delivery options
Although the food we ordered was tasty the meat dishes were a bit tough
I'd rate the food itself no higher than 3 stars over all in quality and the price was very steep for what we received
If you are lucky enough to find fresh hot samosas at the hot food counter buy every single one of them
First off let me preface this by saying that having spent many years living in Thailand I am a Thai food snob and am ridiculously picky about the Thai restaurants I recommend
I ordered yellow curry with chicken and my partner ordered the cashew chicken both Thai hot
Ordering food Thai hot can be hit or miss
Spicy flavourful full of large pieces of chicken as well as all the other good stuff potatoes carrots etc
For a $12 sandwich it lacked chicken flavor and came with soggy bread and soggy onion rings
Between the covered parking bulk selection and good prices I personally think they are better than the Whole Foods down the street for staple items and while their prices are higher for some of the esoterics that actually helps in my case to prevent me from buying more oils vinegars spices etc that will sit in my cupboard indefinitely
The basicsGood selection of Korean Chinese Japanese and Indian goodsLarge produce departmentSmall-ish seafood counterSmall-ish onsite bakeryThe prosA nice variety of produce that is typically very fresh and very affordableOodles of noodles
I think the prices could be a tiny bit lower for the quality of the sushi but overall it was pretty tasty
I was not impressed with the green sauce - it seemed to be VERY heavy on the cilantro but I LOVED the chicken mole enchiladas
The wife was not so impressed with her dish she is vegetarian and said the green chile had too much pork/pork flavoring the rice was flavorless and the beans tasted like pork
I didn't try the Au Jus but the beef was tasty and tender with a bit of melted Provolone on a soft French roll
Everybody else seemed to like their food and the young male waiter enjoyed flirting awkardly with D1 who pretty much just rolled her eyes
The food is AWESOME along with excellent service
Lastly they have a good selection of Boba tapioca flavors I personally prefer mango and desserts
Anyways I saw some people ordering food I was just here to drink and it looked pretty good
My mother in law could NOT keep commenting that her dish was very hot when she received it
The food is limited but supplemented by fresh popcorn made even tastier by a wide variety of flavored toppings
The food that is offered is made by local chefs and is amazingly delicious
It's a little pricey and their dessert menu leaves a lot to be desired but their frigging veggie burger is the most delicious one in the Valley
Yes I know TB is not exactly healthy gourmet or even real meat but you know its delicious
Not overly impressed over priced greasy food and the burger was just ok
Higher quality of meats but not for the price
I wish that I could actually review their wine and food but the service was so poor and substandard that it's not worth giving them my money
I understand if the food isn't good at a restaurant - some are just better or more talented than others
We had eaten here several times in the past and the food was pretty good though pricy
So we ordered some appetizers we sat and waited and waited and waited from my seat I could see the kitchen and I saw what I thought must be our food sitting under the heat lamps where it sat and sat and sat finally the manager called over the server and sure enough it was our food which was of course getting cold and our burgers that where supposed to be medium where very WELL done
Some of the food here blow's of course and some of it is really good
The duck which was supposed to be their more recommended dish was covered with fat
This platter had a variety of meats including a wonderful chicken schnitzel German potatoes red cabbage  brats in assortment  and sauerkraut that tasted nothing like that stuff from a jar
We were a little worred when our next dish wasn't amazing either
Hot oil is poured over the fish at your table to slightly cook the fish
As the fish and fries came together it was a hot soggy mess
He had seen an episode of Diner's Drive Ins and Dives and thought the food looked really good
Her hair was long past her shoulders and not tied back or clipped up which I think isn't a good idea working around all that food
The food is good but the experience was a little lacking
Once they did arrive they were a welcome treat very tasty loved the meat and the sauce
We ended up splitting some mac and cheese and some chili as our appetizers and then I got the chicken salad sandwich for my meal
My chicken salad sandwich was absolutely delicious
Great customer service and very good food
I decided to go with a few co-workers and all of us thought the food was excellent and the value was apparent
However once we got the food all were very happy that I had convinced them to give it another shot
At the end of dinner the chef sent out a free dessert which was a cake that was excellent
Perfectly cooked served hot with swiss mustard and red onion on a Kaiser roll
If you have food allergies they are probably the most accommodating of any place I've ever been to which makes it all the more worth it
Caramel cheesecake dessert was a little salty for my taste but worth trying
I usually stick with the roast beef and swiss with sprouts and mustard on sourdough bread but the specialty sammies are also good the Vermont for instance is legit
The rundownFood  fairCoffee awesomeService  good save the cream cheese thing see abovewill i go back  yes yesshould you go  yes check it out at other times to and let me know how it is in the evening/mid-day
It's a foodie paradise in the way of quality and you just don't see that with deli style dining very often
I enjoyed a half Roast Chicken Breast w/ Sautu00e9ed Onions Tomato Bacon Melted Swiss Lettuce & Tomato Aioli on Ciabatta and a side of Free Range Chicken & Sweet Corn Chowder
The burger was pretty good especially considering it is a fast food joint
My husband and I also enjoyed the rest of our meal -- yiu-shan chicken and one of the house specialties black pepper prawns and scallops
We enjoyed the food but felt it was over priced for what we received
Don't get me wrong the food was good but it was over priced in my opinion
The Food WOWZERSThe food is amazing
We got the Avocado Pizza which was very solid especially with the recommended addition of prosciutto
The lemony flavors played well with the rest of the pizza but the cheese was a little too hard for me - it seemed like there was a lot of parm in the mix
Also I regularly stuff my face with delicious pizzas and giving LGO the same rating as Motorino feels wrong
The crispy shrimp rolls were pretty good too
For our appetizer we got the Toasted Horseradish-Mashed Potato Stuffed Shrimp
My Green Chicken Enchilada's were seemingly tasty at first but I paid for them in the bathroom the following day for hours on end as they ran through me like a scoop of Draino
I love Mexican food and can handle the hottest but his recipe's did me in
While my dish was larger and the pork and mashed potatoes tasted good it just didn't make our expectations after reading Yelp reviews
The Thai Tofu dish was too dry although the green beans and flavor of the sauce was good
The bad After some great apps I was hoping for the entrees to match in quality but unfortunately they didn't - as others have mentioned its your typical bar food with typical bar food quality; the seating to the right when you walk in is practically an entirely different establishment with how shut off it is; a little pricey for the quality of the food
The broth in the wonton soup was pretty much straight chicken broth with no flavor and worse there was so much spinach in it that the last few sips tasted like the run off when you defrost one of those frozen bricks of spinach from the grocery store
I would suggest heading a few miles over to Butterfields-Twice the food better service and better quality
the entrees are good but I particularly love sharing 2-3 appetizers - the Guacummus is great as are the fish tacos
For an appetizer we got the butterfish tataki and the burnt red tomato salad
The butterfish was delicate and the salad was great - the greens had all sorts of different flavors and not that generic clump of lettuce flavor I hate
That being said if you're looking for the artisanal style of pizza small relatively thin crust simple but flavorful toppings fired in a very hot wood oven Cibo is a winner
If you want a pizza that is comparable to the legendary Bianco pizzas Cibo is an excellent choice
My next visit it will be the first place i choose this place rocks Great food and prices a great wait person who found out it was our first visit and gave us the skinny on all the dishes and be sure to ask for the salsa's excellent guac tuna tacos and pork tacos they also serve breakfast next on the agenda
Well I was more impressed with the non sushi items
Super spicy crispy shrimp chicken and veggies was delicious
The food and wine pairings were delicious and the impeccable service by our waiter Oliverio as well as the Chef coming out and presenting each plate made for a very memorable evening
The shrimp had a wonderful blend of seafood and coconut not too sweet and definitely crunchy
Everything else I sampled from my fellow teachers was also pretty tasty including the shrimp ceviche and apple-glazed meatballs
Overall the food and prices for Happy Hour at least make it worth a trip
We had a white fish carpaccio that exploded with unique and complementary flavors
They also have amazing drinks decent desserts and pretty yummy appetizers
I recommend you try their chicken wings very crispy and delicious but a bit oily
I don't go to Pete's for pub-worthy fish and chips
This place is kind of expensive but it is good food great atmosphere and just plain fun
The sauces that they give you when you start eating your meats and veggies are sooooo good
SO delicious The only down side is that when they are busy the line long can also mean a long wait before you actually get your food
The machaca is good too just standard shredded beef with tomato garlic and onion
The appetizers aren't that great but the pizza is very good
Took longer than it should have for some reason I couldn't identify from the front-they weren't busy and our pizza wasn't complicated but the wait was worth it
It's hard to find good sushi in Phoenix especially when most sushi is found in Scottsdale and usually populated by the snobby and uninspired eaters
This is a place for the real sushi eater who is not afraid to try extreme flavors and very fresh fish
The scallops dynamite was very good but it could have been slightly spicier I enjoy the spicy a little more than most people do but the scallops were sweet and mixed well with the kewpie and fish eggs
We finished up with a roll  the name escapes me topped with salmon and eel sauce filled with a spicy tuna mixture it was good but nothing too special
Would give it one star but the other star is for easy to navigate store location down the street from my work and cheap and good selection in the food department
Chicken and waffles hot sauce red beans and rice and a huge Iced tea
Do Not go to this restaurant there are plenty of BETTER Italian restaurants that will actually have delicious food and appreciate you treat you with the respect that you deserve
Your money should be spent on delicious food and quality service
I've only had the barbecue beef and teriyaki chicken and both were quite good
The wonderful rolls with 2 BIG bottles of Saporo for $3 a pop and out the door for under $50 really made our night
The fish is fresh and the rolls actually have flavor
Consistency in their food is solid here and nothing better than being able to count on a place where you will always get a good meal
Hubby had the cornbeef hash and it must have been good because he downed it in no time
Great pick up games best are Saturday and Sunday morning plenty of weights and machines so you never are waiting around lots of TVs with an array of programming good food and a great spa even for guys
However the food and atmosphere was worth it
Food The food has always been good and good portions for the price
My husband has the chicken shawarma plate which wasn't like what we get in other Greek establishments but he really enjoyed it
I really wish I could give Petite Maison a 5 star review on the food alone because although it isn't mind-blowing it is still very well prepared and the flavors are excellent
Figuring that they might not have gotten the message I explicitly pointed out to the server that it was her birthday in the middle of our dining experience while I asked what dessert he recommended the most for it
Quite frankly our server was great when it came to actual interaction but we were waiting sometimes around 10-15 minutes between courses and the entire dinner service took about 2 hours for appetizer entree and a quick dessert
The ambiance food and direct interaction with the staff was all really good and we still wound up having a great time helped along by a few glasses of wine but I really can't let it go that two direct requests were essentially ignored along with the feeling that we were not being treated equally to some of the other guests
Frankly I can get the same quality food at other restaurants while still being treated like a valued guest and I wouldn't return even if we lived in Phoenix simply because I didn't feel like they appreciated my business
The only  thing good I have to say about this place is that every time I ordered a beer the waitress brought me one immediately and then about 20 minutes later the busboy would bring another out to me thinking I never received the first either way no matter how drunk I got the food never tasted good
Overall good experience when we got up we didn't feel like we had stuffed ourselves and did not feel the weighing down effect of food
So I was wrong- everyone enjoyed the quality of the food and the great menu specials
The sashimi and sushi were wonderful even the rolls were well balanced and intriguing
The service was reasonably attentive- we never lacked for food or drinks and had an absolutely wonderful time
The food is amazing and their wine list is impressive
The servers are very pleasant the food portions are good
I am a sucker for strolling mariachis mamacita servers in red frilly dresses festive digs and authentic and delicious Mexican food
Food highlights include the Bistec ala Mexicana simmering in a red caldo of veggies and sauteed beef strips reminiscent of my mom's btw the pollo margarita simmered in margarita mix with chipotle ranch and queso fresco was ok but the clear winner was the seafood enchiladas shrimp and veggies in a lobster cream sauce - simpler than how they do at Barrio but every bit as good
For the quality and variety of sushi/appetizers you can order it is WELL worth the price
It was quite distracting since it's unexpected but a small price to pay for such good food
For my friend and I we ordered 2 appetizers crab wontons + boneless buffalo wings and 3 or 4 rolls
The beers are cold you can order the MAN size or girl size nice marketing ploy  The food was better than I had anticipated with large portions and full of flavor
The only minor complaint I had was a Taco Plate that we sent back twice then gave up because it came out with cold meat so the cheese didn't melt
The food is good the energy is GREAT and I always enjoy a trip here
In case you forgot that Sushi is worth getting excited about the waitresses here remind you just by their totally authentic joyful way of being
Whether you want to knock back a shot of Sake with the sushi chef or not they'll recognize you when you come back and they'll love you for being a friend
You can't go wrong with some Veggie Tempura a Rainbow Roll and that tasty orange they bring with your check
we got starters small bites and hot dishes
But the lack of quality service trumps the food in this case
I must admit I have never had Rolberto's sober or during the day so I can't vouch for food quality
The chicken torta and carne asada burritos are good read - digestable
All very eclectic but I was there for a good sushi roll their offering of which was paltry  Even the standard Dragon Roll was missing
The happy hour and reverse happy hour specials are very good for both food and drinks
The food was excellent I had the fish tacos and my lunch date had the carne asada and lengua tacos - all were excellent
I had a conference at this hotel and the food was decent
He really enjoyed his chicken but ordered it extra spicy and they delivered
As far as McDonald's quality sushi goes this place was spot one
For staple goods such as bread milk eggs meats and canned goods the prices are usually lower than the other large grocery stores
Went to Mango's again today food is as good as I remember
He had great recommendations for food and beer; our food came out fast and our drinks never wanted for refills
Unfortunately the pizzas were pretty much burnt to Hell; the parts that weren't were delicious - it was just too bad
We started with the fries and chilled green beans DELICIOUS as usual split the Shreiner's and Pear and Proscuitto Pizza SUPER burnt and ended with the Pizza Cookie a most EXCELLENT recommendation from the server
Pancho has come up with some nice tasty new rolls but we were all disappointed in that he changed his vegas roll
The sandwich was super delicious with the beef and sweet mayonnaise sauce
We all enjoyed our food and the truffle Mac & cheese was super good but the service was ridiculously slow considering the place was almost empty and spending $75 for lunch for 4 was a little more than I like to spend for lunch
Sometimes I'm not a fan of the lightly pickled cucumber but the jalapeno slices always gives me a nice jolt of spiciness and the flavors of the meat are awesome
i might go back but that's because the chicken med sandwich was good after one bite
i'm hopeful there are other things to choose that i'll enjoy more than my meal however i ate the steak sandwich and tho it looked good it was without any moisture the meat as well as the sandwich itself
i'm an avid roller coaster fan and hate the fact that there aren't any in town worth talking about encanto park has no hills
And several of their dishes are mock - made to resemble normal meat dishes hot dogs burgers chicken etc
While I love heir Spicy Buffalo Wings Crab Puffs Vegan Chili Fries and Mum's Meatball Po-boy I was disappointed with the No Harm Chicken Parm Sandwich and the Vegan Hot Dogs
I had the chicken and rice lunch special it was actually alot more flavorful than it appears
The prices are goodThe food is flavorfulThe service is not great not the worse service in the valley think mrs
Have dined here occasionally over the years and food has been consistently good
Their coffee is very good and while usually no room for dessert brought one home last visit and it was delicious
Primi  Gnocchi w/ veal great flavor and tender shredded meat
The food is delicious--I had the potato and cheese pierogi and kielbasa sausage my hubby had their 'Hunter Stew' a cabbage and sauerkraut and noodle yummy
Props for the Classic Chocolate Chip cookie/ice cream dessert though that was delicious
This was our opportunity to have good food of our choice without having to deal with all those guys
I have had so much good Thai food that this one just did not live up to my standards
Picture this  You timidly stroll into 'The Yard' at Leavenworth abated as fresh meat
The food was pretty good about average for the Phoenix area
The food is pretty good and the frozen margaritas are above average
lol  Sister had the Beef Carpaccio appetizer
The sandwich featured brisket with a delicious horseradish cream sauce served on the side in addition to au jus for getting your dip on
The standard dim sum dishes are all very good and not too greasy although some are
These babies were pillowy soft and melt-in-your-mouth good--the kind of dish where the last bite could start fist fights and break up marriages
But you know the chicken is always good here and the store is clean
I recently went to Christopher's with my friend who was visiting me from Chicago and as foodies as well as her and her boyfriend having a culinary background we tend to gravitate toward not just amazing food but wonderful culinary experiences
Upon reading various reviews about Chef Gross we were both very impressed by his awards varying from Open Table's Diner's Choice Local Eats 2010 and Phoenix Magazine's review to Food & Wine Magazine's Top 10 Best Chef as well as a James Beard Award Winner his resume speaks volumes about his food
The food however was generally not good especially for the prices they charged
I've eaten a lot of fine dining over the years so small portion sizes do not bother me as long as the food quality is there
Well at Luc's the food quality is not good
I also recommend their cheese fries if you like processed cheese-food
Perfect local bar wi great food and excellent staff
The beef sandwich was good not great but good
I unfortunately got no smokey flavor from the meat but the texture and portion made it ok
Big portions good meats but I need that sweet sweet smoke
Just can not get any flavor from the meat
All weekend all we could think about was how good the Pizza was on Friday
My husband had the cashew chicken and I had the chicken/shrimp combo the flavors had us debating who got the better meal
An authentic feeling enviroment with a selection of foods that not only a native could love but anyone willing to step into a Black Forest story book will find tasty
The pizza was pretty good but the sauce was a lil too sweet for us
I loved their family photo on the pizza box
They have good food it's more ethnic than American and I like that
For the price the food was not at all worth it
Food was good the shrimp tacos were about a 4 but we were disappointed or rather spoiled with the shrimp cocktails
the sauce was flavorful the pizza was seasoned perfectly and i have to say that i was impressed

He came with good suggestions for wine pairings knowledge about the menu and timed our food to an absolute T
I've never had smoked salmon in my chopped salad before but the array of flavors and colors was just beautiful in this dish
I mean typically you would expect to get a decent portion or some tasty food for $10 at lunch
At around fifteen dollars a plate I would hope for a little more quality in the food that is served
This is along the lines of good and gets a lot of locals like Roscoe's chicken and waffles in socal
I don't think we've ever spent more than $17 for two people and that's a good amount of food
I kinda hate that I kick off with a negative review  but  this isn't that cheap a place for the quality of food I received
You also get miso soup which was pretty poor and the dashi base was rather too much like a chicken stock with little flavor in the supporting ingredients
If you go then would recommend taking advantage of current  $10 all-you-can eat specials mains only so will have to pay extra for side salads etc with bbq beef ribs on Monday  fish fry on Friday and fried chicken on Sunday
I had a really good citrus blue cheese type salad and a buffalo chicken wing pizza that was money
The food was good it was diner quality
However do not mistake the quality of food for 5 star
Free Continental Breakfast- Includes french toast sausages bacon eggs fried potatoes fruits cold cereal milk and pastries- A sit down place for eating- Guests can pay extra for gratuity- Food is decent for breakfast but the pastries taste better warm- If you want hard boiled eggs- that costs extra- For those who cannot sit down to eat there is coffee and pastries before the eating area
The food was satisfactory but wasn't worth any more than the coupon price
Fresh greens goat cheese fresh strawberries bell peppers onions glazed pecans chicken and this amazing viniagrette dressing
Seriously tasty little morsels of cheesy meaty sweetness
When she brought the food to our party she would hold the hot plates over my son's head which made me feel very nervous
I would definitely recommend this place to people with celiac desease gluten allergy and sensitivities or if you want healthy organic foods
The food is pretty good and best of all it's also pretty cheap
Can't complain much food was really good but in that healthy locally grown organic blah blah blah way
Food is good simple and fresh so maybe a better lunch stop with the girls than a hearty dinner destination with the boys
The one thing that we had that isn't so great is the egg rolls but finding a really good egg roll has eluded us for a very long time
I look for good quality foods and products and I went there today to get some loose organic tea
I was so psyched too; I wanted them to be a new local hot spot for organics and some gourmet foods - but nope; they are not
Fast and Friendly service with high quality food
I ordered the chicken soup as an appetizer - it was okay although the broth tasted like beef broth
Had the beef hot dog and it was about as perfect as I can imagine such a food being
The food at Different Pointe of View can stand up to the creativity and quality of any other high end restaurant in town
The risotto was really my favorite part of the dish but the pork was excellent
We both had some standard desserts - i had creme brulee which was good but nothing special and she had the Chocolate Amandine Milk Chocolate Mousse and Vanilla Amaretto Cream which I wish that I had gotten
Francos is well priced very good food not the junky regulr Italian food but refined Italian food like you get in Italy
I do not mind waiting for good food so I won't score negatively on that
The food is slightly pricey but wonderful for the restaurant
I wasn't super impressed the place food was average service was average and the drink prices were average
Only negative is the Graze restaurant not a very good selection of items to choose from especially when you are catering to families staying here I tried only two items and was not overly impressed with food or prices but I'm sure there will be those that disagree with me
But the fact of the matter is if you're going to run a restaurant you need to have good food
The coral selection is very good as well although not as exceptional compared to other local fish stores
The beers are consistently good and the food is above reproach with fantastic daily specials some of which you'd only find at high end restaurants
We went in at 7pm and the food was cold and stiff
So it's pretty obvious what my favorite espcially for uniqueness and flavor food item is at Beckett's
Sure it's not fancy schmansy and the service isn't outstanding but  it's damn good food
It presents their 4 standard dogs but doesn't fully speak to the uniqueness and deliciousness of their food nor does it really give you all your options which are plentiful
The gyros are good not sure about the American food
The build-your-own spring rolls are good too
One time before a flight I had a teriyaki chicken bowl at one of the generic restaurants I decided this would be one of the most healthy options aside from Quiznos--too many delicious dipping sauces
Friend and I split an order of Gringo Nachos fries with cheese a type of dressing and onions which were really good and worth the $6 but The Pig sandwich pulled pork hamburger patty and bacon on a roll $10
My dad had the pounded chicken breast which was good
If the food was more flavorful and the chicken wasn't so gross I would be willing to try the food again
I was very impressed with the selection of food as well as the prices
The food was delicious the service was excellent
GREAT food good service & reasonably priced
The fish sauce for the spring rolls was really good
melon salad needed a little salt to bring out the flavor if you don't have salt on the table you need to get it right  had the fish trio the portions of ahi and butter fish were very small the salmon was a bit bigger all were cooked correctly and tasted good the rice was served on a seperate plate which made mixing with the sauces akward the bok choy side consisted of one leaf must be running low
The food was good and the price other than the coffee was typical
Potstickers pan seared chicken it was pretty good
I enjoyed itAvocado egg rolls i love avocado so can't go wrong with this dish
I had the 2 item lunch special and also got the beef enchilada with beans total cost came to about $8 and another $2 for the drink so with tax and tip it didn't cost much at all for a good meal in a restaurant
I always think of this place since I have to drive for more authentic Mexican but Macayos has pretty darn good chips and salsa which is how you know your food will be good and I also get another dish here but I can't seem to remember right now
The meat was very tender I was able to cut it with a butter knife and it had a great flavor of the combo of guac spicy tomato sauce pico de gallo and cotija cheese
I was impressed by there happy hour prices until I experienced some of their happy hour specials first hand my friend got the nacho's I personally could of made better nacho's at home I mean these things really looked like they cost less then 5 dollars the chips here are so salty I would need a gallon of water to eat the whole dish the salsa seemed fairly good and fresh and the shrimp tacos I had were not bad even though I did expect some larger portions for 13 bucks
Food was good but serving sizes were small and disappointing
But what used to be fresh food wok-seared and served extremely hot is now pre-made and warmed up then plopped into a plastic dish
For 30 cents more and a drive over to 44th & Thomas we can get twice as much food that is served well and HOT  by people who act like they care if we are happy eating there
I would liketo state that my confedence in Lucille's has been restored the food has always been consistant and good the problem i recently had was with service which was greatly inproved this last visit over a month ago
Great beer fun atmosphere and good food as well
You can't go wrong with a brewery with good beer that serves good food as well
Rich delicious heaven with roasted chicken mushrooms and bacon pieces in it
Between our appetizer and our food we left completely stuffed
Additionally our appetizer came out at the same time as our main dishes
This is my kinda place though-a hole in the wall with delicious simple food
They have a wide variety of pizzas and all of them are good
Hope they read this and find way to correct cold pizza issue
Sometimes you've had a hard week lots of issues or a big quality review and by Friday you are the mental equivalent of a limp dish rag and you just need
I had the roast beef sandwich which was a layering of one or two thin slices of ribeye delicious salty/smokey bacon and a fried egg on Ciabatta bread which was wonderfully soft and hugged the sandwich like a loving mother hugs a beloved child creating the most delicious amalgamation of flavors as I noshed through my sandwich with little driblets of egg yolk falling like summer rain onto my plate which is how I saw it but my dining companions might have just have thought of that as messy eating
And to top it off the food was cold meat overcooked
Not good the beef came from a can just all minced up with what seem like tater tots broken up
The food was just not of of the quality  that is  done with either dedication love or anything really just done to get out the door
We ordered some poolside drinks and food and enjoyed ourselves immensely
The food to me was greasywhich is desired for diners but I wasn't getting the great flavors to match it
Amazing pizza great service and a price that is comparable to any pizza joint in town
The beer is always cold and the pizza is great
The lunch special came with an egg roll pretty good nicely spiced fried wontons kinda bleh and fried rice
The chicken entree was also very good - no extra charge for all white meat is a big thumbs up in my book
I'm not saying this is fancy restaurant quality cuisine but when you consider the abundance of meat in the dishes and the large quantities the value for money spent here is excellent
Our table ordered a paupia yuan a fresh roll with vegetable and prawns for an appetizer
What was amazing was this pizza was a huge square and a full 16
the food is good though the wait is a little long but its well worth it
also a very good place for lunch and its awesome that the place is open till 2 everyday and the sushi bar is also open till than
Waiter recommended a couple dishes and i'm glad he did
The food was delicious we had seared ahi tuna that tasted just right and split an entree of a sea bass special
Whoaaa; just popped in to relax with my hubby and enjoyed Thai BBQ salmon and really good Orzo /fruit combo//terrific food
Hiro Sushi does a wonderful job and I can safely say we have found our new sushi spot
I'm certain that they pre-make the lunch set but the fish was as fresh and delicious as one could be expected to find in a place whose annual rainfall is about seven inches I'm sorry I can't help myself
If you don't mind the continual crowds the food they serve is predictably excellent
So consequently your food may sit on the counter for a while getting cold unless you jump up and down from your seat every few minutes to check on it
The pizza is excellent as are the salads
If you want your food hot I'd such a later time of day perhaps
I felt compelled to stick to the sushi after two failed plates full of fried slightly cold food
The owners are ALWAYS there they never turn over the staff always a good sign and their food is consistently fantastic
Below is the menu choices that we had on offeringFirst CourseSmoked Paprika Braised Pork Shoulder Queso Cotija Guacamole Shaved Baby Radishes Korabuta Pork Belly Butternut Squash Hash Tamarind Peach Glaze Hand Rolled Porcini Gnocchi Maitakes Ginger Cabbage Black Bean Miso CreamSecond CourseGrilled Romaine Fried Rainbow Valley Egg Spanish Anchovies Capers Raisins Roasted Striped Beets Gala Apples Horseradish Cream Prairie Breeze Amish Cheddar Applewood Smoked Duck Breast Peaches Sweet Corn Cranberries Almonds Arugula Frisee *Add $5Third CourseGrilled Pork Porterhouse Spaetzle Spaghetti Squash Bacon Brussel Slaw Amish Asian Pear Butter Niman Ranch Tri-Tip Steak Roasted Fingerlings Baby Rainbow Carrots Black Mesa Ranch Feta Caper Aioli Wild Caught Market Fish White Beans Cherry Tomatoes Fennel Baby Spinach Green Goddess SwordfishNow on top of this there were a couple items on top of the normal menu there were Sweetbreads for the First Course +5 supp and there was another option for the second course but I do not recall what it wasCourse 1 - I had the Sweetbreads which were had a sauce that was delicious i cannot remembe what kind the good kind with a plum apple slices to freshen it up for some acidity and they had a cornmealish fried texture to them -- I had been to Blackbird 1 star Michelin Chicago who also served up a sweetbread 1st course and this preperation blew it out of the water and that was our favorite app we had there -- Also they gave a very good portion size as well this was not a Restaurant Week portion to make tons of money this was their normal portion just at a discounted price - one thing that always drove me crazy about RW is that many places don't put their best foot forward and try to make a quick buck instead of trying to gain return clientsThe Mrs had the Pork Belly which I have to say was one of the best pork belly's i have had in a very very long time
For some reason I expected warm duck but it was chilled duck with just a light touch of smoke to set off the flavor against the tangy peaches and sweet corn it was amazing and way better than what i had pictured in my head - there was also TONS of duck in it every bite huge piece of duck - just greatThe Mrs had the Grilled Romaine with Anchovies which was also very good nice anchovies on it and she really liked it however the duck salad was where it was at - our friends wife went with the off menu salad and she really liked it I passed on trying it because it wasnt beating the duck saladCourse 3 - 3 of us had the Grilled Pork Porterhouse which was one of the best pork dishes that I have had the only other one that i would rank up there when they had it on the menu was the Stuffed Pork Chop at Cowboy Ciao no longer on the menu this was was equal to it or better they cooked it pretty close to medium rare which is perfect for me and everything about it was good lots of flavor - The Mrs had the steak when Todd was explaining the menu he was very elaborate about everything on the menu and then he was like we have steak too so that was really on the menu because you have to have a steak on the menu - It wasn't bad but when all the other flavors on every other course is off the charts just a good steak isnt the same - however as a good husband I gave multiple pieces of the Pork Porterhouse to Mrs Dapumacharacter limit
The pizza creations are simple delicious and customizable
The menu is set up with a cold shellfish section first courses specialties of the house and a more typical steakhouse menu with a range of steaks and sides
But save room for dessert in fact- this is so good you might just want to start with it They have in house made beignets with three kinds of dipping sauce
The broth is flavorful and it has a huge wonderful meatball in it with a dash of tomato sauce
The hard taco was a fatty generously stuffed with tasty shredded beef lettuce tomato and cheese
The standard goodTacos- steak chicken grilled fish breaded fish shrimp all yummyIce cold beerHelp yourself to the Salsa Bar with fresh cut lemons limes and jalepeu00f1os too
My husband is an amazing chef and he can make me these dishes at home but who wants to constantly eat at home
I say definitely give it a try if you have any dietary restrictions or if you just want some really clean good for your gut and soul food
When with the in-laws we usually order way too much food but it's all really tasty and makes good leftovers
The house fried rice is delicious - it comes with beef chicken and shrimp
The beef and broccoli is tasty - the broccoli tastes fresh and the beef is really tender
The sauce is delicious and again the beef is tender
How can you truly create amazing food if you have no space to do it
And who in the world thought it would be a good idea to comprise half the ribs' side dish with raw red onions
For my main dish I had the Tomato and Olive Oil pizza which was surprisingly flavorful despite being kind of boring
Very tasty chicken was a tiny bit dry but the crust tasted like an elephant ear
Good food good service good atmosphere decent prices just can't go wrong
If your idea of a good sandwich involves a copious amount of bread with very little meat this is the place for you
The spices are just right and every dish was absolutely delicious
I had several mezes soup and the Adana and my husband had the Iskender  The portions were generous and the prices were very reasonable for the quality of food
5 stars because of the good food good prices Gordon and Square Pay
The service was just as good as the food
This is an amazing restaurant with some delicious food
I was curious how Mexican food would be as good in Phoenix as it is in Tucson when I went here for a rehearsal dinner
I read the mixed reviews and thought that the good should out-weigh the bad not in this case the food was horrible
The food was juicy flavorful and reasonably priced
For my main I enjoyed some hearty Swedish meatballs bathed in a hearty cream sauce and accompanied with tomato basil spinach salad and sauteed green beans
They have a nice selection of tasty looking pastries as well but you will be so full you'll want to get your dessert to go
Here's the thing either you need to have excellent customer service or excellent food because that way people can rationalize well their service is bad but they have amazing food  or vice versa
The food was good very creative style dishes
It's really tasty- seems like most people go nuts over it dipping everything in it fries bread chicken
The chicken was tasty and the lettuce was crisp
The food is delicious and priced right
Food was excellent and our server was very attentive
It is small but very clean very good food and it is a family owned business that makes everything homemade
Their fish is always incredibly fresh and consistent unlike other usually very good restaurants
My steak was so good that I didn't even save room for dessert which is virtually unheard of if you know me
Probably won't return when I can go to pita jungle and get quality food and SERVICE
We were needless to say a bit hungover and ready for some delicious food after an incredible night
Now I'd be fine with the wait AND the price if I felt like the food was worth it
They do think they have pretty good appetizers and desserts
The fish tacos were good I thought but my wife hated them
The sandwiches are very good and when I ate meat I enjoyed the Bobbie
The black beans had flavor not like they just rolled them out of a can and even the rice was memorable
Next time they have an appetizer of Craw fish Hush Puppies I have to try
Clearly not a dish terribly concerned with being subtle I really enjoyed the texture of the biscuit and although my modest Midwestern tongue needed copious water to quell the heat I actually enjoyed how the bright acidity of the peppers helped to keep the gravy from being too thick and heavy
50 this cinnamon roll would prove to be good but when compared to the rest of the meal really nothing special
Served warm with the frosting slowly cascading down the sides of the buttery bun it is not that there was anything 'wrong' with this dish - it just was not nearly as good as the French toast interpretation even though it was equally amply endowed with butter and cinnamon
The Verdict  Bearing in mind my obvious predilection to breakfast sweets over breakfast savories and the fact that I'd been told all the Bay Area's recipes had been ported over faithfully I had no doubts that walking into Dottie's Scottsdale that I would like the food; what surprised me most was how much I enjoyed the scene and the service - both equally well carried over from San Francisco
Having said before that Dottie's is one of the very few breakfasts I'd actually wait an hour in line for and living in a city where it seems everyone is willing to wait hours in line for Matt's Big Breakfast I personally see Dottie's True Blue Cafu00e9 as a sort of breakfast ideal - food good enough to wait in line for but without the line
This is by far the finest and most intimate dining experience I've had in Phoenix thus far and would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who appreciates excellent food
The sushi is pretty good and the scene is great for people watching
I would have expected this service at Taco Bell and quite honestly I wish I had gone to Taco Bell as what I ordered wasn't as good as what I could get at the fast food restaurant
Six different all delicious $5 appetizers to choose from including lobster pot stickers sliders w/sweet potato fries beef skewers ahi tuna roll salt and pepper calamari and one more lobster one
The only reason I am giving the server a 2 is because the server delivering the appetizers and food was very pleasant
For fast food I thought it was pretty good portion and was very satisfied with my Smash Burger and Smash Fries
is airy open quick and of course has the delicious Paradise Bakery quality of food
I won't go into depth about the food here since this is a pretty prominent chain but their sandwiches salads soup and breakfast are always delicious especially their Walnut Chicken Salad Sandwich and Tomato soup
The food is served very fast it's very good and the place is always very clean
I gave them 3 stars b'c the food was good but not spectacular
The dishes were spiced accurately per our preferences you can order mild medium hot and Thai hot and delicious
The vegetables were fresh and cooked perfectly crisp tender and the dishes were full of flavor
I recall all the food served cocktail-style as being delicious - the highlights being the coconut fried shrimp foccacia pizza charcuterie plate and roasted veggies
The beef brisket sandwich was just as good
The food has always been hot and fresh and flavors are great
50I'll also get the cucumber and eel roll because its oh so tasty
As we looked over the short menu the server made a few recommendations to us and warned us about the spiciness of the food
Who knew that vegan Mexican food could be so flavorful
If you are looking for trendy and dont actually know what good food is then you can eat here
I got the chicken pita and the meat was good
It was grilled and not on that cool circle thing they have I don't know the name but it makes the meat really good
This place brought all the good taste of awesome made mexican food
I can't say anything about the quality of their food
I had their veal meatball spaghetti and it was very delicious
The meatball was very juicy and flavorful
Their dishes were good but not a place we would purposely drive to Phoenix for
In getting the sampler I was treated to a mountain of meat toast and two delicious sides
The chopped pork - smokey and delicious The bbq chicken - juicy and loaded with sauceThe brisket - wonderfully tender and flavorful The ribs - OH MY GOODNESS THE RIBS
The food comes out fast hot and delicious
Some dishes I would recommend areBeef stew noodle soup the meat in here is wonderfully tender and the soup is fantastic
Black pepper chicken has a very flavorful sauce and is delicious over rice
Pizza Bianco  naw not worth the wait I would recommend this to anyone and if they didn't like it i would pay their bill for close friends who i personally know don't think this is a free coupon to go there n try hit me up with a refund  hahahahaThe price is a little up there but we go here for Kids bdays good grades special achievements etc
Beyond the lousy service the food is not good
I like the presentation of my food to be just as good as the taste
The tacos were great- just shredded beef lettuce & tomatoes on amazing and thick tortillas
But the food is so good that it doesn't need to hide under all that cheese
We came in on Wednesday and really enjoyed our food and service
I had 2 fish dishes and enjoyed both but the highlight was a deconstructed key lime pie for dessert
I let it slide cause the food was amazing
I only tried the pasta dishes and they were all heavenly delicious
It's good pretty good food and pretty good service
rrIt's standard 'Americana' fare with a bit of seafood flair thrown in for good measure
I've had the Ceasar Salad and some noodly dishes and they were good
A touch of unsweetened chocolate crushed almonds and hazelnuts give this Catalonian dish a unique & unforgettable flavor
If I were rating on food quality alone ~ All of the dishes were easily 4 star quality - good portions very tasty excellent flavors & great variety from which to choose
The entrees seemed the most on the high side; appetizers and desserts a bit more in line
that aside the food is very good i highly recommend the pad thai
Not the most authentic Chinese food out there but for the price and the amount of food that you get it is excellent
First the good newsArmando's here is a fast food restaurant with a simple but clean look inside
The selection is pretty good & you order at the counter & then pick up your food when it's ready to take over to the table to eat
Do not let this scare you away because the food is worth it
Fast but not fast food just delicious food in a very simple setting
I came back the late afternoon the next day for a chicken burrito which was also very good
The service- pretty goodThe food- from ok to really good  but not the bestI recently had an over saltet paella
The food has always been good and the last two times I've gone have been during lunch
For just under $10 I got grilled salmon a couple of potstickers 4 pieces of California roll a salad sometimes the hot beef salad
I don't mind paying for good food but when the quality keeps going down then I mind
I can't come up with a single complaint delicious food friendly and helpful staff free samples of items if you're a first timer trying to decide a huge plate of food for the price and they even sell beer
This is the place that you go to if you are a person who appreciates good food therefore it takes time
My fiance also got a similar dish when we went back because his brisket was amazing
The food is very good flavorful and interesting
Like other Phoenix area veterans of hip and social restaurant/bars Postino AZ88 Kona Grill Bomberos Hulas with it's wonderful mid-town location will be a hit as much or more for their crowd as their food
I'm not a fan of the piece of flatbread they put on the side when you order the meat and potato scramble because it's really just that - flat but not tasty
I forgot to mention that the other breakfast I enjoy is the Chicken and Mushroom Scramble - totally fresh and delicious
pasty/past/Noun A folded pastry case filled with seasoned meat and vegetables aka AMAZINGNESS
Then we had the pork fried rice and sesame chicken both were amazing
the jerk chicken Chris ordered was pretty good as was his sweet n sour chicken and rice
Get it together this is a cool concept but learn how to make your food consistently good maybe toasting the quesidillas instead of frying
Really good steak fries fish and chips are good and so is the french onion soup
So slightly smaller portion slightly higher price but all good food
Both times I have to say the food was excellent
Our table enjoyed the biggest cut of prime rib hot wings fillet pasta chicken fingers and ribs
I have never had fish tacos that were SO delicious
The meatloaf sandwich had mashed potatoes over the bread and a tasty cole slaw on top of the meatloaf
The Maibach was excellent but the food was just eh
The orange chicken was slightly better quality than Panda Express and really not very good and very odd for a German beer place
Place has an upscale feel to it but the food is down-to-earth and high-quality
I've only had their chicken steak and short ribs but they were all excellent
Salad is just okay but both sides go excellent with the meat
This is a must get dish whether you get the full size as a meal or the half size as an appetizer
It's fried pizza dough that's still soft but firm enough to hold up the toppings covered in delicious flavorful marinara sauce topped with gobs of melted mozzarella and pizza toppings
Could it be that people here don't know good sushi
THIS WF location in Phoenix made me oh-so happy all over again  They do a great job with the hot food bar the bakery is well-stocked with FABULOUS treats for all meals and occasions and I always take time to look at the new items in the vast gluten-free section
Either way the staff was very good food came relatively fast and I would probably go back for a bite
They tasted beefy and fresh exactly how a good burger should be
We ordered some spicy tuna rolls and they were pretty good
I remember this being a very decadent cheesy gut bomb with extreme heat for cast iron stomachs like mine but the chili had no heat barely any cheese and overly salty stone cold chicken breast seemed to have come out of a bag
While I may not become a regular customer I would definitely recommend My Fit Foods to anyone I know who would like to be able to eat healthier and lose weight and who would not want to or could not prepare every meal they eat themselves
If you are going here for something else such as fish chicken or salad they do that here as well but not as good as the burgers
I ran out to my car to get cash instead of using my credit car and Darl the proud owner caught up with me to ask me if I found everything I needed and wanted to know if there were any foods or goods I would want them to carry
We both enjoyed the flavors in this dish very much but agreed that this was not an authentically prepared version compared to when we have eaten it at various places
For my second course I got the tomato soup which was absolutely delicious except for being too salty; though that may just have been me since food tends to taste too salty to me when I am a little dehydrated
The steak ended up being a really large juicy piece of meat that was quite delicious as were the side vegetables
Fleming's IS pricey but I felt for the service and food quality it was well worth it for a special dinner
The food was good albeit leaves a lot to wish for

This Cracker Barrel is very clean well ran good food and some very good employees
They are consistent  with their execution in preparing their breakfast dishes and their services is very good
Pizza does not have to be New York style to be good these days
I was surprised even the people were ok dint expect this since I was in Arizona maybe everyone is just happy since the food is so good
We didn't get any food but the chips were great and the two salsas included a pico de gallo and a really amazing green salsa that included tomatillos and I think cumin
I went in with not so high expectations because we are in the desert and looking for seafood here has taught me a lesson or two in the past but I have to tell you that the king crab legs were in abundance the shrimp scampi and mussels were pleasing to the eye and tongue and the rest of the buffet was very good
I can appreciate the fact that he wants to maintin the quality of his food resulting in limited production but is it all that
That coupled with everything that has come up about the quality of the food I was excited
Been a while since i have written a review but I love to get the word out on good places to eat in the valley and Meatballz is a great lunch place
This restaurant isn't much to look at on the outside but it's got everything it needs on the inside including friendly staff cheap prices and delicious dishes
The spring rolls were really refreshing and I enjoyed the peanut sauce to accompany it
My pal enjoyed her little personal-sized pizza as well
So food photos will reflect these recipe omissions
I was most surprised by the meatballs which were tender and flavorful with a near perfect texture
The food is also WAY overpriced for the quality
They were able to accommodate us even though we called pretty last minute and the food was amazing
They had a cherry tomato salad to start - was fresh and tasty a choice of steak or halibut for the entree - I got the fish my husband got the beef and they were both divine
But the best part was the amazing avocado amuse bouche and the big ol' pile of blue cotton candy you get before the dessert is served
but all in all a really great experience with delicious food
The customer service was excellent we were even given free samples for our chickens without even asking and were given informational sheets about some awesome products we ended up buying as well
There is a pizza station a sandwich hot or cold station and a fry station plus soups and a salad bar
I can only vouch for the pizza and the french fries - both expertly executed and delicious
On top of all that Ethiopian food is HONEST--it's meat and veggies in straight-up yummy sauces good for your body and mind
The sandwich was cold and had a Subway quality cold lunch meat
I do come here for tasty margaritas and the poblano chicken dinner which is the only food I've ever ordered from here
to the sushi this place has some amazing food
On a hot summer afternoon the Hiyashi Chuka cold noodle salad with grilled chicken egg and cucumber+lettuce is the PERFECT meal
if you're in the mood for sushi i'd recommend the sushi combo with the Alaskan - a little on the pricey side but it's fresh and well made
Our food was delicious- I had the the organic carrot veloute a smooth and delicious soup accented with ginger and cilantro
Those pizzas are delicious and absolutely addictive
I usually don't like spending that much money on pizza a large spinach is $20 but it is so damn good that they have me wrapped around their finger
Delicious pizza and worth every penny
The cut and quality of the sashimi is consistent the rolls are always prepared immaculately
Believe the reviews of those of us who come here on a regular basis to enjoy fine quality sushi
The desserts were the highlight of the meal and they had a good selection of wines by the glass
The food is hot and so is the metal plate it's on
I consider Q Up BBQ a great addition to the Phoenix food truck landscape and will look for them again at future outings for tasty grub
I've been here a few times since they opened i live next door and have always had amazing food drink and service
The only reason I'm still at a 5 star is because of the management the normal service and the food is beyond tasty
Now the coffee shop allows no outside food even a partially eaten hot dog and has jacked up the prices for soft drinks to close to 4 bucks and hounds people as they walk in to place an order
Ranch Market has a good selection of food from China and other East Asian countries
Every year the food is good and we have an amazing time
Food is delicious and the place doesn't look super nice
The food was good and we tried several dishes
The sushi and seaweed salad spicy chicken wrap blackened fish sandwich and sweet potato fires were all delicious
I thoroughly enjoyed my orange chicken and my guest enjoyed his mandarin chicken although for the price he would've preferred more chicken in his dish even if it meant less veggies
Good location nice decor good service and average food at above average prices
My friend ordered the fish tacos which he said were good
Also I'd ask around about what the good dishes are since it appears they are hit or miss
Having lived in Brooklyn Heights a couple of blocks away from the original Patsy's under the Brooklyn Bridge I bring a pretty accurate ruler to measure the worth of this pizza joint
The pizza crust is really the secret - they make it perfectly thin and tasty
The beer/wine is good the food is good I like the southwestern egg roll apps the price is good the service is good and the atmosphere is nice thought I was going to say good huh
The food is good and reasonably priced and the same can be said of the drinks
I've dined here a few times before for dinner and experienced very good food and excellent service and this first time lunch experience was no different
The food is quite good but what really stands out in my mind is the excellent but not overbearing service
Ordered 2 al pastor 3 carne asada tacos and one chicken burrito enchilada style like in one of the Yelp photos
The price was great and the food was very good indeed
At last a sushi bar that isn't a hot spot and isn't completely devoid of atmosphere
On the other hand the potato latkes pierogi brisket sliders roasted chicken matzo ball soup and basically everything else is DAMN good
Expect good food good beer & fun with your friends but don't base your experience off the waiters because youll probably be let down
After so many review updates I usually cease to write more unless I have something really noteworthy to add a new menu addition or fave dish or great customer service rendered etc
The pancakes we had today were too dense and not at all the flavorful-spicy and texturally-exciting cakes we've had in the past   The peach creme brulee sauce also didn't arrive warmed and instead was squeezed unappetizingly onto a sauce dish
The gyro meat was great and the tzatziki was quite tasty as well
Having tried two of the three varieties of Burgers on the menu the BLT is humongous and quite fabulous with real beef flavor coming through even the bacon but bring your appetite to this one
The Sweet and Spicy is very different but yet again the beef flavor does break through the accompaniments and I liked it very much as well
What a great way to get introduced to Fogo De ChaoAnd I thought I would still be full this morning because of all the wonderful food I consumed last night
It doesn't have the fun and games that the Scottsdale location has but the service is excellent and the food is good
Keepingoperational costs down keeps ticket prices down and good times keep rolling
The Fresheezy Greek yogurt is quite tasty and makes for a wonderful dessert
Some flatbread pizzas sandwiches and a blase choice of appetizers
Bianco is as good as any Neapolitan style pizza I've had in the US but that's not to say that it's better than all the others
The menu items are named after people and I did catch a glance of the Big Unit hot dog yes it is 22 inches if I was with  a bigger party I wouldn't mind trying it it looks loaded with everything and its 18 bucks but if you split that between 3 or 4 that's really not badunless you're the type that can eat the entire dog Im a Man Vs Food fan and I know Adam had his turn with the Big Unitbut anyways back to my trip to Coopertowns
But the beef tasted so dang good; I just asked the waiter for more bbq sauce and got messy
The FOOD we pay for needs to be GOOD especially at those high prices
The cooks are decent at flavors but the chicken in my so-called street tacos was so dry I couldn't eat them
What I can tell you is that my single-layer cold raw 6-inch tortillas were filled with  very very dry grilled chicken
The food was good 'ol Thai Basil but something about it was just better
I can not begin to describe my disappointment as I sat at a cold jiggly table in the mall food court surrounded by people in jogging suites with a plain cup of coffee & a zucchini muffin which wasn't bad but wasn't great
Most of the staff here have good customer service skills and I even see the manager busting his butt busing tables refilling glasses seating people and expediting food leadership by example
The pizza and wings here are amazingly delicious
Ok food was actually good but one star for one of the worst customer service experiences I have ever had
Had I not wasted 20+ minutes there as my food got cold I would have not been so stubborn
The food itself was pretty good overall I enjoyed some of the combinations a lot more than others
I went back to the meats and the selection was not very good
not necessarily a statement of the quality of the food or service
Overall it was really good I also loved how we ate the food with our hands using the Injera
The food quality was actually pretty good
One standout for dessert was the banana bread pudding it was frigging amazing
Our waiter was attentive and did a great job of recommending certain dishes and describing what was in them
We opted for the street taco sampler for our appetizer street taco's with steak chicken and carnitas
They are a good size that will fill you up without giving you that afternoon food coma
The food overall was really good and at a very good value on Restaurant Week prices
Sweet & hot at the same time - I highly recommend this side dish
We have a few favorites here that include seafood chow fun with gravy monks platter an array of mushrooms unlike any I've ever known paired with tofu stir fry fish with vegetables sauteed whitefish with Ginger and baby bok choy something that I believe is called Peking rib a staple at most tables crunchy red goodness fried calamari and many others currently evading me
A portion of our family is Chinese and so we always celebrate Chinese New Year with wonderful seafood dishes
This year C-Fu canceled the show so we couldn't see paying twice as much for food that definitely isn't twice as good
Over the years I have tried a couple of other things on their menu and they do a pretty good job with a chicken sandwich and sausage biscuit from their breakfast menu
We had just dropped in from having sushi at a place up the way but we were both wishing we weren't so full because the food looked and smelled pretty good
We ordered the Little Sicily pizza and it was perfection you never find a pizza where there is so many quality toppings and so little crispy crust
Thank you Little Sicily for providing good service and a great pizza at a fair price
The food was excellent the wine selection was excellent & the service was EXCELLENT
The food was delicious - we had a cheese & meat appetizer with a sausage mushroom & mozzarella pizza followed by the Dolce for dessert
I thoroughly recommend the chicken panag the basil chicken the pad thai the broccoli beef seriously and perhaps my favorite though not most ordered the chicken special
The taco was great with a homemade shell and very good shredded meat which seems to have been formed into a patty inside
Mary's Mexican food in Tucson but these were very good
Overall the prices at Carolina's were great the food was very good and we will be stopping back on our next trip up to Phoenix
The menu is minimal maybe 40 items in total including soups and appetizers and split in to four primary sections appetizers special noodle dishes soup noodles and fried noodles
We also had the seafood noodle soup and that was good
Not as full of flavor as the curry dish but a nice standard Asian soup
Not extremely hot but just enough spice to mix with the flavor to produce a great dish
The food was pretty good not the best but definitely not the worst
I had a chicken penne with a pesto cream sauce that was really rich but flavorful
We were too stuffed for dessert unfortunately but it sounded amazing
Roommates got the wings which were really meaty and the sauce was good not as good as Zipps
Overall not too expensive and very very good food
The chicken with star noodles was also good
It had good flavor though was more like frozen pizza than pizza parlor type
I tasted the smoke flavor mentioned elsewhere also but it couldn't make up for the mediocre cut of meat
By the time I got my food it was cold and wrong all I wanted to do was leave
The Tomo special roll which is normally amazing with its razor thin jalapenos had huge chunks of them just thrown on top
The BBQ chicken was nothing but a grilled cold chicken breast minus the BBQ they forgot the Miso and the rice was undercooked
I did not like the fancy pedi chairs either if you do the roller on it it makes your body jut out almost a good foot when the rollers go by
As a female friend of mine once declared good hangover food
I tried this place for lunch and the sandwiches are very good but they do not give you alot of food
From a simply delicious ciabatta roll with butter and homemade jam to frech toast or an omlette everything is fresh and delightful
The largest plus is that unlike so many other Thai places when a white gentleman such as myself say hot they actually make the food deliciously sweat-inducingly hot
Dessert was OK in my opinion but the appetizers and main courses for surpassed the dessert
My usual Thai restaurant stop while traveling for businessService was good and food came out quickly
Portion sizes were good for lunch and the prices are on par fo the food
All the food they were bringing out looked really good and I'm sure that next semester I'll be ordering quite a lot of it
I would much rather give my money to a local business with a relaxed atmosphere than that awful Starbucks with its bitter African beans my coffee snob husband swears that good coffee should not be bitter it should be flavorful bad tea even worse hot chocolate and limited food selection
The staff is excellent and food was amazing
Cute place great service excellent food and local
To top it off the meatball wasn't even very good
Nothing impressive in my book no flavor and to be honest I have had frozen meatballs that were better
F and they were totally cool with us cancelling another order of wings when we realized we were in way over our headsG I took a bite of my Thai chicken sandwich that I brought home just for the purpose of this review and I will say right here right now that it was fairly tasty although now my stomach is literally about to burst
And the execution of the dishes is excellent
The dish is simple but packs a very powerful punch of flavor
That is one of my favorite desserts and turning that into drinkable goodness I was very happy
I showed up today at 3pm after lunch rush and before dinner rush and there was no wait at all service was good and food was as awesome as expected
Burger is a consistent flavorful perfectly cooked piece of meat with perfect garnish every time
But appreantly it makes wonderful hangover food
I would usually make a meal out of the bruschetta plate alone but all of the food is tasty
As i said to my friend who I was dining with--the problem is in Phoenix with all the great restaurants with wonderful service--it is hard to spend that dining dollar on anything except great food and great service
We no longer buy our meat from this place because the quality of service and product has been going down and down over the last year or so
We still like the Al-Hana restaurant and they do offer some good spices that we will go in and purchase but we will no longer be using their meat counter
The food was mediocre although the sweet potato fries were tasty
I started with the assorted vegetable appetizer it came with broccoli zucchini and I think something that resembled squash whatever it was it was tasty everything was fried which I wasn't super excited about but hey a little fried food every once in a while couldn't hurt it also came with potato pakoras which were fantastic
For my main dish I had  the mushroom matter it was good but not great again I don't know if I didn't really like it because I haven't yet become acclimated to the tastes of India or if it was just missing something it lacked a little flavor
My boyfriend Sammy  had a shrimp curry dish he liked it but be sure you really like spice if you tell them you want it hot he can usually handle extremely spicy food and he was sweating from the heat of his meal they are not messing around with that spice
The crowd was very college frat boy but the food and prices were good
The pizzas were tasty not great but not bad either
I'm still not wowed by the food - baked brie and the chips w/Killarney Sauce are the only two items I will order because they are both really good
The pho is right-on with really tasty and rich broth and I also love the noodle cakes with grilled beef
Its huge and really pretty but the food is not good
I wish it good and hope over time it will be but the food was terrible and ive eaten good food i got duck it was so bad and  their signature fish dish which we were told that the workers came in on their day off to eat pan seared escolar was Eh i would rather get Sea Bass at a good restaurant like Ocean Club
I didn't go in like someone expecting to get blown away i expected a good Easter dinner based on the fact ive been here before years ago and enjoyed it so i went in expecting the price per dish to be as good as it was well its not and its sad because the place is pretty and it looks like horses can get married in the back grassy area check it out it makes sense
There was a good selection of food out so I grabbed a plate & started with some chips & too mild salsa good salad & terrific ceviche with big shrimp
Like last time the hot food wasn't as warm as it should be but there was plenty to eat here & it was pretty good overall
Food  I had the tostada and it was very good
On future visits I've had the wedge salad and chicken salad both were very good and will certainly get again
The food was pretty good nothing amazing but pretty yummy
We live in Glendale shut it we know and the food is definitely worth the drive to Tempe
As you can tell by all the other reviews the food is good and at times great
The food was pretty good but the service left a lot of room for improvement
The other two waited to eat till corrections were made so their food was cold
Waitress Oh does the cornbeef not have any flavor
The wine was 40 bucks for a carafe  maybe if we would have got a 100 dollar bottle we would have gotten better service  The Dessert was good it was a rich chocolate cake with nuts and chocolate sauce
The beef and broccoli was tasty I definitely enjoyed that
We order our sushi for an appetizer and I was brought out at a regular turn around time
Also the food wasn't that hot which was sort of gross
Food was average to above average and my server did a good job checking in with me
I had the Twisted Mac N Cheese which was delicious and Darren had the fish n chips
Very excited that this place in in the valley as it is always hard to find good Thai food once you leave either of the coasts
This place has very tasty food and the restaurant is beautiful chic and romantic but not so much so that you're intimidated by it
The meatball sub was quite good - rich marinara sauce tender juicy meatballs topped with melted cheese
The piping hot pasta fagiole was a tasty starter which was generous enough to be a meal by itself especially with the tender garlic rolls that come with the soup
The food & atmosphere were both very good
Though I usually get the curried chicken the brown stew chicken and jerk chicken are both excellent choices
Personally I like spicy food - so I've never had any issue with it being overly hot
With shrimp and scallop appetizers being more expensive than most the entrees it just seems odd - though I'm sure getting quality fresh seafood in Phoenix probably isn't cheap
I really am not a picky person but the quality of my food unfortunately truly warrants a bad review
I do know good Thai food when I have it due to my extensive travels and living near a city like NYC which has many good restaurants for every style of food
One drawback is that once you taste really good food it gives you a more distinguishable pallet so when you have a meal that misses the mark it's extremely prevalent
I love a good pizza and this place is up there as one of my favorite pizzas
Its a little hip place with lots of personality and with delicious food
We ordered Tottie's Fried Rice which is a combination of shrimp chicken and beef as well as the Crispy Chicken with Thai Basil both very tasty
The standout of the meal was definitely the Soft Shell Crab Fresh Spring Rolls which were the most delicious rice paper rolls I have had in a long time
lolThe dessert menu looked amazing but we were so full from our meals it was actually impossible
Her caramels and chocolates are delicious and her desserts are scrumptious
Food was good I had the rainbow trout blackened very good
The Discard Pile was actually tiny for the sesame chicken but instead of honey it was flavored with syrup--cheapass imitaion ''maple'' corn syrup
All I found was some icebertg lettuce and coleslaw in the cold section plus brocolli in the beef&broc carrots and onions in the S&S and some white cabbage and a few onion pieces in the lo mein
Lim's had some decent flavors and I created a small Discard Pile so could be a 3Star boofay by getting rid of the msg using honey instead of syrup on the chicken and adding a bunch more veggies into the mix
North Scottsdale this isn't but good food at a reasonable price it is
They put out a wide selection of salad and dressings appetizers soups main dishes rice and noodles
Points for amazing food battered fries staff friendly and brew
When I heard through a friend that Macayo's was more than some college bar that is known for more than bar foods I had to give it a shot
Got some enchilada thing stuffed with chicken and mashed potatoes sounded good but it was dull and uninspiring
the Apple and Brie with Fig Jam was KILLER the traditional tomato and basil one was so tasty it was like it was just out of the garden there was a steak with horseradish sauce that was out of this world
I got the spinach con queso inside my enchilada and it was really tasty but everything else was  average mexican food
Things I adore areGriddled corn cakes with black beans and grilled chicken so good and less than $10
The carnitas taco app is wonderful and SO much food
The woodfired grill gives the lean meat great flavor and the handcut fries are fresh and delicious
- Office assistants were nice too- Sat appt - Digital x-ray- Emergencies & walk ins welcome- Fees reasonable / 20% cash discount- Instead of getting a toy for the goodie bag we got a balloon & a Good Job certificate for Peter Piper personal pizza & a drinkThe bad- Need to redo their flyers to indicate that certain location Mesa don't have digital x-ray Sat appt etc
Every single visit is a great experience; the staff is fast and friendly the sushi chefs are artists of their craft and the food is amazing
The fish they get is some of the freshest I have ever eaten and they get some amazing variety as well
The food is good but uninspired the service is awful as others have mentioned  the kid behind the bar was too busy talking to the other servers rather than attending to customers
Yes the pizza takes a bit longer than 5 minutes but it is so worth the wait
We ordered off the full menu had many appetizers to start full dinners desserts and drinks
The place was packed and waiting time was among the longest I've had at any restaurant but the quality of the food and atmosphere always a big thing for me easily made up for it
They're a little pricier then other fast food joints but their food quality is far superior
Regarding pizza I have tried the Sausage pizza excellent - with a great spicey sausage - very simple but delicious the Ricotta/Arugula pizza I forget their name for it - but it is really good - I've ordered it twice
As for their sandwiches I've tasted the chicken salad sandwich - really good if you love chicken salad
Haven't tried any of their desserts but I heard the tiramisu is amazing
I ordered a sushi sampler with a spicy tuna roll and it was very good
My wife had ordered the Goodyear roll and it was amazing
I have to say I was shocked at the quality of the sushi and the amazing presentation
There are a few choices for Sushi in the West Valley but this one is a nice combo of price and quality
I am giving this place five stars because the food is good to me and throughout my years with Thai Basil- it has never failed- dishes are quite consistent
I love the Spicy Noodles with chicken papaya salad is what I always order tom yum soup need more seafood ; the lunch plates are delicious and you get a little bowl of soup before your meal
Overall excellent food good prices and real Chicago Style pizza
Food is pretty good but the staff is absolutely awful
If you're going to treat people this poorly then you may want to be serving food that is amazing with every visit and up to this point this has not been the case
Krisada Fisher our General Manager travels to Thailand every year and comes back with a riff on a classic or a wholly new flavor creation
After several visits to explore the menu and sample the dishes described by other critics as wonderful I would have to politely disagree
Quickly I will give a recommended first trip order and then give details about what I love about this placeDrink Any Arizona Stronghold wine I really like their reds - Dala specificlyApp Meatball trio in Vodka Sauce - it didn't sound good to me either and then I tasted it WOW
These are the most moist and flavorful meatballs I have eaten and that doesn't even include the vodka sauce and cheese in which the meatballs are cooked
Pasta - My wife had the special which was a seafood and pasta dish  which had scallops cooked perfectly baby clams and shrimp so tender in a wonderful tomato sauce
Dessert - I know Italian resturants should have a good cannoli and this place does I am usually so stuffed from my dinner we never order it
Delicious food friendly service and a comforting atmosphere
Food Good selection of wine and beer
Not the type of pizza that makes you want to gorge after it was light and delicious
My parents who were with us each enjoyed the SW Chicken Sandwich but felt it was a bit dry and not a lot of flavor
Excellent middle eastern food in a pretty sketchy run-down location
Putting that aside the food is top notch they make the best Pad Thai I've found in AZ and if you're brave and get it Thai hot the burn is so good but doesn't mask the flavor
I do have to admit that the Sweet Chili Glazed Salmon was pretty good shrimp and pork fried rice with veggies but the California rolls were just meager and overpriced
Good thing too because we were not offered dessert
I didn't like the prices so much but for good sushi you can't expect it to be super cheap
The Hawaiian Roll is good; it is garlicky
I got the CA Roll because I figured if that was not good then I was S
First of all the servings are huge the meat was so juicy and flavorful
We ordered some Cerveza and Ahi Tuna appetizer and Split the Chicken Avocado sandwich
The chicken avacado was good but the avacado looked strange almost like if you painted blue cheese crumbles an avacado green and put it on there
Their specials are a good way to get  a lot of food at good prices
We held off on dessert but as I recall the banana dessert is amazing bananas wrapped in egg roll wrappers fried to crisp perfection
I kind of thought that a fish and chips place would also have good strips but I was wrong
I had strawberry chicken- it was pretty good not very flavorful but good
The Good Their Lo Mein noodles were delicious and I thoroughly enjoyed their egg rolls which were actually more like spring rolls
If you are wanting sushi from a buffet however I would strongly recommend you go elsewhere
Recently I have eaten at this location and the Deer Valley location Which I could not find here both times the food has been good
However there is a hassle to get to these good food
The next day some food won't remain the same quality she would like like chu00e8 Tru00f4i Nc if refrigerated the flour would get hard and must be microwaved before eating hence reduce taste
The scrambled eggs in the buffet were food service quality and left an unwelcome aftertaste with each bite
There was no toast no toaster and the breakfast meats sausage & bacon were cold
The after dinner flambu00e9 dessert was both exciting and totally delicious
My bf got a cheesy beefy type sandwich and it was super delicious
I didn't try any of their food offerings just a beer enjoyed slowly and honestly felt like taking a little nap
The food here is pretty good try the Boom Dip as an appetizer and don't forget to leave room for the Pizookie its heavenly
The food was good enough one and half grade above your stadium fare and even better when your is team winning
The roast beef with mashed potatoes green beans and gravy is excellent
They have made it homey and serve absolutely delicious food
However being crafted into a quesadilla raised this familiar dish's flavor ceiling by 298374908 levels
I can think of many other restaurant to spend this amount & get very tasty dish
The household enjoyed the following very much#24 Rama w/ Beef cabbage and peanut sauce topped w/ crispy egg noodles and red onion#27 Gaeng Keao Wan w/ Chicken coconut green curry w/ green bell peppers bamboo shoots and basil#30 Gaeng Ped  w/ Chicken red coconut curry w/ carrots peas bamboo shoots and basil#103 Pad Pak Gratiem Prik Thai chicken w/ pepper fresh garlic and chef's sauceI am a fan of green curry of nany Thai restaurants I'm told by a close Thai coworker/friend of mine that Thai curries are some of the easiest foods to prepare but not this one
Perhaps my slight aversion to green bell pepper though I do like the flavor this item delivers in many recipes mars my enjoyment of this dish since it plays such a major role here
The food is served in generous portions that makes the price seem too good to be true
Tasty better than average Mexican food
Their food is all made from scratch except tortillas tasty and seemed fresh
They have real coal brick ovens which give the pizza that nice char and flavor you can't get at other places
If you want great pizza I highly recommend
For appetizers we got the seafood wontons that come in an apricot sauce
The ingredients were good the dressing above average and the staff was friendly however one of the main ingredients of a good sub is the roll itself
The Executive summaryFood -- All appetizers on the menu were gross even fries
Sadly the food here is not all that good
A lot of the menu items from the original owners are no longer on the menu; for example the special Chinese cakes served on a plate topped with a delicious gravy-like brown sauce and shallots - probably some form of Cantonese food
Give me the same quality I could make at home without having to drag out my food processor & I'm your best friend
The chicken was moist & shredded very good
Well the service to start with was OK not great not bad just OK the salads were ehh way to much vinegar in the dressing then we got our entrees I got Gnocchi which was a childhood favorite of mine Grandpa amazing cook and my wife got the Lasagna my first bite of mine all I could taste was salt just heavy salt in the sauce and my wife could not stand her dish either she couldn't put a finger on why just did not enjoy and only ate half
Seriously this food tasted like it was made at like a friends house who is a pretty good cook
I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for fresh and tasty sushi
Stop by this place on a recommendation from my 9 yr old daughter who saw this place on man vs food
It's not that their isn't a good amount of pita selection ranging from those with beef to all veggie or that they don't stuff those pitas full with lots of vegetables like they should
The sausage roll was amazing; think of it like a new twist on the traditional calzone
A coworker of mine ordered 2 menu items totaling about $25 and was VERY disappointed with the quality of the food
Unfortunately this one does not provide me with the same quality of service and value for food as the other ones do
The food here is just as good/average as at the other locations but I feel a little ripped off coming here
The food was good enough to make me want to try everything on the menu at least once and I believe I will embark on that journey
The pho broth was tasteless with very little good meat bits
The spring rolls were pretty good but not worth the rest of the experience
Well I am here to inform you that I tried Fuego's pork dish their signature pernil asado and it was so very delicious
They do have some tasty drinks but their menu is lacking basic options for those of us that aren't quite up to par in the foodie world
The food was about on par price and quality wise of what you would get from Applebees or TGI Fridays
The food is really good especially the bbq roll appetizer
Mine was a kobe beef stuffed with some crap it tasted so delicious
On top of being one of the few places I've found that has spinach as a topping sausage and spinach is a personal favorite combo for me they also make a wonderful buffalo chicken pizza
Just the right amount of kick to it and the chicken is good quality too
Good stuff and now that I live closer likely to become my regular pizza joint
It didn't have a ton of flavour; a shame for such a tasty meat
The food is good but I feel it's all a bit under seasoned
The food presentation was beautiful and the food was quite tasty with fresh herbs you can taste and smell
I will give it a few more shots here to see if the food grows on me and hopefully I have the chance to recycle as well
If it's your first time there plan on spending more than the one-$ listed the more authentic creole dishes are a tad more pricey but completely worth it
Word to the wise save room for dessert the peach cobbler was amazingly over the top
The Hot & Sour Soup was excellent there were lots of salad items & fruit & an array of of tasty hot dishes
The waffle fries were good reminds me of Chik Fil A if you've ever been there I didn't care too much for the texas toast but I did take a couple bites but the chicken was delicious
The chicken was extremely juicy and very tasty
The food that I sampled was quite tasty though I admit ti sticking with standard bar fare
I had the sautu00e9ed calamari for an appetizer and an amazing dish for dinner with red snapper and pasta
The food wasn't bad but it is not overwhelmingly good either
The crust on the fried chicken was really good though
The food from Meatballz is as good as it gets
While the food was pretty good better than average it was the small town feel the friendliness of the staff and the old-time decor that drew us in
If you want ok food and a good time this is the place to go
The catfish has always been good quality and decent sized pieces - but not whole filets
The breading seems to be same for chicken at catfish is spot on with great flavor - and they always have a perfect crunch to grease ratio
Hot and fresh or cold from the fridge for breakfast Lousiana Fried Chicken understands why we love fried chicken and they make it well
Strange bonus - on day 1 and 2 the overall flavor is enhanced with hot sauce the best way to eat fried chicken yo
Take your time at Hanny's enjoy the great cocktails and good food
Anyway I thought the sandwich was good but could have used some veg or something on it so it wasn't just meat and bread
My Buffalo Chicken Wrap was really good at least to those of us that like wing sauce and blue cheese dressing
When the person taking your order is grumpy maybe a little bitchy even no matter how good the food is it may never live up to it's full potential
Now with that being said the meat inside the burrito was not only perfectly cooked it was amazing
The first bite fills your mouth with a certain salty beefy mesquite smokiness that's both flavorful and satisfying
I saw the title and performed a small Oscar worthy soliloquy will driving about how great it would be to try a new sushi joint
I ordered the Mongolian Beef with brown rice-- my very favorite and it didn't taste very good
Our usual favorites are the beef tamales crispy chicken tacos enchiladas of all kinds the chimichangas my husband eats the SHRIMP CHIMI every single time we go without fail and the sumptuously perfect machaca served dry with the perfect blend of spices and goodness and a tortilla to boot
If you go on an off night for service definitely don't give up because the food is so darn tasty
Needless to say the pizza was good which is why I gave it two stars
They appear to have really good food and the people there were all pretty nice and friendly
If they are all as good as today's food then Mark's will be a regular breakfast stop in the future
A++ You know something is good when each bit you say out loud wow this is good pizza
They had just the right smokiness to them and the ribs were so meaty moist and delicious that I really did stuff myself as best I could quite frankly
They have really good happy hour and brunch specials on drinks but I'm still undecided on the food
Other than Ted's Hot Dogs in Tempe not many foods have transferred well from the East to AZ  but this one has
one doesn't serve a sandwich that's burnt on one side and I mean black char burnt and they served it burnt side down so you didn't see it until you picked it up to a guest unless you're just freakin lazy and don't care about the quality of your food
For those of you who aren't familiar Pho it's an incredibly flavorful Thai soup that's actually pretty healthy depending on the preparation and cuts of meat you decide on
Then we had sushi with these fried shrimps on top and they were amazing
While some people seem to have amazing foodie experiences here we definitely did not have the same luck
Because the quality of the dishes didn't live up to the hype or price I felt like this was simply a novelty restaurant hiding behind a gimmick rather than great food
We ordered a calamari appetizer an artichoke appetizer and my dish was the ot your typical chicken lasagna
My lasagna dish sounded really good a deconstructed cheeseless lasagna that consisted of the flat sheet noodles copious amounts of spinach a few too many leeks a teaspoon or so of shredded chicken a sprinkling of mushrooms mounds of tomatoes all covered in a super slippery broth like sauce
Not that it matters but sometimes it makes me wonder if no one is here is the food really that good
But you can expect both dishes to be fresh tasty complex and atypical
But the food is amazing the bread and dip are delicious and the atmosphere is not flashy and perfect for dates
I have had the CHICKEN PARMESAN which was tasty too but I just can't get enough of the marsala sauce
A co-worker of mine brings leftovers in to work every so often and it makes my mouth water even though I would never have thought of that dish as good egg plant gross
Whether because of this childhood experience or something else I love a good fish-n-chips
Their fish-n-chips on the night I went was near perfection with a nice strong beer flavor that is often listed beer battered but hardly ever tasted
Service is fast there's not that much variety but some worth mentioned Squid Salad and Shrimp Tempura Roll
We didn't try food here but found others ordering small pizzas that looked pretty good
We ordered at the front and they brought out our food very hot and lickedy split
The portion was a decent size and a good noodle to meat ratio
It looked pretty good he really liked it and they gave you two cha gio egg rolls cause lots of places are stingy here in arizona and like to give you one
The potatoes were creamy and flavorful and the chicken was SO good it makes me want to recreate it at home
I ordered the chicken fried steak on the second try and the meat was grey and lacked flavor and the green beans and potatoes had an obviously chemical canned flavor that was nearly inedible
I love a good diner and I have been to some great ones and this was sub par I vowed never to return because the place was bad both times I visited and there are some really good cafes very near here that are a better value and have better food
I had the corned-beef hash skillet and good lord that's some good corned-beef hash
The food is pretty good; service is awful
I will be honest though a big reason that this place gets a 4 instead of a 3 is because my husband and I have found NO other Chinese food in the area that is edible if anyone has recommendations I am all ears
A bowl of Ramen in Japan is like getting a hotdog from a street vendor in New York it is supposed to be quick and inexpensive and while I understand that it is a niche kind of dish here I don't think $10+ for a bowl of soup and a drink is a very good value
It's a buffalo faux chicken sandwich-sooooo good
Grimaldi's is a genuine high-quality pizza joint that oozes class
However I've come to find that basic/limited menus are always a good sign because that means a restaurant can specialize and perfect a specific item and in Grimaldi's case that item is authentic NY style pizza
The pizzas here don't come cheap but I'm telling you they are undoubtedly worth the higher price tag and the longer wait
Their crust is also to die for and that's probably because of their amazing pizza oven and pizza chefs
Yes it has taken longer than I would have liked for a pizza to arrive at my table but the wonderful thing about the servers at Grimaldi's is that they don't ignore you or try to avoid you if your waiting a long time to receive your food due to the fact that they are packed
Overall I love that Grimaldi's brings a little taste of authentic New York to Scottsdale with their superior service and exceptionally tasty food
I rolled in around 730 am a good hour before I needed to get to my destination so I had a chance to sit and sip for a while taking it all in
Food - 4/5Papaya salad was fresh but the fish sauce was a little too strongFried rice was good with pineapple bits Pad see ew was good not too oily They ran out of thai iced coffee 0/5Thai iced tea was greatCleanliness 5/5I will be coming back for the great service and food
Its good to see an establishment take risks with seasoning their food
The Chicken It was absofreakinlutely amazing
The Grits They were very good; I probably won't get them next time not because they were lacking but because they would take up valuable chicken and waffle space in my stomach
The pizza we hadTuscan was ok pretty good crust decent flavor
Not only is it in a wonderful location for Phoenix next to the canal in Scottsdale but the food is really good too
I have found my new wine place and I can't wait to go back to try more of their delicious food
I was sure I'd come face-to-face w/ a dive-y sports bar but the food photos I'd seen on their Yelp profile begged to differ so I decided to surprise myself
Otherwise the rest of the dish was very good
I was only able to get a photo of the app as my battery was too low to take pics of the entree and dessert which actually turned out for the best as the entree wasn't much to look at
I recommend the margherita pizza with procuitto added the arugula that's placed on top gives the pizza a great contrast/different taste thats excellent
We also had another pizza the last one listed in the pizza section on the menu that was equally as good
The food is definitely worth the wait tho I have never been disappointed and will definitely be back
I particularly recommend the breakfast pizza --  delicious
Anyways we ordered Sizzling mixed seafood spicy eggplant and hot and sour soup
My boyfriend and I zoomed over and were amazed  to find how good  the food was not too mention the atmosphere
I had a chicken & pesto sandwich that was absolutely delicious
It's worth the price of admission just to see others work their magic while they pile on the food 6 inches or more above the rim of the bowl
This location is relatively new and is comparable to any other Chipotle in their food quality just as a chains are supposed to be right
One especially nice thing about this location is that it's in a small strip mall with a Starbucks Coldstone Ono Hawaiian Grill Subway Panda Express so in case you're with someone who might not love the Chipotle as much as I do they can find somewhere to grab food and you can eat outdoors on the patio
I have been a fan of this place for over 5 years and I will keep coming back because the food is really tasty and the service is quick
The ambiance service and food are as good as ever
His fresh spin on the classic dishes are delicious
The seafood was good but the breading was a little much for my taste
Mostly hippie moms who want their organic tea w/organic local agave sweeteners and feeding their croc-ed footed little girls in hemp sweaters blueberry salad wraps power lunches b/w women with asymetrical haircuts and Ellen Fisher cardigans and the random hot guy who probably does a lot of yoga and watches feminist porn
Another companion had the pasta cordon bleu which she enjoyed but there wasn't any chicken in it
A little magical a little homey a little bit of wonderful with great food and plentiful draughts and just enough contemporary edge that you can impress a date or drink with the dudes
My grilled chicken sandwich and raspberry tea were tasty
It has a good flavor but is pretty generic Mexican food
So when you go you have to have their chicken with hummus AMAZING and so damn tasty I recommend the Lentil Fetoosh Salad funny name but the divine flavors are no laughing matter also they have a honey glazed Pizza Eat that one too and of course some Tzatsiki so refreshing and light
And if your a vegetarian or are a slob and have room for a good side dish do their brown rice and lentils there is just something about the seasoning that makes this a meal on its own so you can even throw some grilled chicken on that and call it a night
The steak was great and the fish and chips were very good
Probably won't be back just average but I will admit good dinners and the food was very tasty  Again that is what saved it for me
I had a Grand Slam which used to be good but 3 of the 4 items with this one were with this little tasteless hockey puck thing they called a Chicken Sausage Patty a little serving of hash browns the size I would give my cat & two small
Maybe I'm comparing it a little too much to an authentic Mexican taco stand but I just don't feel like I get my money's worth after I finish my food
I dont mind paying $20 for fast food when it tastes good but sheesh
I wanted Thai because I woke up feeling a little cold coming on and love spicy food when I am feeling under the weather
The pad thai was delicious the chicken with it was very fresh and it always comes with tofu which was better than most tofu I've had
I would go to Basil for a cheaper meal but this seems like a little more work went into the sauces and meat was better quality
It wasn't even that good there are many other places like Parlor or Spinato's that have great flavorful pizza so it doesn't make the most sense to eat here
I've eaten here more often than I want to admit to and every time the food is delicious
It was different and interesting but sometimes you just want to enjoy a good dessert and this wasn't it
All in all I might go back and try a regular pepperoni pizza and a different dessert IF I had a good coupon or they were having a special deal of some kind
their food is actually pretty good which is why I let the horrible service slide a few times
But the ingredients seemed quality and the salads and other dishes people in there were eating sparse at 2pm on a Sunday looked good so I gave it a shot
This pizza has a woodfire quality edge with a middle-of-pie limpness of New York style pizza
Definitely recommend especially if you are weary of cracker crust pizza like me
As for food they have an awesome menu but the food came off a bit cheap in quality to me so I don't think it's worth ten dollars a plate
As for entrees the SanTan Ruben $9 was piled high with juicy and flavorful corned beef Swiss cheese sauerkraut and Thousand Island dressing
It's a little pricier than most chain food but the quality makes it worthwhile
I have also tried their combination chicken platter 3 chicken breasts prepared with three unique recipes the roasted chicken sounds boring but it's very good and the lobster ravioli and all the dishes are very good
Got The Boss Chicken Club  grilled chicken breast applewood smoked bacon creamy garlic-herb cheese lettuce tomato avocado/mayo spread and fried onions on a toasted whole-wheat bun with fries which was really good
3 stars for good food quality and fair prices but with poor game selection and service
Now I was willing to put up with- expired flavorless soda- microwave pizza- a 20% surcharge on my bill without my knowledge
I was waiting for a friend to arrive and other patrons kept me entertained by recommending several tasty dishes
Overall the experience especially the food was phenom and I would recommend trying this place out over and over
I love it when you are not particularly expecting anything and the food turns out to be quite delicious
I did not think the salsas to be that hot as some had mentioned but I like my food quite hot
In a few minutes our food was ready and was it good
the gyros was HUGE meaty excellent pita and an extra order of tzatziki sauce made it perfect
It is a little expensive to eat here because it is quality seafood
We ordered the Sashimi plate for dinner and it was a great size 16 pieces with good quality fish
I can't say enough good things about Baratin--the food the space and the people make this the perfect spot for lunch or dinner
I guess its pretty typical I've eaten at only one Kona Grill that I thought was good for food
The food would be good if served quickly but that rarely happens
The meat is delicious and the seasoning will wake you up without making you sweat too profusely
Despite my concerns the slightly sweet fry-bread mixed with the spicy meat was an excellent combination of flavors
I only had a regular beef and small fries but the beef was tasty and juicy
It's not in the best neighborhood and I figured the seafood couldn't be all that good considering this is the desert
The food served at Juan's is delicious and cheap
The beef had good seasoning and flavor but a little dry and chewy
Simply put the food here is pretty good
The prices are very reasonable but it is not as inexpensive as say Carolina's Mexican Food and the portions weren't enough for my appetite another good sign of the food quality I guess
And the food oh damn the food was sooo good
I can highly recommend the lamb roast served over rice and the chicken shawarma dinner plate served with rice
Tea Infusion combines good service a pleasant atmosphere the BIGGEST selection of tea falvors I've ever been offered delectable desserts and an overall happy feeling
foods is good but not good enough to put up with attitude from staff
It can be a bit expensive but it is good food
The pesto chicken sandwich was like a good chicken version of their fontina burger
Decent flavor on the fish and I liked the rice and beans
Every single visit all food all drinks service always good
It's just so tasty and familiar  the vegetarian dishes remind me of homemade cuban dishes- no surprise since one of the influences of Cuban cuisine is african spices
The food is  totally delicious and many of the vegetarian entrees are low calorie
I have tried The Blue Nile which is good but the food here is tastier
The rolls were awesome the soup tasty and the ponzu chicken OMG
It was good but I didn't like that it took the special out of a typical escargot dish
always fantastic food if you have visitors from out of town that like seafood I would recommend this place
The Ultimate un-chicken Ceaser Salad and a butternut squash and chickpea minestrone cup of soup had an wonderful variety of colors and textures to make my mouth sing - but after finishing I admit that I was neither stuffed nor satisfied
I haven't ever had the revered cinnamon roll but I did try a berry cobbler once a la mode and it was incredibly good - sweet and syrupy with juicy ripe berries and a flaky buttery crust
There are also classes that you can take which will teach you how to make amazingly tasty healthy bread that can be made with the foods sold in the store
The meat was good but the Baja Sauce was bland and not spicy at all
Then all the food including appetizer salad and entre all came out together
The food was good but I am not a fan of most buffets
I got a groupon for Mellow Mushroom wanting to try it out after hearing good reviews of the pizza
After getting our drinks we ordered our food and  that's where the good feelings quickly changed
While the pizza itself was good the service was by far the worst I have ever experienced
The crust was thin and crispy the sauce was lacking a little the mozzarella cheese and chicken was excellent
There was a definite improvement in the quality of the kid's chicken nuggets thank goodness so my son was very pleased
From best to worst the hummus was great very tasty although they went a little too heavy with the accompanying oil and the topcoat of paprika; the falafels were just okay didn't taste near as flavorful as the fresh stuff from Greek Wraps - Ryan C got it spot on with the observation that it tasted like out-of-a-box mix; the dolmas were WARMED I cannot STAND the taste of warm dolmas especially the ones with meat in them - these didn't have meat of course - dolmas MUST be served cold as far as I'm concerned although I understand that this is very much a personal preference; the lettuce had turned wet and soggy from the dolma juice the pita bread was sub-par and was almost as tough as shoe leather when it cooled down slightly I had to growl and wrestle with it to rip off a chunk like a feral animal; and finally
Andreoli's has a nice selection of meats desserts and other tasty looking treats for sale in their store and a variety filled menu full of Italian dishes
The sausage based sauce was tasty and had no shortage of meat
But it's cheap and service is good and worth a stop just to experience the Man v Food tour
If you're looking for better mediterranean food I would recommend cypres grill over on camelback just next to the trader joes
This is a seriously tasty burger topped with cheddar cheese caramelized onions avocado jalapenos and horseradish mustard fries on the side
First off love Wild Thaiger food is excellent service is by in large prompt courteous and a relaxed atmosphere
Excellent pizza we had the pesto tomato and the peperoni sausage and mushroom
The food is worth the wait and the service staff albeit a bit harried is so friendly especially if you're friendly to serve
We enjoyed our cheap drinks and cheap sushi which was really not that bad
The service was great friendly and attentive and the food delicious
Their food is very good and reasonably priced and always cooked fresh upon your order
If you are looking for quality food at slightly higher than Subway prices than this is the place for you
However I must admit the food here is pretty good
The charm of the staff and the delicious food will bring me back over and over again
My summer roll was not good so bad in fact I sent it back
55 for an appetizer and the Paht Pik Thed Pepper Steak with chicken and the Shrimp Snow Peas 10
Unfortunately both of the sauces that came with our entrees were very watery and we had more meat in the appetizer than our meals
There were no words exchanged with this lady let alone with our own waitress and we were extremely patient and low maintenance considering the wait and quality of the food
OverallFood was not worth the mood we left with
Don't leave without trying a Chicago style Italian Beef with sweet and hot peppers
Amazing prices on the food great flavor on the tacos burritos quesadillas etc
My pork and the sauce it was in was tasty but over half the pork was either solid fat or grisly meat
Unfortunately the cost cutting has also affected the food and drink quality
The food is ok nothing special and certainly not worth the price they charge
Uni-  Not freshSashimi assorted- Not fresh cut is very thickTempura- Not crispy soggyCold Somen noodles- bad texture over cookedMiso soup- Made from powder not pasteSushi Rice-  Not badOverall this place is a no go
why oh why are good sushi/japanese restaurants so limited in Phoenix
* I was a bit disappointed by the selelction of food but I guess it is better to do a few key things well than offer a bunch of variety that is not as good
Highly recommend if you're looking for healthy food in Tempe
We ate wonderful food in an atmosphere that made us feel relaxed and at home
I only review fast food joints when they are exceptionally good or exceptionally bad
you have traditional noodle dishes both hot and cold from Japan along with Sushi; pasta dishes from Italy and some items from SouthEast Asia
This makes it easy to grab a little from this dish and something from that dish without disrupting the flavor of either
My friend said his dishes from the Summer Roll to the Grilled Fish was some of the freshest tasting dishes he ever had; good compliment from him
Even though they were close to closing and there was one other couple there the lady I think she is the owner and the waitress were totally cool with us showing up and hooked us up with amazing meditterian dishes toasted bread fruit and aged goat cheese spread extra olives-just were generally laid back and I didn't feel we were rushed at all
Appetizers pizzas and sushis half off plus drinks
Between that area & the hot food chafers there was everything necessary to make yourself a really good gyro including tasty strips of shawarma with lamb & there were also beautifully seasoned fillets of chicken breast & other treats including great rice
Burgers pizzas salads hot dogs and a variety of other classics each with their own twist
Personally I prefer grilled burgers over fried but it's good quality meat compared to the typical fast food joint which should be expected given the difference in price
Amazing patio great musiccheers to whoever auditions these people or trusts their mixed tape great wine selection and awesome food
Juicy flavorful but not over seasoned showcasing the meat itself
Good thing we didn't stick around for dessert
Service was excellent and food was prepared very quickly and came out hot
Good setup with the tvs but factoring in the below average food and the some of the most horrendous service I have ever experienced make Fox Sports Grill a place I wouldnt recommend to my own worst enemy
Although I have been here a few times I wasn't very impressed with the food or the service
Although my shrimp taco's were good my wife's grab meat rellenos was terrible
-  The dessert chocolate hazelnut cake & banana crepes were amazing and perfect & the trio of hummos was excellent
It was during the summer and my host mother would always make cold noodles with dipping sauce a very popular dish during the humid summer months
Cold buckwheat noodles a light soy-based dipping sauce and a little fried panko fish on the side the perfect dish for when it's hot as sin outside
It makes me feel less guilty about eating pizza and there is more flavor to enjoy rather than eating a large amount of dough
It was the first time my friend had tried the rosemary potato and she was surprised at how good potatoes could be on a pizza
The baked apple pie dessert with ice cream was pretty darned tasty though
cherry limeade was tasty and dessert was tastyservice great
This is an excellent place to go if you like meat potatoes and beer
This is a fun causal place with good food and friendly service
The food was tasty and plentiful the hosts were friendly albeit a little overextended
Good place for lunch large fast service good prices and good food
It was just okay -- the food was good but I've had better service at soup kitchens
I'm not the sort of person that minds waiting for good food but I at least appreciate status updates and attention from the wait staff in the mean time
Spicy Tuna Tempura Roll had no flavor the rice was so sticky just tasted like those bad Sushi you get in a box from supermarket
The presentation of the dishes and smiles on their faces made me realize it's all good here
The food wasn't jaw droppingly good but it did the trick and was pretty good for what it was
With its sheer curtains and dim lighting it's a nice little hideaway where the drinks are tasty and the food is delicious
Mom's tried and liked the meatballs here they're OK and the fettucine alfredos I'd ordered were good  when I craved for the dish a couple of times- I needed something quick and didn't have a way to check out other options
The chicken was mediocre at best certainly not worth the 5 bucks to add it
Also the meats and cheese were just thin slices nothing of exceptional quality
This time we sat in a cozy corner and enjoyed another delicious pizza
Highly recommend the food the atmosphere and the service
I've always said that food needs to tell a story and this dish had a subtle beginning and an amazing end
The prices seemed reasonable for the food and the flavor
Combined with the bad service and poor quality of food I will not be returning to this restaurant and will make sure to inform all of my friends family and coworkers not to bother wasting their time
It was good but nothing distinguished it from similar dishes served at other Chinese restaurants
The inexpensive yet tasty food grill that served a nice variety of foods has been replaced with the Boar Head Deli and Fatburger
Not only do I find the teriyaki sauce that Japanese places typically use to be too sweet but there is always so much - sushi edamame seaweed salads - at good Japanese places that I would rather spend my money on and fill my stomach with
Yes there was tons of salad with a delicious sesame dressing and white rice but there was also a *lot* of meat
It was subtle and flavorful but not too sweet serving to bring out the flavor of the meat and not just provide a sticky and overwhelming glaze
I am however docking The Blue Fin a star because the quality of my husband's beef wasn't as high as that of the chicken; it was fatty and hard to chew
Service has always been great and food is very good and reasonably priced
The meat was a little tough and lacked flavor
I will continue my quest for a phenomenal mexican eatery in Scottsdale hell I will even settle for a hole in the wall in Phoenix as long as the food is GOOD
The chicken cheese and crab combination was very tasty and incredibly filling
While I won't be back here for sushi I can see where this may be a good place to have a cocktail or two
The appetizer of seared tuna was good and I liked 2 of the rolls
The pizza I got looked more like a salad then a pizza but after i removed the 12 pounds of arugula from the top I found my pizza and it was delicious
So overall the food quality was top class
I can get same quality from NYPD or Mama Mia pizza for half the price or twice as much for about the same price
Anyway I'm not telling people to stay away from this place as the food was very good
The food is consistently good and the decor reminds me of the Gourmet Ghetto Thai restaurant Thai Rama in Berkley CA
The food is consistent standard Chinese-American always hot with fresh veggies
I was fortunate enough in my life to have enjoyed food in different continent Europe and USA
Coming from Seattle with lots of good Japanese food and moved to the desert gives me a bit of pessimistic thoughts about this place
I have had Mamma Mia's pizza 3 or 4 times now and each time it is as good as the last
The straight sushi was very good -- the tuna was fresh the roe not fishy
The hostess or manager not sure who she was but nonetheless lending a hand was very gracious in accommodating a prompt removal of these sushi abortions and supplying additional tuna and spicy tuna rolls which were both VERY good
Food ranges from delicious elegant and lovely beef carpaccio to mediocre bland chicken rollatini and what might as well have been frozen vegetables
v's play cards or a board game even bring your own food in  if you want and just chill out and enjoy some good beers
Caprese Skewers Bruschetta & Meatball Trio were all hot fresh & super tasty
Good Food - Good Service - Good Ambiance
After devouring the yummy cornbread we ordered two appetizers their Q-Rolls and their Fire Pie Pizza topped with beef brisket
Instead of mini hot dogs Bobby stuffs the little flaky pastries with juicy beef brisket
The beef brisket pizza was good but not great
The pulled pork and beef brisket were both juicy tender and incredibly flavorful
I have eaten at this location once and the food was great I wasn't a huge fan of the bar area for after dinner drinks however the crowd skewed much older than my preference and I am no spring chicken the service was very good and extremely  friendly though so no complaints there great wine list despite the fact that the mark up for booze there is nothing short of highway robbery
Sweet and Sour chicken was good and my friends lo mein noodles were exceptionally tasty
These beauties are mini eggrolls stuffed with cheese chicken and green chili goodness drenched in a jalapeno cream cheese sauce
Sorry no recommendation for other dishes here from me
For an appetizer we had crispy spring rolls which were pretty much your average spring roll
Maxim is a hole-in-the-wall Vietnamese restaurant that offers up a decent bowl or pho or bun bo hue and some tasty fresh appetizers such as the fresh spring rolls
Don't get me wrong the food was good but there is better sushi than here
Overall the fried chicken was good but we've had better in Texas and California
A good amount of seating inside a nice place to hang out for your after dinner dessert or on a hot Phoenix day
My wife had the roasted chicken sandwich and Gorgonzola salad I had a bite and it was delicious
I had the pita pizza which was delicious but extremely overpriced
The pizza crusts are hand tossed and their ingredients are of good quality
Food was hearty home cooked piping-hot goodness
4 stars because of a great ethnic culinary experience its  tasty food and kind staff
The alcoholic drinks are very good and the button to call the waiter is fantastic but the food is lacking
I mean some of the stuff is good mostly on the dessert menu but I warn you about the Milkshake
There are a few things on the menu that are a bit Americanized however there are some stellar examples of this simple yet tasty food
The Beef and Guinness is wonderful but the daily offerings are sure to please as well
We always get the cheese pizza and it is always amazing never had a problem
Overall the food was excellent the bartender was more attentive to us than our server I just wish I could've enjoyed more
Short-and-sweet Good food marginal parking excellent people-watching
It was fieldtrip time for us as we piled into the car and walked in curious if this tiny hole-in-the-wall restaurant was going to deliver good food
We all had a good time and the pizzas and wings were good too
When we walked there was no AC and it was around 110 that day so you can imagine how hot it was in a place where they are grilling up food
-food was good not great but good specifically cottage cheese was watered down and the mac'n'cheese had way too much chipotle spice in itOver all we had a good time the people watching is great
The Maki Rolls are a little outlandish at times but good
Fish is very Fresh and very high quality and well served
Staff is Friendly makes good suggestions and allows you to order as you go unlike a lot of Sushi places
good food good service if you're Hispanic
maybe when you're a regular there friendlier but the food was wonderful
They  were nice enough to bring us some super delicious complimentary dessert shots of a creamy cinnamony drink along with mini churros
my friend ordered the bbq beef and thought it was extremely tasty
The restaurant is a cut above -- considerably above -- the standard hotel restaurant in this country with reasonable prices for quite good food
Well I would love to have tried this wonderful food that I read about in the reviews but I guess I never will
I think next time I will go with a meat plate sides were tasty
I think we shared three or four desserts and I wasn't that impressed with any of them
We tried three of the pizzas-  and they were all excellent
The calamari was quite good the mussels were overcooked and rubbery and the pepperoni pizza was acceptable as was the arugula salad
I don't mind paying a lot for food when it's good but this just felt like complete robbery
When the food is that much at risk of getting cold you should have more than one person serving
Like I said I expect a certain markup for good food but you don't have to gouge people quite so egregiously
Desserts were nothing worth writing about
The staff was friendly and they had Mr Pibb which is an instant extra star from me I only ate the orange flavored chicken nuggets but I tasted his orange chicken dinner and it was just okay
Basically if you want three scoops of okay food for the price of one scoob of the good stuff you'd get at Panda Express come here
Now this would not have been an issue had the food been worth that
Every week they screen a first-run indepdent feature everything from Hobo with a Shotgun to Trollhunter and Conan O'Brien Can't Wait
The food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable AND we got a great deal
I recommend this to everyone looking for good sushi in the area and will definitely be back again
I dither between two meals - either the ham and swiss sandwich with a small paradise pasta salad or else one of their Fuji Apple Chicken salads which are freakin' delicious
We left with a small bill after a few drinks and some good food and vowed to go with friends again soon
After my services I had lunch a delicious salad with veggies and chicken while I wrote some thank you notes and read my book
Go to any of the other stadiums for a great venue shade food choices good beer etc
This place produces really good fast food/ Mexican food
Sure there are other places in The Valley that are fancier where the food comes to your table almost too pretty to eat but that comes with a price tag and often a nice appearance is used to mask inferior quality
but with regards to the entirety of the dish i wasn't that impressed
If you ask for it they will make their dishes Thai hot something many chain-type Thai restuarants will not do
My husband had the Cascabel-Chile Marinated Carne Asada and it had good flavor but the meat was over cooked somewhat
I'm all about good ratios not too much meat not too much bread
The beef tasted good with the mustard and onions and pickles and ketchup
They recently contracted with a cattle rancher up in Camp Verde and now they have fresh GRASS FED beef as well which is interesing and delicious
it reminded me of eating hot sauce and meat on a cracker
I'm sure the veal is quite tasty but I just can't bring myself to digesting it not to mention it was more expensive than the chicken
The CHICKEN parmigiana by the way was extremely tasty with al dente angel hair pasta fresh cheese melted under the broiler a slightly sweet and tangy sauce and perfectly cooked chicken
They also had a good amount of fish some type of skin on roasted fish in a butter sauce a fried fish and fried whole tilapia
I was very happy to see a wide range of hot sauces to put on the food including siraca at the tables chillie oil and chillie paste
Well in closing the food was pretty good but the service was horrible
They use Morningstar Farms chicken and Worthington's Turkey - it is the best mock turkey I've ever eaten - and you can't buy Worthington's in AZ so you've got to try it at Capriotti's
The hot foods section along the corner area of the buffet has items such as buffalo wings meatballs in marinara sauce and a taco bar
The Grind's burger is unbelievably tender and juicy but it also maintains a great beef flavor
The sushi is soooooooo fresh and with happy hour you can ordered 4 salmon nigiris for 7$AMAZINGI've gotten to know the regular sushi chefs and they're totally cool and will basically make me whatever I can dream up that day
also near the sushi bar theres a section of cold dips
their chicken is damn good and the atmosphere in the place does get a little too hot at times
the food is very RICH especially their iced tea it's like drinking pure sugar soooo good
The Brio burgers are tasty the flatbread pizzas are almost authentic and pretty good I didn't really care for the dip but my wife liked it and the beef on bruschetta is really good
99/ lunch seems low but when you come face to face with the food it screams blandness unhealthiness and low quality
The lunch selections include a taco bar with greasy high-fat beef a salad bar that attempts to imitate Sweet Tomatoes but it comes up far short some other low-quality Chinese and Italian options and a dessert bar
Good if not great teriyaki chicken/beef all-white chicken and brown rice available better then average pot-stickers gyoza and a very good fast food sushi menu
here I am in Tempe on Mills and I'm just looking for a place with good food and drinks
Classic fare for my food the pork sandwich tasted right with plenty of sauce juices and flavors there was a finely cut slaw on it that balanced out the flavor
So this is a shorty review but if you are in need of food for a reasonable price that is good over conversation and drinks you might want to consider this one of your stops
It was wonderful plentiful not too greasy despite being all fried food and piping hot with crispy fried batters
In short--the service was great the grilled/fried food is wonderful the atmosphere is comfortable and inviting
I'll stick with just mild   Fried fish and chicken basil mmm so good
It arrived with every one else's main dish and looked quite appetizing it was very hot the broth was tasty and the vegetables were crisp
Service could be considered slow but the food is well worth the wait
It's worth every moment particularly considering that the food was well under $5
Anything you need in the way of sides or amazing desserts can be found in the other areas of Baiz Market but that's another review for another day
The orange chicken was just spicy enough but not too hot to eat
The sweet and sour chicken had a thicker breading which I wasn't too fond of but tasted good anyway
The egg roll was a little over done on the outside and full of flavor on the inside
I love everything about this place; how its decorated the delicious food and the friendly staff
My fish was prepared well and seasoned perfect it was salty but a good salty not too salty and the flavors of the light aioli and pine nuts went well together with the fish
I've also had the meat pizza buffalo chicken pizza and they were all good
We split the Thai Dynamite Chicken large chunks of chicken delicious basil no vegetables sadly and the Chicken Japanese Chile Ramen very spicy delicious and perfect
In addition to the totally acceptable food pleasant service and good prices you get the added bonus of checking out an old school cigarette vending machine on your way out
Let's just say everything is decent but it's not the greatest most flavorful mexican food there is
They rely on flavors versus sauces in this dish and I found it rather refreshing
I cook fairly similar to this at home so it's nice to find a place away from home that can treat food properly without relying on fats and butters and actually tastes good with out being 'bland' healthy
The pizzas are still delicious -- these days I especially like the one with leeks and pistachios -- and the veggie salad still rules although there have been times it has been overdressed
ask for the prefixe menu - for about $35 a person you get an appetizer an entree and a dessert
appetizers we had the grilled skewers  4 skewers - 1 shrimp 1 eggplant and 2 satay beef
That said--the food is good [kind of modern fusion] I've only been there twice for lunch so I can't say how dinner is and since I've only been there for lunch I can't say if the wine list is any good
I'm originally from Cali and they have amazing Asian food there that just can't compared to what you get here
The food however was very good and so were the drinks
The bread itself was good; the stewed beef was so-so
It did tast very fresh fresh tomatoes and toppings but I like more garlic oregano a little more zip in flavor on my pizza
the food is decent but not all things are worth the price
My wife had a chicken chimichanga combo and it was so good it inspired me to try a simple chicken taco
But the crowning achievement was the appropriately named What the Heck roll - a mix of a whole bunch of stuff that translated into hot deliciousness
The food needs to be fresh and hot to really enjoy it
The food was absolutely wonderful every bite was a treat
I would avoid eating here the chicken lacks flavor
They switch the menu up pretty often which can be good and bad RIP Steak and Fries - Best $19 steak I've ever had but they also bring back some favorites as well Helloooo Jack's Crispy Chicken Platter
I'm giving 4 stars because the prices have gone up in the last few months they've stopped offering their pimento cheese dip at the bar which was amazing and they no longer offer the crescent rolls with dinner anymore
Hubby had the Red chicken and a few other things I don't remember and said they were good
-This food is good but does it justify the mark up
The pinto beans were tasty enough to be a dish in itself
I chose a flavor lemon that was less appealing simply because I didn't want my dessert to have been exposed to farm flies
Food is amazingly fast for the quality and rather inexpensive too
My husband brother-in-law and I each ordered different menu items jerk chicken curry chicken and fricassee chicken with the special rice and had Jamaican sodas that were recommended by Marie I think that was her name
I am not sure where jerk spices originated but the food is infused with those tasty flavors as well
We had to wait for a while for our food but that was good news to us=ignore the whiners who demand the food fast
The restaurant is very consistent with customer service and quality of the food
Our food came pretty quickly and everything tasted wonderful
My food was good but I'd have a hard time paying $25 for it
The beef was a little more flavorful, but still only mildly warm
However, I have people around me that wish to sabotage the wonderful principles I have about eating healthy and not stuff myself throughout the entire year, by bringing home items like cookies, pies, cupcakes and cinnamon rolls
Their jade chicken and black beans are really good
I recommend that dish for anyone who goes to the Cafe
I tried my 1st sandwich there roast beef with cheese hot and the bread was so fresh and the meat/cheese was delicious- I made my hubby take a bite
The BEST though, was the side dish that the waitress recommended with my sea bass - sugar snap pees
Both my wife and I thought this side dish was amazing
They have hot food ready to eat where you can even get a whole duck and a bakery that smells great
We had the dumpling soup base was blah- soysauce based with little flavor and adding spicy sauce didn't help soup dumplings however looked home made and were nice fried dumplings pan fried not fried only 2 sides were fried beef chow fun good beef was a bit saucy which is not how I normally have it Mongolian beef best thing we ordered beef & Broccoli just OK short rib now my friend said it was like Korean BBQ-- I was laughing inside
The meat is cut strange little triangle on the bone and the flavor is sooo different than Korean BBQ it's almost insulting
The meat selection as they came around was very good but I couldn't help thinking that I saw sirloin's much more often than the more tender rib selections
25 and I must say for the price the amount of food that you receive is excellent
Regardless we received our food and it was still super hot and delicious
The sushi was good but nothing too special
The fish is great quality and the rolls are well done
I love how different the las vegas roll here is kinda hard to eat but very good
For a great dessert place I highly recommend the Sugar Bowl
Yes I dipped my bread in the segments of the serving dish to absorb more garlicky goodness
Let me start by saying I love a good juicy burger it ranks as one of my favorite foods
The fish steak and prime rib dinners at Feeney's are excellent  and include one of the best salad bars I've seen anywhere
Excellent home cooked style tortas aguas frescas and many other foods
It is not a fancy place but what it is is good mexican food with an atmosphere to compliment it
All in all a good experience and we will go back when we are in the mexican food mood which is about once a month
The dessert and drink were comped but even if they had not been it would have been worth it
The food is great the service is excellent
My husband had the chicken hash which was exactly as described and was a pretty good authentic hash
Overall ambiance is good staff is friendly service is quick and the food is decent
I generally think food at hotels are less than adequate
Prices are a bit high but the quality of the food offsets the price
By the way the desserts Homemade White Chocolate Bread Pudding and Kahlus+ Chocolate Toffee Mousse Cake were both very good
The good was prompt seating and the chicken fried steak was really good
Highlights Good beer selection friendly staff extensive menu with the emphasis on meat and pork stick-to-your-ribs German comfort food gemu00fctlichkeit ambience
My wife had a pesto Crusted Chicken that was really good
Smelled like lots of good food so I have no Idea what was going on when Cher T
This was ok meat tasted really good but the buns were very plain
I had the fresh fish soft tacos which were delicious
Their food is really good especially the crazy calamari salad
Of course I always get the free H2O and I just ordered the meatball sandwich took some advice from a friend and one of good friends ordered the calamari
Anyhow this Jerk chicken was absolutely delicious
The other stuff with this chicken was so dang good I wanted more
The food was still good back then but now it just seems to have that something extra
which I just don't understand cause the food is reasonably priced and seriously amazing
We skipped dessert because with all this goodness we were pretty full
I forgot what its called but I think I had the thai peanut with chicken and it was really good
The second time I went I had the hummus whic was pretty good not sure if I'll get it again but I didn't want alot of food like the bowls
i usually start with the ahi temura roll then i move onto soup i love a good corn chowder and tonto has some of the best slightly smokey and nice and chunky i have tried almost everything on the menu and usually notice when they add something new such as the butternut squash soup excellent
Family was impressed by the place and I kept on raving about the food
If I were to rank the pizzas in descending preference from excellent to good because none are bad
The seafood linguini had a spicy kick to it which surprised us all but the pasta was delicious
We ordered the Seafood pizza and it was not good
The chicken fried chicken was AMAZING and I highly recommend either that dish or the pork chop
The happy hour menu include teppanyaki sushi a lot of different appetizers and drinks
This is what we order  from the happy hour menuchicken and steak teppanyakiyummy yummy sushi rollshrimp tempura rollkobe sliderscoconut chicken skewersAsian pear martini The food is delicious
The only thing I tried food wise was the Wasabi Tofu which was really good but watch out the first bite is REALLY hot in every way
It's obvious that quality has been taken into account as all of the vegetables and meats are locally produced and purchased from small farms
The Kung Pao chicken was alright kind of disappointed in its lack of sauce but the veggies and almonds that came where good
Pretty much this place is good for quick and cheap food
I really want to give Maizie's a chance I've been there 5 times but when it comes down to it I have to remind myself that the reason I go to a restaurant is to EAT EXCELLENT FOOD
But no doubt that the guys who have eaten here will tell you that the food is pretty amazing
The Sausage Sandwich is amazing as are the pizzas especially the Chopped Pizza You will experience a wide variety of choices on the menu all the food is fresh and the service is outstanding
Greek is not always my first choice of food however this quality casual dining experience keeps me coming back
We don't go back because it's where we've always gone but because of the good food and great service
If you're in the downtown area and really want some good Mexican food this is the place to go
My prediction is that 50 years from now when all the patrons of this place have died of heart attacks the next generation will look back on this food the same way we look back on asbestos it seemed like a good idea at the time but boy was it a killer
They haven't taken pics of their food since they opened cause it's that damn good
I had heard the food was good so when my boss offered to take me I was excited
I had heard the enchiladas were good but I opted for a heathier option and ordered the chicken tacos with corn tortillas
Most of their food is worthy of four stars they have a decent beer selection and know how to pour and the service is good
I was iffy to try this place because on the outside it looked kinda ghetto but I'm SO glad we did because the food is SO tasty
It has the best bar food you're likely to come across and some great beers that are so good you can even get them at the local liquor store
The rolls were completely overpriced $11 and $13 which wouldn't have bothered me so much if they were good
We got the Sakura and Geisha roll and for all the delicious goodness that was supposed to be in them I was extremely disappointed at how crappy they were
At least I wasn't starving I was just lacking good sushi when I walked out
I had the meatloaf special which sounds weird at a place like this but it was excellent
I recommend that if you do go here that you save room for dessert
We split the bread basket the cinnamon roll was very good the biscuits were amazing and I probably would have enjoyed the muffin more if it we rent for the poppy seeds
I got the chipped beef gravy good I think next time I will order the sausage but the gravy itself was so good it didn't need any meat at all
The food selection is great amazing salads appetizers pizza's &  sandwich's
It was hot and juicy with chunks of pineapple mixed in with the vegetables and tender meat
Their baked goods from breakfast to desserts all looked delicious and unique
We tried their pizza - which was very good - light crust and not super oily
I haven't ate here yet but if the food is the same as they serve at Stand Up Live it's pretty tasty bar fair
The service was fantastic and the food was amazing
I got the chicken salad sandwich and it was delicious
Your a 24 hour diner the food should ALWAYS be hot and fresh
The prices are perfect the service is great and the food is really delicious
I wasn't putting a lot of hope in the food but everything that we've tried has been very good
But the food tastes so good that it isn't even an issue for me or my usually very picky boyfriend  we just make sure to have them cook everything well
They had some really good seasoned roasted jalapenos that made a great addition to the plate added nice heat and flavor to the dishes
I definite enjoyed the variety and the quality of the food
After having checked out a dozen or so highly recommended sushi spots I had pretty much givin up on the idea of good sushi in the dessert
I really enjoyed the Red Devil White pizza in a 10 size; it's the perfect amount for two or three little meals i
The selection of food is not as good as 5th and Wine but is great for an appetizer or snack
Don't get me wrong the food is good but we went last night
The food quality is low and the taste is nothing amazing
The food is not bad per se it is just not that good
I enjoyed a perfectly cooked pan roasted free range chicken kung pao style
I recommend the Lulu it is very good and has tons of meat
is so so much better hot - why not bring it out at the end of the meal instead of with the rest of the food
Although the shrimp lobster dumplings vegetables black cod spicy tuna roll chicken and steak were also amazing
The chocolate cake for dessert had a funny color green center but tasted delicious
It's like going to an italian restaurant ordering delicious pizza and getting delicious pasta instead
I recommend the dish but only as long you know it doesn't taste like biscuits & gravy
Having grown up in Hawaii I have been around the freshest of the freshest seafood and am very picky when it comes to good sushi
I don't mean to put race into the mix by any means nor do I think only Asians can create good sushi the chef at the Ritz was Caucasian but when it comes to sushi it is really an art form and unless it was passed down from generations before you or you went to the Culinary Institute of America
Other than that it's a recommendable place if you just want to throw back a few drinks over good food
Everything is fancy tables decor food presentation BUT the food quality is not fancy
The food was just as good as any other nice Mexican place with less on the menu and comparable pricing
everything we had was good and our experience was fine but nothing about it the food atmosphere decor menu was spectacular
You don't have to worry if the food is too hot or not spicy enough
I wasn't totally impressed the 1st couple times but have come to the conclusion that the food is good for the price
All in all it's good food for a great price
I had a Kobe beef carpaccio appetizer/salad with truffles it was very good
All the food I've ordered has been so good
My only complaint is that sometimes the waiters forget about you and when ordering catering or food to go it takes longer than when you scheduled to pick it up so I'd recommend  asking for an earlier time like 30 minutes so you will get your food when you actually want / need it or just show up 30 minutes early to let them know you're waiting
And what it is is a great place to go to get a quick bite of very tasty asian food
and their kung pao chicken is spicy and flavorful
He also repeatedly put our HOT dishes within reach of the baby in a high chair putting her at risk to be burned
But it is the closest sushi place to my house and the quality of the food is pretty good
But if you are prepared for this it's not too bad because the sushi is good
I had to bump this review up to 3 stars because the quality of sushi
Bottom line when a buddy wants to go grab a drink and some bar food I'll recommend we go here so at least I can eat something but the price point prohibits me from eating there even semi-regularly
The good-Panang curry-Flavorful dishes-Great service-Nice ambiance totally watched couples on first dates here-Nice pillows on couchesThe bad-The rice was dry thin and not the kind that goes well with curry
It was delicious and the perfect amount of food
I will go back but next time will probably just do the cheese and chocolate fondue as it was alot of food but the pork was amazing and we aren't even pork people
tee hee 4 stars good service cute service good food cheap food
It was everything it should be fresh greens good dressing nice crisp won-tons except the chicken was very dry and tasted like it was prepared much earlier
So my wonderful husband switched with me as he had ordered the Bolonese Meatloaf which is a combination of pork veal & beef supposedly covered in a reduction sauce
Frankly again I think my plain meatloaf I make at home has more flavor
Also I thought the dishes could have been served hotter
Meat is always the best quality the veggies are always fresh
Four Cheese Ravioli- they made this usual ho-hum dish sparkle with a light tomato basil sauce and sharp delicious cheeses
If I were to choose I would have to say the muffuleta - with its nearly perfect ciabatta savory Italian meats provolone olive tapenade and sundried tomatoes which was a tasty surprise
I also tried the carrot cake maybe I'm used to the amazing desserts that vegan bakeries have/ the cake was dry with hardly ang frosting; gave it to my dog
I am in the design field and let me say that though the food was the star attraction the decor of the place was amazing too
Very good Kobe or Angus beef burgers and the staff was great
We had a LOVELY dinner were treated wonderfully by the staff and 2 of us ordered that evening's special were so impressed with the dish the chef himself came out and talked to us and gave us the recipe
Other than that it is a great place for a delicious and healthy dessert
The black beans that came with my meatloaf were delicious and the rice was good too
The sandwich was good I guess but I am not really a sandwich kind girl so I just picked at some of the meat
I can have good Mexican food a lot of places and for a lot less than $40 for two people dinner drinks tip
Which in my opinion is Ok if the food was any good unfortunately that was not the case
We ordered a soup a appetizer and two main dishes kung pao chicken and spicy beef
Poor Sonya ordered the beef tacos that sounded wonderful but came to fruition as 2 bite-sized soft tacos with no side
The food although a bit expensive in my opinion was excellent
The only reason this restaurant is getting 1 star is because of the delicious cheesecake dessert and cup of coffee awesome
I guess i'm just spoiled with good Mexican food from where I live
Green is really excellent food in many respects
That's fine I guess especially for recent vegetarian meat-eaters who are missing some of the old textures and flavors
I'm a huge fan of Middle Eastern food so I was thrilled to start our pub crawl off with some tasty food and hookah pipe action
We then had a sampling of various appetizer type dishes and I was quite happy with all of them
The food is always good home-style fare and I've never had a problem with service
Visited this place once - the food was somewhat tasty
Nice  service nice atmosphere as allways good food
I will go back if I'm allowed as the food is good and the service usually is good too
Prices were what you would expect for good sushi but definitely over-priced for the quality that was served here
Good sushi is about fresh fish so my husband and I like to ask the chef's for their recommendation for the night
The chef here sent us out toro it's the fatty part of the tuna good toro is like biting through butter which also happened to be the most expensive fish they had
I couldn't even chew through this toro if this was the freshest fish they had then I am seriously concerned about the quality of their fish
The chef came out to ask us if we liked the toro and when we told him it wasn't good he got very offended and insulted us basically said that it was because we couldn't tell good fish from bad fish
Okay so for the most part the food seems edible however I wouldn't recommend getting the Asian dishes
I ordered the Igby all beef hot dog and a corn doggy
But it's good to try different styles of food in different settings
The egg rolls we got were just so-so but the soup was delicious
There were three of us; our main dishes were $10-$12 each with a $9 appetizer 3 desserts cocktails etc
Food The food was actually pretty good
Chicken was really good a tad dry but this is likely due to smoking then grilling and the veggies were spot on delicious and a great variety of carrots parsnips and butternut squash
But with all that said the food is very good
My wife & I went with 2 other foodie couples who are good friends for our monthly side dish function
I never had Black Pepper Fish at a Chinese Restaurant so I decided to give it a try and it came out piping hot  temperature  with green peppers and onions and mushrooms
My husband tried the Szechwan Pork it also had a nice vegetable to meat ratio and also the sauce is very light and more mildly flavored than other places we had Szechwan at
They offer some dishes I haven't seen elsewhere and I didn't have the Kung Pao or the Orange Chicken but the people who sat behind us did and it looked very good
i give this place the 4 stars because the food is actually really good
The pro pasta appetizer had cheeses meats and mushrooms that were top notch
Quiessence follows the Slow Food way as a philosophy and Greg and Dustin utilize the local produce from Maya's Farm to create delicious and simple rustic new American fare
As always the food was fantastic and all my friends enjoyed their meals
I always order take out for work and they offer me free delicious iced green tea and always converse with you while you wait there awkwardly  The spiked cottage cheese sparked my curiousity as a side with my meal and being the adventurous foody that I am I gave it a shot
However this was balanced by the chips and salsa which I always eat so much of that I'm not hungry by the time the food shows up which seemed to be made fresh not too hot but with plenty of flavor
The menu looked great and we were very excited to try some delicious Cuban food
Luckily we happen to be forgiving when it comes to delicious food so we put that aside
A small place like this can stay alive on delicious food but you have to feed your customers for this to work
A nicer and classier environment than Denny's but the quality of food is similar well slightly better and a bit pricier
If you are really big on breakfast and brunch food and don't want to eat at a nationwide chain restaurant it may be worth it to check this place out just temper your expectations on the protein pancakes
I thought the ribs were good as was the bbq chicken
But really to be truthfully super blunt honest-to-go-honest truth Haji-Baba's food is not the best in the world but it is 1 fresh 2 good quality 3 tasty and 4 cheap
I am sure you can find better Mediterranean food around town but this place is really good on your wallet and fits my needs just right
If you like pizza with a lot of sauce I would recommend asking for extra when ordering
When you go to the pizza kitchen I recommend ordering a salad too
The meat - ordered rare plus was cooked perfectly and was delicious
I was impressed by the good service very knowledgeable staff and in general good food
The food is great the service is good and the atmosphere is pleasant
The food is generally good albeit a bit overpriced -but you expect that to some degree when you walk through the door given the top level service you expect to receive
again i recommend it as a place to go and be rowdy not to eat great sushi
I have had their baked salmon dishes and they are always good
Their sauce is flavorful too you'll want to slather a boatload on your beef
Overall sushi was pretty good for what it was worth
However the meats was absolutely delicious
Valle Luna's fried ice cream is so delicious and since it's dessert they can't charge $18 for it
I have never tried the food here but I have heard it is good too
It was a nice blend between ooey gooey hot pizza and cool crisp salad and I'm into flavor and texture contrasts in my meals
Food was good haven't quite decided if it was crave-able yet though
Besides the food they have an amazing selection of wine and specialty beers
I ordered the voodoo chicken and it was pretty dang good I'll give that to them I couldn't believe adding shrimp was an extra 3 bucks and they only put like 4 pieces of shrimp in it again rip-off
Service was great and the food was very good
My wife had the chicken flower enchalada and she said it was very good
The food is delicious but nothing super spectacular
From the food to the atmosphere the place is simply wonderful
The pizza was amazing and the few glasses of wine made everything even better   We sat outside in May though a little warm it was still enjoyable
I recommend the BBQ Chopped Chicken Salad
Good food clean restaurant if you haven't been there then you are missing out
The customer service was spectacular and the food just as amazing
And the next time I won't be so good -- I'm getting a dessert with my meal no matter what
Thai Town has some of the best quality Thai food in the United States
They have very good white meat chicken and they do not charge extra for it
For a New Mexican joint it is pretty dang good and true to the region but food a sit-down Mexican joint it would be disappointing
Overall I would recommend it to people who don't have expectations of a certain type of food
since I'm not a fan of pizza in general When you're ordering a single slice you shouldn't ever expect it to be fresh and hot
They both said that it was really good pizza that was totally worth 3 bucks a slice
The food was good too but here's where my disappointment begins
If you're Vietnamese and looking for good authentic Vietnamese food you won't find it here
My favorite dish at TC's is the Au Pear Grenache Omelet - a delicious omelet filled and topped with bacon almonds fresh slices of pear and gruyere cheese
From Udon Soup Soba Noodles Tempura fresh fish dishes Tonkatsu Curry Korean Spicy Rib even this wonderful Mushroom & Scallop pasta dish they only have at happy hour Please put it on the menu
The first time I was there it was for the Yelp event and it was not impressed with the food
I had the hot and sour soup and the mongolian beef
However aside from the pain in the ass parking them not taking reservations being herded into his cramped almost non-air conditioned bar for overpriced drinks for hours then being made to sit at the bar instead of a table; the food was very good
The grilled vegetable platter and pizzas are amazing
We finally had to go in and let me say - the quality of the decor matches the quality of food
The first visit we were delighted with most of the dishes - especially the hot dishes - they were delicious
Two of the appetizers that are hits are the antipasto which comes with meat olives mozzarella and roasted peppers spread out on a large plate
Don't get me wrong the pizza is delicious and blows away quite a few other options in AZ but it doesn't take the cake for me
For two people with drinks appetizer pizza and dessert you are looking right under a bill with tip
good food tonight and from the reviews Fuego Bistro seemed interesting
But it was the food that really impressed
The chicken tasted great and was well cooked and the babaganush was excellent as far as babaganushes go
The actual sandwiches solid quality deli stuff using primarily boar's head meats and cheeses

The portions were huge the food came out hot fresh and good
Staff were very friendly food was hot fresh and amazingly gooy
From the burgers to the desserts even to the liver and onions they give you before hand this place is amazing
OK -- not much else to add to what has already been said creepy looking place but knock your socks off good Mexican food
LEST WE FORGET - the crappier looking dingy run down hot windowless next to a bus station types of Mexican food places are the BEST
At the appropriate time my main platter arrived with a BIG Pablano Chile stuffed with delicious Oaxaca cheese a good-sized shredded beef taco & a large serving of steamed vegetables including zucchini broccoli carrot slices & red bell pepper
Finally for dessert we had this amazing cheesecake with rosemary caramel sauce
The beer selection is amazing and the food is top-notch for bar grub
For food I would recommend the Bernaise Sliders
You will not find melted-cheese-laden food here which is a good thing
However the inside is clean and their food is delicious
They have an excellent selection of entrees to choose from their lunch prices are fantastic and the food portions are just right
It was tasty however I still like their Sweet and Sour Chicken better
If you're looking for a new place to get some good Chinese food I highly recommend giving Canton Dragon a try
Its amazing how people are led to believe that this place serves delicious Mexican food
Been there once and never went back again thanks to their awful long lingering wait staff that took forever to bring us drinks and food along with the low quality of the food
No matter the location I can always count on delicious food and great service
Mac and Cheese Squared is a personal AND House Favorite for good reason cheesy noodles cooked in truffle oil with wild mushrooms applewood bacon and chicken breast
But the Panang sauce combined with chicken and rice made for a delicious meal and even a not-so-guilt-free breakfast the next day
I always ask him for recommendations on true Italian dishes that Aiellos makes and they always turn out tasty and amazing
We enjoyed the calamari beef pho several fresh spring and crispy rolls a sandwich and garlic fries
We pulled some tables together and they were a little uneven but the quality of the food overcame all obstacles
I love me some diner food and this is a good place to find it
I'm currently hooked on a sweet dish I never would have considered from the menu - its shrimp honeydew melon and walnuts and is absolutely delicious
However it tasted good and I would recommend trying this dish
The dessert was pretty but just OK for flavor and texture
we've always had good service and great food here
husband enjoys the pig omelette and other meaty spicy goodness
The roast beef is made in house I believe and really good
The wrap was stacked with massive amounts of flavorful moist chicken
The chicken was flavorless and the consistency of a dry sponge

I still think the custard is what makes this place special but their other food is good too
Not currently on the menu but worth ordering is their seafood paella with a delicious sauce featuring just a hint of coffee
We ordered our mains and while the food was good the wait was almost unbearable
The same could be said for the dessert it was decent but the long wait didn't make it worth while
While I will give 3 stars for the freshness and quality of the  food there are too many other great restaurants in Phoenix to go have to endure the mediocre service at Christopher's
I knew I was in trouble though when I asked the waiter to recommend a vegetarian dish and he suggested the veggie pasta with black beans and ginger soy sauce
Some one at the table ordered a bean dip appetizer that came in a small dish and was a bit lacking of flavor
It's one of those food that is fun and good - please do play with your food
Needless to say I rather enjoyed my pizza Ricotta Cheese & Jalapenos Though it was tad bit spicy but I can dig
The tacos were delicious with lightly fried fish cabbage cilantro salsa and a delicious creamy sauce
I love small intimate places that have excellent food
Plus they host cute little musical shows and food trucks & who can pass up chilling in the grass listening to some jams while chowing down on some delicious greasy truck food
allow you to drink beer/wine provide servers that bring you drinks and food during the show amazing recliners foods like hummus and paninis and awesome customer service
Good food nothing super delicious that makes me have cravings
The girls that work here are cute but have horrible attitudes the sushi presentation is awesome but the flavor and freshness is seriously lacking
I simply can't bring myself to try any other dishes because this one with fake beef is so good
Burger selection is pretty good and so are the choices for chicken and salads
I look at Carl's Jr as a good fast food alternative to your typical McDonald's or Burger King with slightly better food and better shakes
Not so good was the Chicken salad sandwich it was just meh
Sometimes the service is a little slow on the first contact but once you order the food comes pretty quickly--and it's good
Pros outdoor seating          delicious foodMediocre margaritasCons wait till first service
The quality of the fish is pretty good not the best
Up next was the most amazing dish of the entire meal the fois gras
I'm not a big fan of the bison because the meat is typically tougher but the favoring and broth was good regardless
The broth was not overpowering so you can enjoy the full flavor of the beef
Some of the dishes especially the foie gras was definitely worth revisiting
love the lime and cilantro flavor pinto beans grilled chicken corn and mild salsa lettuce and sour cream on the side
Most of what we had were dumpling-style dishes all very good
I do not think there are servers only counter service and mostly it appeared to be cold foods
The produce rarely looks fresh and the meat and poultry never looks like it's great quality
Food came at the right moment after appetizers
Love the hot sauce and the food is pretty good
All in all it's not the most fancy place to go but its a good spot if you want to have some lunch do a little off track betting or just go for some drinks and food after work
The chicken is really flavorful unlike a lot of other chicken sandwiches/salads where the chicken is bland and adds nothing to the meal
The food is always excellent and the servers are always super friendly
Other things we've had that are excellent Guacatony garlic cheese bread wings Bistro Classic pizza baked ziti Italian sausage sandwich
All the food - from the rolls to the entrees to the side dishes- were piping hot and delicious
The food is bistro style the chef Eugenia does amazing things with savory and sweet alike
I go here for breakfast every other weekend though it is not open on Sunday   The food is amazing the only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is the portions are too small and could be bigger without any effort
Anyways we ordered the Spicy Tuna rollSpider rollLas Vegas rolland theSummer rollAll were quite amazing
The Spider roll is soft shell crab with the normal ingredients and this was also amazing
I enjoy being able to get a small portion because it is good enough that you don't have to eat barrels of it to feel like you've had a good dessert
The new Scottsdale Quarter location has great ambience and service going for it but I was sorely disappointed by the quality of the pizza
The fish and fries were not the worst thing I've ever eaten but for $5 bucks I would like more than frozen fish patties and frozen fries thrown into hot fat and chunked on a plate
Save your money for better quality food elsewhere
The menu is kind of limited some pizzas a couple calzones sandwiches a few salads and appetizers
I usually hate my entire life and everything in it at 700 when I roll through there but I always drive away with excellent coffee in hand and as much of a smile as possible on my face
Like some fellow reviewers I would definitely recommend the Chicken Pesto Sandwich
If a sandwich is what you are in the mood for Schmooze recommends Roasted Turkey Pear and Arugula or the Blackened Chicken Caesar Wrap
Nothing unusual just the outlandish stuff all hotels charge
The fries with feta and vinegar sauce had such potential for a junk food moment the feta was yummy and the vinegar sauce was good but they served all the yummy stuff on frozen crinkle cut fries how sad
We enjoyed our food and drinks on the cool patio area
Given the food was just appetizers I thought the food should arrive quicker
The menu has a modern twist on your traditional Mexican food but in a good way
has always offered good quick Mexican food
I've visited here for more than 10 years and the food is always consistently high quality
Give me a great atmosphere tasty food made with fresh high quality ingredients good drinks AND be kind to my wallet then I'm yours
If sugar plum fairies came in the shape of delicious beer batter fried dogfish shark pieces
wipes drool from chinI judge a thai restaurant by it's noodle dishes and the brown sauce noodles here were amazing
Two sandwiches and a pitcher of sangria run will run you about $45 but it's worth it to sit and enjoy the good food in their outdoor patio space
The quality of the meat is good really good
The coffee was fantastic and the food quality was very high - extremely fresh and tasty
The conveyor belt is almost hypnotic the food is quite good the price is awesome maybe just train the waitresses a tad better but since the food mostly comes to you who cares
I think their food is very tasty with a full assortment of flavors
It's the perfect blend of self-service meets top restaurant quality food
With very good quality food and great prices no wonder it is so popular
The food was good but not nearly as good as it should be considering what you're paying for it--yes it's pricey for what is essentially bar food
started going to logans some years back and I really enjoyed it there everyone was nice and the food was good
Have ordered fish that was so over cooked I couldnt eat it not only was it over cooked it was cold not warm COLD
It didn't disappoint - both the soy chunk curry and the pop cho were very tasty as were the avocado and plantain spring rolls we got
The atmosphere gets five stars and the staff was friendly and service excellent but the food is overpriced and the food was satisfactory
The prices are a little excessive but I think the quality and freshness of the food is outstanding and that this is well worth paying a little extra to obtain
Service was attentive and the food was pretty good
The muffins breads and rolls are always tasty
The rest of the menu is excellent with various offerings of classics like meat loaf sandwiches fish and chips salads and classic entrees
Don't forget dessert big enough  to share but good enough not to want to
I agree with the other reviewer the house chicken is good and very well priced for the amount of food you get
I am not a huge fan of the egg drop soup or wor wonton soup not enough veggies the crab puffs are good but the house chicken is what brings us back give it a try and see how you like it
The dessert menu is also amazing and all of the desserts are made in-house that day
The food was ready but still steaming hot
I remember thinking that if the food was half as good as the people are nice it'll be awesome
I get cheap food that's good at the time then you feel like death later
Haji-baba has cheap food insanely cheap food food so cheap you would debate eating there due to the cheapness but have no choice but to give it a shot because
The quality of the food at Haji-Baba is parallel to high end middle eastern restaurants its FANTASTIC
The chicken shawarma wrap I ordered was 3 dollars and change the size of a glove box  exaggerating but its BIG and incredibly delicious
There are tons of ways to be delicious vegan dishes that don't include the abomination to me that tofu is from a taste and mouthfeel standpoint
Been there a couple of times and the food is excellent and cheap
The best dishes seemed to be the soups - Alex's posole had the right color to it and my albondigas contained some tasty pillowy-soft meatballs
The pizzas are pretty good if not slightly over priced but you're paying a bit for the atmosphere instead of a hole in the wall type joint
Its a cute little place at the very end of a very sad empty strip mall but it holds it own with delicious food
In the end we were overcharged for the paella and sangria we didn't want Calamari in the Paella the service was awful food moderately good Sangria average
The second time was on a Saturday a couple weeks ago and my buddies wanted to check out a cool spot for food and drinks in Scottsdale so I took them here and it ended up being a good call
2nd experience 5 stars chill lunch atmosphere with good food and good drinks
Just ate the spicy chicken wrap which was hot packed with veggies and perfectly seasoned
We started out with the fried wontons standard fried wontons with like 1/16th of a teaspoon of spiced ground chicken filling and spring rolls which were actually quite good despite the extreme stickiness of the wrappers
What really worried us though is that the appetizers came out about 30 seconds after we ordered them which led us to worry that they'd been sitting around; I'm not always against pre-making food but this place isn't busy enough to ensure rapid cycling
Every time I go I get the beef ribs and hot link
The hot link is the best and the beef ribs are huge and meaty
Their muddy waters sweet tea and lemonade and their strawberry lemonade is good and their desserts are good as well
Basic salad bar with some fruit and cold pasta salads 4 soups 1 pizza choice 2 hot pastas ground beef tacos 3 dessert breads and a soft serve machine
The hot-and-sour soup was a little gelatinous and not very hot or sour; the egg-rolls were mediocre; and I'm pretty sure they served me last night's ribs for my appetizer
We enjoyed some food from the restaurant and sat under the olive trees
its located downtown its crowded its youthful its noisy its got decent food creativity is decent food taste pretty good
But they still have the same calorie laden sauces most of the sandwhiches come with mayo by default and fatty meat which apparently now is hormone-free which is a good thing
I had the 'Unlimited soup and salad and the first soup was their tomato basil which was great and I had the Santa Fe chicken salad with it also very good
The food was honestly 4-star worthy SO tasty
Lastly the dessert was reasonably sized for two people to share and indulge in the great flavors but without over doing it
The meat had a good flavor some sauerkraut and the thousand island was brought on the side
Delicious pizzas salads bigger than your freakin' HEAD
Our server was kind enough to offer a couple dessert shots on the house we ordered the raspberry cheesecake & triple chocolate mousse
Overall the food & drinks were good but I'm not really dying to come back
The meat is tender juicy and flavorful; the fries are divine; you can't go wrong ordering regular sweet potato or a mix of both kinds of fries
As much as I would love to try the other dishes the delux burger and fries are too good not to order time and again
Hey I like the place for its close proximity to our home for their consistently good California roll with a crab mix pork tenderloin entree avocado egg roll but it's not worth waiting 45 minutes
The flavors of each dish were decent but not the best I have had
Also it's worth noting that this is a good place to come over for coffee and/or dessert after lunch next door at Pita Jungle
The waiters have always been really knowledgeable and educated about the flavor profiles of their fish and are usually really good about letting you know what is going to be best that day and what is the freshest
I have yet to find a sushi place in Phoenix that has fish as good as theirs it's not the best but it's the best I've had in the valley
Italian Beef this is my favorite here with the hot peppers
His dish was amazing I had to fight for a couple bites
For the fish course I had poached halibut that was served with some kind of really flavorful sauce and a vegetable puree so that whole thing was extremely delicious
I was very surprised that he enjoyed it so much since he is usually not a raw fish kind of guy
For dessert I got a goat cheese cheesecake that was truly amazing
or from letting the flavors from one dish influence the next
Let's just say for the actual price of the food that this restaurant isn't worthy of a revisit
We noticed the waitress across from us was very good to their party constantly rounding and making sure everybody had their refills and checking in on the food and if they wanted more entrees
We will give em props on the food because it was DELICIOUS
The salad wasn't a big deal but the appetizers were AMAZING same with the entrees the meats were tender and succulent
Hey Guy call me I can recommend better food better prices and way more atmosphere
I enjoyed my meal despite having to eat it in the middle of the crowded mall food court
As a New Yorker myself I can say that Mama Mia takes care of the craving for good real NY pizza
A pasty is fresh not frozen and the filling choices are infinetly better than the stardard ham and cheese or pepperoni pizza hot pocket
The hot dog was on a toasted bun which was good the all beef hot dog had great flavor and they pilled the cheese and bacon on the top of it I ordered the bacon cheese and tomato hot dog
I think my prime rib french dip won over the chicken pot pie or kobe burger although all were good
the beef was too dry and the ginger flavoring
But overall I would gladly return very good food
The food was amazing and I can honestly say I have dealt with many vendors and this event was seamless
Yes the food is not that good for you so it will have to be a once in a while splurge
The food is good not great but definitely above average
These were served with horseradish potatoes which were also very good
I remember a time a couple years ago when the food at 3 Roots was really really good
I had a spicy lobster roll-SO GOOD- and vegetable tempura
Chicken and waffle was good - nothing life changing or worth writing home about
Sun Devil chicken/pork/beef sounded tasty but I knew to call bullshit when it said extremely spicy
Sure the chicken was cooked properly but there was no detectable flavor in the meat itself OR the batter
Chang Lee is full of mediocre uninspiring food that lacks quality is overpriced and no sides other than a smidgen of white rice No wontons
The Fish N Chips are just as good and if you're not a drinker grab a pint of Root-Beer
Gallo Blanco hits all of these marks and more with its amazing food eclectic atmosphere and focus on high-quality local and sustainable food
Great service nice environment  wonderfully prepared food
However I would like to quibble with a previous reviewer-- this is NOT the hottest Thai food around
I have been to Thailand 3 times so I should know The hottest Thai food and amazingly good as well is Thai Lahna
But Malee's is excellent excellent food
I think I would have enjoyed it more if we didn't have a horrible dinner at Akai Hana Sushi
Skip forward a couple of decades and we were still talking about this pizza and how good it really is when our friend said Oh yeah I know where they are now
Very low key relaxing environment with really good Italian food
We started with the Caramelized Onion Tart with Figs and Gorgonzola added on the Edamame Dumplings at the recommendation of our waiter and rounded out our meal with Curry with Rice Noodle Cauliflower Cashews and Chicken
Great place to bop in and grab some good food quick and at a really reasonable price
My mom thought the decor was a little stark but good healthy food always trumps atmosphere for me
I did however enjoyed the slight spicy kick that the dish had
I'm not much of a sirloin lover - I prefer Rib Eye because of the juicy flavors from more marbling but this Red Meat Lover would never turn down a steak
They have a simple spaghetti with olive oil basil tomatoes and grilled chicken and it's pretty tasty
I got the Kung Pao Beef it came with choice of soup egg drop or hot and sour egg roll and steamed or fried rice
It was a lot of food and it was good but I was not blown away like i was expecting
Food is good prices are reasonable and flatscreens are everywhere so you can watch any game that's on
Dry goods/foodstuffs were exactly what I was hoping for
And since none of that is true I'll just have to be content with buying delicious authentic French food with my meager earnings
Pizzas are always delivered ahead of their approximated schedule and are always piping hot
The food was actually quite tasty but our server was horribly rude
I can get Thai food nearly as good for cheaper in Chandler where I live but for a date night out this place will do nicely
It's not the kind of restaurant hard-core foodies would be impressed with but definitely the kind of place where a group of friends can just hang out and relax after a hard day's work
i also got to try the turkey burger which was also juicy and flavorful along with the chicken panini which was incredibly tasty
The sliders were awesome all the meat was very moist and full of smoky flavor my favorite out of the three was definitely the pulled pork
We tried their pizza which was really good
As mentioned in most of the other reviews their produce is gorgeous their food fresh and delicious and their staff friendly and helpful for the most part
I'm no Indian connesseur but I like my food hot yet with some flavor
There's no reason to trek out here if you're craving good Indian food - unless your sole goal is to make you nose run and clear your sinuses
So I thought corned beef rubbed with ancho chili spice and topped with sauerkraut on rye was going to be a bomb of savory tangy spicy flavor
Yea the food is good - but the service is just so ridiculously bad
I'm sure they used quality ingredients and at no point did I feel the possibility of contracting some food-borne illness from my food which would have made the experience more authentic in my opinion hehI just didn't think it was all that and the size/taste to me did not justify the price
I will probably be back at some point since this is in my neighborhood and the food was tasty after all
A gigantic serving of tasty lean meats over a bed of steamed cabbage carrots broccoli and zucchini
Who would have thought that mixing Mexican and Chinese food would be a good idea
Between the sushi and the other food everything is pretty run of the mill good here
I would usually go with 4 stars for a place like this because the food is that good in my opinion but I am just tacking on the extra one this time for the nostalgia
But truly the food is pretty darn good and it has stood the test of time
My main course choice was the Double Stacked Chicken Enchiladas Christmas Style Red and Green Chile I would so SUGGEST this choice Christmas Style it was very flavorful and added a nice mixture of taste with each bite
She was spot on keep my water glass filled which is hard to do I'm a fish and had everything out hot and quickly
Yeah yeah she knows it was seafood but you don't anticipate a huge fishy bite the flavors should have been blended better so this doesn't happen
I'm not a huge fan of their pizza it's good but not great
A unique quality about Indulge Burgers is the fact they can certify their Angus natural beef is humanely raised
What perfectly cooked fish with great flavor
The staff is inattentive the food greatly over priced and poorer than fast food quality
We ordered a Classic California roll and were very surprised that is was not in fact a California roll enough lemon flavored mayo to choke a horse
Food - the value here would be great for a steakhouse - if it was good
but I'm not a fan of dessert flavored iceberg lettuce
If this is true I will do my best to be a good girl the rest of my life - I am afraid this place with it's stink restrooms tasteless meat and strange mordern salad dressings strange for an old fashioned cowboy steakshouse anyway may very well be the hell I'd be sent to if my  good deeds didn't add up at final judgement
A wonderful collection of made from scratch pasties say Pass-Tee unique desserts and some of the best examples of the brewers arts to be found anywhere on this side of the pond
From the traditional Oggie with beef onions potatoes and rutabaga with a lovely red wine gravy to the adventurous Lamb Vindaloo with basmati rice potatoes lamb and a wonderfully spicy vindaloo sauce all of Dean's creations are worth trying
From the quick seating time despite arriving at prime time hours on a weekend to the gracious service even though we were only ordering apps to the AMAZING food I'm so glad we stopped by
Unfortunately none of us ended up having any wine even though the selection looked amazing but the food more than made up for that
They offer hot sandwiches fresh baked goods desserts and a small variety of cheeses and meats
All of the sandwiches sounded delicious; I decided on the beef phyllo
It was a delicious flaky giant pretzel like phyllo stuffed with seasoned beef
This burger joint is NOT a franchise it's family owned so you are getting way better customer service and quality food than you'll find at McD's or BK
The pizza was wonderful the mac and cheese needed a pit more seasoning but was creamy and satisfying nonetheless
I tried the Loat Cha noodles and they were excellent with beef and eggs
It looked good and we plan on returning to try their pizza's soon
The sauce had a nice unique flavor very mole-esque but I did not enjoy it due to the shoe leather meat
And I wanted to say that I was confused about some of the mixed reviews because being a foodie who is almost fanatical about fresh food and clean comfortable surroundings I was very impressed
I also was impressed by the rolls that they served
I'm not gonna abandon a true Vienna Beef dog joint for them - but it's nice to know they are almost as good
In hindsight it prolly would have been closer to what I consider hot
But they did have a reddish hot-sauce appearing sauce on them
It came with soup it was ok kind goopey an eggroll really gross and a wonton thingy good
The food is pretty tasty and the restaurant is a hip house located in a downtown neighborhood
But if you're on a budget and just want good Asian food you might want to consider somewhere else
The food is good- we got the veggie spring rolls pad thai noodles broccoli island and the chow fun
I also find the different tandoori dishes delicious
You won't find donuts and egg dishes here but if you want amazing coffee drinks go to Dutch Brothers
This restaurant gives me a new perspective and I think that a fast-food nation could in fact get elegantly poised over a hot plate of Cornish heaven
We couldn't get a table then and ate at the bar food was pretty good
The food- I was so heartbroken b/c we really enjoyed dining out and fine dining and it was such a let down
I was still waiting for something to be wow this is delicious so silly me ordered dessert salt caramel panna cotta
Food was good as we split a Scottsdale club
Attractive interior design attentive but flawed service very good food
And my spicy chicken wrap may come out juicy and hot or luke warm and dry
And the salads are always on point try the caribbean it has more delicious fruit on it than I want to list or the mediterranean chicken salad it has pine nuts and pine nuts are great
The masala at Copper Kettle was thicker and I don't think the sauce was spiced as much as the place in Sedona the chicken in the masala on the other hand was spiced beautifully fairly hot
There was a buffet available at dinner but we opted for fresh preparation and although we waited a little bit for our food it was worth it
The chef has mad skills and we will be back because I live close and the food is worth it
I disagree somewhat with the reviewer who says place wasn't good for kids yes it is fine dining but we went pretty much when the doors opened for dinner few other diners at that time and we snagged a corner table relatively out of the way where we could keep our infant in her stroller
Overall the place isn't much to look at but the food is good
Big chunks of meat sauce is flavorful not bland at all and not too spicey
I would say their food is good but not amazing
All that fake beef flavoring is hard to compete with
I will say the Happy Hour prices were a great deal and the food was pretty good
The food was only ok-- good plantains though  and the cocktails were watered down
The first time I ordered a sandwich I was a bit put off by the thickness of the bread;  I did not want the bread to overwhelm or disguise the flavor of the meats/cheeses/sauce
Where else can you find a Phat Azz Chicken Samich Stupid Fries and a DVZ's Hot Ghetto Mess
The grilled meats rest on a huge plate of flavored rice
If you like to see the cooks in action the kitchen is open and we were just about 8 feet from the window and the expediting chef so we could watch him run quality control over all the dishes coming out
Nothing too remarkable but the dish was tasty and conducive to snacking--a perfect appetizer--and I was glad to be able to switch between the spicy fatty and sweet dips grainy mustard melted cheese and some sweet fruity red jammy sauce
No complaints though--every component was good and the dessert came together well
I'd like to try this place on a regular night--I have a feeling the quality of the food can only improve and everything else was great
This happened in the early morning hours and had I not overheard otherwise I'd never have known it-- the place was disheveled just enough to show that customers read the news while they enjoyed a cup o' joe grabbed a bite and/or worked on their laptops
When our food came it was delicious although one of the orders was wrong
It's a shame really because the food was delicious
Beef Bourguinon shepard's pie had a rich delicious gravy the beef was very tender and just the right amount of potato on top
I just lusted for more beef since it was really good
The food here is delicious the staff is friendly the prices reasonable & they even have BOOTHS  -  back in their almost secret rear dining room
Otherwise the food was amazingly delicious and expertly prepared by chef Michael DeMaria of the famed Michael's at the Citadel
The Short Rib Cannelloni on Caramelized Onion BlueTalleggio Fondue and Beef Broth looked almost to good to eat but with one bite was quickly devoured
For beef lovers there was another well cooked goody the Prosciutto Wrapped Fillet of Beef with Sliced Garlic and Tiny Beach Mushrooms $19 is not to be missed
The food was pretty good I had the chopped chicken pinenuts gorganzola salad
He thought the fish quality was mediocre and that the slices were very thin compared to other valley restaurants
Like I said above C&C is as good as it gets for food service and ambiance
After a bark at the park day I decided to try some of their pepperoni pizza that they had out and it was sooooo good
I don't really like pizza crust unless I can cover it in ranch but there is something about the crust here that is so good
Everything I saw looked delicious and my food was great
The kobe beef was delicious seasoned well but overcooked I ordered medium-rare and got medium-well
Cool hip ambience with pretty good but not great food at Corbin's in the undiscovered country of Sunnyslope
The wine is terrific the food delicious but boy was it crowded
This is a great neighborhood bar and has a suprisingly tasty breakfast and the food is VERY reasonable priced
Hottie and Foodie Bear for lunch one afternoon at Los Reyes
This AMAZING sammie came with breaded thin beef steak ham chorizo fried egg cheese avocado lettuce tomato and jalapeno
I tried beef & broccoli very simple dish yet had no flavor and the meat texture was like rubber
Starters dont exceed $10 and entrees range anywhere from $5-$15 If Im correct there is only one item on the menu costing $15 We started off with three appetizers thinking it would be the only dishes ordered little did we know- Grilled Spicy Chicken Wings Some a little burnt but it tasted great
We ended up sharing the Half Chicken entree and I was extremely impressed with how it came out
We ordered two Hong Kong style chow meins one chicken and one seafood; egg rolls for our son; spicy dumplings spicy sauce chicken hot pot; and Kung Pao beef for my stepson
Just my kind of place--good food good service and good prices
This is perfect way to skip the dessert at whatever restaurant you are at and get one much more flavorful and worth the price
good for themAll in all The Lodge is really pretty average in terms of food and service
You literally cannot walk 10 steps without tasty delicious stadium food beckoning your fat ass to indulge; polish dogs ice cream 24 oz
I had the Tijuana Torpedo -- a most tasty concoction of wood-grilled meat spicy cheese and green chile pepper
I mean really- Rack of Ribs Steak Stuffed Chicken and some other options that weren't very good
I've been to Sakana a few times and have always enjoyed the food
I'll definitely be back to grab some quick tasty sushi for happy hour
The chicken is crispy and flavorful but it differs from Roscoe's because it is sometimes dry-- I go for the white meat which usually stays a little juicier
They need to add an appetizer that is a version of the butterfish for Happy Hour
Excellent choice though and I have to say if it wasn't the best meatloaf I've ever had it sure was close

I got these jerk chicken wings for an appetizer and holy cow they were delicious
The food is really good & the prices are totally reasonable
The pizza sauce is very flavorful and the cheese is piled on plentifully
The pizza is just slightly salty and greasy from the melted cheese in a very pleasant and delicious way
The cheesy bread is really amazing - delightfully thick crust covered in a buttery garlic topping smothered in cheese served with pizza or marinara sauce your choice for dipping
The cinnamon bread is gigantic a wonderful dessert and it's nearly impossible to stop eating
As for being hungry for a good pizza well you're in the valley; good pizza is hard to find period
It has the right amount of dive atmosphere with just excellent food
We got free appetizers and beer/wine I JUST SAID FREE FOOD AND BOOZE
The food was fairly bland and not very flavorful and the chips and tortillas seemed to not be very fresh
Since I had a late lunch I wasn't hungry but my fellow coworkers enjoyed their onion rings and chicken strips
The food is great for what it is the price is right and the service is very good
Hubby had the Cajun Chicken and that was good
The food is standard pub fare they have a good beer collection along with ciders
She also recommended the equivalent dish but with lamb
I'm not knowledgeable about Cajun food but one person I know from Louisiana who has been to this place said it's Really really good
Appetizers- Butterfish tataki- Grilled pork belly MUST MUST get this
mmmm PSushi- Sashimi sampler 5 The kampachi was soooo good
- Hamachi and serrano chili makiGrilled stewers Both of these are a must- Sweet potato- Sweet cornEntrees- Korean spiced lamb chops- Yuzu miso black cod- Rice and mushroom hotpotDesserts Both of these were excellent with really unique homemade ice creamMango and vanilla cake with toasted rice ice creamVanilla panna cotta with yuzu ice creamDrinks2x large AsahiGreen teaCome with lots of time and lots of money
ALthough service was great and the food was good all in all too overpriced for what you got
They throw green chilis on their WOOD FIRE pit and grill them before placing a fresh patty of beef which has pepper jack cheese pounded into it and then throw hot sauce on it which is not really hot it's more of a chulula type thing
I tried a bite of the BBQ chicken pizza and it was very tasty as well
Now before I go ahead and completely lose your interest with more paragraphs describing why I am both a joy and an excellent source of dining information I will proceed to the meat of the matter
While my grilled chicken and spinach salad with point reyes blue cheese apple belgian endive & roasted pecan vinaigrette was not a complete homerun for me it was still fresh and well-dressed and I quite enjoyed devouring it until my brother and sister-in-law informed me that uncooked spinach doesn't pack the same nutritional punch as when cooked
If he doesn't know good food than I don't have long legs and exceedingly fabulous fashion sense
When I first tried it I was a skeptic but then I had the food and I was greatly surprised by the good taste and quality of the food
While we didn't eat he explained the food menu to us and noted how several items on the menu were very hot which we like very much
If you are looking for good quality food set your sights on AJ's
This was a well executed dish with very complimenting flavors
This was a good dish but nothing spectacular
The platter they are served on is very hot so you need to eat them quickly or they will overcook just sitting on their serving dish
There are other good Thai places in town where friendly service and delicious food are standard
The chicken seemed to be low quality and was very fatty
However otherwise you are paying for food that may have a gluten-free vegetarian or vegan label that lacks flavor
Their portions are great you actually get to enjoy the flavor of the fish rather than cucumber or just rice
I come back to sakana because they are the only sushi in glendale that I have found and actually enjoyed
I recommend this place for a great hangout for you your friends and/or family it has awesome food
This is a place that serves really good North Indian food kind of Pakistani style if you ask me and it's really spicy and really good
Food was hot and fresh even at the late hour
The food here is amazing anything you can point to on the menu is awesome and delivered fresh to your table
We ordered the Melanzane Pomodoro e Mozzarella eggplant mozzarella and a red sauce which was AMAZING an appetizer salad and for dinner the Agnolotti ai Gamberi shrimp ravioli and a special for the night linguini with seafood
There was plenty of seafood scallops white fish shrimp and mussels and the sauce was amazing
The Chicken Liver Pate was SO DELICIOUS as were the Popovers
The chicken is grilled white meat good luck trying to find that at any other restaurant of this type
I had the blue corn enchiladas - one chicken one shrimp - and honest to goodness the meat had no discernible flavor
Not only could I not tell which was which but couldn't identify a particular meat flavor at all; the ingredient was totally without flavor
I've only had hummus here as far as food goes but it was pretty good
We thought it would be a good idea to split a couple of desserts chocolate Cru00e8me Bru00fblu00e9e $6
I didn't try the food here but the selection of beer is good
My dining partner thought his food was good and the portions they give are fairly generous
The chefs create artistic masterpieces in that small kitchen using regional proteins and veggies creating pates jellies and cured meats in house and even selling their delicious selection of cheeses retail out of the AZ Wine side of the shop
In addition to the beer they have an amazing atmosphere and surprisingly good food
Any sandwich or pizza is going to be good and for the side I recommend the potato salad
Unique and delicious pizzas and like Jennifer mentioned huge air bubbles around the crust
Delux recommends to order their burgers at medium rare allowing them to showcase the juiciness of the beef; L
As we bit into these works of art the beefy goodness oozed wonderful flavor onto our palate
The beef truly is the star of this show however supporting cast complements it nicely without taking away from the magnificent flavor of the beef
The beef wasn't flavored at all and when we got the fries they were cold
The flavoring and seasoning is what made the dish
The meat was extremely tender melt-in-your-mouth-type cooked to perfection and juicy and flavorful
Shortribs are not a lean cut of beef but it was worth it
I don't eat pork so I didn't try my sister's jerk pork dish but she said it was really good but not nearly as spicy as the shrimp
* Spring Rolls - Excellent and I loved the sauce
* Hot & Sour Soup - Excellent because I always custom order it with all the meats and shrimp
*Cashew Nut Sauteed Plate w/ Chicken - excellent and full of good stuff
Good clean modern place to pick up some wine or beer to go with the food or for a friend's party
Their fish and chips are really really good
I ate it and I like it but I thought to myself 'What is Cambodian food because the flavors don't seem unique
Not good for romantic date because of the noise of shuffling carts of food throughout your meal but usually occurs during lunch time Dim Sum
Ok selection of regular menu items and a fairly good selection of sushi
The Philadelphia rolls needed better quality salmon
Nothing really looked good so I ordered a pizza which left me underwhelmed
I've been to plenty of buffets in the Valley and not once was the food cold
All the dishes were pretty cold a health inspector would have a field day with this place
If you can eat $20 worth of sushi on one plate this is the place for you
As for the review while we're all here after all the food is good
The service was great and the menu had a good balance of wines beer and sake and a nice variety of sushi
The food is a strong solid not the kind of Nobu quality you would get with fresh food flown straight in from Japan and melt in your mouth Black Miso Cod is there anything better on earth
Good service food is out very fast and servers are very much on top of the game
Red curry w/chicken spicy noodles w/beef cashew dish with tofu which I dont care for but the rest of it was good and spring rolls - small crunchy even after take-out
Not a super experienced Vietnamese food consumer but I appreciate a good bowl of noodle soup and this was fantastic
Appropriate portion of hot rich slightly spicy broth with soft well textured noodles; brisket shaved ribeye beef meatballs a bit of fat some ribeye cap strips and tripe in the bowl
Their pizza's good it's fast it's affordable and their customer service is spectacular
Anyway we had a great time and the food was very good
It was definitely worth it as our guest raved about the food
The food is amazing but the service and connection to the staff is even better
My 5 mo pregnant wife was in the mood for Pizza last night as was my 2 yr old daughter and I never shy away from a good pie
The problem is that we struggle with good pizza joints outside of our usual spots Red Devil Oregano's & NYPD
Oregano's and NYPD were slammed because of bike week so we stumbled upon Crust as we eat Sushi next door and figured we'd give it a shot
The pizza was excellent and the thin crust was amazing
The bun bo hue was delicious with a spicy hot broth and a huge portion of meat in the soup
I don't particularly care for their fish and chips but their chips fries are really good
I love the healthy food being available--but ordered the korean tacos and their pizzas are worth trying
Tuesday night special at least I think its Tuesday is All You Can Eat pizza couple that with a pitcher of beer and a good movie and it's a great weekday night
Amazing service stellar food hey I'm vegetarian
This hotel has staff that cares great work out room gorgeous pool with full service bar/food service and misters to keep cool
A guy at our hotel told us to eat at Pizza A Metro
In my experience with Italian food it all tastes pretty good
Will definitely be back excellent food and service
As for the food I was told there wings were amazing and hot so I ordered some hot wings only to find out they smell hotter than what they really are they were also pretty standard nothing amazing
I also had the Apricot Citrus Chicken dinner which was tasty and one of the healthiest options on the menu
So 3 stars for the fond memories and tasty food and decent service
get over yourselves people the food is good and the pricing is spot on
it's good food go try it and move on with your day
From what I recall the spice I recall from earlier visits was good but nothing spectacular and the dessert was fabulous
I am pretty tolerant and love a good amount of heat in my food
Now I wouldnt say I'm a fan yet but I will give it another try in the future due to my love for hot & spicey foods
We both agreed that the food had definitely been prepared well portions were large & presentation was good
Can't say enough about the amazing food
They had some awesome varieties of different southern hot sauces and I dabbed that on the catfish which brought even more life to the dish
They pump out a lot of good food it looks like so if you want some fried fish on game day head on over to Karim's
Food was good not great staff was very nice and hospitable
The food was good and our actual waiter was decent enough
this hotel is next to a TGI Fridays and an AMAZING seafood restaurant Pappadeaux
The pizza and house salad were made with high-quality fresh ingredients and I thought reasonably priced
Thin crust was crunchy but still a little chewy the crushed tomatoes they used for sauce had a very nice tomato flavor and we had 2 bubbles which I've found you can only get at places that are cooking their pizza at high temperatures
I cannot speak to the quality of their particular chocolate desserts since we just peaced out
Here's my recommendation If you hate cooking as much as you hate eating interesting food The Good Egg will suffice
The meatball slices were thicker than usual and this made the pizza that much more flavorful
We ordered dessert to go and enjoyed a slice of blueberry cobbler cheesecake after coming home
My only other Mongolian grill experience is with YC's so I was impressed to see they had an extensive selection real fresh protein very -very cold- fresh meats reassuringly
Everyone sitting at shoddy tables in a little room eating delicious food
Portion was great wife and I shared and the food was tasty
We had beignets for dessert which were warm and delicious
I'm not in Scottsdale that much but a great place to go with friends to just chat and enjoy some good food to please everyone
Upon entering I was hit with the wonderful aroma of Italian food and quickly took note of the cozy ambiance always important to me
We had two appetizers- crab dip and chicken nachos
I bought a coupon off Deal Chicken which made the evening super affordable less than $50 for 3 people's tickets sodas appetizers and tip
$2 edamame and miso $4-$7 rolls such as the eel avacado roll excellent or the albacore ceviche roll
Why I would not come backThe food doesn't speak to me Blue Wasabi's Happy Hour is better and their rolls so much more funThe quality of the sushi is great the recipes just aren't
The cheese is beyond delicious and the arugula on top gave the pizza an outstanding appearance and unique taste
There was nothing that stood out except just good food
There weren't very many people during lunch rush and only one patron was Indian so either the food is not up to par or they didn't go that dayThe food was decent not much selection but the stuff I picked was tasty
for wine tasting good food and live music
live music from great musicians almost every night relaxing ambiance good food and wine
They also have young fresh coconut juice and some pretty good vermicelli dishes
The food is good but never memorable I need to go bag and have that ___ good
The food was good nicely put together and creative enough that you felt you weren't eating somewhere else
The verdict is still out but it was a cool dish and my girlfriend enjoyed it
The prosciutto wrapped chicken was very nicely crafted on a bed of sauteed spinach with some fingerling potatoes that were delicious
So all in all NoRTH to me is like every other fox restaurant it's cool good consistent maybe a little overpriced for food that is slightly casual but it's good enough that they get away with it and you realize you are paying for the ambiance and experience too
Nothing really blows you away in terms for food service quality ambiance or any other intrinsic for that matters so I'm not sure it would deserve any more stars it's a solid good
The place is extremely small which makes it slightly uncomfortable like everyone can hear your conversation and you are sitting very close to other parties but don't let this scare you off because the food is very good
We all kind of shared food the BF and I got the meatball pizza which was tasty but a bit heavy on the meatball can I even say that
The pizza could have used some basil or something to make it have more depth of flavor but it was good as is
They also got a pizza and really enjoyed it
Although I wouldn't say this place is the best pizza in town it is very good and I would love to eat here again
The chicken which wasn't even cut so the two halves of the sandwich weren't separate was tough dry and flavorless
But the convenience of the location and the fact that I truly believe Carne Asada is a health food I recommend going to one near you
If you want quality fresh tasting food straight from the ground to the kitchen and then to your mouth this is the place
Management was friendly towards people of all ages prices were cheap and pizza and wings were excellent
The food quality also was much more sloppy and prices steadily raised over the years
this didn't look like the spicy tuna rolls I usually get but it tasted good
Javier's chicken was good and the sauce was perfect
Other dishes at the table like the swordfish and petite filet were dry and flavorless
On the other hand it's hard to justify a two hour or more wait mediocre wait staff and tasty though not one of a kind flavor of the pizza there
Like I said I can see why it gets rave reviews from a culinary standpoint but I really didn't find the pizza to be worthy of being called best in the country
If you aren't a pizza snob though you'll find that other places like Grimaldi's and Oreganos serve up delicious if not better pizza with a substantially shorter wait time
Food quality  Every dish was prepared perfectly
I will say however the sushi was pretty good
Good food - Menu has enough variety to keep things interesting2
You can get better Mexican/tex-mex food in the valley but this is good for the price
Came here for pizza and wings last night and the quality was WAY off
If you kill the food quality by skimping on cheese using some crappy pizza crust being stingy with wing sauce ON WINGS
Normally I can ignore all that junk on the walls while I savor the delicious food but now that the food isn't distracting me I can hardly ignore the random junk dangling from the walls and ceiling
The food is good but served in abysmal portions
i think I've had most of the stuff on their menu here are a few standouts  the hummus is very good the shwarma is terrible the turkey pesto wrap is good the lentil fetoosh salad is very good the club wrap is bad the lavosh pizza is good and the glazed chicken lavosh pizza is really very unique and tasty
the food wasn't that bad but for what we had paid for the excursion I would've expected better quality or quantity
Chicago peeps if you've never been to AJ's there's one very good reason to go  Gino's East frozen pizzasYeahCertainly not as good as the real deal but still better than 90% of the fresh pizza you'll find in the valley and easily the best frozen pie in town
The cured meats were good prosciutto sopressata salami gorgonzola it was all quite good but the mac and cheese simply destroyed it
the food was definitely four star good but the value was closer to three
Everyone in the party enjoyed the myriad of sushi they ordered although I myself am not a big sushi fan
I probably would recommend a local sushi joint if you're going for a regular/later meal
The red sauce pizza was average with a very sweet sauce a tough crust as if it had been made earlier in the day but overall a it's low quality but oh so tasty kind of taste to it
Believe me I would not take the time to write this glowing review unless all of the components lined up right  promises kept food well prepared; clean ample and delicious and great value
The meat was not good at all it tasted sour
For those who don't like it too hot they do serve things very much toned down and there are many dishes that aren't hot at all
It lacked flavor the rice noodles were slimy the spring roll was loaded with grease
However some diners may find some of Palatte's quirks to be frustrating rather than accepting them for what they really are the small price one must pay from time to time for some really amazing food
Any concerns you have over the business side of going to Palatte will be laid to rest the moment their delicious food hits your lips
In the meantime go and enjoy the food- in spite of the quirks it is more than worth the trip
Service food quality variety selection portions drinks and value were all spot on
I had the rigatoni with meat sauce and a meatball which was very good
A lot of the other Chinese delivery in the area is nigh inedible and Hunan Express has good and plentiful food for cheap
Things I've tried and enjoyed aside from the hot and sour soup are the hunan beef the chicken corn soup the bok choy the chow fun and the potstickers
I recommend ordering here if you have a hankering for a bucket-load of reasonably priced Chinese food and don't feel like changing out of your pajamas
It manages to be trendy yet unintimidating for us non-trendy people has great service and excellent food I'm willing to overlook the dessert and very reasonable prices
What I liked most about this variation of lemongrass chicken were the beautiful assortment of steamed vegetables that topped the hot pot of bubbling saucy chicken
Service was good and most people were raving about some sort of banana dessert but I was full and didn't try it
The Dinner Club dinned at Hula a few weeks backThe general consensusThe Food good some great some not so great
The appetizers were the weakest part of the meal the coconut shrimp rolls were ok the ahi wontons were disappointing but the poke was tasty and the sweet potato fries were delish
Disappointing was the Jawaiian Pork Plate good but not nearly as tasty as the other portk dish and the fish tacos also ok but the same fish tacos you can get anywhere
Dessert was good but not mindblowingSo why 4 stars not thee
Plus the funky old building has an awesome 6 pane wall window that is an awesome highlightOverall worth checking out great drinks good food and a fun atmosphere
Lemon chicken that turned out to be pork and bad at that wontons in soup that fall apart greasy greasy lo mein and eggrolls it's just not worth it
Delicious fresh flavorful with a lot of meat and vegetarian options to please any discerning palate
You can have a nice hearty and delicious dinner for 12 people for less than $100 and that includes drinks a bunch of food left over to take home
I really enjoyed this place and I have a very soft spot for it in my heart because of the type of regional dishes they serve and their ability to bring my memories of childhood dish delights to my current self
My hot sub was cold and the meat was watery
For only $3/roll you can get very high quality yellowtail rolls tuna rolls etc
If you don't have that at least have good food
I'd really love to come here sometime when it's not packed before a show because the food and drinks are surprisingly good
I have had most of the desserts and you really can't go wrong they are all really good
The chicken enchilada omelet is really good and has a nice spice to it
For food we ordered a $20 package which included a 1-topping pizza and appetizer sampler
Their fries are good more satisfying than other fast food restaurants-- ow with sea salt-- as if that makes them more appealing
Now for Esther's the food was amazing-Oxtail Red snapper Jerk chicken and curry goat-All Amazing
We ended up ordering 1 entree as an appetizer the fish and chips
*** The food was good but I think what keeps us wanting to come here is the wonderful customer service they have been AWESOME to us  we were greeted with an honest smile and we were well taken care of during our entire dining experience there
Besides whatever money they're not spending on updating the decor is clearly going right into their magically delicious chicken salad
The food is excellent and well prepared but the rest is a bit of a mess
now a small amount of food will come out for each course but the food is amazing its actually so good that you shouldn't even know what it is so you cant judge it before you tried it
we had halibut checks kobe beef monk fish duck liver it was all amazing but its a improvisational restaurant the great thing is that the menu keeps changing so there is no limit to the possibilities that this restaurant can accomplish if you have a real passion food food this is not a place that you can skip
Good thing the food was good otherwise this place would be in trouble
As far as the spiciness of the food I always order everything medium hot
Side dishes recommended by us are the Mascarpone Creamed Corn Twin Baked Potato Bar with five toppings String Beans with bacon and Cauliflower Gratin
with good food and lots of beer i usually want to stay out later
The chicken curry was excellent and the bread it was on was almost as much of a treat
All in all a very pleasant experience with very good reasonably priced food
The fish was deep fried which I like a good portion
of course I don't go anywhere without trying Dave's so I took a bite of his beef burrito and it was good
We walked into the open and airy joint and where we found a huge front counter and the two owners I know what they look like because I saw them on the food network show they were in were assisting new customer by allowing them to sample some of their fairs  this is all good but we had 5 VERY finicky people in front of us
- The food is very good and the prices are probably cheaper than the average subsidized school lunch program
Think of the food in the Ikea Cafeteria like their furniture   Quality stylish sometimes exotic always unique at a great price  and you have to assemble it yourself ;
The food was absolutely fabulous and the staff was so amazing and accommodating
The second time I went was today and decided I would call in the order because the food was cold last time
Seriously so disappointing because the food is pretty good overall minus that gross hummus
The food has always been good but I've never really been inspired to write a review until now
The food has always been consistently good unless you ask my husband who doesn't like Italian food
The food was good but it wasn't as good as I expected to be
Thank goodness they haven't moved on to the ultra-hip French dessert egg-bread read brioche for their burger
It's a wonderfully put together dessert and not too heavy perfect for any time of year
I probably wouldn't say it's the best dessert I've ever had but it was definitely delicious
Yeah so it is obviously a chain and some people don't like it for that reason but I think as far as chains go they do a nice job and the food and presentation is quality
It's a good place to go and linger over the food and conversation
We usually get  cheese - tonight we tried the special one but I typically recommend the Wisconsin Trio house salads or whatever the special salad is the vegetarian entree the extra veggies they give you and a dessert - tonight we did the S'mores
Some might have more seating some don't have the grocery store attached but they all have delicious mouth-watering food at decent prices
For the quality+quantity of food you get I can't say that the price is that great I've had way better food for way cheaper with just about the same level and speed of service elsewhere
The food is a wok-fried contemporary American take on Thai not much for the spice and the curries simply aren't that potent but it's all good
Lessons - CheckOld Fashion Ice Cream - Check Awesome Bar - Check Duce Lemonade is AMAZING Hula Hoops - Check DJ - CheckFood - A-Ok options are a bit strange Price - A little high for the drinks and the foodStaff - super coolCHECK IT OUT
The Kung Pao Steak was quite good as well as the Szechuan Chicken
I'm just not used to eating only dark meat chicken and let me tell you it was fucking delicious
In closinggood cheap eatscream cheese treatsbomb dark meatsnow if only they had crushed ice
The service was very friendly and the food was delicious
It took over an hour to get our appetizer and food
Our appetizer came out only moments before our food
They eventually showed up with the food and it looked delicious
It's not the best Chinese food I've had but I never had a complaint regarding the quality and quantity of my food
We ordered the seafood bebimbop in hot stone bowl clear rice noodle soup with short rib and the rice cake soup with beef
The seafood bebimbop in hot stone bowl was our favorite
Having this dish in the hot stone bowl makes all the difference in giving this dish added flavour always worth the extra cost
The other two dishes were good but a little bland
The furniture themselves were so exquisite that I could see the place having a totally different atmosphere if the walls were painted a muted light color with minimal decoration and the furniture themselves were highlighted  It would def enhance the dining experience and draw more people in because really the food and service was good
My husband and I have been perpetually disgusted by the quality of the seafood in the valley with the notable exception of PF Chang's scallops
The rolls are not only delicious but absolutely beautiful- they look just like the pictures
The cerignolas were BUTTERY smooth and delicious - almost tasted like a dessert olive if there is such a thing - and they were my favorite
creative fun names for the dishes which had the flavor to match
I hope the quality of the food improves as I really like having cool places to eat near the house
Me and the BF got into a debate about the food title worthiness of wontons when i declared wontons were one of my favorite foods
All the pizzas were good but my favorite was the funghi mushroom pizza
While I will admit we never even got to the dinner I simply made a judgment call that with all that we had seen up to ordering the food would not have been that good to over come all the cons
We had a conversation on the patio afterwards and he was clearly passionate about good food and scottsdale and I'm thankful that he has moved into the neighborhood
They have been good every time I've been there and the service is friendlier than your typical fast food burger joints as well
In the end it gets 4 stars for good service decent food convenient location and consistently feeding me when I'm hungry on the cheap
buffalo chicken sandwiches that were unique and delicious
Chicken was tender and flavorful and the little mini macoroni salad was a nice added touch
Now i know why places with good food don't survive
I don't wistfully pine for San Francisco or Chicago with service as engaged and attentive as our bartender and servers food as creatively designed and excellently executed as our tasting menu and decor as exquisite as the interior space
I dined at Fleming's recently on the insistence of a friend and while the service was good I thought the food was shockingly high priced for what it was
Great beef great appetizers great pours for cocktails
As for the food the hot dog was far from exceptional
After leaving my new favorite place we went to the Taste of Scottsdale and it was surprising that none of the food there was HALF as good as what Rokerij provided
After a few samples my group gave up as it wasn't fair to our stomachs to put average food with amazing Rokerij food
My husband daughter and i were in the area and decided to stop by and eat some good pizza while watching some Sunday Football
But the food was very good and the coffee nice and smooth
The food arrived quickly and looked amazing
We all ordered something different and all the dishes were delicious
So yes good food great place I would highly recommend
In my opinion The Greene House offers an incredible value for the quality of the food that is prepared however in lower cost areas such as Phoenix and Scottsdale I can understand why one would perhaps be a little taken back by a $11
Our meals were all very well prepared from the lightly battered Fish and Chips to the Parmesan and truffled oil french fry appetizer
The Angus beef was flavorful and tender but it should be named such not mislead the diner
00 for a true Kobe beef burger those who have never experienced true Kobe beef might be misinformed on the true texture and flavor of this delicacy
The food here is very good and very simple
I was pleased to find that in addition to pizza they offered pasta dishes hot and cold subs salads and cheesesteaks for delivery
The meatballs were nice and juicy and with good flavor
You could tell it was made with mixed meats ideally beef pork and veal as a good meatball should be made
The meat was rather salty but otherwise good
~ The food sometimes arrived cold ~ Pricepoint
The flavor was second to none and panang curry is one of my favorite comfort foods
Personally I think the grilled pizza's really stood out noticeably fresh ingredients really were a flavorful surprise - definitely not the 'Mall-food' someone else here had mentioned
Pizza is good especially if you are hungry - could be better if they had a wood oven
I've been to RA's Ahwatukee location several times and while RA's sushi in general is not stellar the service is at least good
Darn good basic Italian and Pizza fare with a few specialties thrown in at a pretty good price
BUT once the coffee pot landed and we got our orders in the food came out very fast and it was amazing
It's a nice family-run cafe - the food is good and is reasonably priced and I think this place has a lot of potential
Plenty of other treats awaited on the regular hot tables including the Pineapple Chicken the Egg Foo Young & the many shrimp dishes
food specials that are silly cheap and very good and a great happy hour menu
Good class of customers great food and drink and free rides home if your tipsy
But asked a few people coming out if the food was any good and they said Excellent Been eating here for 10 years
My chicken was cooked but it wasn't very good
Shame actually if they put as much effort into their dull food as they do the interior then it could be good
I just happen to know the right people and the ones who have searched out good food
They have everything from good ol' cheap good food to more expensive higher-end dining
EXPENSIVE- not worth the price of food/drinks
Find a good little hole in the wall where you don't have to dress to impress to eat some junk like this and enjoy good food
I did like my AZ 88 chicken sandwich but everyone else wasn't impressed with what they got
The service was great waitress was awareI look like a hobo she avoided my stareI usually go commando undies I don't wearThis place was good and the food was fair
I am not usually the sports bar type so the first time I went to Duke's it was because of a friend's recommendation for the food
Again the food was good especially considering their really low prices
I was looking for a good pizza and Cibo came up under the top pizzas in Phx
But that's a good thing when you want better-than-fast-food but only want to spend around 5 bucks
the shrimp tacos were Delicious and the braised beef very nice and tender it could use some more sauce thought
$1 off beers $2 off all appetizers and half off mini pizzas
The mini pizzas are very good and they have a wide range of great appetizers all of which are quite tasty
Because I live in the generic area known as the Chandler-Gilbert Divide and sometimes don't want to drive 30 minutes or more for a unique meal in Phoenix/Tempe/Scottsdale I am always pleasantly surprised to find good eats nearby that save me the commute for food
I loved Joe's BBQ from the beginning because it's pretty good casual reasonably priced and gives free food on your birthday
Imagine my delight to find Joe's Farm Grill which also gives free food on your birthday and provides the same casual atmosphere prices and good eats
The mushroom pizza was the same except the mushrooms again had very little flavor
It was New York style but most New York style pizza has a lot of flavor in it
Their pizza is consistently good and I have no complaints in that department
Our waitress was nice but didn't offer my little brother any pizza dough and didn't do a very good job of keeping our drinks full
The only reason I am giving them 4 as opposed to 5 stars is because the burrito my sister got was a little too messy and it got on my table cloth The fish tacos were superb though and their rice is amazing
I would say everything is good except I am not a fan of cold spring rolls
They have a good selection in salad options as well my favoorite is Pina Colada Chicken Salad
The desserts always look so delicious & I have on numerous times gave in to the Low Fat Berries & Custard Cup/Tart
It is always packed when we come even outside in the summer which gave me a good indicator of how yummy the food must be
Service is typically pretty good you'll be able to keep drinks coming and food comes out quickly
No on to the Scottsdale location I was Very impressed food came out hot good flavor fresh
Did get a cheese course for dessert which was good but all the fruit around went into the trash low carb usually means no fruit
The atmosphere is lovely the service is always excellent and the variety and quality of the sushi is as good as anything we've had
Plus if you bring a non-sushi eating friend you can trick them into eating the very delicious Beef Teriyaki Roll also a meal in itself
Second time I had just an italian beef sandwich with garlic parmesan fries and I was less impressed
I focused my sights on the garden pizza which took me by surprise because it was basically a chef-tossed salad on a really good pizza crust
Green's food is good enough to turn me vegan just kidding i love meat
Luci's has a great selection of really good healthy food on their menu and the prices are super reasonable
And then I ordered a $12 or $13 flatbread which was a tiny square pizza with hot cucumbers on top of it
I would have given it 4 stars but I'm still holding on to it until another dish on their menu is as good as I've been led to believe
Butterfish scallops and yellowtail sashimi were excellent
The food was delicious although not as spicy as I remembered
I am pretty sure I had an amazing dessert but I really cannot remember what it was
Chicken and dumplings blandB's hamburger  Good burger
So good for you Beck for actually cooking your terrible food
The food was good on several previous visits but I am never returning to this restaurant or any others in the chain
- I really enjoyed my meal here with a grilled chicken sandwich w/gluten free breadI'd only go back here during happy hour or on their Monday 1/2 price night because my family said that was quite expensive for a meal at lunch time and they'd rather have leftovers then clean their whole plate
Tuna on fried brown rice cake was delicious as was the salmon and toro sushi
Splitting a pizza and salad with a friend for lunch is my idea of a good meal
The stock could use a bit more depth instead of mere salt but the corned beef is delicious
It was wonderful too -- the veggies were nice and chunky the chicken was tender and the cashews were a nice additional texture
The jerk tofu and spicy peanut salad are good but I feel they are overpriced for a few pieces of tofu/meat substitute and plain greens
If your not in the mood for pizza their sandwiches are excellent as well
The quality of the food almost took it down to 3 stars but in the end their attempt to be really interested and concerned about the provenance of their produce raised it to 4 stars
The most spectacular course of the evening was the amazing dessert board
Just like the other reviews said small portions high prices low quality food very limited menu
Harlow's amazing and reliable food good friendly service the hot waitresses the eclectic mix of patrons and the four types of hot sauce on each and every table make this place my favorite
Note only 4 stars because it IS a little pricey for breakfast food $9 for eggs Benedict and because you will run into someone you know not good if you are all tore up from the night before
The fish was lovely and had a nice firm texture and the spices/peppers added a great bold flavor while the coconut milk mellowed it out a bit
My dinner entree was the Cocojoe's Coconut Chicken Plate and it was delicious
Back to the food -- The mock chicken was pretty good I could eat this in place of real chicken any day
The No-Harm-Chicken-Parm Sandwich was so tasty and big enough to share between two
The food was good but not jumping out of my seat good
The prices are reasonable the service is always friendly and the food is really good
We decided to go ahead and sit at the bar and have dinner since there was room and the food had been very good previous times
had the hot pepper chicken sandwich all of which we we really liked
I recommend making yourself a spicy Mongo beef
I had never tried Filipino food but my friend recommended it so I tagged along
and my friends had the cannoli and the ube cheese roll both of which were excellent
The restaurant week menu was very enticing and I was immediately drawn to the Ahi Tuna appetizer halibut entree and churro expresso dessert
Corollary to #1 - Telling us 'most of it will come out cold anyway' is not the way to increase your tipStars received are for the nice hostess who seated us and the very delicious and large salad I ate
Chicken & links are really good too but I don't  go for the ribs not my favorite
it's just the voices in my head demanding attentionI stopped for some lunch at the old Orange TableThey always have savory foodIt was crowded as hell even in summerSo the service was not very good;The wait staff is hip and they sort of act coolBy their looks I could tell I was notI was wearing a golf shirt and old cargo shortsThey just didn't think I was hot;They chatted with friends and hung out in the kitchenBut they did bring my soup hot and tastyAnd a good turkey sandwich with lettuce and mayoThe bread was just right thick and crustySo would I return to the tables of Orange
Alright the pizza was good the dough was tastey would order a little extra done to get it like some of the Naples pizza i've had perfect salt and consistancy
This pizza was good worth going and will do it again
The food has always been served hot and fresh
The italian restaurant Alto on property is quite good I enjoyed a chicken dish in a red wine reduction and they have a lovely wine list as well
I could go for dim sum at lunch let the dishes pile up and waddle back to my office for nice long afternoon napIf I felt more ambitious I could walk up to Chinatown to Delicious New Fortune and Yong Kee for some of the most remarkable food this side of Hong Kong
I can't complain about the food it's consistently good
I recommend the #1 with a soft chicken taco and a green beef burro
Aside from that gripe the place is good the food is delicious
We had received a coupon for a free pizza with the purchase of $20 worth of food and drink
there are a few appetizers and sweet desserts on the menu
RA has really stepped it up with its management and quality of food
Eggrolls were good but a little too much wrapper and not enough filling IMO
Also got some chicken soup for the sick hubby which I didn't try but he said was quite good
I was very pleased at the heat level and overall flavor of the dish
So overall a nice experience good seafood especially for Scottsdale where it is actually hard to find really good food in general especially hard to find good seafood
Most people go to Nello's for the pizza which is quite tasty by the way
Saw all the good stuff said about the place so I gave it a shot since it is real hard to find soul-food in Arizona
White's hit me with 3 big pieces of catfish piping hot and crunchy on the outside flaky on the inside and a big bowl of red beans and rice which were good with a hit of sweetness to them never had red beans with a hint of sweet like that and then put me down with a big side of greens
I order tuna salad with fried calamari and 2 rolls keep in mind that this place is very expensive my father in law order a roll and my wife order some rolls with appetizers
They have a full service meat department deli hot foods counter produce along with all the traditional grocery items you would need
The menu was casual for lunch with a good number of pizzas and sandwiches
Even though it is a pancake house such a delicious mortgage we ordered the Mexicana omelette with jalapeu00f1o jack cheese and the Corned Beef Hash Skillet
The Corned Beef Hash Skillet was real tasty
I've been craving some New Mexican food lately and thought this was as good a place to start as any
There are a few indie pizzeria's but none of them very good IMHO but finally Tony's Mamma Mia Pizza and Subs has filled that void
service was good but food was very much just okay
Music solo guitarist was decent service was good beer cold too bad the food was such a let down
The quality of the food was great and the combinations were somewhat inventive but also worked really well together
While the atmosphere was slightly above average the food was excellent
For me I'll definitely be going back to try more tasty meat-free bites
We only sampled the App food like the nachos which were average the queso dip which did not have enough cheese and the quesadilla which was good but not great
The food is usually pretty good and the service OK too
The variety is pretty good ranging from salads pizzas burgers po-boys and noodles
next timePros-only vegan in town-flavorful with a good selection of dishes-cute decorCons-meals a lil small for $10 but not that bad
Some of the highlightsMy friend had the Famous Grilled Chicken Salad and she was thoroughly delighted by the quality of the chicken
Living in Arizona doesn't offer that many Chinese food options that taste good
The food is always fresh and hot and tasty and the service has always been friendly and efficient I've even been offered a free beer on a number of occasions because of frequent visits
Soups are excellent as are the ribs eggrolls and other classics
but i wasn't that impressed with my dish
we did get a toda salad which was good and alot of the curry dishes smelled and looked tasty so if we go back we'll have to try those
Warning the Jerk Chicken is HOT now I can hear my friend Chris in the background calling me a weenie however be warned
With each dish they have cookies either a snickerdoodle which is awesome but their volcano cookies are DELICIOUS
Working at the Downtown campus of ASU there are certainly some great spots especially when the food trucks hit on Friday but having some pita goodness less than 5 minutes away is nice
I even grabbed a dolma from CM which was very good almost like a full sushi roll with just rice
I think their pizza is really really good and they have a great selection of beers on tap
It's not cheap by any means but it's worth it if you want TRUE food
it was good no doubt but you would prolly get sick if you ate too much of it
House Modern Sushi has amazing sushi and rolls
Stop at the Lodge for great food spiked hot chocolate and the beauty of Scottsdale
Awesome tender sliced thinned meat and delicious
Two rounds of Shochu HIGHLY recommend the nectarine so light and clean and 3 apps later the butterfish tataki changed my life we made our way to dinner
D'licious Dishes did something amazing; They saved Thanksgiving for me
The orange flavor was fine but those pieces of meat had been sitting out a LOOOONG time
Parsnips accompanied his meat and they were also so good
The food was fantastic truly memorable guacamole lovely innovative salad yummy home-made tortillas varied delicious salsas and artful tacos
No one else in my party complained aloud about their food but neither did I since I was eating for free but I heard few compliments about anything except the wonderful margaritas
Seriously you expect the food at HAG to be like a guilty pleasure but for being that unhealthy it has no flavor
The variety of flavors and toppings are the same in quantity and selection as any other shop but when my frozen dessert is not just plain-tasting but also completely melted when I'm only two thirds to three quarters done I get a little bit miffed
I would definitely recommend the wings with the fish sauce reduction a different taste and probably some of the most flavorful nontraditional wings I've tasted
It doesn't matter if you're seated downstairs in the cozy darkly lit bar or upstairs where you can watch the chef's make quick work of your order in the open kitchen you can expect friendly service a fantastic wine list and very tasty food
The jerk chicken is my other go-to selection but the egg fu young is another good option
Add some of CB's homemade salsa and its a tantalizing side dish that compliments a really good takeout meal
My husband got the prime rib special and the piece of meat was large and delicious but the vegetables that came with it were almost non-existent
That is where most of the good food is located anyways so you can stay out from behind the concrete monster
But the meat dishes are really tasty - I had the most fantastic pork tenderloin here
This is a fun place at night and several dishes are quite good
Boars Head meat is always good but I'm not sure if they are actually slicing the meat for each sandwich
last week i was craving some good chinese food so i decited to try this place since is at the chinese cultural center honestly when i came in i was already safisfied since the restaurant its very pretty sometimes i hate go to bad looking places to get legit food
The falafel pita glazed chicken pizza and the medchilada combination of a chicken burrito and enchilada Greek style -- not on the menu anymore but if you ask they will make it are some of my favorites but really anything you get is good
I went here with a friend for some food to go and had a good experience
The big man was in attendance last night overseeing the finger food service which included caprese on crackers meh meatballs strong tuna tartare spicy and delicious and sweet pea guacamole five stars
I always started off with an enormous plate of sushi and some hot and sour soup
After high school I realized that the quality of the food is fairly mediocre and I rarely go anymore
It's a good place when it's late and you're fiending for some food
Score   SCOrdered  Fish sliders excellent sturdy delicious all because of the toasted bunzzzzzzzzzz this small important detail seems to almost always go overlooked at so many placesnot hereits the very foundation of almost anything Damn Good not becoming soggy messy fast food crappy
the chips were outstanding which is usually always the first indicator of a mexican food restaurant's quality
That being said the portions are small for the pricing and the food is not very good
If you want a big meal and be filled with tasty food for morning wake up great stop
The food is good about what you'd expect for the price but that's not why you're here
long story short the chicken and waffles were amazing as always but the unsweeted tea was on the verge of souring
I got the soup as well very good seafood soft tofu soup but such a little portion for $8
Our dessert came out in no time and it was DELICIOUS
Breakfast Seems like they changed the recipe for the turkey maple sausage so it now has an odd herb flavor and less maple flavor but tried the flattened meatball and liked it so might switch to that option
Overall a great non-chain place for unique and delicious food
It's not overly orangey it's light though smooth with some good body it leaves you refreshed and paired quite well with our grubBar Food+ Beer Bites
It was fresh mozzarella basil arugula tomato and a very sweet reduced balsamic on a super crusty round-pizza-medium kinda size bread which was really good cut up in 8 triangles kinda like pizza
I definitely think the food is worth it but the atmosphere of the place doesn't seem to really fit with the prices
I loved it the service was excellent food was great etc
While at least half of its aisles are dedicated to Chinese foodstuffs and other goods you've got whole aisles solely dedicated Japanese Korean Indian/Pakistani Thai/Persian/Dutch/Indonesian and Brazilian/Colombian stuff among others
food arrived cold potatoes are sliced to thick and do not cook all the way through and don't crisp at all biscuit was dry and tough gravy bland and boring
My work paid for it so it was a bit more than I would normally spend for a lunch but it was so tasty that I've went back since and paid for the food on my own dime and without a Groupon can you believe it
As stated by my first word in the review the food here is really good
The Chicken Kebab is good and the hummus is decent as well I've only had Original
And like I said I like the food but it's not amazing enough to make up for the lack of customer service so I'm giving the place 2 instead of 3 stars
I always loved Benihana as a kid and either I grew up and learned what good food really is or this place seriously went to crap
So being a true NYer and a good Jew I love Chinese food
The soups appetizers and main dishes are all consistent each time I order them which is what I look for in a good eatery
The Bacalaitos were delish nice crispy texture and not even the least bid fishy people should give these a shot
Just like the original Pizzerias and Trattorias of Italy La Piazza is a place for friends and family to gather for good food
The food was excellent and the people very friendly
Spaghetti with Marinara Sauce $7 or with Meatballs or Italian Sausage $9 both were tasty and filling
My friend is sensitive to too spicy foods but enjoyed the meatballs saying they were just right
Now that I'm spoiled for good pizza it will have to be La Piazza'a
Anyway it was EXCELLENT and easily one of my favorite pizzas in the valley
Appetizer spinach artichoke cheese dip was good my little ones grilled cheese was fine but our chicken chipotle pasta was terrible
Pros Pizza was really good not great but really good
Salads was good as well the food was not bad at all
Even Subway has amazing service and gourmet food compared to Carly's
It was hot noisy and the flavor of the food has gone down
I ordered a peach lemonade the drink was tasty and three fish tacos
I hate to give a crappy opinion but I was craving some good fish tacos hoping to find that diamond in the ruff
As a huge fan of Greek food I am always looking for something authentic something skin to the Mediterranean Snack Bar where I grew up burning my little fingers on the hot dish which held my often craved spinach casserole
The food arrived in good time and the chicken was tasty if lukewarm
Ten on Tatum was equally amazing and had great food
They had the best Chicken Shawarma I've ever had tasty hummus and babaganooj too
Then I got various sushi rolls with the white miso soup all very good
It definitely was a good quality piece of meat
Pizza is great sandwiches wonderful burger - I would skip
I gave this place 5 stars because it had the best margarita on the block delicious food excellent staff and outdoor dog friendly seating and yes that's my little Yorkie in the pictures
For food we had the pork pot stickers which were delicious
Also had the Surfrider Chicken sticks which were nice and juicy and delicious as well
Well I'm sure their Pizza is good but I didn't try any of it and probably won't go back to try it
There is better Italian food out there but NoRTH is good and not terribly overpriced
HH menu pricing was very good $3-5 for rolls and $3-7 for various appys and entrees
The calamari and chicken tempura were each served with a surprisingly flavorless remoulade and the breading was equally unremarkable
Other than that though it's good clean and enjoyable food
I'm not sure if I really know what good Chinese food is
So either they make good food or I am easily pleased with salty meaty saucy woked food
The food was delicious and very affordable
We shared appetizers and it was plenty of food even without an entree; I do think the prices were a bit stiff but considering the amount of time you spend in the seats they were fine
Although I did not eat in the restaurant and I didn't even see it since my husband picked up the food I have to say that what I had was excellent
I've been to many places like this where I've had to eaten salt-sodden food and this place does a good job with seasoning
The service was good the first couple of times we went and the food was hot and tasty
But this last time we went the food took forever to get to us and half of it was cold
It may be construed as slightly overpriced given the fact that it's primarily used as a lunch spot but the quality of the food is good
But don't go too late; food isn't as good as the morning
All the dumplings are fantastic chicken feet is good BBQ pork buns are great egg custard chinese vegetable all great eggplant with shrimp be sure it's hot same with green pepper with shrimp
Still the quality of the food and the excellent service have me giving Delux an emphatic 2 thumbs up
There are too many good dessert options out there
For only having veggies inside of my roll I wish it would have been a little cheaper but it was filling and tasty
Love the other food btw and the service has always been good everytime I go
OH and anyone who complains about the price get real this is some of the best food you will have and the prices are 1/3 what you will pay in LA or NYC with food that is out of this world delicious
While the pizza is still good it's not great and who wants to pay $23
So with that in mind I cannot say they don't do great traditional high quality sushi
From the Curry sauces to the simplest of spring rolls it was excellent
I like the Keg and have always had a good cut of meat when I have gone here
Their chicken salad and baked beans are delicious I am so glad for yelp helping me find all of these little gems that would have remained hidden
The food was amazing as were the prices and the wine
Been here multiple times and the food is always good
Generous salads burgers pasta desserts even the house wines are quality
The meat seemed of very low quality actually made me wish I would have gone veggie
Although I realize that there are many good reviews associated with Cafe Carumba this restaurant simply does not fall into the foodie category
They offer basic appetizers several types of bruschetta salads pasta and pizzas
The pizza was saucy and cheesy- a bit tough on the very bottom of the crust but otherwise tasty
I had the brown bag chicken sandwich with a side of mac'n cheese and it was absolutely delicious
Mike's beef tenderloin was pretty good but not worth the $34 price tag
I didn't try the spinach but the cheese and meat bureks were ridiculously good
if someone asks me where to get some good food I instantly think of Joe's Farm Grill
The Chefs here combine the perfect amount of salt and ingredients to enhance the natural flavors of the fish
Menu  Basically two parts cold and hot - crudo always has a market fish available along with about 5 other options
I have tried their fries Italian Beef Chicago Style Hot Dogs and tamales and everything was great
Our appetizer of 6 meaty delicious potstickers was $2
Burgers Kinda weird burger meat but unique kinda good
I like cold pizza too but this didn't make it
They recently opened around the corner on Thunderbird and were more than willing to recommend a good wine for our Italian food so I gotta give them props - make a stop by here before going to Giuseppe's as they have some unusual California wines that I've rarely seen outside SoCal
Their food is delicious - the crab puffs are addicting and melt in your mouth
Now it was not identical to what I'm used to but it definitely had good flavor and they didn't skimp out on the meat
If you want my recommendation order the pollo con queso its just some nice little chicken burros covered in melted cheese and for the grand finale globed with spicy cream cheese
Maybe it's the ooey gooey comfort food covered in cheese artery clogging guacamole goodness that I need once in a while
Or maybe its the fact that my recent diagnosis of gluten intolerance has not impeded my meal here at all- I can still feel evil eating delicious food without actually getting sick
Service-  The waiter did not seem to have any real opinions about the food just that it was all wonderful
Heehee few things make me happier than good GF pizza
The chocolate chip pizza cookie is insanely good but definitely one of those things that make you feel guilty for eating
Had I not been in a hurry I would have brought this to the manager's attention instead of throwing away food which may have been very good under other circumstances
the kid's PEPPERONI PIZZA was light crispy and surprisingly good
The fish dinner is good and Brittany the waitress even better I'm a big fan
We split the torta nortena with chicken and the chicken ranchera torta and both were delicious
The food is so good and for the price in unbeatable
My friend had the meatloaf which was amazing
For dessert we had some decadent chocolate/espresso thing that was soooooo good
This location is usually pretty busy but good thing is that the service is pretty fast and the food quality is still good
This place is amazing I love Hawaiian food
My favorite things to get there were the teriyaki chicken with rice which is beyond delicious and the manapua I think that's how you spell it
The manapua is this strange sweet-ish roll filled with pork and it is possibly one of the most amazing foods I have ever tried and that's saying something
We had the spinach salad with grilled chicken and it was so light and tasty
There was nobody in the place just myself and my friends and when the food finally showed up to our table three of the plates of food were cold
Good food relatively cheap and a cozy atmosphere
dinner was good except very skimpy on meat for the price
My husband and I both ordered the Chorizo and cheese omelet which was wonderful but AGAIN a little skimpy on the meat for the price
After that I would never go back no matter how good the food or boba or tea is
Next the Sun Devil Red-a little too hoppy for meThe Epicenter-not a whole lot going on kinda fell flatThe Hefeweizen-surprisingly good pungent in a good way banana & clove flavorsOur group of 5 shared some delicious nachos something about the shredded chicken was just insane
and later 16 pepperoni pizza which was also pretty good
This place is kinda tucked away behind Churches Chicken but way worth the trip
Nevertheless i was just not impressed with the quality of the food for the price
We needed an excellent Asian food more then the always great Sushi on Shea next door
The food is fresh plentiful full of flavor affordable  and a wide wonderful selection
Alas the prices had climbed too high the food wasn't as good as we remembered and the service sucked they got my husband's order wrong and the rest is history
Sushi Ken is a bright cheery place with good service and great food
The tonkatsu was excellent and the food in general outperformed my expectations
I wondered over here after stuffing my belly full of wonderful sushi at Zen 32
The ground beef which I thought was going to be bland and boring was actually very tasty
If you like more City style chinese food I do suggest Nee House although their  service sucks Prime on Camelback Jade Palace is pretty good Hong Kong House on Mcdowell and for a nostalgic kick in the ass with relatively good ChinaTown dishes try Dragon Palace
The goodMost of the food here is quite tasty and fresh
The food is pretty good and they have some interesting choices - cornbread peanut coleslaw
I have had their fish & shrimp tacos and they are delicious as well
Even though other yelpers were recommending other dishes I decided to play it safe with the chicken teriyaki bowl
The chicken teriyaki was fresh and piping hot
The flavor of the dishes were average with nothing standing out
I'm not going to mention the food so much however it was good as much as you could expect from a Taco Bell and Long John Silvers mashup - but who doesn't like some planks of white-fish along side a spicy chicken quesadilla
Some of my favorites Kye sega wat  - Beef cubes simmered in spicy sauceMisir wat  - Red lentils simmered in hot sauce and herbs
The food is good but I can always get the same thing down the street at Las Compadres with better service
Along with being a great value  the food is also very good
The ginger chicken is also really delicious and has a nice potent taste
Even if you're not normally a dessert person I recommend trying it
I wish this place wasn't as high priced as it is but the food is definitely cravable and worth it
My friend who loves golf and getting autographs told me this was the tourney of all touneys the grand daddy of lettin' the good times roll
Explains why the sushi was so good- it is authentic
The food is amazing and creative and the staff is fun and efficient
Had a great time -- got to sample several different pizza's and were impressed by the quality of ingredients used in the toppings -- I loved the sage and sausage combo and that fact that the pepperoni was actually spicy
The food was quite good--I had the pork shoulder and the restaurant made a vegetarian entree for my fiancee
-Groupon check-Cool unpretentious waiter check-Live music check-Amazing menu double checkWe ventured over to 5th & Wine a few weeks ago after buying our Groupon online for $15 bucks for $30 worth of food and haven't stopped talking about it since
I was very impressed with the service and the food
food was good  staff was upbeat and we appreciated that they didn't hurry us even though we arrived at the closing bell
Every ingredient is so flavorful and the food just melts in your mouth
I am sorry I wish I could give them a 5 star review because their food is delicious but they definitely do not know how to treat their repeat customers; the neglijence is unacceptable especially that we get charged for things we do not get
It came with a large salad biscuits and apple butter 3 slabs of ribs 2 whole chickens cut 2 lbs of different meat options we got 2 lbs of pulled pork and 2 lbs of tri tip so delicious - my new fav 6 sides huge servings of sweet potatoes cole slaw fries sp fries corn on the cob and  mac and cheese and we got sundaes for our birthday
Everything was amazing and we had a ton of leftovers probably a slab of ribs a whole chicken 4 corn on the bo halves a quart of sweet potatoes slaw and mac and cheese pulled pork and tri tip
Despite the service it's worth it for the great selection of dishes and sides
The meat jun was very good and is somewhat like the Asian version of a chicken fried steak
The food was delicious and the service even better
The comb of half baked cookie and ice cream with all the good food put me into a food coma
Great food + great service = excellent dining experience
If only their prices were more reasonable we would go there more often but as far as the food goes Flavors will not disappoint
+ positive -negative -/+ neutral+ The food is amazing
- The food is good but definitely not healthy
My chicken curry was quite watery and wasn't as flavorful
The cashew chicken though was pretty good but nothing too special
The chicken mole enchilada was delicious I especially enjoyed the mole sauce
The spinach enchilada stood out the least but it was very tasty just not as good as the other two dishes
We got a refill on our drinks and the guy poured sum of our drinks on the left overs so we could not take our food back to the hotel
Foodnet Work shame on you for recommending this place
Just because the chicken is good does not mean you treat people like shit
The pho itself has really tasty broth and the beef was nice and tender
The ambiance is amazing and the food is extremely inexpensive while being decent portions and absolutely scrumptious
and have a mini-vacation here one day the cost of a round of golf for guests of the resort is really good and the rooms include a sink stove and even a dishwasher so it'd make a great mid-week vacation
The food is delicious service is great and prices are low
I recommend the mongolian beef kung pao chicken and hunan tofu vegan
food is made quickly and is always steaming hot
Nestled back in one of the frozen food cases is the most wonderful pasta sauce; I keep some on hand for a quick meal
T'Cookes has not recaptured it's mojo from the glory years gone by - good service and food but it used to be head and shoulders above typical resort fare
At night they had Free Beer on Tap and Wine along with fresh salads veggies and dips chips pretzels  popcorn and hot appetizers like egg rolls
Everything I have tried has been wonderful fried okra grits with butter yum fried chicken waffles greens mac&cheese and to conclude a fabulous meal red-velvet cake
I looked at my colleagues who never had Korean food before nervously but to my surprise they both took a good liking to the kimchi enough so that it disappeared long before our entrees even got there
Eventually our entrees came to us and honestly the two veggie dishes looked awesome especially the bi bim bap which came in its own hot stone pot filled to the top with good stuff
I have to admit that I was more than a little skeptical and thought that I'll be the judge about how good the food really is
Well lo and behold the reviews were spot on and the food was delicious the service was very good
I'm getting hungry just thinking about how delicious the food was that night
The food rates a solid 3 stars - not outstanding but certainly not bad and good enough for me to go back
The customer service was beyond amazing thanks to DANA  The food was so mouth watering it wasn't even funny
With tons of pepper and soul this food made us feel homestyle good
The food I've tried has all been tasty although I do find it to be a little over-priced
We also tried the beef skewers that were pretty good
This wouldn't be so bad if the food was slap-yo-mama-in-the-face good but to our disappointment there will be no slapping our mamas in the face after eating at Gallo Blanco
I would give this place another try because of the food but the quality of service does not make me feel inclined to return here anytime soon
The shrimp & sweet potato tempura is one of the best I've ever had and the noodle dishes and the spicy beef salad is excellent
The service and quality of the food remain top notch
But aside from the potato gluttony the food is actually pretty good
They literally were out of hot dogs and pizza for non party skaters insane we had nachos
I've got to say that I have eaten at many many Chinese food places and this place has excellent food
I am strictly rating on quality of food here
I would love to see them improve the interior of the restaurant to match the quality of the food but with a full belly I am not complaining
We ordered the chicken chopped salad which was delicious
The prices are very reasonable and the food is good
Its just a clean taco shop with cheap good food
A bit of a trendy downtown-type place but food is amazing and the ambiance is very cool
Thai'd Up exorcises the ghosts of crappy restaurants past and churns out some flavorful food at a decent price point
Thumbs Up The entree soup coconut was some of the best I've ever had;  egg roll was crisp and fresh; drunken noodles came out piping hot and were tasty; portions were generous; my colleague picked up the check
Definitely a gourmet pizza with quality ingredients
I expected everything to be well-executed but I was very impressed with the inventiveness of the dishes and the medley of flavors
Our friends ordered chicken fried rice and a Philly roll they said both were good but they'd had better
The las vegas roll was actually very good but we had to scarf it down because they'd forgotten to make it for us we didn't see a waiter for at least 20 minutes after they dropped off the food and we were late for a movie
I'd rather pay more and have really good sushi and great service than put up with this place just for the all you can eat option
I've been a lot and have always had great food and good service
The steak wasn't as good as I remember it and realized we didn't order the more expensive meat cadillac so that could be why
The chicken was perfectly cooked and really good
Last night I ordered the usual shrimp and chicken pad thai with the vegetable egg rolls and sweet n sour sauce as an appetizer
The meat tasted like it had been frozen multiple times and lacked flavor
The point is  Carly's has decent food maybe a tad over-priced in this economy but hardly a deal-breaker the service is not great but not intolerably bad aside from First Friday of course and the vibe is actually quite good
My girls shared the chicken teriyaki and were not impressed
My son had the red beef curry and enjoyed it
Wei has a good selection of options and the food is always fresh
It's consistent as you can get and doesn't break the bank for a good portion of food that can also be relatively healthy
Whether I get the Thai Dynamite or the Spicy Korean the flavors spices don't vary that much - both are still decent dishes though
A good place to try for a good mix of decently priced and good tasting Greek foods
We prefer the meals at the place on the Southern and Mesa Drive -- a Mexican bakery that also has good food
I came here excited to try these amazing cinnamon rolls I've heard so much about
The food was good but not good enough to warrant the high prices
the house chicken is good and I enjoyed the mongolian beef when I had it too
While annoying I'd give them another shot as the food was very good
Whole Foods in Tempe has such a great atmosphere wonderful employees and great great great food
Their wine selection is great and the prepared foods is super delicious too
When this California girl wants good sushi but can't get home to the California coast she goes to Sakana
I highly recommend ordering from their specials board because it is usually the freshest & best quality fish being offered
Oh and did I mention the portion sizes are ginormous compared to higher priced lower quality Phoenix sushi joints
Also don't be afraid to ask what the sushi chefs recommend they've never steered me wrong
Food was very good but the ambiance made it excellent
My bottom line is this if you want good quality sushi and excellent service & attention then Sakana on Elliot is the place to go
I would say that it would as good as another deep dish pizza and if I wanted a deep dish pizza this is the place I would order it form but I don't think I will want another deep dish pizza
My sister had the catfish which was really good in size and cut but again it lacked flavor
Although the place can suit all sorts of tastebuds I would recommend going JUST for the pizza
We just moved from NYC and have had a HARD time finding good food in the area
I'd love to tell you that the food was amazing and that the service was perfect but I can't
I won't be returning to try their food even if it's close to my job because I feel that honesty and integrity are necessary components to running a good business and I don't want even my mere $1 to contribute to an establishment that runs without them
The small 12 medium crust BBQ chicken pizza was also good $14
So these were slightly chewy due to the quality and abundance of meat
Was quite impressed with the number of side dishes
But a good friend of mine suggested I check this place out and try the chicken shawerma sandwich
Our friends ordered the beef green curry extra hot and thought that is was good too
I hate to compare to The Good Egg which is also very close for us but Harvest is priced about the same the food is better and as my GF says her grandma's furniture didn't vomit on the walls
The warm pitas such as the falafel or beef gyro are definite winners being cheap delicious and filling
Overall the food is good service is quick and the experience is laid back
Regardless the bottom line is that the food is very tasty
It's not so much a romantic date spot but it's still a fun lively place to have some good Italian food
For lunch and dinner they have tons of pasta pizza sandwiches and soups to choose from as well as a pretty good wine and beverage list
The Chicago dog was good soft bun tiny diced onions yada yada - I look forward to trying their Italian Beef
My husband enjoyed his corned beef sandwich on rye
After a few questions and the suggestion of my server I also tried a wonderful curry dish called Evil Jungle Princess
Good food good drink comfortable and relatively authentic atmosphere
The gyro meat is amazing and every time I order one it's better than the last
My weekly sushi hot spot was jam packed on Friday at lunch 30 minute wait
I'm a sucker for menus that have photos of their dishes
I was surprised that Sushi Eye has photos of their rolls
The salmon was so good they made my eyes roll back into my head
This place is tucked away in a random strip mall next to a pizza joint but it's worth the hunt and the drive
My friend's Roasted Chicken & Artichoke Lasagna however was amazingly delicious
I am no shellfish expert but these looked fresh and they tasted good even better with a little extra horseradish and cocktail sauce
I have had some pretty good escargot dishes in my day usually swimming in a mild garlic butter sauce however Metro's were doomed by a combination of rich green pesto and a breaded crust
There was a good crowd too so lot's of people have been dying for some nice Hue food
It wasn't that the food was bad it was totally edible just not very good
But back to the food for an appetizer I tried the deviled eggs and they were wonderful and big
The oysters were good I wish they didn't give you the fancy pre-made sauces and just bring me out the traditional horseradish ketchup lemon hot sauce and let me mix it together myself none of the sauces were nearly spicy enough for my liking but the oysters were fresh and good
food too My only complaint it was pretty hot inside but then again it's ALWAYS hot inside buildings here in September
My boyfriend likes the green chicken enchiladas and I have gotten a variety of things all turned out good
The pizza pepperoni and mushroom of course had a thin but not too thin crust and good cheese/topping coverage
My only disappointment w/ Sauce was that while the food was good - it wasn't as great as the menu's hyped it to be
the orzo noodles were the perfect pick for this delicious soup and added a nice twist to traditional chicken noodle
I love this place because they have a good amount of dim sum dishes you can try
The food is consistently good here and the prices are right
So basically the guacamole was good and the dessert was good
Food was very good I had the pulled pork with bacon and ham on it--no I'm not a vegetarian in case you were wondering
There crispy chicken wings were also very good
I think my favorite thing about Village Inn is  the food quality does not go down in the overnight hours
The third guy a native New Yorker concedes that it is very good but disputes that anything outside NYC can be authentic NYC pizza
So there you have it if you aren't from NYC and you want an authentic taste of the big apple or if you ARE from the city and you want to annoy your non- native NYC friends while eating some pretty good pizza Grimaldi's in Scottsdale is the place
Quick tip take it for what it's worth MHO if you order more than one or two items on your pie the pizza starts to loose its character
we shared the lettuce cups as an appetizer and they were quite tasty although messy to eat as are all the dishes that use lettuce as a tortilla
As appetizers were half price during happy hour I figured I ought try another appetizer and got the meatballs marinara
You know how sometimes you know you're full but the food is so good you just keep eating and eating and then get mad at yourself afterwards
Flavor was really good on the Pepperoni & Sausage Pizza but I just wanted more
I've tried a few dishes and found that they can sometimes be a bit bland but overall it's quality Chinese food
There are good restaurants and fast food within walking distance
My caterpillar roll was good but not the best but I 'd order again just because I like caterpillar rolls
This place has wonderful I mean wonderful chicken parmesan
The chicken parmesan and the sausage rigatoni are amazing as they ever were
Kids ate chicken fingers from the bar menu and some sliders from the appetizer menu
Cooked as good as a fast-food burger can be cooked
My daughter had the kids meal of chicken and fries and she loved the flavor
Food options are the 3 hot food items usually some sort of entree paired with some combination of sausage bacon eggs or potatoes
I probably won't go back to this place while the food wasn't terrible; it was far from good
Pricing is very fair for the quality of the food and the portions are large
It was a cream based chicken tortilla with loads of chicken beans corn and a garnish of avocado and tasty tortilla strips
Of course that is why the food is fresh and amazing
I little family run place with affordable prices and very good food
The appetizers are really good as well my favorites being peanut satay and their spring rolls
My favorite sections of the store include the deli counter at the center of the store where you can find specialty baked goods meats and sausages salads and other unique items
This used to be one of my favorite places in the neighborhood but the quality of the food and service has gone WAY downhill recently
That aside the food at Krishna can be quite good
The sauce was really good but the entire dish was overall just average
It was the dish the server recommended too
We usually don't finish all of our food when we go out but the meal was so delicious that we finished every bite on our plates and even licked our fingers clean when we were done
We even managed to stuff down some Huckleberry bread pudding for dessert that was just as amazing as the rest of the meal
Newp not my thing at all but good hearty comfort food on a chilly night always sounds good and so we ventured on over to Richardson's to see what they were cooking up
Fish seemed to be the hot dish of the night but once I saw one of my favorite words
The boys had Chimayo chicken and the carne adovada and Gabi K and I tried the scallop appetizer and the special scallop pasta
Regardless the staff was still friendly the food was delicious and the drinks were still good
The broth was complex had wonderful depth and the beef and meatballs were very good
Yes the girls wear kilts but the food is pretty good for a sports bar
The shredded beef however was moist flavorful and good
That didn't quite happen not because I have a good metabolism but because they had NO BEEF
The atmosphere was lacking the fries were not memorable and the beef was just off in flavor
After a bit of a wait my food was delivered piping hot
As well as being a fantastic environment and atmosphere there is a great selection of microbrew beers the food there is really good and the bar staff are also very friendly welcoming and attentive
The waiter passed by with a plate of lasagne it looks wonderful as did the spaghetti and meatballs
If you're a person that likes a good crowd live music friendly service decent food and great beer you should definitely go to Rosie's
I got the bacon-wrapped lychee -- which was excellent mixing of savory and sweet flavors -- and the ginger fish -- which was a well-cooked but otherwise plain serving of some kind of whitefish
In the past we've received good food and service at this location but yesterday was completely the opposite
The food was tasty and a good value which is the only reason I'm giving more than one star
Their chicken adobado is amazing the salsa bar is possibly the greatest thing you'll ever put in your mouth they have a decent beer selection and all you can eat homemade chips
Hubby was coming down with a cold and we started with chicken soup and a salad
The chicken soup was like home made shredded chicken not over salted classic and good
It was a good thin crust pizza the toppings were cut perfectly not too big not too little  How many times have we all have had a slice of pizza that is either-too heavy with toppings or you have to bite into a giant green pepper
I am pretty picky about food and we try to go to places with good flavor and it's not all about GIANT portions
Good food costs money running a restaurant is expensive and any business owner needs to make a profit
there should be an endless supplyBottom line  This is a great place to go if you want tasty food at a reasonable price
The wings and other dishes were great especially as sports-bar food goes beer selection was good prices were reasonable
The food itself was very good but I had a very bitter taste in my mouth from the credit card debacle
They did produce the dish very quickly within 5 minutes or so So the quality of the Bulkogi was a C
BreakdownFood -      C            See above Service -  B            Service was good and efficient
If I had read these other reviewers review I would probley not come here but i had also stumbled in one day for lunch and thought the food was decent but my wife and i went last nite for dinner and had the baba ganough which was goodi make better we split the mix grill which is pleanty for 2  and also ordered the falafels which i liked as well and we took a to go container home with enough for a nice snack
Look if you dare to serve deviled eggs as an appetizer you KNOW your food is fresh and awesome
The pizza's are all very good whether you order something from their speciality menu or build one yourself
Their Italian dinners aren't quite as good and seem to take a backseat to their pizza in many regards
They've got a good beer selection on draft or bottled too lots of good choices to go with their pizza
That being said I will say that the Black Angus on McDowell Rd in Goodyear has never served me bad food and only 1 in the many times I have ate there did I get bad service and that really wasn't the waitresses fault but rather the family in the booth next to us was letting there 3 year old run around the restaurant with a stake knife even going so far as to run into the kitchen and climb into our booth and hit my husband at which point we asked to be moved
At least at Pei Wei it's cheaper and you get your food hot
I would have told the server or anybody that our food wasn't very hot but nobody ever came back to the table to ask us how everything was
The other sad thing is that we spent a good part of our dining conversation talking about where we should have gone for better Chinese food and service
The service level and the quality of the food coming out of the kitchen is drastically in a different league
the strip mall that it's located in is pretty sketchy but the food is totally worth it - you'll see
The Seasonal Vegetables and Seafood $15 tempura offered up three delicious prawns as the stars of this dish
For sushi we selected the Salmon Avocado Roll $12 and the Crispy Prawn Roll $12 and both were excellent
He said that the kitchen was very good about knowing how to prepare gluten free foods and he was trying to make sure they do things right
We were really blown away with the quality of the food as well as the super efficient staff
They have good options if you don't want to pig out and their food over all is really good
The service was very good but the food was just no good
The truth is the food is probably well received by the Scottsdale and Phoenix crowd however in San Francisco where quality expectations are much higher the restaurant floundered and closed shortly after a costly renovation of the former Stars building
When I arrived she said it was not very good and didn't recommend the food so I just got iced tea and a muffin which was good
Food atmosphere and service were all excellent
I haven't had too much experience with Thai food but we thought their Pad Thai and Red Curry dish vegetarian was very good
Asian food is never bad cold the next day *grins* The ice coffee and thai tea looks awesome
Oh and a few more things to note about Eddie's House the decor is warm and welcoming very comfortable bar stools a flatscreen TV at the bar an outdoor patio cool ass fly fishing photos in the men's room according to Jared and take out is available
I was with a date we waited the 2+ hours had a really good dinner salad an appetizer and pizza
let me preface by stating I spent the first 18 years of my life growing up in Northern Illinois and I'd like to think I know a thing or two about chicago pizza generally you have your more popular Chicago style deep with the stuffed topping and a layer of sauce on top then the lesser known but still delicious Chicago style thin which is thicker than NY style usually square cut with lots of cheese and some of the toppings under the cheese usually with sweeter sauce
a while later remember it's deep dish we got our pizza and although it wasn't bad it wasn't anything special and I think they should maybe tone it down on the CHICAGO THIS and CHICAGO that keep your windy city to yourself cuz I'm not fooledI give them credit for getting the pizza out in a reasonable time frame but paying $25 for a pizza that was alright didn't leave me in a good mood
When I think of Mexican even what is to be considered Mexican-style food I think of all of the different flavors and textures spicy sweet crisp crunchy
If you want great Mexican food in the downtown area I would recommend La Tolteca
Upon walking in we were greeted by a GIANT wooden door and behind it wonderful smelling mesquite chicken being roasted in a huge fire
One of my favorite things to do when I move to a new city is try to find good pizza
But I add one star back for the fact that you can pretty much get any bag of veggies and just pop them in the micro for a nice steamed side dish or all their meats that look good or the fact that capn crunch was the first thing I saw on the way in
The food is delicious depending on when you go  last time we went at 3PM  they had steaks roast beef and ham in addition to chicken pizza and all the fixings including dessert and salad bar
A quick kiss over hot coals on your own personal chimney and grate and I mean lightening fast to avoid over cooking the exquisitely marbled meat
Silky smooth fatty meaty five star territory goodness yum
No qualms about the fish quality but I found some of the pieces were just too heavy handed with the crispy garlic tidbits
The dish that I ordered was surprisingly flavorless
The fish was supposed to be moist and light and delicious
I highly recommend this place the food tasted fresh service was awesome and the place also played good music
The food was good however some stations were out of food before I got to them drinks were affordable crowd was mixed live band played a nice variety of music and the staff was very accomodating
The food is tasty   while maybe not rich  or decadent or over the topthe food is great tasting  but without leaving you feeling like you need a nap
Food quality is good  it taste like they just made it in Grandmas kitchen without adding a lot of grease
I don't mind waiting especially for good food and if the food is great and the service isn't I will always come back
Another gimmick that I probably wouldn't mind if I were dining outside but didn't care for since I was dining indoors w/ friends a couple who'd ordered food and a couple who didn't away from cigarette smoke and the cold air
She enjoyed the dish and stated that the veggies were very fresh
Pasta with marinara and steamed veggies broccoli green beans snap peas carrots The chicken was a little tough but could still be cut with a fork the sausage and mushrooms were excellent and I do not like mushrooms
The fried chicken is BOMB the Pork Belly Cubano is delicious and the French Dip is one of my go to favorites
I can say that I had one that had rice cakes with little shrimps and green onions and shredded meat on it and that it was quite tasty with the accompanying Nouc Cham sauce
The sauce is unique and sweet and I've never been disappointed by the quality of their food overall especially the Margherita pizza and pesto cheese bread
Now that I'm living in the north valley I always try to find a pizza joint that's half as good as Florencia
We also had the avocado plantain rolls for appetizers and they were great
Everyone else ordered meat dishes so I didn't get a chance to try them but  they seemed to love them and couldn't stop talking about how flavorful it all was
The food was excellent and priced similar to a cafe instead of a golf course
Veggie tempura is so yummy and only $4 and the sushi is pretty good
As delicious as the food was I have to say - I probably won't be back to Chakra
While their selection isn't as vast as other buffets it felt like the quality of cooked food was better and not as oily
Service was good drinks were filled consistently and the staff even apologized that some food wasn't as fresh due to lack of customers
Hubby got the Philly burger- an amazing burger to see piled high with meat and all the cheese steak fixings
There's an Osha Thai back home in SF that is really good and I've heard great raves about this place from my co-workers who claim to be thai food snobs
Actually I stand corrected they finished their food before we even got started on our appetizers
Now aside from the food and what really earns this place 5 stars the customer service is amazing
I would recommend this to anyone looking for delicious food
The Diablo Shrimp pizzadilla is excellent as is Cochinita Pibil which is a melt in your mouth slow roasted pork with a delicious deep flavored red sauce served with plantains and pickled red onions
The meats was amazing so tender and moist
The cinnamon roll was very fluffy and had a good helping of frosting on it
The pizza has chicken bacon cheese arugala and an amazing garlic parmesan buttery sauce
From local veggies to grass-fed chicken and beef - fresh local and seasonal ingredients are packed into their excellent breakfast and lunch menus
The food at Hula's needs to be good and consistent not just returnable
Pretty much typical buffet- a bunch of mediocre food with little flavor
The fried food that should have been light and hot was cold and greasy
The one thing that was actually good were the black beans- nice smoky flavor but unfortunately for me that's probably the last item when I think of Cuban food I actually really care about
Their foods is good and service is OK
The food is like any other Oregano's location Tasty with large portions
I've had pizzas pizookies various appetizers and sandwiches here and for the most part I've been pretty satisfied with the food
We got all of a drinks and food in good time
We all walked away raving about how good the food was
Get the Hawaiian toppings and both the polish sausage and bratwurst are good I don't think I've had a regular beef dog
Came with an appetizer of  buttered shrimp and a dessert I ordered cru00e8me brulu00e9e but they didn't have it so I picked carrot cake
Malee's is the most spicy Thai food I've had in the Valley which is good because it satisfies my really crazy addiction to heat but it'sbad because most other places just can't live up to the heat standard Malee's has set
A moderately white fish it is native to the rivers of Australia and reminded me of good ol' Texas catfish
I had nearly polished of a bottle of sake by the time the food got there which may account for my belief that the sushi was good lol
With a thank you and a quick exchange of smiles I proceeded to devour the entire bowl - catching my posture melting into a slump a few times as I took in the sheer flavor of the broth the delicious texture of the clumped tender rice noodles and variety of beef parts cheek tripe thin sliced meat etc
A few minutes time and another aromatic bowl was set before me - this time with a wonderful array of seafood shrimp krabstick dumpling amidst a hefty portion of delicious egg noodles
I had to muster up the willpower to stop eating this halfway through and to get a to-go container so I can relive the dream tomorrow morning for breakfast   tl;dr Amazing food very affordable at ~$7 for a gigantic bowl
A big recommendation for those who prefer something different but delicious food
The spring rolls are all tastyspider and spicy asian are my fave the pho is good and a few months ago I discovered grandmas spicy chili that is now an add on to everything I eat there and I love it
The pizza was tasty but the pizzookie was spectacular
Their pizza is awesome love the dough and they use quality stuff to top it
All in all damn good for a pizza night at home
We just went there for appetizers and drinks and the food was less than average like supermarket sushi at Trader Joes bland
The sushi was good but wouldn't say it was great for the money spent
I've been to a good amount of sushi spots in the valley both 'commercial' and divey locations and this really missed the target all together on customer service and presentation
Each regular dish is $8-14 the ever-changing featured dishes average about $20+ each but for two people they recommend that you order FOUR to SIX dishes
Wow first I need to say how impressed we were with the service we received at this location in Chandler for California Pizza Kitchen
Took the bf here for his bday and the pizza was good but not OMG good
Seeing the food cooked by the bar area got me really excited and it looked and all smelled so good
My wife had the chicken dish forget the name it was very good and covered in Asiago cheese
The quality of the sushi and other food was amazing
Still some of the BEST Mexican food and service was good
Jims dish looked really good and Audrey had some fish
A good time was had by all and if you like Cuban food go here
I shared a margherita pizza with added mushrooms that was pretty good but my friend let me try her Wise Guy pizza and that was amazing
But saving time with a reservation was worth it and I'll go back if I have some time to kill or want to pay a little more for pizza
They've definitely got some good choices of food on the menu but somehow this place just didn't hold our attention like some other breakfast spots have
The only saving grace was the wonderful bartender who exchange my dish for tacos
Both kinds of chicken were good the souvlaki better than the shwarma
I miss my old favorite dish but it is still really really good and like i said I love the art
All I can say is very tasting the meatball with the eggs was a great flavor combo
i love when that egg cooks perfectly in the hot mixture of rice veggies and beef
both dishes are absolutely delicious and come with all the tasty korean sides kimchi sprouts potato salad spinach and so on
I did have brunch here and the food was pretty good however it was nothing you couldn't find at any other Mexican restaurant
But it was worth it the gyros were really good lots and lots of meat
It was a little noisy inside but the food was excellent and we will be back
The sticky rice was perfection and the cashew chicken was definitely hot
Hoping it was just the dish I chose that was lacking spice and flavor
Anyway the best part about all this it's a local family owned business it's a great place with delicious food near the light rail and it's reasonably priced
The chow mein and rice are good my favorite is the sweet fire chicken
The Beijing beef is also good but way high in calories so I have switched it up to the kobari beef dish that is not fried
A few days prior the meal was excellent for a fast food Chinese joint
Step up your service and your food quality and you would be great
I got the Alfredo seafood pizza and it was just delicious
So I am not sure if it was an off day or this was their normal quality of food
I would good back to Ono Hawaiian fast food which is cross the parking lot next time I feel Asian
As an addendum to this review the food is definitely 5 stars - it is that good
Saigon Pho is okay always busy but the quality can be hit or miss and they tend to use dark meat chicken instead of white which I prefer
I know they are all around the valley and the food is not amazing but I just can't help but come back almost every weekend
Even on its best day the food isn't good enough for me to have to do a $15 battle for an extra 10 oz of sauce
The broth had good body a beefy flavor and nice anise undertones
I also got the Goi cuon rice paper rolls w/shrimp and thought they were pretty good not as good as Pho Thanh
I feel bad giving it two stars but the food was really honestly not very good
The beef was cooked a perfect med rare and the wood grill flavor really came thru
Great food great service and good ambiance
Here's the good they give you LOTS of meat on your sub and for the most part it's very tasty
While the soup and 1/2 sub combo is a good deal make sure you're hungry as it's a lot of food
The wait for food is long but well worth it
Amazing food awesome atmosphere and mostly good service
Anyway they normally have a wing and pizza deal and it is best enjoyed there where it is warm
If you order it and pick it up they are not always accurate on their timeline they give you so show up early and wait or show up on time and risk having a cold pizza
The food is good and everything we've tried we have really enjoyed but if you're looking for a breakfast place that will knock your socks off you won't find that here
and it doesn't need to because plenty of people like this place for exactly what it is A healthy reliable and affordable breakfast eatery that always delivers fresh tasty food with great service
For what it lacks in an adventurous and exciting menu it makes up for with the quality and consistency of the food that does come out of the kitchen and that's what keeps people coming back for more
The meat however was tasty and so was the sauce thanks for the recommendation guy who works behind the counter
Very tasty and the quality of the chicken was a step up from some of the other Vietnamese places I have been
The meat was cooked perfectly and excellent mix of house seasonings and a jack daniels sauce I think
1 order of grilled cheese and soup - M said it was GOOD1 order of korean bbq pork tacos - G said it was very good1 order of beef kabob - V liked it I was too full to tryThe girls had tons of drinks too
great food tasty drinks and awesome price for happy hourThat being said after how my wife & I were treated last night I won't be going back
Like I said before the food was phenomenal my  chicken fried steak was AMAZING
So I ordered some honey chicken for lunch so much food for so cheap and it was of decent quality
It was a burger with a creamy horseradishy sauce on it and you got a little wasabi flavor but it lacked that kick you get from eating wasabi
Our server recommended a shawarma dish and I opted for one of their specials with grilled chicken over linguine
We probably ordered too much food but it was a tasty place
The spray painted building walk up ordering and telenovelas SHOULD be overlooked due to the quality of the food
Sometimes I will order the hot and spicy chicken sandwich just for a change of pace
I've had very good thai food being from San Francisco and this was not it
If you want good food that is good for you the environment and your wallet look elsewhere--you have plenty of better options
While the interior seemed a little too much like a strip mall Spa the food and service were as good as what you'd see in the more metropolitan locations
I ordered the fried chicken and it was every bit as good if not better than the more expensive offering at Chelseas Kitchen
I remember driving down the alley a while ago and passing a garbage can with a rather sophomoric retort to the restaurant's quickly declining food quality
The owner was polite quiet and friendly and the food was good
so this is for my northern Californians who are searching for a place as good as La Vic's I came here last fall after a night of drinking and of course like any other drunk person I just wanted some greasy ass mexican food
I thought the fried chicken was juicy with good flavor and the waffle was excellent
But the chicken tends to be dry and chewy - not good
Anyway it was hot and the food was great my favorite was Chi Chi's Tacos would have had more fun if we just came with friends
Pros lots of topping choices and you can add as many toppings as you want; fair price for a hot dog; if you are into low carbs or can't eat bread there is a aked dog option where you pay the same price as a regular hotdog but you get two meats and no bunCons the buns are not traditional hot dog buns but more of a pita-like bun which I didn't like that much; the fried pickles were cut a little too thick and therefore not that crispywould I eat here again
The 1/2 chicken was good but not the greatest and very expensive for what you end up getting
But it's good for what it is fast-food-coffee
com/AZ/glendale-restaurant/happy-hour/Highlights include the Chicken Nachos enough to feed two people until you almost puke; Pizzas hot and yummy; Fried Calamari some of the best I've had this side of the Mediterranean Seared Ahi better than Filet Mignon IMO; Spinach Cheese Dip; The Sliders enough to stuff you to the brim; and well pretty much everything else
The teriyaki chicken skewer appeared to be deep-fried chicken tenders with absolutely no teriyaki sauce or flavor besides a soy sauce marinade
super cheap quality seafood; super cheap burgers; super cheap everything
It wasn't dry and had a simple meatloaf flavor
A couple of people ordered dessert and I didn't taste it but I was not impressed
I got the hot chef special for the night meatloaf sandwich
The meat was cooked perfectly but there was no flavor and slightly dry
The group also ordered other sides and appetizers and I tried other people's food too and I didn't like anything besides the beef capaccio appetizer
The beef was thinly cut and came with a side of salad which was so good
I would add capers to the beef for more flavor
But service quality of food and taste compensate for everything else
Highly recommend the Siamese Basil dish very delicious healthy and full of flavor
you can slightly go wrong if you order the food at a spicy '#5' you may get eye-watering gut-wrenching call me back in 2 weeks hot or on the other end of the spectrum 'please pass the red-chile because this is barely touching my tastebuds' hot
My recommendation if you want to enjoy your food order it at a #4 and add the hot stuff
A bowl of lentil soup came with the entree and it was delicious as were all the various dishes
The food was good though a bit steep in the pricing department
Imagine the flavor of corn bread that's not dry mind you accompanied with chicken salsa black beans and topped with some jack cheese
The pot roast was also delicious and I would say the same about the chicken
We went here on a Sunday after a visit to a downtown church and apparently we are the only people who immediately felt after prayer that what we need on a mid-day on Sunday are some cocktails and some amazing food
The food is pretty average if you ask me nothing bad nor really good
The employees are always friendly and the food comes out hot
I also had a very good dessert beautifully created
This place is trendy and the food is tasty
The meat has very smokey flavor without the great sauces they have on the table
The more things stay the same the more things stay the sameBACKGROUND---------------------I'd been in New Orleans for 5 days back in October eating some of the most tasty food ever
The first thing I missed when I had been here a month or 2 was good Italian food
There are plenty of people that have claimed they found good Italian food here or there but when I tried it i found the places were serving something that may have included pasta but had nothing else in common with Italy
so now after years of searching to find really good Italian food in the Phoenix area  I can count all the really good places on one hand
The chicken lettuce wraps were perfect and the curried rice was wonderful
A greek salad with the grilled chicken or keba added is excellent
He put some greek grill appetizers on the menu which are essentially gryo meat spring rolls and they are fabulous
Definitely a good way to get a quick sushi fix
The deep fried rolls are good if you can get them fresh but by the time they come around the conveyor belt that is often not the case
I usually always go with a meat dish when eating out but today I decided to mix it up and try the spaghetti squash casserole excellent choice very refreshing and filling
Me not being a dessert fan it is hard but I would recommend the key lime pie
The burger I liked meat seemed nice a fresh with good flavor
I currently live in one of the best food meccas of the West Coast and can't get really good Jewish deli Saul's is not great folks and no I have not tried Miller's yet
The spring rolls are pretty good although I'm not crazy about the sauce it's a bit too thick and sticky for my liking
I just don't think there are many places here that serve good mediterranean style food for people to compare
We ordered room service and have to say the food was pretty good
my partner ordered the pizza it was hot and pretty fresh tasting I had the waitress order me whatever she wanted
Good food and a fun place to watch the game
The flavor of the meat was really delicious
I have been here a number of times tried every pizza on the menu but its just ok and not worth the wait or drive
Yes the food portions seem small but the flavors are so full & rich that we were all full afterward
Salsa freshly made guacamole clam stew skirt steak & chicken tacos and pork belly fajitas were all amazing
They are fanatical about food quality to the point where I've seen them toss what any other restaurant would call a perfectly good fish shipment if it was not up to their standards
It's a place where you can sit at the sushi bar and ask the chefs to decide what you're eating trust Koji and Lori and be impressed with just about everything
The sushi and sashimi are extremely fresh and very tasty and they always have some sort of unusual or seasonal fish special you can't find anywhere else
They don't have a ton of variety on the menu--maybe 12 or 15 rolls the usual assortment of nigiri and then sashimi and hand rolls--but what they do have is made with top-quality ingredients and delicious
The food is good the service is generally fine and the prices are good
The food selections is good and their outdoor seating can't be beat
While it must be stated that this isn't going to satisfy the Mexican food connoisseur I found this place to be pretty enjoyable and a good value to boot
I loved the beef & that it was so tender & flavorful
The sushi is good but I'm up for sushi pretty much any time
Doesn't really sound like a compliment when it's put that way but seriously Moira is good 4-star sushi for downtown Phoenix
I get it with tofu because I am vegetarian but I heard for those who are not vegetarian that curry is delicious with the meat options as well
It is mostly the sauces that accompany the appetizers specifically the fresh spring rolls and fried spring rolls that really brings all the flavors and satisfying taste of the food together
Good variety of dishes for everyone from salads and sandwiches to hot dishes
The thing is huge and the Italian beef is tender and tasty
My tuna roll was OK the Shrimp tempura roll was filled with an enormous amount of mayonnaisey Krab meat and my cucumber salad was a giant bowl probably 3 cucumbers worth of just plain cucumbers WTH
There is much much better sushi to be had and I'm more than happy to pay for it elsewhere because Sakana's sushi isn't quality sushi to my standards
Overall the food was good but not great and definitely overpriced
Tostada bean burrito fish taco and 3 meat combo platter all excellent
Sweet Tomatoes- land of the flavorless food
It doesn't matter if it's pizza pasta or bread nothing from this restaurant has flavor
Although the food itself isn't awful I can't describe any one item as being good either
The Chicken Parmesan both the sandwich and entree are excellent
A surprising first for me is getting actual lunch at a coffee place and was pleasantly surprised to find the food was also really good
I ordered a Curry Chicken sandwich and it was huge and delicious so finished the whole thing
We decided to order two pizzas one with red sauce and one with white because it all sounded and looked so good
I'm giving Cibo 4 stars because the actual flavors of the toppings and sauce on the pizza are not as flavorful as I expected and not as bold as I like
I honeslty wasn't impressed with the toppings and the flavor and the quality of the pizza sauce but the crust won me over
I will go back and try their Pho and maybe some other items and if it's amazing as all these reviews state I will update my rating but for now based on the eggrolls and bun dish
To me a 4 or 5 star vietnamese restaurant has to have good bun & com tam broken rice dishes as well as Pho
Long story short I have tried the food and beer here four times over several months and it is not good
That really is a pretty good price for a delivered one topping pizza
Consistent service good selection quality food a touch of the southwest unique to the West those who call it a chain invoke thoughts of Applebee's and TGIF and Z is absolutely no freaking chain
As you can see from the other reviews the panning of the clientele and possibly the food although I thought it was pretty good might make you not want to search for this place particularly since it's sushi
Have a seat by the windows for the best food photos
this place is tiny and a little chaotic as a result, but the food makes up for it and then of course there are the macaroons--all colors and flavors--and if you can't decide which one you want--you can get a sampler set
2	Well I hate to be the bearer of bad news ,but I had an awful experience here and it makes me hesitant to EVER go back despite the good reviews for dinner and dessert
My husband's pasta was piping  hot and he said it was OK also but had a weird taste to the meat
No it's good for fast food but honestly for the $25 my husband son and I could have had a nice lunch at a sit down restaurant for the same price
I'm hopeful that with the success of 32 Shea other businesses will follow suit great service good food and good atmosphere creates a successful business
Besides being with friends there isn't anything that goes better with good beer than good food
Pizzas come in 2 sizes 12 and 14 but the 12 is of good heft and made a great appetizer for the table
Whenever I split a dish or order small items as my entree I always leave a good tip
You are burning calories AND you also get to sample some seriously good good food
The table-side prepared guacamole was surprisingly good with the added dried cranberries but my chicken with black mole was only so-so
While visiting Phoenix over the holidays I mentioned I was turkey'd out and could use a good pizza
Other group members had the monthly special  I can't remember the name which was a blend of chicken and vegetables in a tangy seasoning over the top of a tasty rice mixture which we all thought had the most unusal but delicious aroma and flavor; a pesto Caesar salad very satisfying but needed just a touch more pesto; and the hummus plate which we devoured without a scrap left
Food wise this place is pretty good and inexpensive
The food was plentiful and the flavors were right on
They have other stuff like chicken sandwiches and melts and hot dogs but it's basically a burger joint
The food was typical Roy's - very good
I had the butterfish of course and it was excellent
I've read good reviews about their desserts but I've always been too full
White table cloths dim lighting and a impressive wine list try the plum wine gives a sense of class but food is good and price is reasonable
I love spicy hot food and the bartender kept warning us about these wings- even gave us plastic gloves to eat them with- warned us about going to the bathroom afterwards without a thorough hand washing
Yes they were hot but they still had flavor which is really hard to find in 'super hot foods'
I've been waiting for a good sushi place to open up in Gilbert
I've always gotten a crust salad when I come here - it's a great idea similar to a taco salad bowl except flavorful crispy chewy pizza crust makes the bowl
At any rate we ordered our food and it was quite good
I tried some of my family's dishes and they tasted good as well
I also wasn't impressed with the food or the service
Simply put I was tired of wasting good money on crappy food
The first time I went there this lovely woman helped me pick out some wonderful beef sirloin tip for stir fry and pork hock to make some delicious Filipino-style stew munggo and sinigang in case you're wondering
After that I realized that the quality of meat really makes the difference
Also there was a wonderful gentleman who checked in with me and asked me how my dishes turned out
Overall I would say this is really not authentic Mexican food at all but still pretty tasty
Oaxaca Black Mole Chicken Taco-  Woooooow this one was awesome packed full of flavor and was very moist
The location is nice because it's a good place to get your nails done before or after lunch given the food places right in the Quarters and across the street
The place was really cool the food was pretty good and the other employee was SO sweet but sadly all that was negated by the shat service by the bartender
I ordered the short rib appetizer and crispy chicken
The crispy chicken had great flavor but was a little over cooked
Each dish is seasoned differently so the platters offer flavors that really compliment each other rather than blending
So bar food can be really good at a neighborhood place
Then shegave us a free chicken quesadilla since someone called in an order then cancelled it it was good
If you want to play it safe and get a tuna roll it will be safeway quality but nothing too special
More flavorful the spring rolls were phenom and as always the service was fantastic
Chicken fried steak has been everything from amazing to mediocre
I would say go if you are getting a good deal on happy hour wine but stick to wine and skip the food
I worry that with the food coming out cold and not kept at the proper temp we would get sick  I had severe diarrhea all night
Sliders were hamd made patties on nice buns tuna sliders were blackened and tasty I got nothing bad to say about the chicken wings and that's saying something steak skewers were a bit dry avodado dip was ok
Our table only sampled some appetizers but I can't wait to return to try some main dishes and of course more appetizers
Second the menu is interesting and the food flavorful
I had egg rolls and lettuce wraps; both were in Asian-fusion style and wonderfully flavored
Third though some reviewers have complained about price for Monday Night Football they have all-night happy hour with half-priced beer appetizers and pizza
For $7+ for the veggie sub  you get a long narrow toasted sesame roll that is good with 3 types of cheese lettuce and tomato
I find that their carne asada is done with good quality beef and is pretty tasty although in my opinion it just lacks salt
Their fish tacos grilled not fried are done with mahi mahi and equally tasty but you're never going to envision you're eating these on the beach somewhere
I guess I'll never know if your pizza's any good Pizza A Metro
To be fair the beef ribs and the tilapia and the blueberry pie were good
I went for just coffee so I didn't experience the food although lots of people attest to it being really good
-- The Buddha's Feast Chicken is delicious with huge pieces of Chicken and a lot of fresh vegetables
Not very impressive though the chicken feet was quite good jalapeno in the marinating sauce
The redeeming dish was the desert tray which came out fresh and hot
There was a nice meat selection and overall the meats were of good quality and quite tasty
I'm not expecting a superstar dessert but at least make an honest attempt at quality
On this particular occasion it didn't really               rise much past mediocre given some borderline egregious                failures in service and food quality
It had all the ingredients of a good farmers market; local crafts fresh produce baked goods local foods etc
Granted there were no dishes piled up but clearly the tabled needed a good wiped down
Our order did take a bit longer than usual to arrive but the food was delicious
The food was OK wasn't the most amazing but I'm confident I wont get sick
The shrimp were small the serving of rice was possibly one cup the advertised egg rolls were half spring rolls and the fried carrots were over cooked the miso soup was cold and the california roll was very warm and filled with cream cheese instead of fish and vegetables
I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone based off the location which is in a questionable neighborhood; the customer service because of the pushy person who lacked proper english skills; and the quality of the food which lacked in holding up to its advertising as well as its lack of quantity value per price and lack of the traditional asian flavors
Our server struck up conversation and seemed genuine in recommending her favorite antipasti pizza and wine/beer combinations
The antipasto speciale was full of interesting flavors and the Prosciutto Crudo pizza was simple yet tasty
This Dave & Busters is a bit smaller then the other locations but still does the job i did not taste their food i am sure it is just like any other D&B and the drinks were just as good
Everything about the place is just good- the people the atmosphere the food
The food was pretty good it's not OMG I just died great but it's good
Plenty more food to try good atmosphere good price
To begin with the cashier immediately greeted us and finding we were new recommended with all apparent sincerity and business sense the beef & sausage combo sandwich
The sandwich and fries we ordered easily fed both of us and the quality of the meat was incredible
I had the blackened fish tacos and the flavor was good but it was nothing more than fish in a tortilla nothing special
I have gone to Sushi Station several times and I have consistently enjoyed their rolls
If for nothing else it is worth going to for the spectacle of the conveyor belt that wraps around the restaurant delivering plates of sushi to patrons
Upon sitting down at the sushi bar we placed our drink and appetizer orders right away with our server
When she came over I asked about our appetizers--she told us that hot food usually takes longer than the sushi to make
20 lbs of bread rolls ok maybe it was a little less than that but they were tasty
Great atmosphere great service pretty good bruschetta and great chicken salad
i don't know Filipino food crispy and savory - I'm glad I splashed the sweet/spicy sauce Brian recommended on them
I looove hot food but I wasn't feeling the sauce
I think it was the flavor of the fish itself but the sauce it came with tasted pretty rad especially when mixed with the Texas Pit sauce
Good food; good service; consistent and accommodating
The appetizer Firecracker Chicken Wraps is really tasty
The ice tea is not watered down and the desserts are pretty good
Go here because you want plentiful cheap flavorful authentic Vietnamese food
I recommend the steamed chicken pho spring rolls and their great coconut water drink
Its melange of Latin inspired dishes lovingly prepared by Chef Holly Gibson offer a variety of flavors from Puerto Penasco Ticoz Street Tacos to the Caribbean Coconut GInger Curry Rice
These make for distinct flavor combinations and the juiciest and most tender meat
So after that wonderful veer my focus was back on the food
What one will find here on the appetizer menu are the characteristic  southwestern and even south american comfort foods such as empanadas a taste of buenos aires and flautas
This is a super cool super hip bar with pretty damn good food and one of the best burgers Au Poivre II you'll find in Phoenix
I'm sort of a shrimp fanatic so I'm always impressed when seafood tastes like this isn't a landlocked state
The food we ordered Glass Noodle Spicy Salad with Beef & Thai Toast as appetizers and Thai Beef Fried Rice & Chicken Yellow Curry as entree
Aloha Kitchen is an endless source of incredibly awesome well made delicious yum-foods
Restaurants like Aloha Kitchen are a huge part of what I love about living in the Phoenix Area Honest amazing affordable food that's served by independent establishments
Food was made fast and delivered piping hot
It takes a bit longer for the dish to come out of the kitchen as they bake each serving under the broiler to get the cheese all hot and bubbly but it's well worth the wait
The deep dish is authentic and WONDERFUL
Long ago when I still ate meat I ordered the Club and was floored by how good it was
Within UNION Trattoria del Piero serves an abundance of fresh and organic food options including salads and tasty-looking sandwiches
I had the chicken which was good and the veggies were excellent
I love Japanese food and I was really excited to find a place near by and while we were waiting for our order we were excitedly planning to come back and have their sushi but after this complete mix up and poor quality food there is no way I would trust them with anything raw
The meat that was used was not as good as it could have been it was overly salted and the aioli was overpowering
It's got some drawbacks but this place delivers consistently good food at reasonable prices and has a good atmosphere and lots of 'life'
I like two scoops of mouth-watering macaroni salad a scoop of warm fluffy rice and some deliciously grilled meat all in one plate
I would also recommend getting either chicken beef or spicy pork tacos
If you are in the area and are craving Mexican food it is definitely worth a stop
Overall I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place when we craving good Chinese food
The bar/food order area is plastered with dollar bills signed by the people who came had a good time and left their mark
Grilled cheese hot dogs chili grilled chicken sandwich BLT pulled pork nachos
The chef is supposed to be the next big thing in Phoenix and he must be as every time I go there is either a local celeb or another local chef enjoying a meal; which to me always means that the food must be good if someone who can cook is going here for dinner
Fattoush is an amazing little place family run with wonderful fresh homemade tasting food
Most of the people eating there are Middle Eastern each time I have been there which I think say something about the quality and taste of the food
My cochinita pibil sandwich recommended by the waiter and a signature dish could only be described as bland
BC has been out for a while and has a reputation in the area as a winner - maybe their food quality has slipped with a change of chef
The food is very good I was very happy and returned the next night to try it again
There food is over the top and they gave some great wine recommendations- we also tried their sangria which was delicious
They generally have good deals going most of the time including lunch specials and an extra large pizza and 25 wings deal that's quite affordable
Less meat but great balance of strong flavors
95 with sides & relish tray What I liked  Most meat of any of the 3 and very tasty but cold you have to tell them to heat it
Meat served cold and wait a minute is that cole slaw instead of sauerkraut
Great atmosphere delicious food friendly service and affordable pricing all contributed to my 5 star rating of Spotted Donkey Cantina
Donkey Dusted Agave Chicken Wings served with Jalapeno Ranch dipping sauce Dos Equis battered Fish Tostadas and the Arizona Mac & Cheese made with rigatoni fresh hatch green chiles applewood bacon and Mexican cheeses are only a handful of the many eclectic menu choices at this casual-classy hot spot
This provides a nice shady area to rest or if you're just looking for a nice stroll a good turnaround point
The beef is excellent quality and was actually cooked medium-rare as I asked
You can get burgers just as good if not better at Fez Delux and even Parlor if you can bring yourself to not order a pizza there
The food is consistently good if not a tad overpriced for the quantity you receive
With prices like that I can forgive some of the food quality a bit
Second course; chicken and morel mushrooms amazing with black-eyed peas - matched with an amazing black raspberry rum cocktail
According to the manager they would like to host one monthly through the summer and they try to limit the seating to about 60 to keep the food quality as high and I suppose the drinks as cold
The rolls were extremely rich and had great flavor
If you are in the mood for even just a beer or some delicious and unique bar food do not hesitate one bit to check this place out
I'm glad to say that their food is as good in the desert as in the middle of the ocean
Service is always good food for the most part has been delicious save a couple times were a new entree or appetizer didn't lived up to the waiter/waitress hype
As an appetizer we had the white fish ceviche
The food was fresh the service was great our tasty Jasmine Tea was never empty
The decor in the restaurant is nice makes you wanna just hang out and have some wine and good food
They specialize in hand rolls not the deep fried kind but wonderful fresh light and tasty rice paper concoctions
but now I see it deserves five stars for quality food  great service a super cool space and for being totally light rail convenient
Someone was a bit liberal with the spices this trip as the green chile beef and chorizo were a lot hotter than usual but that's how you know it's homemade
Service was friendly and prices seemed good but I just didn't like the food very much
The menu changes weekly so there is no point in reviewing specific dishes but the worst of the ten that my wife and I experienced was good and over half were excellent
My only gripe would be the gowns that showed my ass as I strolled the halls during the recovery and the kitchens uncanny ability to remove all flavor from the food
While the food was good nothing memorable and the uniforms that the servers and hosts wear are terrible
However they do have coupons for dinner which give you starter entru00e9e and dessert for a good price
For the original the flavorful ham center the dish
The chicken was nonetheless really good cause well IT TASTED LIKE CHICKEN
Good service tasty sauces and meat very good sides and filling
I arrived about 30 min before closing after flying in and they were very courteous and seated me quickly took my order suggested some sides and got the food to me quickly and very hot and fresh
Lots of food and I took my time and as it was all so good ended up only taking the corn muffin home with me and it was great the next morning with my coffee
I'll say it again good food service and excellent experience overall
My favorite entrees are the Portobello Chicken and the Meat and Cheese pasties but they are all good I have never been disappointed with anything on the menu
The food came out very quickly probably under 5 minutes and it was nice and hot
I had heard others talk about getting high quality cat and dog food for great prices at feed & tack stores
They also carry Petite Cuisine- Fancy Feast sized cans of food that is the most wonderfully unprocessed cat food I have ever seen
This used to be a wonderful place downtown-- an escape from the annoying hipsters at Carly's with their stale food and watered down beer
The food wasn't as good as it used to be the service was pretentious and inattentive and it was entirely too loud
The BBQ pork was tasty the wontons were good but the fish balls weren't that great
I've now been there almost a dozen times and always experienced the same excellent quality of food and service
As I have tried a lot my favorites are   * Plank Smoked prosciutto fig mascarpone truffle oil   * Salad Goat Cheese and Pear Salad with dried cranberries and walnuts   * Pizza Truffle Mushroom Pizza with goat cheese and spinach absolutely incredible  * Pasta Cavatappi poblano alfredo with roasted chicken and  sautu00e9ed mushroomsDrinks- I have found my perfect drink for this hot AZ weather POMAGRANITE MARGARITA it is so cool and refreshing
The place is packed which is generally a good sign for me that means the food will be turning over quickly it has a lovely bar and a very nice piano player reminiscient of the Old Eddie V's heydays

However the food was not worth the price I thought I was eating at Peter Piper's with the quality that was served
I also got an order of spring rolls which were delicious and refreshing just like they should be
Yeah it was good but it was your normal fancy pizza that I figured most trendy places are doing
People make jokes at me sometimes because I get rediculous when it comes to good food

I highly recommend this restaurant for excellent Thai food
The Hubby's Prime Rib Hash looked amazing even though I don't eat meat and my sister in laws Kale and Quinoa salad was sooo tasty
The ahi tuna was completely tasteless and one of our rolls was dry and flavorless and made with imitation crab I'm assuming
Guess I'm spoiled from having lived in a great sushi city Seattle where quality matters
This pizza tasted like shit and for 10 dollars I can go to grimaldis and get an awesome pizza triple the size and quadruple the quality
-The decor wasn't great but honestly I don't really care what a place looks like if the food is good
All in all I am very happy we have a vegan friendly Mexican spot in this area of Cen Pho that has good food and service
our food was good also only problem being that one of our chicken wings had a lot of fat on it

The food is as good as the Coronado location but the ambiance is seriously lacking
Bottom line their food is good- love the carne and pork
The Swedish meatballs & gravy were a bit heavy but tasty
They serve some mean sushi extremely tasty as well as the martinis we ordered
If you are with a group and can agree with one flavor it seemed like ordering a whole pizza was significantly better of a deal
I was swaying between 3 & 4 but the pizza slice and the hero bread pushed it up although service was slow and the potato chips were not good
The sweet and sour pork was good along with the spring roll and crab rangoon
The service was good as was the food but I would only give it 3
Their food competes with the quality of their wine
The menu is simple and has exactly what a pizza connoisseur like myself needs simple delicious toppings however I want it and in sizes that will actually fill me up and make me not have spasms of hunger in my small intestine
And even if it hadn't been the food was really AMAZING
The meat was tender and flavorful here though and not greasy like in other spots
Great food good prices and good service -- what more could we ask for
I stay with the salad bar food which is pretty good
On the boyfriend's recommendation we split a Queso burrito with chicken

Service is always slow here just like in Mexico ;D but all of the food is fresh and worth the wait
You would think will all the Gorgonzola artichoke and grilled chicken it would taste amazing so good that your taste buds sweat at the thought of this pizza being served on your table and alas

My father had the garlic shrimp and octopus which was really delicious--if I go back this is what I'd order--and I had the fish cuilichi was ok just kinda heavy and not really something that got me excited
The meat itself tasted good although better with some Kikkoman shoyu
The food is awful and made with cheap low-quality ingredients that add up to a mediocre meal
The food is NOT good and they have non existent options for vegetarians
when we got called and walked in and the smell of the resturant was so overwhelming I was almost scared that the food was gonna disappoint for sure because nothing could top those delicious aroma's in the air
The atmosphere is typical any mexican food spot so pretty much out of date with several team photos of teams they support lining the walls
The service is usually pretty good as well but its the food that makes this place a must visit
Food is good but with the beer selection I rarely eat there
This small quaint food joint comes with colorful surroundings excellent service smiles yummy food and the sweetest little lady behind the counter
Service was goodfood was goodlocation was good and parking was decent

I was flummoxed and kind of scolded him with - why didn't you just order some more good food at The Mission rather than eating this garbage
Everything on my plate was absolutely delicious  both fish were so fresh and cooked so perfect  the assortment of vegetables were hot and crisp
The thin crust specialty pizzas they have are a tad salty but delicious
The pan pizza also is quite good although I wished they have the specialty pizzas offered for both thin and pan style crust
The chicken was cooked just right and the chili rub tasted good the salad was fresh and the sauces were decent
I had the Chicken Lo Mein the quality of the chicken and lo mein noodles is cheap the hot & sour soup was okay but nothing grand fried rice was plain and the egg rolls weren't spectacular
Costco has great customer service clean aisles openness good deals on gas food home clothes
Sushi appeared as if it had been sitting there too long and just of extreme poor quality and limited offerings
I would recommend that you go to a sit down restaurant and order quality food

She never refilled water only came back after motioning to her recommended shit food
Some of it was dry but there were two delectable morsels of chicken covered in some sort of yogurt sauce that were amazing
For a name like camarones shrimp in Spanish you would think that the ceviche would be served with some cojones explertive for strong or brave in Spanish but instead the katsup flavored pansey shrimp dish fell short at best
The taco and sopopillo chicken were identical and flavorless
The only salvation to the dish was the delicious tortilla and the table salsa left over from the chips
The food everything buried under a mound of cheap cheese then thrown under a broiler and brought to you hellishly hot
The food was surprisingly good and our seats had a great view of the stage
I would not recommend to place for food
It is very close to ASU so it might be geared toward young college students who do not appreciate good food and just go for the drinks
He acted like I was retard I didnt eat anything after I saw this but we did have a few bites and the food was not good
BUT the FOOD oh the FOOD it was sooo delicious
The fish was cook to perfection and the reduction with the fingerling potatoes were sooo delicious

I noticed that Mandala has a kids menu as well as some delicious looking desserts
I also noticed on the menu that they say the food network has given them reviews Good reviews
I will be back the place is charming and the overall vibe very inviting no one is perfect risotto but the heart and effort put in to the dish is worth a second chance
The mahi dish was meh at best and the tortilla soup was just ok as well lacking flavor
Today we received burnt cold food with sub-par service
Both came with plenty of flavorful meat and the two salsas provided on the side really added an interesting side to the tacos

The food was pretty good the service was good as far as I remember and I wanted to go back sometime  maybe try the lunch menu
Mesa has a plethora of wonderful little restaurants and cafes with good food and good service and good prices so there's no reason to patronize a place that doesn't measure up

With that comes the usual scene of people that I normally try to avoid but the food is pretty good
We've enjoyed Dad's grocery bag the cheese/meat platter the smoked salmon is perfection the ribs fall off the bone the short rib is decadent
Both were amazing but my only complaint is that they went a little heavy on the horseradish spread
Portions on food are awesome but dont let that fool you on quality because I have never had anything I wouldnt want to eat forever on a desert island
Snotty dressy club girls will stll have a good time  its nice to stop in for a drink before the clubs or after the clubs for another round and sme food
This whole chain needs to focus on a specialty food in order for it to be good seems like they are way too spread on on trying to fill every niche
The food is quite good but what really makes this place is just how friendly the wait staff is
Overall I have to say that I'm always impressed by the freshness of the food the inspired preparation and the commitment to local flavors
I know it is NOT real Asian food but nothing good out on the West side
Like any good market the wide variety and abundance of fresh food at PRM makes shopping at the old chain store a boring old chore
99 those were good but the food didn't make up for the poppers
The sushi was good although the rolls were orderd were heavy on rice and this weird oval shape aren't they supposed to be round
My Jerk Chicken Quesadilla was goodish and the Carnitas tastes like Hawaiian kalua pork which was ok just not what I was expecting I guess
The empty atmosphere and 'good enough' food drained me I think
Awesome deal that day $35 worth of food for $10
I decided to put my faith in LGO to create a wonderful pizza experience
The creamy avocado sweet tomatoes summery basil bright lemon zest and add in the salty prosciutto and you have yourself a pretty tasty pizza
All of their pizza creations sound amazing
In addition to the wonderful pizza and the lunch with great friends LGO also provided a bright spot in my day by putting one of my favorite hard-to-find red wines right by the cashier for $10 less than I usually get it at AJ's
If I were in the area I would go again for the wine flight and maybe order an appetizer from the bar but I think the hype exceeds the food
Of course only if you're a fan of a huge selection of food small plates at HH prices and excellent wines by the glass for $5
WAY WAY WAY better than Pete's Fish and Chips which is still good
and if you want really really really good pho and spring rolls
When looking around we did see some delicious looking sandwiches and it did seem that people were enjoying their food we were just wishing that we were enjoying ours as well

Seriously how freaking amazing is it that I can buy a whole roasting chicken for $1
The food itself was good especially the blueberry girdle cake - I wish I would've ordered another one
Everything there is to die for but I'd recommend the panini/soup combo of the chicken pomodori with the broccoli and cheddar soup
However I can say that the food it very tasty the atmosphere is cute and quaint and the pickles are indeed spicy   O
Pizza was still great sauce cheese and peperoni had a lot of flavors
The chicken tinga taco changed my life it was amazing
Pizza is a staple and its always good to find places where your craving can be satisfied

** I recommend THAI CAFE  chandler blvd and loop 101 for BETTER FOOD SERVICE & Price
I'm not going to lie I come to Charlestons primarily for their oven roasted chicken which is fantastic though I wish was available in all dark meat and their croissants which should be outlawed for simply being insanely good and perfectly done up

Now that I gave up the vegetarianism I am thoroughly happy with the variety of flavors in the meat items
I was excited to read through the menu but disappointed at the flavors - the dishes didn't stand up to all the high falootin' foodie terms used to describe them
The gravy was delicious and smooth; the chicken was moist and not greasy at all
The risotto was well cooked but the flavors of the dish had a stinky-foot quality I didn't appreciate
The main dishes were well prepared meats cooked to perfection veggies still had crisp sauces doled out in perfect amounts - you can tell there is some excellent technique going on in that kitchen but the flavors left something to be desired
We were craving Mexican food and this was the closest place to our hotel so Los Olivos it is
The meats were plentiful though and very good
Though quite tasty the corned beef was sliced a bit too thick for my taste- the deli down the street has them beat hands down
The service was great and the food was excellent its worth the price even though I didn't have to pay
The food is delicious most everything on the menu is exceptional; though a few things really stand out
The only reason this hotel gets 2 stars is because the beds were very cozy and the food was yummy
Spiciness was good for me mild-medium but the food wasn't as flavorful as I'd expect for Indian food
Last night I had the BBQ Chicken Salad which I thought was pretty good and worth the price

The food tastes like home made the service is good and seating comfortable
I never wanted for anything- the sushi chef was extremely attentive and personable and my server made sure that my tea was hot my water was topped-off and a smile was on my face
I will say that I was a little disappointed in the snow-crab used in the California rolls- usually when you see specific crab labelled it comes out as a solid stick of scrumptious leg-meat but this was shredded and possibly from the claw without much flavor
Can't wait co come back I will try the fish platter another diner was having it looked really good
If you're in the mood for some delicious New Mexican food THIS is the place to go

I recommend checking this place out for both the food and the casual atmosphere
The Acapulco Gold BBQ chicken is pretty tasty it's the only thing that I get haha
the food was Ok but not  as noteworthy as the ambiance
The bruleed foie gras was amazing as was the coconut-carrot soup gnocchi with mushroom sauce salmon mussels scallops pork belly beef a deconstructed BLT all of them delicious and beautifully presented
- As I said in my review of other Half Moon's their food is really good for bar food and they have some of the best fries I have found in this state
Then to top the meal off you get to choose a dessert I am personally a sucker for their chocolate cake but the cheesecake is very good as well
The Steak was somewhat devoid of flavor so I ended up dishonoring it with A1
the table ended up splitting some apple pie/ice cream desserts which were actually pretty good
This a review highlighting Flemings Event hosting skills-I had a luncheon/seminar here on yesterday and was thoroughly impressed with both the outstanding quality of food and excellent service
I had the Chicken and was impressed by juiciness and the mushroom chutney it was served with
I'm not used to finding delicious food in a strip mall
It comes with soup egg drop or hot and sour soup you get fried wonton chips your meal includes 1 egg roll 1 fried wonton fried rice and your selection
The happy hour is a good deal if you can stomach the food
This is a relatively small restaurant with a tiny kitchen but don't let the size fool you - that tiny kitchen turns out some wonderful food
I noticed that I was the only gringa in the place - a good sign that the food is muy authenitico
Nice big slices of tongue braised in a wonderful mild tomato type sauce served with rice that had veggies in it and small dish of liquified black beans along with two of the most succulent corn tortillas I have ever eaten
I would be lax if I didn't mention the fact the that food was served steaming hot
Love this place I think the food is really good I switch from Breakfast Burrito to an omlette eggs are always cooked perfectly
The fish tasted like it's been poached in butter then pan seared to heavenly goodness
To sum up - decent to good food for sports bar food attractive servers wearing skimpy outfits stiff drinks at reasonable prices and sports on big screen tvs
Pretty much the most amazing chicken and waffle experience I've ever had
The prices are very reasonable around $7 when considering the quality of food the ingredients and the ambitious serving sizes
They have the best Challah bread I've had since I moved here I love their egg bagels and the rolls are delicious
Really was not at all impressed by the dishes
But I recently came for brunch and while the line was LONG and I had to wait in it for about 30 minutes before ordering the meat and potatoes scramble was definitely worth it
I've never seen someone working there with a cold sore and I thought the prices were a little higher than your typical fast food combo
On this particular visit our party had a couple of Appetizers Pot Stickers Sea Scallops and two salads Chopped Maui Wowie Shrimp as well as the aforementioned Butterfish entru00e9e our other entrees included Salmon and both of the available Mahi Mahi dishes
They had a lot of vendors who sold food art necklaces jewelry and leather goods
This is really one of my favorite places to get some good cajun food
Their fried catfish is nice and crispy their blackened catfish is juicy and spicy and their red beans and rice are quite tasty
The scallops over corn grits w/pea shoot greens and cola gastrique really changed that for me - the dish just works - perfect balance of flavors bordering on the rich side
Tracy Dempsey does desserts so they're always good
The place is usually freezing cold and I think the music is played so loudly that it will take your mind off your cold food
The best two things on the menu in my opinion are the meatloaf weird I know but it is good and the Steak Au Poivre
Superior quality as well if the bologna-like meat has such a grade
Both our breakfast dishes were highly filling and very flavorful their steak scramble is very tasty and I really like their honey biscuit
When the staff is continually friendly and prompt and their food is repeatedly tasty and filling - you are darn near 'as good as it gets'
We enjoyed sitting at the sushi bar and catching with the friendly sushi chefs
I will tell you the look on that jerk's face was nearly as delicious as the food here
and the other special who knows the name is a fish cake noodle soup that's pretty good too
The pizza wasn't super good and with a $75 bill for two pies two salads and two glasses of wine I expect a lot more
Pies came out before the salads did so our pizzas sat there and got cold while we finished our salads
If your food is good you don't need that much salt to make it great
They offer a good selection of seafood steak and  if you are looking for smaller try the small plates
I got the spicy tuna rolls and shrimp tempura rolls and I thought it was very good
This place is good for the novelty Greek dancing and a flame-blower but the food is only OK
The chicken was moist and flavorful with the skin on the stuffing wonderfully smoky and the pomme puree was smooth creamy and rich

The meat hasn't been as fresh flavorful or juicy as before
The restaurant Pinon Grill has good food too
The orange chicken was decent with the sauce being very flavorful
The chicken chunks were a good size and of all the items this was the most appetizing
Ill probably never come here again because I'm not from Arizona but I do recommend this for a hip place to be it's got a great atmosphere and exceeded my non existant expectations of Asian food in Arizona
So far I've indulged in the bacon cheeseburger italian beef sandwich and the Chicago style hotdog as well as their fries
The chicken tortilla soup was also really good
They do a great job and their tea menu is very good with many different offerings the settings are lovely and the food is very good
I enjoyed the ham and asparagus one and the chicken salad was lovely
Plus we got complimentary apps and the dessert of our choice but even then the food was excellent

My fiancu00e9 had chicken and dumplings which she called very good
We frequent this place often and the service and food are excellent every time
I've never tried their pizzas but I can attest to their salads and sandwiches and entrees - the one that stands out the most is their Sashimi Tuna which was surprisingly filling the fat of the fish and avocado and not-surprisingly very full of flavor and my favorite ginger
Spinatos pizza and calzones are amazing
Their thin pizza is very thin and very good
Quality of the food authenticity of the dishes and excellent customer service are the factors that really make this place stand out for me
The food here isn't cheap so plan on spending a good chunk of change on your meal
It gets three stars because they still have a strong selection of organics cheeses locally grown meats baked goods etc
The good the service is very friendly and you get a good amount of food for the money
If you like eating good food in a disco with the beautiful plastic people who all look exactly the samethen this place is for you
I gave them a 3 star not because the food wasn't delicious but because the overall experience
The hummus was also really good and comes in a dish with a great presentation just wish the pitas weren't so hard
They have you in and out in under half hour and offer a delicious soup and spring roll while you wait for your meal
If you happen to go at dinner time try the chicken wing appetizer the sauce is super flavorful and delicious
Ok went kinda spur of the moment the place was packed a good sign as I had never eaten here before and it is literally walking distance from my home anyway had their special green beans as an appetitizer while waiting on the sushi and OMG they were an amazing treat I never knew green beans could be sooo delicious
We were just going to leave without trying anything but figured we had to atleast try the food it must have been amazing right
We told her our drink order and were about to tell her our food order but she cut us off and asked whether we were hotel guests or not
It offers all 4 points good food great price healthy choices and fast service
There are people living down here and we will come out and eat at restaurants that offer good food at good prices and stay open
Mike and I arrived just as they set up and with a little bit of everything on the bacon-wrapped dogs and glass bottles of Coca-Cola I was scarfing down the delicious mystery meat and considering having another even though it would be too much to digest and I'd be throwing up from the acid reflux
Not worth it-Pasta side is bland but sometimes I get it and mix it in with my salad yum-The mediterranean tuna left me too stinky for work hours-Orzo soup was bland-The turkey is just deli slices of processed meat not great compared to the chickenYou can specialize anything on their menu too and they will get it perfect
Friends enjoyed their steak and potatoes flatbread pizzas and shrimp appetizers
In addition to the great food their ambiance and  our company hosting our visit to AZ really made it so that we enjoyed ourselves
I'll definitely be returning it's been a long time since I've had some good Mexican food
Interesting food great quality elegant atmosphere and friendly service
The Beef Carpaccio served with field greens capers mustard aioli and fresh Parmesan cheese looks excellent as well
I had heard good reviews and could not wait to get my hands on some stew chicken
I decided that I was going to get the the jamaican patty with fish but after being slightly confused by the waitress I ended up ordering the chefs special appetizer
the flavor was bitter and it needed more fish
We got our food and they were not joking when they said the plate was hot
The food ambiance and good company made the night
They have sodas flavored teas juices milk and water and a soft serve machine with various toppings for dessert
We ate dinner at the hotel's Belvedere and while the service was not up to par the food was great
The fiance and I went there during the weekend and was very impressed with the quality of food
Not only does Palm Valley have a great course  my daughter plays and practices there with her high school golf team they have wonderful food and facilities for a wedding
The beer is always solid ask for the Bourbon-Barrel-Aged Kiltlifter never advertised offered rarely but incredibly worth it and the food is a cut above typical bar food
I really enjoyed  ModernSteak  We went as a group and mostly all had the Kobe Beef Hamburgers
We had a lot of appetizers too including onion strings just ok  shrimp cocktail fried shrimp fries and we actually ordered a Kobe Beef Hotdog as an appetizer as well
The place is great get a sunset reservation enjoy the bar food is good to excellent and bring your wallet
For SEVEN MONTHS I have been deprived of fan-worthy Chinese food
For Americanized Chinese food this place is freaking good
Like so many other places the chicken is tenderly excellent while it's breading is slightly too saturated missing the crispy oomph
I have to admit the quality of food here is better than your average berto's restaurant However the girl who works the drive-through during the late shift makes some of the strangest mistakes with the food
Each salad comes with a roll and butter each sandwich comes with chips and both come with two tasty cookies
The drinks are great the bartenders are hot and the don't miss out on the food
Fabulous signature drinks/cocktails good food and great times with friends
Maybe I'm being too harsh don't get me wrong I enjoy fusion dishes but when you put my fried rice next to my refried beans and call it good; we have problems
I was selfish and wanted to show them the best restaurant not in walking distance from the hotel and bussed them on the light rail to FEZ
Following it were a few moments of extreme gratitude for the delicious food and then a lot more silence as we devoured our meals without feeling like we were in a hurry any longer
The parking lot is EXTREMELY tiny but you can go through the drive thru to get fresh salads or delicious food that's not deep fried with oil and fats
25 minutes after ordering our appetizers we still have not seen our waiter or any sign of our food
Summary warm greeting excellent service adequate wine list good food
Some of these types of desserts can be intolerable sugar bombs; this one although sweet was worth the calories
It smelt amazing on the way home and made it there without turning to mush like some fast food joints
Last but not least good food that didn't make me feel like I was going to have a heart attack in my sleep Good luck Shorty's I'll be back again soon
Another star for comping us the foie gras course after I saw how beautiful/delicious it was and wished out loud that I'd just dropped the $15 to the chef - he was such a sneaky charmer about it too and the server was practically beaming when I gushed over how delicious the dish was
I prefer authentic ethnic food true to their origins and regional flavors not ethnic flavors mixed up with average American fast food ingredients stack high and made pretty as if it was some great inventions They are not and consequently the mish mash waters down the experience
In Glendale this place is very popular since there aren't many good choices of ethnic food so this is a good substitute for those who don't care about authenticity since they may not know it if they ate it
With all of the new Sushi places and good reviews on here I wish we wouldn't have wasted the time or money at Kabuki
It just took us close to two hours to eat at the bar and the food wasn't really that amazing
The food was actually ok but not good enough to return
Husband ordered the Chicken Curry which he liked and we enjoyed egg rolls
The food has been hot tastes fresh excellent presentation and absolutely delicious
Hubby and I each had the Shaken Beef lunch with egg roll appetizer and drinks it came out to $39
Everything was well worth the wait and the food was extra hot and tasted very FRESH
Of course the Y has downsides bad parking as others have mentioned awkward layout less-than-high-end showering facilities and sub-par food choices but it's well worth the money and my waistline wallet and attention span are all the better since joining
For those of you that make it a habit to eat good sushi I don't know if this place will satisfy you
It was a little to sweet pasta was good and the chicken had a lot of flavor
If you love spicy dishes full of flavor take a drive over and have a feast
I am writing this several weeks after my visit so i do not remember much specifics but the dry hot pot dishes were amazing
So far I have been there two times with some friends, and each time I went I felt like it was Thanksgiving all over again trying to fit just another delicious bite of food before heading home
4	I have to say I've never been served food by an Iron Chef before so my dinner at Scottsdale's Distrito was an absolute treat considering Iron Chef America talent Jose Garces prepared my delicious Mexican meal
At the bar there is a huge food truck stand-like marquee listing tasty drinks off the menu
The dish was huge-the appetizer could fill four people-and the mixture of toppings was great
We had to try a dessert so we opted for the big-enough-for-two El Fuerte $12 a flourless chocolate cake with spicy peanuts espresso ice cream and doused in hot caramel by your server
Eating at Distrito was such a fun experience both because of the engaging ambiance and the tasty food
I always get the same thing because its awesome Green chili burrito enchilada style with green sauce It is soo good but every time I get it the pork is pink not my favorite so finally when ordering I asked for the meat to be well done and explain why
I've been here 3 times so far each time food has been wonderful
Do NOT stop in for amazing food and superb service okay
Not only was the food absolutely delicious but the staff was extremely friendly and attentive
The chicken was u00fcber tender but not very flavorful or crispy
The fish and chips looked really good but again kind of flavorless
While most of the food I have had there is quite good after my experience today I will never order food from there again
The quesadilla is solid the hamburger is wonderful the grilled shrimp and smoked foods rock
A decent selection of raw feeding foods and a HUGE selection of quality kibbles
However what I have had of the mock meat is pretty crazy good
It was just sooo good melted in your mouth new flavors new ideas great lil spot with outdoor seating boos and good food
For an appetizer try the Hawaiian Ceviche--White fish like u have never had before or try the Poke- tuna avocado and macadamia nuts
We have tried the burgers fish sandwich steak tacos fish tacos tofu tacos grilled hapu breakfast wings jerk chicken several cocktails and its continually a quality experience
The first night I enjoyed the sea bass tacos which were filled with fresh fish avocado and lime
At past visits I've tried the seafood pasta pork chops and enchiladas all of which were very good I went out on a limb with the pork chops and although good I'm still not a fan in general
Service was good too; food came out in a timely fashion
Granted the food came out of the kitchen hot and a manager apologized for another table that came in after us for being served first apparently our order took an extra 15 minutes because of the fish which takes longer
Not worth it - I could fry my own chicken and it'd be damn good in less time
Fish on the other hand both the redfish cod and catfish were so friggin' good
The gravy makes the whole dish perfectly seasoned and addictive in flavor
Da Vang is an amazing Vietnamese dive with a friendly staff and wonderful food
Their rotisserie chicken is delicious and my favorite entree on their menu is their grilled bbq salmon which is cooked perfectly tender and melts in your mouth
The food here is amazing and there's such a wide variety including delicious tater tots even sweet potato tater tots and the mouth watering reuben that I had chosen
The bread meat and cheese had been heated and that really made this sandwich tasty
The good - I liked the pizza and the chicken was very tender and flavorful
All amazing - their meat is cooked to perfection
My impression is that La Bocca is more of a wine bar that serves appetizers and smaller/lite sandwiches salads and pizzas
Our group was in the mood for mexican food and I read the reviews on yelp and thought it was worth a try
All of the food was excellent and the managers really care about the service provided
Yeah the food is good and the atmosphere is loud and always hopping
I am not a bar food guy so there food is good but mostly not to my tastes
From Korean style frozen yogurt to cupcakes and now food trucks the people of LA know a good thing when they taste it
If you've heard of Zankou and its amazing Lebanese chicken and tangy fluffy garlic sauce you know exactly what I mean when I say it's ethereal
But things have changed; the quality of thier soups and pizza bread really has dropped considerably and the last time I went there I got food poisoning
We went for New Year's  dinner two years ago and though it was freezing out side the food was amazing
I had the chicken-fried steak only available on weekends which was as tasty as any I'd had in the Midwest/South
My partner had the fish sandwich which she says was just okay all in all it was cute trendy good beer selection but not impressive food
He sold the business and left back to Korea and the quality slipped a TV was put in on the wall and the food started to stink literally
The TV was now TWO TV's but the food was very good
The food was good; not mindblowing but decent
But I also ordered the curry goat because of other reviews  which was really good and also tasted the Jerk chicken it tasted more like a BBQ sauce I expected a little heat
Overall I enjoyed the food that I ordered I would try this place again and see if things changed and will probably call ahead of time to see if they have beef patties available
The table side prep was cool and the meat was delicious
Pluses- Recently this location has been getting busier which is a good sign- Food is better than Chilis- The new campaign to serve lunch quickly has suddenly made this a practical consideration for lunch that has to fit within one hour including driving time
My wife is half Thai and her Mom and Aunts used to sit around prepping cooking REAL ACTUAL Thai food and gossiping all day long so she knows the good stuff
The first time we went she loved it so much that the second time we went and got a TOGO order we brought home over $75 worth of food for her I and a 12 yo girl
Enjoy the tastiest most authentically prepared and flavored Thai food you'll likely have this side of Bangok served by friendly authentically prepared and flavored Thai folk in a very clean and ornately decorated authentically prepared and flavored environment
The sushi was fantastic in my opinion but then again I'm not some self important sushi snob so take that for what it's worth
They have a wonderful Tuesday special of 'hot meat LOL it's Mexican style beef made into either Nachos Tacos or Burros depending on the Tuesday
Myself and 2 others in my office will wait till 9 am to run down there to get 'hot meat' day
I wouldn't say their food is Zaggot's worthy but this is a great small deli that will get you a nice breakfast or lunch when you don't want to go spend 15+ else where in Scottsdale
The pizza was fabulous; as good as the best NYC pizza and I've had a LOT of that
I think the food was good as far as sushi goes
The chicken soft tacos are kinda bland but the quesadillas are pretty good
All of the food I tried was good and the prices were reasonable
My other friends ordered the arcadia salad and a chicken salad; they both enjoyed it
Although both desserts were very tasty if eaten without the creamy topping the cake in both was on the dry side
Here is the rundown of our mealRoasted Brussels Sprouts = excellentCaesar Salad = excellentMozzarella en Corrozza Crispy House Made Mozzarella Salad = excellentRoasted Corn Pizza = excellentPesto Pizza = excellentFunghi Pizza = excellentPepperoni Pizza = excellentI literally cannot say enough good things about the food here
The upside is the dessert really is really tasty
It seems a bit pushy to charge that much for food that is good but doesn't taste too much more decadent than what you can get at Tru  Foods
I will say that you get a lot of food for what you pay so this place is definitely good value in my opinion
My other coworker ordered the machaca burrito he said it was good and it was actually full of meat
I would take out-of-towners here to give them a hokey Arizona experience with no promises about the quality of the food
It really needed some good fresh pico de gallo to kinda crisp up the otherwise gummy meat
What a great night filled with good food and some fun new friends
I've been here for dinner twice and though food / service / ambiance is excellent - I'm not hip enough for it
The food was good and rice was done correctly
We ordered the samosa starter - cold in the middle coconut curry with crispy tofu - was soggy like it came out of a microwave flatbread pesto pizza - burnt around the edges and cold in the middle
The food Crabcakes were very large and tasty
I had a very very good tuna sandwich then noticed the pizza's on other tables and had to try it
It's good to know that there are some people who can still provide great customer service in the fast food industry
When the pizza came it was hot and looked great
It's good food priced reasonably with healthy options Mi piace l'insalata di mare
I  had three big kids with me and none of them were able to finish their food  but said  it was tasty and they were stuffing themselves to try to eat it all
All three were delicious hit the spot and were the perfect amount of food for under $5 to tide me over
The bacon that accompanied this dish was very good and you only get two slices
My girlfriend got the meat lovers scramble and considering the name of the restaurant we figured this breakfast would be a sure shot
The scramble was skimpy dry bland light on the meat and came with the same rosemary potatoes and hard cold toast
This Grimaldi's is A~OK if your in the area looking for good pizza
The cafe has some good food options and the prices are fair
The food is delicious and he always accommodates special requests like grilled onions on the Gyro or when I just want a piece of Salmon on a Greek Salad which is not on the menu but one of my regular orders
From the moment i stepped in  the who restaurant smelled like good food
If you are with a group I recommend you start with the meat and cheese platter
I tend to slather anything I get in salsa to raise the spice level the chicken tinga in a burrito does not require it at all by the end of this huge burrito I was starting to feel sweat droplets forming but I couldn't pull away from how delicious it was
I buy filet mignon from here too and I have to say that their meats have always been fresh good quality meat - at prices lower than other wholesale markets that we shop
Heres why Freshest fishUnassuming genuinely nice chefs and staffamazing priceshuge selectionfast
We had a fantastic server Cody who brought us out an order of Angry Prawns as he said the food was taking a while we didn't think so but we were happy to try out another appetizer
While the pizza wasn't the best pizza in the world it was good and like I said for the price you can't beat that
I didn't taste it so I can't comment on that but I was told that it was pretty good but didn't contain much meat
the competition is concerned or they think their food is much more delicious than I do
I started off w/ an order of kampachi sushi per one of the recommendations of the Japanese sushi chef
Prices are good especially when you start to notice how Whole Foods has been burned a hole right through your wallet and then some
You paying double price here or probably worse quality of food and service
The food didn't take very long to come out and it looked wonderful
The chicken was quite good but a tiny bit dry
You have the best drinks ok I've only tried one type of drink wonderful food ok ok
It's a grilled chicken breast smothered in hot wing sauce blue cheese dressing and sauteed celery similar to pickles
The dish came with a decent sized fillet of grilled sea bass grilled broccolini spears and some surprisingly tasty fried rice
Again we were disappointed in this dish as the chops were fatty and not of the same quality as the 'old' Eddie
I'm a purist in that regard kind of like when I see somebody using a knife/fork to eat a slice of pizza - cringeworthy
When your menu is 30 pages long okay I tend to exaggerate and filled with Italian Asian Mexican American and so on food choices you just start to wonder just how good the food's going to be
The quality of the food is always average to above average
I usually order the same thing  Meat and Eggs which all consists of the following    * 2 Strips of maple smoked bacon    * 2 eggs prepared to order    * A pile of potatoes    * 2 buttermilk pancakes    * One cup of EPIC coffeeThe bacon is very good
Two guys next to me got the fish and chips and they said they were good
I really like the meats peppers cheese and bread but prefer my hot/warm sandwiches do not have any lettuce or tomatoes on it
Other items I had a bite of the MAC burger had quality meat but was over cooked
The menu has been the same for as long as I can remember but the food is always good
chef was wonderful the food was delicious and fresh and a solid four stars
The chicken soup is flavorful and the portion size is significant served with a couple of handmade tortillas
+Good FoodNice AtmosphereCool Schwag On WallsProximity To My Place-Single Diner Faux Pas
And the food wasn't flavorful in the least bit
The food was tasty - I enjoyed the pace of entrees and would definitely go back
I've been in more times than I can count and aside form slow service once or twice I've always been extremely pleased with the ambiance service food quality and overall experience
Big in portion huge in flavor and in my opinion the most well executed dish of the afternoon I figured going into it that the cod would be excellent and as good as it was the biggest shocker of the dish was perfect execution of the polenta - toothsome dense and a veritable sponge for both the tomatoes and the briny fish
With almost half of our table having never eaten tripe and another not really a fan of the dish I figured I'd be doing most of the legwork on this dish and although everyone took a taste my suspicions fortuitously proved correct - an acquired taste for sure this was really good
Also straight from the chilled case these traditional baba were everything one could hope from the classic dish - a buttery ball of pastry drown in rum; a sledgehammer of flavor up front with a buttery sweet finish; at one bite each I'm pretty sure I'd have been tipsy with a half dozen
A stark textural juxtaposition to the baba which was soft throughout I personally enjoyed these a lot though having sat for a while the honey had begun to harden which made them a bit difficult to extract from the small dish
Quite simply a focaccia base with fresh grapes placed at the center prior to baking thus allowing the juices to infuse the dough as it cooked this was sweet light and full of flavor - the sort of dish that would be easy to whip up for a party and equally easy to dress up in any number of variations
All that cheese counteracts any good the cauliflower would give your body; but my reasoning suggests the lack of pasta makes this dish an awesome healthier alternative to the old comfort food staple
Now most wine bars have wine and no or barely  any food - this place is an exception - Great Lunch and Dinner menu - an excellent  happy hour appetizer menu as well - love the individual pizza's
That is because of the amazing serendipity that landed my new condo not 30 yards away from a restaurant with superb food quaint atmosphere friendly servers orgasmic desserts and for the cherry on top BYO motha f***in' B
The portions are pretty big the food is tasty and the menu has a lot of stuff in it
Disclaimer This rating is exclusively based on a very brief experience at Hot Pot none of it food related
The sandwich was pretty good but the corned beef was divine
When a restaurant has a menu as limited as Honey Bears' they darn well better do a good job on each dish
The menu has appetizers burgers pizza quesadillas chicken tenders - it's similar to food at Chilis
I had a chicken quesadilla which was delicious
I didn't have coffee but I did have a chicken salad with mandarin oranges and pecans that was delish and almost too much for me to eat at one time and on the recommendation of the staff a coconut and lime Italian soda which was a brilliant and refreshing flavor
The contrast of flavors and textures of these two dishes was complex and only lent to the entire experience of the evening
The food was impeccable and all the attention to detail and care in explanation made it a night worth repeating
One of the few great experiences i had out there back in LA now was going to their Good yes capital G food places they were really really really Good
We also ordered the pork lab this was good chicken satay peanut sauce was bland and thin and cucumber salad did not have much flavor and yellow curry thumbs up
It is deff a small hole in the wall place but excellent service food and quick
Everything on the menu looked fantastic but I decided to be good and order trout with glazed carrots instead of pasta or fried fish with fries
Brat had decent flavor but I had a hard time finding it; the poor little thing was lost in the roll
The bread to meat ratio was about 3 to 1 and that does not make for a good sandwich
Chicken tikka marsala has just enough cream and spice to hit all my F spots you know like a G spot only F for flavor
I had the Bianco pizza which came recommended from the waiter
The food is consistent and pretty good
When the order arrived the pizza and stromboli were cold as if they had been in the car for an hour and 10 minutes
The meat didn't have a ton of flavor and I didn't even get a lot out of the cheese
We love the meatball dish as an appetizer
They also serve lunch but I recommend eating somewhere else and coming here only for dessert
Their food is okay they have the basic sandwiches salads and soups but it's their ice cream that is really good
The meatballs are supposed to be fabulous and I'm sure they are when they're hot
The flavor of this pizza was quite nice what it failed on was presentation
With all that being said I enjoyed the taste and all but I think if they focus a little more on execution the pizza would be a lot more solid
The chicken was heavily sauced haven't we all been once or twice and flavored strongly with garlic haven't we all been once or twice
1 Beef taco - fantastic the taco shell was fresh and the beef was delicious2 Red beef tamale - the biggest tamale I have ever seen
Maybe too big as the beef flavor was lost3 Bean burrito - fairly plain beans and some cheese in a tortilla no sauce or anything
Salmon Sushi - Mom and Dad said this was good
Las Vegas Roll - Made with eel but very good
The food is just as good here if not better than all of the other Dillion's locations
The main dish was SO good but the veggies that came with it were also delicious
The chicken inside was white meat and it was tender and flavorful-the deep fried tortilla was crisp on the outside and somewhat softer on the inside
When I want to pack on the pounds and feast on good ole meat and potato's this is on top of my list
The rolls are excellent the selection is great yes you can pound down fresh salad and fruit if you are on a diet
I wasn't too crazy about the chicken the beef was pretty tender and tasty
My dad enjoyed his Atkins version of the BBQ beef but he loved the mahi mahi mini plate he had on our second visit to L & L
I went for the first tme recently and the food was excellent
I waited and waited for this place to open hoping for a good fast food Mexican restaurant
Anything is good on the menu ReallyMango Sticky Rice - A+++ Creamy sweet but not too sweet with tangy mangoLemon Fish - A Light bright and flavorfulPad Thai Best I have ever had was hereI am going to stop writing since I am slowly entering a food coma
The pizza was of course delicious and I want to thank Grimaldi's for doing the right thing to keep a customer happy
I've over-indulged on several of their delicious sushi rolls
We asked our concierge to recommend a place we could go that had pretty good food didn't have to get too dressed up but still had an interesting atmosphere
That's a pretty darn good deal for the amount of meat and with sides
The foodI have been three times and can say it is an easy place to recommend to others
My wife tried the beef tacos also delicious
The bottom lineGreat environment if a bit out there good value great food
The food was wonderful and very multi-dimensional
At first I was not sure what to expect from a Swedish bistro in Tempe but I could not resist the temptation to give it a shot
A perfect balance of very fresh crisp Swedish style vegetables with really tasty pieces of chicken and a hint of the South West bringing back memories from Sweden and guaranteeing my return for more during my next visit to the Tempe area
This is a no brainer when looking for great value for money in combination with excellent food
But I recommend the rolled tacos if it's going to be your first time here
Next came refreshing Chicken Lettuce Wraps 4 large crunchy iceberg lettuce leaves with a side of plum sauce and a plate of the delicious chicken and vegetable filling
Next came the Firecracker Shrimp that couldn't match up to the fabulous flavor and heat of the Kung Pao dish
The roasted red peppers in the chicken salad were a nice addition but it wasn't good chicken salad still unfortunately
I didn't even take any leftovers the food was so bad and husband decided his leftovers weren't worth keeping either and threw them away before we left
Their specials include $3 draft pints $4 Three Olives Vodka cocktails and great food specials I recommend the big cheese crisp for only $4
They apologized and referred me to another Pizza Hut location in Gilbert which I think is excellent customer service
David Charns the owner is friendly and conscious of quality food
Super casual atmosphere good food served up quick with a little smak makes this place fetching
I am getting nostalgic here so let me close with these couple of important details  1 The wine selection was small but the wines were good and 2 the cheese/cracker/olive food pairings were quite good
Their prime rib is absolutely delicious and second favourite of mine is the rotisserie chicken - especially with their barbecue sauce
Varied menu giant portions reasonable price consistently excellent service giant tables available they're usually spacious as hell inside lunchtime portions and the biggest desserts I've ever seen in my life
Meal highlights Prime Rib Nachos one serving is enough for FOUR people Rotisserie Chicken and possibly the most delicious appetizer on the planet Cheese Potatocakes
The food on both occasions was great I haven't had a good cut of meat like it since I left the midwest
I bought a steak here good ground beef looked good but that Grey meat was in the middle and a French Silk pie out of this world GREAT
Their food is pretty good but they have changed the menu so now I must review again after trying this place again to see if the changes make a difference
Food was good but service was less than stellar
's glowing review of the water boiled fish I decided to go with that with an additional appetizer of pork dumplings in chili oil
Steaming hot chock full of spicy kick from fresh szechuan peppercorns - I had to quickly adapt to the formidable power of this food or risk perishing in the wide open space that serves it
The KING SAMAny Pizza with these Toppings-Pesto-Chicken-Garlic-Onion-Jalepeno** if you like hot pizza put a dash of Tabasco on it for the final touch
And Grimaldi's -- Keep up the good work our company Sitevoice across Market Street are all big fans of the good food you produce time and time again
Banana Leaf has nice nice selection of various Asian cuisines so you can mix and match we had hot & sour soup Pad Thai Szechuan Chicken so a nice combo of flavors
anyhow Great vegetarian choices for people who eat there veggies but trust me I am a MEAT eater  Chicekn Tika masala Little dry but still good
I am probably a horrible person to give my opinion on what good Chinese food is so I'll offer up my take on the service and ambiance of the place without pretending to know what I'm talking about in regards to how the food tasted
They have a great selection of Margaritas amazing Chicken Tortilla Soup and of course a great selection of grilled entru00e9es
From the retro 60's farm decor to the reuse of the old farm buildings to the top-notch food Joe's is worth a trip from any part of town
I grew up in California and didn't think I'd find good Mexican food again after leaving
Oh right the food - I didn't think it was all that good
I just wish I would have enjoyed the food a little more
Honest to goodness the best chinese food I've ever had was at a tiny family owned restaurant on the island of Santorini in Greece maybe it had something to do with being so over Greek food by the second week of my trip but ever since then I've been on a seach for a non-chain restaurant in the states that compares
I ordered the Garlic Chicken just as good as any I've had at any other chinese restaurant the egg drop soup was also good it had corn it which was a little weird but still good
My husband ordered the Gang Pang chicken which was spicy and very good
I love the Machaca burritos and the breakfast burritos are to die for and at $3 a pop you can't beat it Bottom line I highly recommend checking out Carolina's for some good Mexican food
Will this be the only place I go to for yummy chicken fingers and delicious sauce
I have nothing to complain about the food quality since food quality here was always great
We would like to prove to you the quality of our food
The tots are AMAZING but when I complained to Tracy that they must have been cooked in the same oil as the fish he did not hesitate one second to offer us a second dish of sweet potato tots on the house
Tiny's is good ol' home cooked style food
Located in a strip of stores and restaurants behind a service station and sharing a lot with an Oregano's several Asian restaurants Korean Chinese Vietnamese sushi and a small Asian market I was impressed by the business housed here
With all the good food they serve waiting in line for 50 minutes was nothing We've tried all the different locations and have never been disappointed
The cook tended a slew of delicious marinated chicken on the grill and sat humming cheerfully as they browned
I'm a huge fan of the buffalo sweetbreads - chicken wing-style with Frank's Red Hot-based sauce served with celery and blue cheese dressing
If you love chicken wings and have never had sweetbreads I highly recommend this dish
All of the items on the happy hour menu are very reasonably priced so you can get some good food and drinks
I loved everything except for two little things, an anise flavored gel that was part of the soft-shell crab dish and the bacon in the polenta dessert
I love me some Green- but most of that place is vegan junk food and not so healthy albeit delicious
3 kung pao chicken this was spicy with bold flavors but had a very americanized taste to it
Although there weren't many people here I came during winter break the food was very good
The food is always delicious the drinks are always delightful the service has never failed to be friendly and inviting and the restaurant is always clean
The last meal we enjoyed consisted of a chicken avocado sandwich and the voodoo tuna
A while back I had a friend visiting and we were talking about things that he wanted to do and he mentioned that the last time he was in Arizona he went o this really good pizza place
The only reason this place got 4 stars was because even though the steak is awesome most of the time from time to time it's kinda tough - it could be that much better if the meat was a little bit better quality
Also - the chicken is always dry and lacks flavor
While the quality of the food seems a bit better the portion was MUCH smaller no leftovers
But the food is good especially when considering the price
The jade chicken is a good safe pick for first timers but i think the jerk chicken is the best however it has some kick
I don't like it when places look like subway inside if I am on a date no matter how good the food
But the rare gems of places with good food and a date atmosphere that isn't so trendy that I will be wasting an hour sitting are where I want to go with my girl for dinner
Service 5/5 I don't recall ever waiting for a check or a drink for too long and even when the occasional mix up happens they remedy it promptlyPricing I would really expect to pay more for food this good
Melissa got the teriyaki chicken and I nibbled a little off of it it was good
If there's anything to be said about Jersey Mike's it's that the food is always fresh delicious and just the right amount
Whatever you end up getting - turkey ham salami definitely try the prosciutto; the meat is light fresh tasty and doesn't leave that heavy feeling in the pit of your stomach
Picture thisTake a delicious chicken sandwich from your favorite joint
Perfect date place or for an after dinner cocktail to seal the deal ; can't wait for winter to truly enjoy the patio and I still need to try the food it looks amazing
My wife ordered the 'Deputy' Prime Rib which was the most un-flavorful piece of meat she recalls having and the au-jus being just warmed beef broth void of flavor
Keema Matar lamburger Goat Curry & of course the obligatory Chicken Tikki Masala & Tandoori Chicken finishing up with Mango Custard & piping hot tasty Indian Tea help yourself & no extra charge
And it's no surprise why; great food good ambiance and attentive service
my first experience with them was a cold deli meat platter that was catered to my work for a Friday lunch
As far as hotel food goes this place was pretty boss
I'm convinced the only reason this place gets good reviews is that people are too embarrassed to give it an honest review after they just waited 3 hrs for a crappy pizza
Coming from New York and Connecticut where the best pizza spots are Patsy's in NY Pepi's in CT I'm here to tell you that this place is not worth trying no matter what people try to tell you or what you read
Overall I would say the food was good the service was great and the experience was what made the meal
Whether it's late night or delivery you're going to get delicious pizza crispy but not floppy crust and a mouthful of gooey cheese that sits well is flavorful and doesn't drip
The first time we went to Over Easy the food was wonderful and we couldn't wait to go back
My friend had the beef with the citrus sauce and enjoyed hers as well
The place is so pretty and cozy the food so delicious and the staff so professional and friendly it's a guarantee you'll want to go back
While not a stunning polished restaurant by any stretch of the imagination Khai Hoan is an impeccably clean little family place cooking simple good food in a strip mall on Apache Blvd
I enjoyed the usual Vietnamese favorites of spring rolls and pho
While the grilled pork on broken rice was nicely flavored the meat was a touch on the dry side
We are not usually big on the fancy-smancy food of more upscale restaurants but we were both pleasantly surprised by the quality and flavor of the food
Kind of like ESPN Cafe meets Hard Rock Cafe you've got a great combination that offers quality American bar-style food with an energetic atmosphere
Some of my personal favorite named food on the menuThe Big Unit Hot Dog Ryne Sandburger Amazing Grace Burger and my personal favorite on the menu - Tommy's Cali Burger
Our food was not hot my hashbrowns were not fresh and my husbands potatoes were cold too
The bread is quite good and so are the desserts
I really enjoyed the bacon covered shrimp and I loved the buttermilk chicken with asparagus
Anyways so my guess is that Pita Paradise will probably always be a little busy but the food is good so check it out
I've also had the eel dish and the eel is a good portion size with steamed vegetables
Compared to other fast-food Japanese there are other places I would frequent more but if I'm in the area it's a good choice for quick Asian food
So let's be honest Little Caesars is not the best pizza in the world but who would expect that of a $5 Hot n Ready pizza
The only real complaint I have with this Little Caesars location is that I have been here twice to pick up a Hot n Ready sausage and cheese pizza and both times there were no sausage and cheese pizzas Hot n Ready
The pizza is of good quality for $5 but it would be nice if it were actually ready when we went to get it
Jason the manager strolled over to the bar with a fresh plate of assorted appetizers pizza as most people would call it with his cheap suit jacket and an earpiece
The food is always good and cheap with the slices being huge
Service has been very good so far and  myself and my guests have enjoyed the food very much
Scale of 1-10 multiple visits10 Food10 Service8 Atmosphere8 ValueNumerous times since Verde shut its doors have I sat eyes glazed over longing absent mindedly for a good horchata
Did not really get to much because I  was not that hungry but will say this about the place it was clean the staff was friendly and knowledgeable and the bits and pieces I did try from picking at my friends food was good
The pizza is as good as I have had here in the valley and if you go on a weeknight there is no wait and the service is so fast and friendly there is not one thing to complain about
We have eaten here before and the food is always really good
The fish was cooked perfectly the bun fresh and the garlic fries are amazing smothered in fresh garlic and parsley
great food solid value excellent service and nice atmosphere
Is it because I work in a full service restaurant and can eat wonderful food anytime I want
The beef was so tender and the flavors so rich
The mozzarella was over abundant and flavorless the tomatoes were mealy underripe and were decidedly not Romas likely Beefsteak or Mountain Pride
However it should be noted that I ate at the Pinetop location last year and both the food and the ambiance were excellent
5Didnt even know about this place but had to pick up a pizza at Pizza Hut next door on a holiday since my work address doesnt have a manned lobby for the deilvery guy to deliver Anyways Tried the PICADO Gyrothe Breading was really good didnt break apart like other placesThe meat a whole lotta meat too was consitantly seasoned and the fixins were not overpowering
I can't say enough good things about our experience -- the food the ambiance the service -- everything was five star
The wings were good size and had a good amount of meat
Overall the food was good and I would order pizza and salad from here again
Quality not so great my hash browns were burnt more like hash blacks and the rest of the food too greasy
I had eaten a short time before arriving here and wished I had waited to try some of the flavorful dishes in the cafeteria or outside where 1/2 chickens were grilling
Takes time to season the pit with lots of good wood and smoke from the meat to produce the right flavor
The restaurant is average in food but I enjoyed it
Our food came out quickly as we ordered and hot
It was creamy flavorful and had just the right amount of cheese chicken and avocado
My husband had their goat cheese and chicken phyllo pockets and enjoyed them
Really amazing little tacos perfectly cooked meat and great toppings
_MG had the Corned Beef Hash breakfast again familiarly salty and delicious with the fluffy Simply Bread Wheat toast and half a plates worth of hashbrowns I ate the egg whites
organic chicken tasty & with spaetzel i
My fiance got the chicken schnitzel and it was pretty good
The wait staff are pretty busy but the food is worth the wait
The butter was cold which brings the temperature of the food down
After reading some good reviews my hubby and I were anxious to try this place boasting wood fired artisan type pizza
Definitely worth a try if you enjoy mexican food
The service was also good but the food just didn't hold up
The dessert was amazing a fresh baked deep dish macadamia nut cookie with banana caramel ice cream
You haven't had it this good since you had medium pizzas for regular price four bucks four bucks four bucks
We ordered the dishes 4 and 5 on the 1-5 hot scale
We've repeatedly ordered variations of the same dishes but they've been solid and we've enjoyed them
So normally I like this place and the corned beef and cabbage have been quite good
Sadly there are few places in phoenix that claim to be 'irish' that serve authentic quality irish food
If you are looking for great food and a fun atmosphere I definitely recommend this place
I have visited this location many times and although I have always ordered the same thing Jambalaya I have a great dining experience each time as the food is always excellent and the service is terrific
The food items are little more pricey but well worth it
The thalis combo platters are affordable not sure how the meat version is but the veggie option is a good start if you miss the lunch buffet and are at a loss after going to so many single-option vegetarian restaurants it's quite easy to forget how to order
I would most definitely recommend this place -- just be prepared if you order your food medium and up
The food was delicious but my dining companions have determined they prefer Greek middle eastern food which this was not
The meats are marinated in a tasty sauce that doesn't overpower the meat
I've never been impressed with the service here at all either - they're often assholes unless you're getting food and sitting down - then they're just fine
The best part was the steak though it was more a chopped beef than a shredded which I personally prefer but the right-off-the-char grilled flavor was intense and very savory
My coworkers got their dishes mild and hot
Bistros offer fares with decent prices a prix fixe menu and simply good simple food
I've been here twice now and must say there is some good food coming out of their kitchen
Definitely on my list of places to hit for good food on my next Tempe visit
They have amazing pizza that does not taste like a piece of hot cardboard with tomato past and a sad excuse for cheese
Recommendation To anyone living in tempe and enjoys a REAL pizza
They have an excellent website which can make it easy to find some food to your liking while here
My madre got the Margarita chicken tacos that were good but really dry
their caprese spek and pulled pork sandwiches are among my faves served with a nice lightly dressed house salad or fresh fruit yogurt and crunchy granola - skip the chips because they're just store bought in a bag and if you are lucky enough to go on a day when they have their meatball sandwich special don't even hesitate - it's so delicious
All in all Corbin's is a good addition to that area with a nice bar and some decent bar type food
The noodles were tasty and I preferred the saltier pork over the sweet beef
If only the noodle dish I ordered at China Magic the next day was as tasty as this one was
Among inexpensive pizza delivery places I think this particular Domino's is pretty damn good
Chicken was tasty but a tad on the dry side
With a large outdoor patio a beautiful atmosphere and DELICIOUS food this gem is definitely worth paying for parking
Excellent drinks food service was quick and with a smile
Good job to Ticoz and their delicious drinks and food
unfortunately the quality of the food does not seem to have transferred perfectly
the dishes are tasty but they lack something really delightful
Raspberry Cream - not too sweet lovely little cup on the side - oh the love I have and yet the hate of my thighs - not that it matters on Vacation - but even if you don't have French Toast - ask for some for your pancakes or to add to one of the gooey goodness of cinnamon rolls on the buffett
Not where you want to head for lunch or dinner if you're looking for flavor or substantive food of any kind
I must confess that I ate a piece of his pizza and the crust was delicious
The bacon wrapped scallops were awesome the chicken wings excellent with a little kick the batter idami yummy
What an art form these folks were moving but at no time was there a hiccup and the food that passed by us from the kitchen area was also amazing
Beef taco is straight up yummy and on the greasy side good amount of beef and cheese
Him's orange chicken and sweet and sour pork are good when fresh otherwise they get dried out
Overall the food is not good but it's usually ok and it's cheap and I'll eat here when I'm in the mood
I had some really really good Vietnamese food in this nondescript restaurant in the mini shopping strip at the northwest corner of Camelback and 17th Av
But I'll definitely be back again and again because the food is so darn good and so inexpensive
The chicken was good not overly salty like what I'm used to
My husband had a more classic dish and it was just as good as mine
Plus the food is pretty wonderful and with a great happy hour you can't go wrong here
The food is simple homemade and delicious
You just can't find many places these days that serve up homemade food that's almost as good as Mom's
I typically like to stay away from chain restaurants but the mister and I were looking for a cheap place and served good food
Hummus has been there lately there's a guy with good fresh bread need to try some of the meat/fish vendors
My friends have recommended this place several times and I turned them down because I didn't realize that it is a sit down restaurant with food other than pitas
I ordered seafood linguini and it was really good
Rolls were pretty good - they had a large selection and for some reason many of them had macadamia nuts in them
I was pleasantly surprised with finding Sushi Eye so I'd definitely recommend another visit if you're ever visiting Tempe
Her sea bass had this silky texture almost like tofu and the light sauce provided just the right amount of flavoring for the fish
I went here last night with list in hand intent on doing my whole weeks worth of shopping here I generally shop Target for non perishables and household items & Sprouts for all produce meats things like that The hubs and I are starting a 7 Day Detox diet and I needed to buy mass amounts of organic products I knew TJ's would be the place for this so off I went
Had an excellent pizza here - the Kosmic Karma which has sun-dried tomatoes spinach roma tomatoesand pesto in addition to the red sauce and we added meatballs to it
We sat in the bar area and had excellent service but our server did alert us to the fact that the pizzas take about 20 minutes to get to you
The pizza had a lot of topping options and were all delicious
Their prices are good compared to other Scottsdale restaurants  but I would rather pay a few bucks more a plate and get really really good food
My phone died before I could take a photo of the menu as I sometimes do to remember the name of the dish
After eating the delectable egg rolls and being extremely impressed the large bowl of soup arrived and emitted such a putrid smell I didn't know if it was from the person serving it or the dish itself
I'm trying to talk myself into giving them three stars because those egg rolls were so good but the more I remember sitting there being purposely ignored the more I acknowledge how impolite and unprofessional that was so I'm going to make it two stars
I ordered the chicken strips and fries and I enjoyed every bite
The food took a long time to arrive and when it did it was a disappointment the lamb curry was OK at best but the chicken tika was dry and flavorless so I sent it back and they did remove it from the check
The can highly recommend the Shellfish Sampler and 1988 Martini from Roy's and the pizzas and Berry Thyme drink from Tuscany
There's also good sushi at the Vista Lounge
Was told the food trumped that of Hooters not hard to do I have only had the California burger and though it was good I have definitely had better
It's been nice to have them close by but it's just not worth it anymore to suffer through less than delicious pizza
People seated after us were receiving their food and we had not received our appetizer
I think the food is pretty good really I think the bagels are probably the stars
The food is pretty good but you pay too much for what you get in almost every case
I do go there every now and then and it's a good place for a beer with a few friends but I avoid it when it's busy and I usually don't get food
I enjoyed some beers on tap but wanted to try some food so we ordered the Copper Blues Burger
I think those 'IA' people are a fairly large breedThe sauce slightly sweet the meat filling features raisins for added flavor
The food is pretty good -- I've had their chicken sandwich and salad
Well anyway this burger was pretty freagin good and I highly recommend it as a fast food option
The 12 thin crust pizza are good but I like to see more toppings on some of them
The good - service is awesome even for fast causal- food is fresh & made from scratchThe bad - dinner is quiet here think they need to start a happy hour or somethingSecret salad sounds delicious
Nothing to complain about the amount of food served was beyond plenty and the flavor did not leave you anything other than wanting another bite
The burgers are unpretentious and have no real gimmicks  you order a burger and it shows up and it's just an honest delicious  burger  not too much salt or seasoning so you can taste the meat the lettuce the onion for exactly what they are - PERFECT
The food was excellent and our entire party enjoyed their meals as well
maybe if I wasn't from Louisiana & had never had good catfish I might have enjoyed it but my standards are high and unfortunately Lolo's did not deliver
the chicken must be really good because there's nothing about this place that would make me want to return
I recommend their cheese and meat small plates perfect to share and compliment each other well
I was super excited that they had beef patties but was a little disappointed that they weren't the standard beef patty I'm used to getting from Jamaica/Florida but they were good and flavorful nonetheless
The food here is good but it is too expensive for what it is
The food is really good sometimes over-sauced or overcooked - you get the idea but it is not really really great - and it darn well better be if I am paying that much
The Cornish Pasty Company has dozens of tasty options with my favorites being The Porky Bangers and Mash and Chicken Pot Pie
I had the Fish Taco Gobernador and it was very good especially with the guacamole
Wasn't impressed with any of their starters but I liked their main dishes
They are a fast food Mexican joint but I enjoyed my meal
For a quick bite to eat it's a good place to go for Speedy Gonzales Mexican food
Both sandwiches were delicious though I think the salami sandwich edged the roast beef out by a hair because it came on a ciabatta roll and had goat cheese on it
The goat cheese and roasted pepper salad was good but the Thai peanut chicken salad was PHENOMENAL
The brand of wheat meat that they use actually had good flavor and an unusually normal texture
The food is certainly worthwhile though and I think this may become one of my regular take out spots for lunch
Yeah maybe I have made some interesting choices that weren't for me but even then I could taste the flavors and freshness in every dish
I recently attended a banquet at the Golden Buddah and I was shocked at the level of quality of food and service
There was a crab claw appetizer most chinese restaurants prepare this dish by taking a crab claw surrounding it with ground shrimp batter and then deep fry
It wasn't all bad there was a crispy chicken with garlic dish that was pretty good but out of 10 dishes 4 were bad 5 were okay and 1 was good
The soup appetizer and first entree arrived timely but after that there was a 1 hour gap before we received the next dish
For the prime cuts of beef that they were said to be these didn't come close to what you'd expect for a top quality steak house
It's definitely not the cheapest bar food you can get but for the quality you get you're not breaking the bank
I tried several cookies for dessert and all were good
Okay let's get it straight hereThis is                       Denny'sThey serve                Denny's foodThey're open            24 hoursYour expectations   moderately low but you still expect some quality                                     to the food and service
No dessert and no appetizer although they give you these small tasteless bread sticks in a package gratis to snack on while waiting
The ambiance and service was great but the food was amazing
All the prices really seem amped up a notch compared to the actual quality of the food/drink you're getting; I suppose you pay for the atmosphere
my chicken ones were so awesome I wish I would have gotten more I had a try of the others which were pork and beef and they were equally amazing
next time we know where they are we are sooooo going back Id highly recommend finding them and getting yummy good awesome food
I haven't tried much of the food but the wings were good and that is typically a good barometer for me with sports bars
The meat and veggies are extremely fresh and tasty
The good thing is that they don't just serve pizza and wings
I only go there when I'm craving some grease so that tells you the quality of the food
We also had a lamb sandwich with an amazing feta tzatziki sauce on it- oh yes and for our 3rd dish there were 2 of us and 3 dishes was plenty- we had cous cous with McClendon's carrots
This review is mainly for the excellent beef jerky
I purchased the smoked beef and hot jalapeno sticks which are delicious
But all in all the food is good enough to repeatedly visit for the items I know they do well
As far as food is concerned I am absolutely addicted to the lettuce wraps tofu easily substituted and the classic yellow curry but the SaBai Fried Rice and the eggplant dish are delicious as well
In additional to the great atmosphere delicious high-quality food great drink prices outstanding happy hour warm and attentive service they also have GREAT hours especially for an Asian restaurant
Food was cold and tasteless even after being sent back the first time
The burger was served on a very nice bun but the meat that was on it was by all accounts flavorless
I love seafood eaten seafood all over the world from Vietnam France Italy Baja California and many more and this is good food especially landlocked and for the price
*eye roll*I had the rainbow roll and the dumplings they were good decent
Pizza is good made fresh and tasted like it
Ground beef tacos usually remind me of Toxic Bell but this one had very flavorful but not overspiced meat and a homemade shell
The food is great dope appetizers  rockin' burgers decent pizza and daily specials
They have only a few tables so I wouldn't recommend this as a sit down pizza joint unless things are slow--they fill up very quickly
It has a sourdoughish flavor to it and it complements the flavors of each dish in ways that most breads don't
The spinach salad was huge colorful and plentiful with chicken goat cheese pecans and a tasty vinaigrette dressing
The peanut chicken is great as is the pad thai doesn't taste like normal pad thai but it's good chicken tofu and shrimp with lots of peanuts
We both really enjoyed the scallion broth that both dishes are served with
I was craving some real Mexican food and from reading the reviews on Yelp and also the recommendations of the person sitting next to me on the flight down here I called for directions while waiting for my luggage and my sister and I went there for lunch
I don't know what constitutes good Mexican food in Phoenix but I wished we had gone to Taco Bell instead
I'm giving CM's two stars because despite the fact that the beer was decent and the food mostly tasty I was so immensely turned off when I had to listen to the we really don't do separate checks speech from our server
As far as chain fish joints in Phoenix go this is not nearly as good as say
I will call this next paragraph DeliciousSo I've described the excellent vibe but now let me move on to the coffee and food which is just as if not more important
The appetizers are cheap and plentiful and the drink specials really roll around to some good stuff
The food was served cold might have been better had it been warm
My friends both ordered beef gyros and loved how flavorful they were
Everyone in my party enjoyed the food too
I've been here twice and although the food and prices were good employee discount I've had two very opposite experiences in terms of the customer service
In summary the food is pretty good the prices are great average without the employee discount the food comes out pretty quick and the customer service is definitely very YMMV
It's one of those cheers-esque places where everybody knows your name  I will be a life-long customer because this place really knows how to do good fresh food
The chairs and tables are cheap but the food is really good
It's a good thing too because there's a sign just inside the door boldly proclaiming that some website poll rated them best in town in about 11 different categories like pizza Italian worth the wait and such so the bar had been set pretty high
Oh and on top of that I thought getting a slice of delicious Costco pizza would help after such a crap experience but alas I was wrong
the food was just okay for my tasting but their desserts are delicious
I've tried almost every single one of their sandwiches and although I have small tweaks for each one of them hold the mayo I despise tomatoes the chicken can be slightly chewy I really appreciate their overall comfort and deliciousness
I think overall Paradise Bakery is a delicious place to find fresh food maybe overpriced but the atmosphere is nice
They have wonderful service with friendly effective waiters and chefs fantastic food and very reasonable prices
Heard through friends that this is the place to go for good ol' Chicago food
He finally took our order with no apology for the wait but let me tell you the food was worth the wait
Another favorite are the beef roll appetizers
All the other dishes I've tried have been good although when you say spicy it doesn't really come out spicy
They have a really cool bar and desserts for two um yeah right for two that were amazing
While it's not the best Italian food in Scottsdale it serves up some wonderful meals at reasonable prices
The food tastes fresh the sauces are good but not overpowering to the dishes and the service is great
i really liked it the egg rolls are good love the mint leaves served with it and the dipping sauce
went back with my gf and son I had another noodle dish with rice noodles and beef a bit spicy just enough for flavor and the sauce was awesome
Dom liked the egg rolls and picked at the chicken he's a really good eater so I think it just wasnt his cup of tea
Flatbread invent your own pizzas were very good
I've enjoyed every bite of food I've tried off the Buzznbeez food truck
I also got a chance to sample the fried chicken and hot link BBQ combo and was enchanted with the spiciness of the batter that coated the chicken
The menu seems to shift quite a bit so I haven't gotten a sense of the entire repertoire of goodness offered by this sunny bright-yellow addition to Phoenix's food truck scene
I want to give them four stars since the food is so tasty but I've had some issues with their customer service so I withhold one star
Fortunately a Sonoran hot dog was mere steps away off of another food truck
I enjoyed my food with the exception of the mac-and-cheese which I found flaccid
I want to see them succeed and add to the fabulous panorama of flavor that is rapidly becoming a standard amongst the finer food trucks in the Phoenix metro area
The food was always good every time and they were always very friendly
The food was the same quality as take out of course but the service was phenomenal
We had Plum Wine and Oolong Tea but quickly realized we needed some cold water with the hotness of our food
I was so unimpressed by its unexciting flavors that I don't even recall what kind of roll I tried
Debating a second pasty as Hannah returned to check in on me The Pilgrim sounds quite good but subsequently turning my attention to the sweeter half of the menu I decided to not make the same mistake twice and inquiring as to which dessert she recommended I went with my gut and ordered two to arrive with a delay between them the first Shirley Temple's Pudding a $6 sticky toffee pudding served in a cast iron pot with a side of cru00e8me anglaise
Moving next to my second dessert and for my tastes the better of the two a goodly delay of fifteen minutes brought to the table Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding with vanilla ice cream - a truly unique spin on bread pudding made with what almost seemed to be cracker-thin pieces of bread juxtaposing a brandy tinged chocolate sauce and baked much like the sticky toffee pudding to be set at the edges yet dense and moist at the center
He really walks the walk and talks the talk and not because he's some up-and-coming kitchen punk with a sleeve of tattoos trying to become the next Food Network sensation but because he's really good at what he does
They're a few more bucks than a Filiberto's  but they take your order at the table and the food is served on a plate   good quality ingredients and plenty of it
I questioned myself if the food was really that good for how far I'd have to drive
Food so good and prices so cheap I wonder how they even stay in business
The rare beef brisket pho is amazing
I think the food quality may suffer a bit when the owner isn't working
We both loved the food I had one of their delicious sandwiches and the wife couldnt stop eating her savory crepe
I normally keep my dining and entertainment limited to downtown Phoenix and Scottsdale but this food was good enough to come back for
However their lavosh pizza with the kalamata olives is reallly good and their hummus ain't so bad either
Let me preface this review by saying I have only ever enjoyed Casey Moore's as a bar and have never had the food though I hear it is good
My wife and I are big fans of sushi but couldn't find a good place around
My wife proclaimed hallelujah at the surprisingly low calorie count; a food this rich and delicious must be bad for me but it's not
and the food yeah it's good if you want everything with chile oil sauce in it
The last two times we have been disappointed especially in the quality and preparation of the food
Phoenix is lacking in good Indian restaurants and that is compounded if you're in the mood for South Indian food
Chicken bowl is by far my favorite with great flavor and sauce compared to the Fan Boy and Shogun bowl which are a bit drier and just need a little something else though they are still delicious
The pot-stickers are great and the spring rolls are just good
The food could be a bit hotter when served
Moving on from the food the hours are good and their locations on campus are very accessible
I came here on a Tuesday and ordered the beef noodle soup it was good but the soup was lacking the complexity of flavors and the beef wasn't as tasty and tender as the ones we have in Taiwan
The dishes were excellent all were paired with homemade tortillas beans and white rice with vegetables
Usually the pizzas are very good and for sure are the best that Glendale has to offer
I note the pizza was still good but not special
They use flavorful quality natural ingredients yet still manage to crank out tasty food very quickly
Food was flavorless and my Mother and I tried a variety of foods here
I critique a restaurant onthe followingFood - taste presentation creativity and use of ingredientsService - level of sophistication of the sever knowledge of themenu and attention to my needsAtmosphere - quality of flatware stemware and overall ambiancePetite Maison delivered high quality gourmet delights thatwere succulent chic and innovative
This technique apparently traps the essence of fish better because you really taste the clean flavor of the mahi an experience rarely had because other chefs burry the fish in cream sauce
Food is good nothing to rave about but plentiful and just dont be in a hurry
I guess you can only get good fish tacos in Cali
This place is expensive but the outstanding quality of food and superior service make for a fine experience
Food Quality 2/5 barely averageFood Quantity 2/5 below average - not much fish in the rolls what I can easily call slivers of fish on top of rolls
Food Flavor 2/5 barely average nothing great
We eat sushi all the time and just wanted to get a feel for the quality of the sushi for future visits
We are realists when it comes to restaurants and expect quality ingredients a clean place responsive service and tasty food
Very fresh delicious and wholesome - you actually felt like you were eating food that was also good for you
Good atmosphere good food reasonable prices and friendly service
A softball shaped hunk of beef with a crispy peppercorn crust 360 degrees around and dripping with juicy goodness inside even when it was requested well done
The food was great the service was good considering how busy it was for lunch and the prices were reasonable
We ordered the three meat platter and oh boy it was good
At times the food is fresh and tasty while other times you risk a stale or undercooked bagel with funky tasting cream cheese expired
It was just soggy beef and also was like chewing just cow and not a tasty steak
I do note the table salsa was seasoned nice and the bar foods we tried were made nice so I know you can get good food here
Last time they weren't busy and the food was very good
Drinks aren't too expensive I haven't tried the food from the restaurant but it does look delicious
The food has always just been ok to good three stars at best and the service has always been hit or miss
I've had a lot better--maybe because I'm spoiled with good sushi in Los Angeles
I mean ya ever watch Check Please where they do the close ups of the food and it looks sooo delicious and the reviews the people give are so enticing
If you're looking for Mexican food go up the road to Si Senor that place is amazing
Katsu chicken entree is also very good
Not pricey at all for what you get which is a significant amount of very tasty food
Not cool in a I wear D&G sun glasses and think RA has amazing sushi kind of way but cool in a this place has great food who the hell cares what it looks like kind of way
at all and please let me tell you to save your money or at least go get good Mexican food at Rosita's or Manuel's that are in the same area
Morgan shared her burger with me grassfed beef and very juicy and delicious
Holy uncow people this food is effin good OK
I thought the meat was flavorful the veggies were fresh and the bun was fresh too
They also have excellent Indian Chinese dishes
The food is consistently good and I have eaten there on several occassions
NegativesTheir non-South Indian dishes are not so good
The owner also says every dish is excellent which isn't true; he is kind of a businessman so he doesn't really care about telling you which dishes stand out
Now onto the services MASSAGE My 60 minute Swedish massage was wonderful
the rest of their meat and non-meat food looked also delicious and we hope to hit this place up again soon
I have had the Italian Stallion and Bianco pizzas and they were both good
Usually I have had good food and service but this time it was just ok
Everyone was very polite and nice but we ordered the onion ring tower as an appetizer but it was brought halfway through dinner but he did make up for it by taking it off the bill =This time I ordered the teriyaki chicken sandwich which was completely messy and just tasted ok
It was good but even with both of us sharing it we weren't even able to finish this rich dessert
Everyone at our table got something different and each pizza was delicious
Also the food was just okay it seems like they have more pastas and sandwiches than baked items besides our turkey sandwiches lacked flavor or something
I'll admit the veggie roll was actually tasty not enough to make me a loyal patron though
The portion was large and the food was great-the flavors were bold and everything tasted fresh
The Mandarin Kung Pao chicken is my favorite and even though I hold the onion and garlic it's still super flavorful
Overall Pei Wei's awesome for great service and customizable food options so I recommend it as a relatively yummy and painless lunch break from work
The gnocchi with braised short rib was RIDICULOULSY tasty and the raviolini was excellent as well however the pizza was good but not amazing
I was immediately impressed with how stylish Olive and Ivy was and then shortly thereafter completely let down by the food
Just don't expect much other than decent food and fairly good service
The Mr had the Chicken enchilada's very good a nice creaminess to the sauce
So the food here is good but not one of those places where you feel the need to return to try more things
He prefers to have his soup scalding hot and full of seafood
It's huge super hot chock full of seafood and perfect noodles
I had a beautiful plate brimming full of fresh delicious spring greens and topped with two grilled chicken breasts that were sliced up and artistically placed upon the heap of greens then topped with a super tasty light but creamy sesame dressing
They have the most wonderful food and I would just like to say the hummus plate with chicken in the most delicious thing in the world
The salad bar is full of delicious options salmon brie chicken salad
I am really happy for America and her husband to open another shop especially in such a good food lacking place like AZ mills
There was also a shredded pork dish with bamboo excellent and a pickled vegetable with fish soup
I could have eaten the entire scallion pancake myself as well as the cold spicy pork belly dish
I recently moved here from the East Coast so I have been looking to find the best Mexican Food here feel free to contact with recommendations
However my experience was that the food was tolerably hot
The prices were *amazing* and so was the food and now I'm dying to go back and have a full dinner here as well
We got something like 5 appetizers including the big ass burger 3 drinks and 1 dessert for around $65
Go here if you like your food cold your card overcharged your waitress rude and your customer service idiotic
So with our food cold and 3 of the orders wrong we went back to the office and I complained on Twitter
They weren't short staffed there was NO ONE in the restaurant our food was CLEARLY ready on time as it was ridiculously cold when we got it
In short the food here is not worth the absolutely awful service
unassuming exterior unique decor excellent service with well-seasoned hot food
Blackened chicken on the Caesar salad was actually spicy served hot on cold greens broccoli cooked al dente
A little small but we were celebrating and enjoyed the company cool weather great breezes that evening and excellent food
I spent some time over there and have learned of few neat dishes that are very good
The pizza was pretty good and I had a pasta special that was quite good
Meaning if you are looking for FANTASTIC food that is real for good prices and GREAT service this is the place
The food is excellent but the service is absolutely terrible
Hey I know that good food takes time to make but when I have to stand and wait for 15 minutes to get the food that I called in that I can see is just sitting on the counter well the blood pressure just gets raised too high to make the experience enjoyable
They hide behind the excuse that good food takes time but the hard reality is that they are just ultra inefficient and truly don't care to speed things up
Although the bar serves food and attracts more of a family scene during the lunch time hour I don't recommend ordering off the menu
The service has been less than good on all occassions but the happy hour pricing and great food makes it worth the try
My brother took us here while we were visiting him in town and the scenery was breathtaking the service was fantastic thanks to our awesome server Dennis and the food was very good
Dos Gringos is a good place to go grab some drinks and some food to snack on
The food and service has been hit and miss over the past few years ranging from pretty good to disasterous
Nonetheless the food was worth the trip and the cozy patio on a Sunday morning was a nice change from you know Cheerios on the futon while watching exercise equipment infomercials
The meat was almost falling apart and the taste was wonderfully savory
The meat was nicely done and the brioche roll was an excellent choice to serve it on as it kept the contents in the sandwich instead of running down your hand but the sauce was woefully short of promise
I rate this restaurant 4 stars based on quality of food portion size to cost and excellent sanitation
The Bacon Deluxe served with two fresh never frozen beef patties seasoned well cooked to almost perfection with hot-melty-cheesy goodness two slabs of bacon served up hot and fresh on a lightly buttered bun with lettuce tomato onion mayo and pickles
I guess a lot of people may not know what good Greek food is like
I think it's arrogant for Delux to think their food is so good that everyone will gladly sit on each other's laps in order to wolf down a marginally creative burger
Food was excellent nice large portions but not crazy
We have triedHilltop Acres -- excellent combination of veg skillet styleCrack o' Dawn -- nicely basted eggs on top as has the Hilltop AcresThe Eggington Omelet -- hesitated because of the cream cheese inside but its blend with the chicken broccoli and hollandaise is tasty
The peppers add this crazy flavor to the overall dish which is completely unexpected and delicious
The only thing really worthwhile is the Sushi Bar
While the food was decent it wasn't worth $10 to me
I absolutely love all the food I adore the giant green olives that come with my sandwich the bread as always is fantastic and the staff is excellent
Refills were abundant and as usual the pizza was amazing
The pizza was every bit as good as I remembered it in Vegas
But to me you just can't put a price on delicious pizza
All this while your food is sitting there getting soggy and cold
The BBQ pizza was good but not blew me away good
This is a family place and very loud but the food is good and everyone is happy
The two white pizzas were also good but I definitely prefer red
For real the food here is always amazing and not only this El Pollo Loco but them all they raise the chain restaurant bar high like 25 feet if we were pole vaulting jon gets it do you
pork fried rice and saladFood was average nothing off the hook but the mix of the cultures made for a good eat
The service is wonderful and the food is pretty damn good
She handed me a menu and I asked her recommendation between the turkey or roast beef
As I said I don't know how long Stan's has been open but their quality of food is fantastic and in the poor economy I hope they make it
They were seasoned nicely and cooked well enough however they had *obviously* been cooked well in advance of the pizza as they were room-temperature to cold
It's a bit off the beaten path of Mill Ave but certainly worth a stroll over
The chicken tacos are definitely the best the chicken is flame-broiled and you definitely get that flame-broil flavor
The steak tacos are nothing compared to the chicken the steak just isn't very flavorful I definitely would not recommend them
Great Atmosphere Average FoodIt was a beautiful Sunday night not too hot or too cool so my boyfriend and I thought we'd try out Margaritaville
I enjoyed my entree  but it's somewhat hard to mess up chicken pasta
I don't mind paying that much for a good meal but we had thought our food was only average
This sort of place for drinks and good food after and in-between classes is lacking outside of Mill Ave
I've had their quesadilla with shredded chicken and the flavor is good
Old Town is sushi-row but Stingray is trendy and equipped with a selection of tasty sushi sweet cocktails and a fun atmosphere
My eyes are bigger than my appetite but the sushi is so good I always seem to finish whatever we order
- I got the chicken club burger and it was GROUND chicken and flavorless
disclaimer not super expensive but food wasn't great and other burger places are a few $$ less - and betterLong story short there are too many other good places to eat burger and non-burger in Scottsdale
My only suggestions for improvement would be to dust the Amoroso rolls with corn meal and offer a broader selection of hot sauces
They really know what they're doing with the food peppered steak is my favorite there's a good selection of higher-quality beer and choices for everyone including vegetarians - I know because I was one once
A most wonderful combination found I today of simple delightful food a laid back atmosphere warm staff dog-friendly accommodations a vegan-friendly menu and
A great neighborhood restaurant with quality food nice atmosphere and no attitude
It's a great place to introduce Thai food ewbies because the food is great and the menu has lots of photos of the entrees
Appetizers worth sampling  spring rolls chicken satay and tofuEntrees worth trying  pad thai pad see-u curry dishesI saw a complaint here about the time it took to receive their food
Even dessert had a bit of Southwest flavor to it as we ordered smores which you make yourself at your table
Although we fought our better judgment to leave after we enjoyed  our food
It comes with a side dish and I recommend the Kale salad see above or the sweet potato hash
The chicken curry with cashews $13 is also amazing - lots of white meat chicken vegetables and a delicious but not too overpowering sauce
The staff is very pleasant and the food is actually really good
Both of the margaritas were good but the food with exception of the dessert were all terrible
Plain and simple this is not my idea of good pizza
This past week though it came up quite often often enough that on Monday when we were planning our lunch out together for Thursday we were so hungry by talking about Mrs Whites that it only took until shortly after 11 for us to pile in her car and head out for some good ol' soul food
I've eaten here a few times and have always enjoyed the food which is a lot more authentic and flavorful than your typical Mexican restaurant
Their food is actually fairly stellar not as good as the aforementioned location but I digress but their service is so consistently bad that I actually have to dock them three stars for it
food was very good and the portions were HUGE they have these little pizza rolls that are made like cinnamon rolls they were really tasty
The food came out Hot and fresh and fast as can be
Clean descent parking friendly staff and good food
For Dessert they had a tasty peanut butter creme brule thing
If you're looking for wonderful Mediterranean food this is the perfect place to stop
I urge you to try the food if it's your type of restaurant and if it's not I recommend it anyway to step outside your comfort zone
Sharing the same dish a savory romesco balanced with a sweeter pear sauce I enjoyed them both with the cheese
The pizza was very good wood fired and what not
We also had a corn tamale that was sweet and moist and tasty rolled in a banana leaf instead of the corn husk we are used to
The onion rolls kaiser rolls hot dog and hamburger buns etc
Prices for lunch at the Residence Club pool are less than at the main pool and the food is just as good
I love that their chicken & turkey breasts are house-roasted that all sauces including the delicious pesto made by hand and in-house and that the incredible selection of sweet samplings and baked goods are all made from scratch
The hostess seemed stressed out and confused the server was too busy and the food that took forever was cold and tough
Let's just say that my husband kept talking and I had to tell him to stop talking to me because my food was so flavorful that I didn't want to waste my energy talking but instead focusing on the party of perfect blend of spices juicy succulent gravy warm fresh flour tortilla and the earthy flavor of green chiles going on in my mouth
For an upscale sushi joint I expected to be blown away -- I was far from impressed
I had dinner here with my mom who spent most of her life in Taiwan and my brother who lives in San Francisco where good Chinese food is abundant
We thoroughly enjoyed every dish but especially loved the Tong Qing Spicy Chicken
If you're looking for good authentic Sichuan food this is your place
Service was friendly but we found the menu a bit limited and the quality of the meat not amazing
We started with the #2Goi Cuon- Spring Roll appetizer minus the pork
25 degrees Fahrenheit  is a bit cold for me  25 degrees Celsius is the typical San Diego day that I miss so much  but as any Chef knows 25 degrees as it applies to meat  is the difference between a medium rare and well done burger
The other Hawaiin spots are good too but don't serve Meat Jun or all cool Korean side dishes
I hate when places do that too but its a rough economy and the owner have always been super cool with me so that stuff doesn't bother me I guess since the food is good
Our food took 45+ minutes to arrive and while our friend's steak came out hot our Hibachi Steak and Potatoes were room temperature
Since Haps moved to a building near Honeybears the flavors of their food have seem to drop to bland but Honeybears pork drowned with bbq sauce is really hard to beat
HighlightsThe FnB always comes up with unique approaches on simple food with great flavors
Anyway if you are looking to change up your dinner routine want to have some great food that is a little outside the box and have the owners share the passions with you through their food give FnB a shot
OTHERThe only reason they don't get 4 stars is because they aren't high quality Mexican food- more like a step up from fast food
The Food is amazing the staff is friendly the location is always clean the menu is not overpriced the selection is great and the food always comes out very fast
Come down to Kierland on a hot day sit at the RA Sushi Bar order a cold beer a couple pieces of maguro and suck up all the Scottsdale ambiance you can muster
His simple honest to goodness approach to food is not only inspiring but down right delicious
I gotta admit that we Phoenicians are spoiled with our many drive-thru mexican fast food places and I'm spoiled knowing the greasy goodness of los betos
I love the concept of a restaurant set in a historic house that in itself is cool in its own right  and the food is tasty but the service is horrible
The pizza is pretty good too but I think the sauce tastes a little like ragu
The dishes were well prepared and very tasty
They have EXCELLENT food GREAT gals service an AWESOME owners FUN poker and More TVs than a Las Vegas Hotel
Food Quality 5/5Cleanliness 5/5 - Very kept up always clean and if a spill does occur the staff immediately takes care of it
It was worth to try it and taste all the good flavors of their pizzas
The tiramisu was melty and you could really taste the alcohol which was good at first but a bit too strong as we got to the end of the dessert
Phx BBQ wasn't quite what I was craving after watching the Food Network picks but it was good enough to hold me over
The food is good the drinks are tasty and as someone else described the restaurant is spacious yet intimate
And the sushi is fresh creative and tasty in my opinion
This is a cool place for brunch good service good selection and decent prices it's even close to Old Town go figure  I had the salmon flat bread pizza with creme freshe capers and arugula this was perfectly paired with a nice strong cup of coffee served in a clear plastic glass
But FEZ offers good drinks and good food all set in a very modern hip decor
In the middle of our massive girl gossip session a very hyper sweet employee bounced over with his phone and asked if he could photograph our food I will admit it looked very delicious for their social networking site
The food was amazing sourdough bread was crispy steak marinated and cheese was perfect
Obviously it can't be for taste or the quality of the food
Like I said the coffee was good but it doesn't make up for the tasteless food and the STEEP prices
The very best was the pizza which was delicious and different
Donald's Italian beef sandwich looked so good I'll be having that the next time I go to Lobby's which will be soon
Both had a really good bite to them without losing all of the different flavors in the dish
The beef was fork tender and the sauce flavor was over the top
The service was okay and the food was pretty good
The Fish tacos is what they are good at and what I enjoy the most
They always come with a good portion of grilled or fried fish cabbage pico de gallo and avocado slices
What sets Baja Fresh apart from the other fast food kinda Mexican food places like Wahoo or Tacos del Mar is the salsa bar it is  well organized/displayed with 3-4 kinds of salsas mild hot dark roasted and the  pineapple salsa is amazing by the way and there is also pico de gallo lime slices cilantro onions and sliced jalapeno peppers
I've always enjoyed La Grande Orange's pizza which along with its extensive wine list is one of its specialties
This time around my olive and avocado pizza $17 was crispier than I prefer but it was still really tasty-I ate a whole one myself even though it serves two people
I like the pizzas 2 people can share one if you have a moderate appetite Drinks are good too
The dishes are quite creative with good use of ginger mango etc
Not too noisy feels like you are in the action tasty food
Their Wall-nut Chicken Salad sandwich is my fave tastes good and pretty filling
It's not just one time but the past three times I have gone I have been mildly disappointed with the quality of the food
I'm glad I went to this place when there was no line and the food was good
Unfortunately all that meat made it difficult to taste the sauce and the onions and all of the good things about the sandwich
The sandwich was very delicious and full of spice chicken and french fries
Adding to the experience was the excellent food
I must say it is a great place to go when your craving some good authentic Soul Food and waffles
So go ahead try it out and then go find some good Asian food the next time you're in the mood
We both ordered sushi and it was quick and definitely tasty- but damn was it expensive I totally should have read reviews before going
Both were delicious but I would recommend the lobster and the lamb only if you really like mediterranean type food
We got the 4 berry tarte for dessert which was excellent
Usually when a restaurant has 20 different types of food none of them are good
The chicken was excellent cooked well tender and seasoned perfectly
Our server returned to take our order of spaghetti lasagna and a meatball plate with some garlic bread to start as an appetizer which we thought might be some fairly easily prepared dishes that might speed up our wait time
I am catholic and it's hard to find good restaurants for Fish Fridays during Lent- I will steer clear of this place
The fish sandwich wasn't terrible it was just a previously frozen square fish patty on very fresh bread 1 star for the good fresh bread
A young fun crowd with good drinks and good Americanized sushi
Had lunch here today and liked everything about the place from the spare decor to the incredibly fresh flavorful food
I'd recommend not getting the Jade Red Chicken
Its one of the top sellers but the crispy chicken pieces lose their crispness when dunked in the sauce and the flavor is mild when combined with the jerk rice and cuban black beans
In addition I ordered the 3-course steak dinner that came along with the Cinnamon Apple Beignets dessert and my partner ordered the Steak Paired With Chicken Shrimp or Crab both diners were delicious for $11
Needless to say we will be back to try other dishes on their menu excellent choice for lunch or dinner
despite all of this the food is excellent and cheap
I have no issue with this but the food was not very good
My food came out quick and Diner quality tasty but probably not awesome quality
I HIGHLY recommend this place and the happy hour prices are wonderful considering the quality and quantity of the food
I want my food cheap tasty and really spicy
Quality check number two arrived and still no food for yours truly
Quality check number three came to which I replied Have you seen a beef fried rice around here anywhere
I shutter to think of the quality of your lobster and lamb dishes if the fried rice is any indicator
I can cook with generous amounts of sesame oil and fresh ginger too but there really are some savory dishes to be enjoyed here
Delicately sweet and still lets the fish flavors come through
The gyro meat was nice and crispy while the flavors balanced quite nicely
When we finally ordered we decided to try the quail appetizer and then each had questions on dishes
I asked their opinion in regard to the best of the spicy flavorful dishes and it was suggested I try the lemongrass chili chicken which I did
Unfortunately our food came out and our appetizer was forgotten about
It's so wonderful to see the food you will be eating
His was quite good - though maybe too many flavors competing since there were various types of seafood in it
Saw this place on a couple of Food Network shows and it sounded good so we headed on down to try it out
From the corn bread to the bbq sandwiches and finally the mini-donuts for dessert that were even hot everything was fantastic
-Spider roll this is stuffed with a flavorful fried softshell crab crab meat etc
First time had great food all server recommendations - although he disappeared prior to arrival of meal seemed to be doing side work so he could bolt out
- your server will know it's probably their most popular dish it is AMAZING
Stopped by for drinks the second time ended up ordering a pizza expected little since it didn't mesh with the menu it was really quite good
Overall a lively but romantic place with character good food and decent service
The food that was provided for breakfast lunch and snacks was good
Save room for dessert because at FnB it is always worth the extra two miles on the treadmill
The prepared foods are a good price too and tasty
The food is not only nothing special I don't even recommend going there with food in mind
For dessert we had the toffee cake and the caramel cookie sandwich - the cookie sandwich blew my socks off - light crispy chocolate cookies with just enough caramely goodness to be delicious but not too sweet
i have been to thailand - yes eventually you get sick of eating thai food around day 9 -  this place is spot on for authentic flavors in the downtown area
I had seen all the good reviews on Yelp so I expected a good meal at Roy's but I was still pleased at how good the food actually was
The fish was done perfectly and had a great texture and flavor
Though the place was dead on a Friday night seasonal resort the joyful staff made up for the lack of vibe and the food was amazing
Pulled pork sandwich $102 meat with pork and brisket Ranch House SaladCorn bread pucks of sweet warm goodness
That being said for ordering my dish very hot it was not all that spicy
i think Ra wants to be known as a late night hot spot as opposed to a place you can find good sushi
Not meat flavored frozen cardboard but actual slices of turkey beef chicken and pork
The chicken was meh the beef was hard to chew but the Meet Jun was pretty good
Can't see how you could be disappointed in the quality of the food here but I can see how the place as a whole would make things less appetizing
The combo plates are generously portioned flavorful perfectly-balanced complex in seasoning comfort food
and I am not even a die-hard sushi fan I like it but don't love it and sometimes feel like the quality and subtlety are wasted on me
It's surprisingly rare to visit a quality family-owned pizza place in the Valley
They have good desserts if you're willing but you'll probably be okay with the pizza
The food was ok Voodoo Penne was delicious as usual but the Mushroom Agnolotti was dry and lacked some depth in flavor
It is the perfect everyday really cheesy nice and greasy pizza you would expect for a good pizza joint
The food truck scene allows us to bring the dog and for $20 we had a delicious meal and a change of scenery
For entree's I had the veal and crab which was delicious while my boyfriend had the crispy redfish and he really enjoyed that
We were too full to order dessert but they did box up their cotton candy for us to enjoy later as well as two boxes of their delicious fresh baked bread
So we enjoyed the food the atmosphere and the catchiing up
I ordered the Enchiladas de Hongos mushroom enchilada and found the dish to be overwhelmingly rich and not that flavorful beyond cheese and cream
It was overall a very disappointing $17 dish and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone
The caramel churro dessert was quite amazing and saves this restaurant from a 2 star review by my stomach
A little pricey but worth every penny; the food is crafted so well that you start to dream about it and wonder when you can run back for more
Not bad for a hot lunch salad and egg roll with quick service
And my boyfriend's thai peanut chicken was pretty tasty as well
The food is authentic and completely amazing
The place is very well kept and the food was extremely delicious
Being Chinese and having eaten Chinese food around the world and Phoenix I'd say I've experienced the good the bad the decent and down right scary
That's a good sign that the food is authentic
I got an all beef and I was tempted to go with one of the Shaka dogs the already themed hot dogs but decided to combine my own ingredients for a sweet and spicy salty and juicy quadfecta
The pizza was good and filling  the snack plate was perfect with a martini
Overall the staff was friendly and attentive the prices were reasonable and the food well it was pretty good
Looking for exquisite views top notch service delicious drinks and/or food and a special experience to share with a friend or loved one
The tamale was very tasty and the beef inside was very good
I don't really care for Mexican food but if I'm in the mood I think I will go somewhere with a bit more flavor
If you want excellent pizza that is the best I know of in Arizona go to Red Devil
Total hole in the wall mom and pop shop with an almost cheesy/rinky dink decor but that's totally OK when the food is made fresh served piping hot and tastes pretty darn good
The salmon bruscetta had this amazing horseradish sauce on it and was light and fresh but really satisfying
Once America can work out Gay Marriage I will start testing out the water with delicious lunch special sushi marriage
The OMG roll lacked flavor and the ingredients did not complement well
The sirloin steak was good but the side dishes that came with it was over cooked
It was a bit of a drive from our hotel but felt like stepping into another world my perfect dream land of a gentlewoman's farm where the faint whiff of pony poop does not imply that I will have to clean it up where the sage and the stars and the dust conspire to make you hungry for a big dinner of country food
Its one thing to serve good food which I demand
However I would like to see them improve their desserts and also pay a bit more attention to lavishing on the guests for example it was a cold night but they could have up-sold he and I to a drink by the fire pit outside if they had offered blankets or the like before I give them 5 stars
I have had several dishes during my visits to Valle Luna and although a single one does not stand out more than the other I can say that the fajitas are really good who can mess up grilled chicken and steak
for the quality of the food it was worth the price if it were a dinner but 25
I highly recommend this place to anyone that is looking for some of the freshest fried chicken around
Fresh chewy bread flavorful sausage and red sauce - it was a comfort food happy place for me
The chicken was very tender and juicy and flavorful
We found a pretty good place for sushi rolls and Japanese entrees
The food is decent - they offer appetizers salads burgers chicken strips etc
Either one is a sure hit and you can't go wrong with these delicious deli meats
Their seafood counter is absolutely amazing
Both paired wonderfully with the grilled meat and the saltiness of the herbs on the potatoes meshed well with the reds
An amazing dinner and dessert but in addition to the fantastic food we were connected via videoconference with Chef Russell Skall; Fleming's Executive Chef Chuck Wagner; owner of Caymus Vineyards and Marian Jansen op de Haar; Fleming's Director of Wine
Pizza is always still hot by the time it gets to me
Perhaps a tiny selfish part of me was trying to keep Mamma Mia's all to myself however after meeting Frankie and the rest of the wonderful team in person I couldn't deprive my fellow Yelpers any longer
the chicken was good but I think the waffles is what got me
After waiting 30 minutes for our split table the service was wonderful the food was divine but some of the girls were in cranky moods
However the chicken curry and Paneer tilkka masala were spot on and very delicious
A chicken sandwich with gorgonzola bacon caramelized onion and anyone of their delicious mayos is a great meal and large enough for me to eat twice
Great service and the amazing wine list beware time for food
Dessert was a delicious White Chocolate Brownie and a Bread pudding
The fish tacos are delicious and the sauces are all tasty especially the verde salsa
They use white meat and the sauces and veggies taste fresh and hot upon delivery
My husband has had a couple of other dishes and enjoyed them I think he likes the sweet and sour chicken and egg rolls
I hate when I order hot and sour soup from a restaurant and it tastes like salty beef broth with peas and carrots and those canned bamboo shoot things
Their other dishes I've had are good too
I am not down on all Paradise Bakery locations and the ones at airports are usually very good alternatives to fast / junk food so I really do like these guys but this one can and should be avoided
Lots of food for a small price and the Pad Thai was really good
If you are interested in some good Thai food on a budget definitely try out the Thai House as I doubt you will leave hungry or disappointed
I can't say it's health food but it's tasty enough
Curious to try their beer that they brew right there in the restaurant & the desserts looked tasty as well
I went there two times in Jan 2012 the first night the waiter was without personality it took a long time to get our food and the restaurant was almost empty BUT the food was good
The second night the place was packed it took even longer to get our food it was unbelievably hot inside BUT our waiter was great and the good was good
His food is wonderful and complex with many layers of flavors and ingredients you will often not find elsewhere
When I went here the pizza they brought out was crazy hot like burn the top of your mouth hot
And don't bother with the sushi; I've come to the conclusion that if you don't have a sushi chef preparing the sushi behind a sushi counter it's probably not worth it
Super fresh tons of meat choices they take over 24 hours to make the beef broth that is the amazing base of the soup
Check out these slices of Glory see pics One with Tomato and Ricotta and the other with Spinach and RicottaThey had about 6 or 8 different pizzas to choose from for a slice not to mention a full menu of signature and custom made pizza calzone pasta soups salad and appetizers
They serve tasty bread and olive oil for you to snack on while your food is cooking and the menu is filled with different pastas and salads to choose from
The burgers and chicken tenders clucks are usually really good and the fries are delicious and bottomless
Ingredients are very fresh the choices provide tasty and interesting salads pizzas and yes even desserts
They have a steak salad that is really good and their food is tasty all around
But I will tell you that for what it is it's pricy as hell and to be totally honest the food quality is not commensurate with the price tag
They have a limited time thing going on right now with BBQ chicken pizza not sure how long it's going to last but let me just say it was amazing
Much to my surprise the food was pretty darn good
If you need your carb fix or just some quick and decent Chinese food the highly skilled non-Chinese cooks make your food and get it out to you hot and tasty
The food was fantastic the drinks tasty/strong and the prices reasonable
The selection of food and beverage choices is wonderful
I've done takeout from here multiple times and the food is consistently good and always ready when I arrive
Oh and their pizza is pretty good too
The food was good and pretty cheap compared to what I am used to at baseball games
I was impressed with the view the food and service
All in all the service was excellent and everything we had except the chicken fried steak was good
I've had better food before but for where we are and the quality it's not too bad
My other friends enjoyed the food and feasted on this meal
The Caesar salad was nothing amazing but the Carnita pizza I had was
The fish was cold and the sauce was congealing
Excellent chorizo with the correct combination of meats and spices
Very reasonable for the good quality food you get
I just went to the newest Spotted Donkey Cantina on Hayden and was so impressed with the food & ambiance
The food is good and I like the way you order your food
I love a good calzone so we ordered two meatball calzones a small kids pizza for my daughter and my son got a medium pizza and we got an order of wings
The kids said the pizza was good  I thought the sauce lacked garlic and spices  The calzones were huge and stuffed with meat cheese and a tiny bit of sauce
I'd recommend adding some spices to the food GARLIC some oregano a little salt
I had the special swordfish au poivre and it was good but very rich and wasn't feeling very well a few hours later
BBQ Chicken Pizza wasn't too bad and their Sweet Potato Fries and Onion Rings were pretty good
The chicken had a great seasoned flavor and he even made his own homemade green chili hot sauce that tasted so fresh and flavorful
For me the food has always been just ok not bad but not anything special in this city of really good restaurants
I always love Cracker Barrel a the cute gift/knick knack shop in the front balways good food and c they don't have them in Cali
So I was here on the 13th and thought their food was actually pretty good
Both dishes were really tasty and I enjoyed them veyr much
Just quality fish prepared and served by authentic mostly Asian people being reasonably polite
Other than just great pizza Streets of New York also has other great food including toasted sub sandwiches I have never tried them but both my mom and boyfriend really love them so they must be good
especially since my boyfriend can be quite critical and picky when it comes to food This place is wonderful and definitely keeps me coming back
My friend ordered onion rings rather than fries to go with her beef sandwich and this was a superlative move; the onion rings were crisp and tasty
Really unique combinations various dog options all local meats and produce - bratwurst beer hot veggie
The garlic chicken is spicy and has a wonderful lingering garlic sauce that mysteriously is hotter the next day
I would recommend spending more time on working on their food  preparation and less time on the wait staff telling us that nothing can be changed
Alas while the food was good the space was definitely not
When a local boutique pet store where we purchased our puppy food from stopped carrying the brand of dry food we used and inadvertently recommended us a new brand that our puppy was allergic to PetSmart gave us the solution to the problem without us needing to waste the other one
Some Fresh and Easy factoids zee good zee bad and zee annoyingMany of their prepared food and F&E label food contain evil ingredients like palm oil high fructose corn syrup and gelatin
Many of the prepared foods are perfectly acceptable and tasty
And it is still much too Easy to spend way too much on delicious bad for me and planet foods
Had breakfast at Dicks Hideaway this morning before a big day of shopping a group of friends is furnishing a room at a transitional housing program for women0--It was a great place to start the day--I hadn't been there in awhile and had forgotton how good the food is
I had the slider sampler and hubs had a blue cheese burger;  Beef good - beef friend
The drinks were not very good for the priceWe did not have the food but judging by what I saw it looked like traditional bar fare
The food was pretty good but not that amazing
So the food was ok and the service wasn't amazing but I didn't expect much
Another item i was unimpressed with was a Fish and Chips special which was priced at $20
I will say it could have used a little more meat and less lettuce but the flavor was there
Just after that we moved to our table where we enjoyed a very tasty and healthy Butcher's Block meats cheeses olives etc and an autostrada panini essentially an italian panini
So this review is based on takeout food quality only
The chicken skewers were super dry with little flavor
You can tell they also put way too hot chicken in the cold salad so it made the cucumbers taste very soggy and warm
We also had the chicken wings spicy which were pretty good
At least Chipotle has hot salsa not too hot either but much better for a fast Americanized mexican food
So maybe it's management but I can say the food is less than good
The house beers are below average in my opinion The food was not good at all
Here is all I can say about this place* Phenomenal ambiance * Top notch service* Delicious foodEverything I tried was excellent and there wasn't one thing I wouldn't order again
But that did not take away from the overall taste - this is a very good pizza under any grading system
The prices are very decent and the food very delicious
Beyond the obvious delectable dogs the chili is Cali style vegetarian with black beans and corn - DELICIOUS and light yet meaty
I ordered the chicken wings off the appetizer because I wasn't too hungry
The Capellini was so so the meat sauce was very bland with no destinctive flavor of any kind very disappointing
Back home we had a nice little four star Italian spot called Paparazzi's and no one has ever come even close to there quality and service anyone ever visiting Peoria Illinois needs to try this place if they want top notch Italian food
Our bill was $40 with tip rather high for the quality of food service and atmosphere we experienced
The food is always good and the kitchens fast on getting food out
For one final taste sensation we ended up combining a piece of each pizza and forming a pizza sandwich and they were also delicious together
The rolls on the table were just ok but the honey butter was so good I had to have more than one
Perfectly prepared - and the flavors of the mesquite-grilled salmon were perfectly complemented by the slightly tangy diablo cream sauce with big tasty pieces of crab and crawfish in it
The food is terrible quality and the drinks extremely well measured meaning they are not strong
cheap delicious food that is a gamble every single time
I feel like the enchiladas are a bit smaller at this location and they don't use quite as much spice on their machaca but regardelss the food here is good
you just have to find the tasty Americanized mexican food places and Manuels happens to be one of them
Service is hit and miss but the food is good and the price is right
Here is the rundown* meatball appetizer = very good - 6 big juicy meatballs and tasty sauce on the side* wedge salad = HUGE and reasonably priced but just not that good
* roasted chicken = very good pretty juicy and had a nice kick to it* service = just ok
But life is a bit brighter now that I've found several delicious food trucks here in Phoenix including Short Leash Dogs
The wait time is as expected for a food truck serving lots of customers - no biggie that's just how food truck dining rolls - besides as every foodie knows the good stuff is worth the wait
Thai House is one of those restaurants that isn't afraid to flavor and spice the food the way it should be which immediately gives it two thumbs up
The fresh spring rolls had alot of flavor and probably the best I have had in a long time
The fried egg rolls were good but not great like the spring rolls
The kee mow didn't shy away from taste or flavor with tender beef al dente noodles and a nice kick to warm up the mouth
There was miso good tempura good salad very good california roll rice and mine was chicken katsu which was quite good
Good food and friendly service make this a solid bet especially in Surprise
Horchata was okay not as good as the food city ones but can't be perfect
It is tasty though I personally could do with a better chicken black bean cheese ratio
The atmosphere save for the soda machine in the middle was good and dessert
The food options are great but go before security as the quality and quantity both go down after the scanner
The meat plate sounded good we ordered chicken breast in bourbon sauce and pulled pork
The chicken was good tender juicy and had great flavor
Another worthy mention is their grilled chicken dishes
Too many places love to over cook chicken then flavor it after the fact but at Carrabba's you know they marinate them which keeps them juicy
WONDERFUL location GREAT service and FABULOUS food
The management is very active and concerned with the individual customer and the food is amazing of course
Both dishes were delicious and distinctive
I had a 12 chicken bacon melt and it tasted pretty good
The staff is always friendly the food is always good and the wait is long enough that you have time to enjoy a glass of wine or two before sitting down to dinner
The food was again spot on and delicious
The meat is always really good there just isn't enough of it
For a buffet- this place is really good with a variety of seafood dishes from crawfish to crab legs to salted shrimps on a stick to sashimi
Just a good combination of all sort of food
We had two rolls Hot Night and another that is not on the menu w/ shrimp tuna cucumber mango sirachi etc
If you're looking for a good eighborhood sushi place near FLW and 101 we think this is a great choice and encourage you to give them a shot
the Pizza Sandwich was far more flavorful and spicy than I expected
Not the best meal of all time but good food nice decor healthy ambiance and decent service
For a place that is not known as a pizza parlor I was truy impressed
A good thing is that have a cafeteria with excellent Swedish meatballs so you can replenish yourself after what can be hours of shopping
Excellent food at a fair price and far better than the chains of the same vein
The service was good and the food above average
Blue Nile offers a slight variation from the Lalibela experience but still delivering the same core of delicious filling interesting food that isn't really possible to describe to you without your actually trying it
I decided to order a combo plate of misir wat lentils and creamy curried chicken which of course came on a bed of hot injera a bread that has the consistency and taste of a crepe with extra injera on the side
Despite being a carnivore I did order one of the vegan dishes the misir wat and it was excellent
The chicken dish was good tasted like an orange chicken deep fried until crispy then tossed in a sweet tangerine sauce
The beef dish I liked a little more it was the wide egg noodles and had chunks of beef onion pea pods and bok choy in a really good brown sauce
You can order many of the dishes mild to HOT so I did a medium hot since I sharing the dishes I didn't want to blow them out of the water with too spicy of a dish
Okay if you're looking for a genuine Chicago Vienna Beef Red Hot or a NY Sabrett street cart dog; then you might not  understand Hot Dog Stop
We just wanted good food and beers and did not care about airport mark up as long as we could get something good
Fresh delicious food and generous portions
They grill everything over an open charcoal grill and the salmon sandwiches the burgers the chicken sandwiches and the hot dogs are great tasty hot fresh well priced
Between the pizza and the Iced Tea and them not letting us know that they closed in half an hour I'd have to say that I would never go back or recommend the place
When we didn't have a large enough order to even make using the groupon worth while Joan asked for a dessert to go
haha it was just sooo good and not being able to finish the last half of my piece was very disheartening
They had very little choices to start with and the food was COLD
They were good but I couldn't find the chicken that was supposed to be on them
Typically my mark of a good sushi place is the quality of their fish in either the sushi dinner or sashimi dinner
Nowadays it's too easy to mask the quality of fish in a roll that has a million other different things loaded in it
Food was excellent however service was poor
Again the food was wonderful but 2 hours for a 3 course meal is ridiculous
It was always speedy delivery good food and good service
Delivery takes forever and the food is not nearly as good as it used to be
The Dollar car rental agent recommended Pitic as a nearby mexican food restaurant
Portions were so big that we had to request containers to take leftovers home and the delicious chocolate cake we chose for dessert came with a candle and was free
Wonderful service great atmosphere and terrific food
From the decor to the service and most importantly the quality of the food Moira is a great addition to the downtown scene
Hana may be a bit more 'traditional' in its approach to sushi but it holds nothing on Moira in terms of freshness quality or creativity
A bit of advice for those contemplating ordering sashimi or nigri -- always ask the sushi chef and not the wait staff what they recommend that evening -- sushi restaurants are at the mercy of their suppliers in terms of the quality of the daily deliveries  and the toro that tasted divine last week may not make the 'cut' this week
The spinach in my dish was a little overcooked but I loved the flavor of the curry - sour and herby it was a bit different from Thai and Indian curries and a really pleasant surprise
For a bar/grill they really had good food
And as a side note - you might not want to come here if you're trying to watch your weight Hawaiian food in general is high calorie-laden goodness which is why I always leave this place full and happy
The food was good - brisket and ribs and a black bean soup
We had one appetizer and split an dinner dish and I had one sangria
Not the best sushi I've ever had but good value
The food was excellent except for the Garlic fries
Everything I've tried has been delicious especially the enchiladas and shredded beef tacos
But if you are in the mood for good Mexican food and you are not in a hurry this is a good place
was going to round up for the quality of the meat all white meat chicken for example and the willingness of the owners to become familiar with customers I hadn't been since before the roof collapse and they remembered me
A microbrewery with delicious food a HUGE outdoor patio that's dog-friendly amicable and helpful staff and oh right did I mention that their beer is amazing
Great service cold local beer and a good selection of better than average bar food
The quality of meat makes up for being charged 50 cents more
We have also had their meat and cheese pies which are pretty good
This weekend the boyfriend and I decided we were craving some good all-american pig out food so we headed over to FDs to get our glutton on
The veggie egg rolls were tasty crunchy and flaky -- almost like a fried spring roll
We got the cucumber salad very good and seaweed salad equally as good-and they dont add lettuce to it to make it look like more shrimp tempura roll good spicy tuna chunks of tuna were way too big and it just wasn't good Pearl necklace far from impressed and the napolean dynamite pretty good
We had the yellow curry with chicken and it was absolutely delicious creamy and spicy
The panang with beef was also good--way better than Malee's at Desert Ridge before they closed
I give it three stars because the food is good
If your idea of an enjoyable experience includes good food surrounded by SUV-driving soccer moms with ears adhered to cell phones this place might just be for you
There is nothing better than walking into a restaurant for the first time and just knowing you're going to love the food because the ambiance is so good
Great flavor dumplings were perfect I would have liked to see a little more chicken in the entree though
but rather a good place to go to kick it with some Telemundo and delicious food
The staff were friendly and the food was delicious as always
Plus they were playing some jams while we enjoyed our food and they didn't rush us at all even though they were closed by the time we were done
I do like the pho and recently tried the Banh Mi with BBQ pork and although my sandwich could have used a little more meat it was good
The corn bread was ok but the chili lacked meat substance annnnd flavor
If you are a Food Network junkie like we are this is where you can get all the ew hot seasonings all the cool kids are using
It was piled high with meat and loaded with flavor
For a mom and pop shop the prices for the food were very reasonable and the food was also definitely very good
My italian beef came out surprisingly fast and it was quite delicious
At one point a couple years ago the food service and quality became for lack of a better term lazy
The food was amazing and in very big portions
I read one speaking about Filibertos having superior food and I think what they are mistaking for flavors is the pounds of lard that other mexican food restaurants cooks with
Revo has a wonderful blend of grilled food and seasoning to make the meal flavorful while still being a healthy option
The place is called upper crust they better have a good pizza
The crust it was a good thin crust pizza but it didn't have enough to put it over as GREAT
I ordered the Chicken Combo Platter and was pleasantly surprised when they brought out this huge portion of chickenmixed beans and brown rice which included a side of pita and the most delicious hummus I've ever had
I got a chicken pita which was very tasty but it kind of fell apart since the pita was so thin
It was a substantial amount of chicken and there were also veggies with a vinaigrette on them which I really enjoyed since I don't like the creamy yogurt sauce that most Greek places use
The food was just as good as the Scottsdale location and our waitress was very nice but they had no AC
Dessert and a bunch of other menu items that sounded good
A little steep but it's a good environment and doesn't feel snobbish like a lot of Whole Foods-type places
I didnt have dessert this time around but have tried their graham cracker chocolate mousee before and its delicious
I warn you to be careful on how hot you order it because at times my food has been so spicy but so good that my mouth was saying stop but my stomach was making me keep eating
Their spring rolls are really good as well
At some point you have to be concerned with the quality of food being served
I had the tandoori chicken and a naan which is kind of like a pita and both were really good
The rib-eye meat they use is so good and makes for great sandwiches my family has taken to calling it 'dragon meat'
I trust that the chef will produce really good food without cutting corners by adding excess amounts of salt butter cream or sugar don't insult my palate's intelligence
We found the food fresh the curries were great and you can make them hot really hot or off the charts
Other recommendations are the chicken burrito very juicy
Food was good in every restaurant I tried including room service
I had heard such good things from friends and was so excited to finally try your sushi
I mean I do come from San Francisco where you can find some of the most amazing mind-blowing met in your mouth sushi
We ordered miso soup an appetizer a bottle of wine that was half off because of a Sunday special they had going on and 4 rolls
The chicken salad sandwich is moist and tasty and served open-faced while the hot pressed Cuban sandwich is wonderful on a cool day
I would suggest that anyone who lives here and has not been come and if you're in town and looking for a great local non-chain restaurant that has quality food prepared the way it should then try Cibo
the food here was excellent the prime rib was one of the best I have ever had  all seemed very well doneI was talked down on my wine selection lol typical steakhouse wine I did not like the horseradish it was really sour ALMOST not fresh but that was it
which I normally don't mind if the food/service is amazing
The food was not what I would call very good
After seeing this food truck sitting at the Phoenix Farmer's Market I finally decided to give it a shot
First there are four different types of hot dogs to choose from as well all from Schreiner's Meats regular dog all-beef dog beer-hot dog or bratwurst or veggie dog for those that dislike meat
I've had the Artichoke appetizer the side salad and the prime rib ribs fish sandwich and chicken for entrees and don't forget about the banana cream pie
The chicken which is suppose to be their signature dish is ok not much flavor to it but everything else I've had there is to die for
When it comes to pizza I'm a sauce man and there's is really really good crust is great as well but I'm less fussy about that
Like any good East Coast pizza shop you can also order pasta meatballs etc
The combination plates they have are terrific value as I got two tasty enchiladas and a steak taco al carbon rolled soft taco basically for 12 bucks
Overall this is a good place to go in & grab a quick meal - the food is on par with a Rubio's or Baja Fresh but you have the opportunity to support a local business which wins in my mind
However they give generous portions and I could have easily given them 5 stars if Haji Baba's Chicken Swarma wasn't twice as good as Pita Jungle's This place seems to be constantly improving their menu and is a must go to for a date or just to try it out with some friends
The chicken was tender and the sauce was wonderfully creamy with just enough heat
CONCLUSION So you are probably wondering if the service is so bad why do I keep coming here the food is actually pretty good and it's darn right cheap
Outside of those items the food is prepared in a replicator hence the reason it doesn't taste good
Though the salad was good the main dish was abysmal and I would sooner head to Claim Jumper or Mimi's on my way into town
Every time I think of Haji Baba I think of three things their chicken shawerma plate which is to die for as in I would throw myself in the path of a bullet if it meant I could get some their delicious lemonade and the store that's attached to the restaurant which always has new discoveries
The food and service here is as good as any chain restaurant
the sliced pork bun with egg rolls is just TOO GOOD to pass up
It's a wonderful cross between a hot rice noodle dish and a salad fresh refreshing satisfying and flavorful
When Chipotle first opened its doors in 1993 the goal was simple to serve high quality delicious food quickly with an experience that not only exceeded but redefined the fast food experience
The specialty rolls are all stuffed with krab so what hope do you have of ever getting quality sushi
The food was really good  they offer a couple of unusual dishes not seen at other Chinese buffets and a good dessert selection
It is a unique entity in Phoenix serves wonderful food and the service has always been courteous and attentive
They brought out all the food together and nobody had a problem with cold/incorrect orders
Over the last few years it's gone from good food with nice/funny people working there to decent food with a miserable woman who scowls at you as she takes your order
but the brussel sprouts minus pancetta I don't eat pork and the chicken meatballs were delicious
I was going to be good and get fish but when the waiter described the short ribs I couldn't resist
They were so flavorful and so tender that I've dreamed about that dish since
The food is still amazing and gets 5 Stars
While never amazing in the service department I could ignore the occasional blip because the food was just that good
Food amazing and with plenty of specials offered
My side salad was ok corn was very good pulled chicken was very dry and the roll it was on got sliders was store bought
Next choose your meat  make sure meat is stirred  my meat was cold
To be fair I grew up with very good Hunan & Yunan style Chinese food
Items with seafood will be a bit more expensive maybe a bit over the $9 markA very good meal for under $10 excluding drink
It's really great for grabbing dessert after dinner or if you just want some sweet yummy goodness
I am an out-of-towner from San Francisco but have been going to RA on Scottsdale Rd since before they expanded their dining room and continue to be impressed with their service quality of food and their atmosphere
Their food has consistently been fresh creatively prepared and delicious
I love this place for the food and the good service
The brisket had that wonderful beefy flavor - tender and moist on this particular occasion
The beef ribs were good; they were decently sized and definitely meaty
The pricing is terrific and the food is absolutely delicious
I am infinitely annoyed by price gouging and none of this food is spectacularly intricate or worth the wait
Food recommendations are  classic pizza with just about any topping pesto pizza is good but too rich for my tastes
Not bad-it was weird that there was a special only if you pay extra section of the salad bar that had the good stuff like chicken and artichoke hearts for a few extra bucks but it ended up not mattering because we went for the 2 meals for 20 dollars route
Parking was a breeze the food was extraordinary the chef charming and a good time was had by all
The food he grilled was equally bland needing soy sauce AND salt to give it some flavor
but i figure it's worth the wait with the amazing food they brew inside
My fettucine bolognese was another ample portion of homemade noodles and a delicious meat sauce
OK now that I got my complaints out of the way I can say the service diverse menu and good food are all pluses in my book
The menu was impressive diverse Hot Teriyaki Veggie Bowl and with tons of hot and cold lunch staples Club Sandwich Pastrami and Cheese Chicken Caesar Salad etc
Their food is very good better than some of the finer Mediterranean establishments
The appetizers finally came--we ordered the sampler tray and a chicken quesadilla
Dinner comes out before the appetizer dishes were cleared and we were starting to have an excessive amount of glasses and bottles on the table that the server didn't feel necessary to remove from the table
My girlfriend came with me ordered a roll called the California Roll and then we split a Shrimp Tempura appetizer
The food and service we received was AMAZING to say the least
I didn't think it was possible for food to taste so flavorful and filling at the same time
I was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was here
The food is good not great but I'm a salad girl and this is a steak place so I should really just order a steak or burger
I had the chopped salad with chicken and it just needed a little something to add to the flavor  some great cheese or seasoned chicken maybe
And as an added bonus the well-prepared food while fairly standard is well executed and delicious
It was good not to die for but better than chain pizza
The flavors blended really well together it was cooked perfectly and you could tell the meat was high quality
I feel like the food quality has gone down dramatically since I first started eating there
The food was very good but it didn't blow me away in any respect
Although Jim's isn't flashy on the outside and scared me for the first few years I was here I decided to actually go inside one morning I was completely impressed with the food service and diner atmosphere
The food is pretty good but the service is not so hot
Yes the food is good but it really doesn't take 45 minutes to make pancakes and eggs no matter how busy the place is
The place was pretty dead which was good because I don't like crowds or waiting a long time for my food
*Edamame = standard*4 random rolls = pretty good but not outstanding
This did not bother me because the dessert as a whole tasted very good
The food was amazing and the service was great
The food is pretty good just don't expect anything service wise and maybe you'll be pleasantly surprised
It took away from the taste of the dishes which otherwise would have been good
But those I was dining with seemed uber-impressed with their signature thin crust pizza
I had the california rolls and macadamia crusted chicken - both were delicious
My boyfriend got 3 plates of rolls and an appetizer
The seafood platter they ordered smelled good
It's definitely a bit pricey but if the seafood is really that fresh I guess it's worth it
The pizza crust was even flavorful enough to eat the ends
Overall it's great to see a friendly and professionally-run restaurant with good food
In Short Food was tasty but I've had much better
The food is INSANELY cheap - like between $3 and $4 for lunch and it's pretty good
The egg rolls aren't good though but seriously for $3 this place is pretty great
Otherwise this place has amazing pizza pastas and salads for no more then $15 and if you want to get crazy try some of there sangria it's delicious
The lamb kisra basically a pizza or flatbread is soooooooo damn good
The meat is always very good whether it is chicken gyro meat or their lamb shank
If you are looking for tasty Middle Eastern food in Tempe I definitely recommend Sahara
The prices are average for most places nowadays and I think the grilled chicken plate at approx $7 is a pretty good deal when you can make two meals out of it
Hubs batting average not so good he went for the beef enchiladas rice & beans
The meat in his enchiladas very flavorful fresh corn tortillas also good
I will return since my dish was good & will try the Tortas next
I took my parents recently for brunch and had ordered the chicken crepes $8 which were quite good although they must have sit at the pass for a couple minutes too long because by the time they hit the table the chicken was lukewarm
Love the food love the people I'm usually there with and I've always had a good time
It's pretty much your standard Sweet & Sour chicken but it's good tender and worth a second helping as well
It was almost too sugary-sweet but it was so small we only had one bite each so it was a good little dessert to satisfy my sweet tooth
I'm not a German food expert but I have a nice variety to make some  comparisons and Black Forest Mill was by far my least favorite or had a notch below in quality to what I've tried
I'd never been there before and everyone is always telling me how good the food is so I was quite excited
I ordered the spicy dragon beef bowl and gyoza and an iced tea   The beef had an interesting flavor akin to melted plastic
I'm not much of a meat eater so had the Quattro Formaggi Pizze -- but have to admit the other meat-laden pies were looking mighty good
I still come here because the pizza is amazing they always have a large cheese & wings combo on special they make their own super-chunkily-creamy-delicious bleu cheese dressing and the guys who work at the pick-up window are super-sweet even when it's blazing hot outside and inside near the ovens
Sure you have to remember a random number they give you at a moment where you'll never be able to find a pen or something to write with in order to pick up your order like Carolina's but it's still my favorite pizza complete with a chewy delicious crust
And finally the food really wasn't very good
The staff is very helpful and the few times I have been there the food has been good all times
For starters we ordered Uzbek salad - tomatoes cucumbers and sweet white onions lightly drizzled with a dill vinaigrette - and blinchik which are crepes with a flavorful meat and onion stuffing; beware the blinchik are rather filling by themselves
The palov was a dish of tasty seasoned rice with carrots and meat and was quite a good choice
Since variety is the spice of life we ordered two different sandwiches to split - Long Trail delicious roast beef on sourdough with crumbled bacon muenster cheese lettuce tomato red onion green pepper and a fantastic horseradish mayo- The Vermonter maple glazed turkey & honey baked ham on wheat wtih sharp cheddar lettuce red onion thinly sliced granny smith apples and cranberry mayoIt was past the lunch rush so our food was prepared pretty quickly
My wife's fish sandwich was consumed with muffled oooh's and ahhhhs' and she raved about the perfect texture grilled flavor and delicious fresh multi-grain bread
My first taste of Torched Goodness was at Food Truck Friday today
The shredded beef chimichanga was pretty good but we both felt that it was on the small size considering its $12
I never write reviews online but decided that this was overdue after feeding some relatives that were visiting from Brooklyn tonight and hearing them rave about how good the pizza was
But if you are looking for a delicious real New York style pizza that will make your taste buds sing make sure you give Argento's a try
The quality of the food and the service we received have fluctuated so much over the years that it's really hard to give this location just one rating since they could rate anywhere from 1 stars to 5 so to be fair I think 3 stars will suit it fine plus upon a recent visit this is about what I would say they were at right now but give it year and it will change again I am sure
The food is very good and there is a lot of variety - salads rice and noodle bowls burgers and more
The quality of the meat and flavors was top notch and highly recommended
We split the Beef Carpaccio and it was very good -- a little low on salt -- but very yummy
At the end he only brought the dessert tray and did not tell us about all the other ice cream flavors they had
anyway we made it inside finally and the food was pretty good
my date thought the pizza was amazing while i found it to be so-so
The second time I was there I got the little lemon pie which looked small but was plenty for a dessert and really tasty
The sliders were completely cold and the meat was dry
A little kitschy a little run down but the food was delicious
It was good and a decent amount of food for what I paid
But Food wise it was okayI cant complain it was good and will probably come back after I check out the other plate lunch places here
FOOD AND DRINKThe Pork Sandwich was very good and so was my wifes salad the drinks were authentic yet creative and I can honestly not say a bad word about anything
If you live out here in Phoenix there are a number of good BBQ places many of which have a strongly Southern focus on BBQ pork specifically ribs and pulled pork with the meat served already mixed with or covered in sauce
Hot links for dinner with the Sweet and Zesty sauce and the bread pudding for dessert
Easily could have removed the faux-meat but it was delicious
Overall food was good but prices too high and service waaaayyy too slow
I had the Pepperoni and Ham Rollatini and it was delicious
but it was tasty 3 basted chicken strips on a roll with lettuce and tomato and nasty red onion
fresh shrimp and chicken was cooked but not overdone and dry excellent
The food at every Paradise Bakery I've been to has been good but the customer service tonight was incredible
The chicken appeared to be all white meat and was really good
Also some on the meatiest wings I have ever had to be honest hormone injected wings up in this joint is what you will get and they are very tasty
Very flavorful and each dish had its own distinct flavor
The convenience store is awesome with plenty of delicious coffee slurpees hot dogs and any other gas store food item/beverage you could want
I had the house special bbq chicken pizza which has a ton of flavor and a nice grilled thin crispy crust
Overall the food is good nothing spectacular but its definitely good
but the food is excellent and all the meat dishes are accounted for
So every time I find myself in a food court with a Hot Dog on a Stick I must succumb to a fresh squeezed limeade and a cheese on a stick American of course
I'm a big fan of spicy foods but I hate it when restaurants just turn up the heat while ignoring the flavor of the dish
The food is quite good especially the Guinness braised beef boxty
We got the marinated thin sliced beef sooooooooooooo good
When you order Korean BBQ you get all these tiny little random side dishes some were good some were questionable
But the food is just too good that I'm updating my review to 5 stars
This time we had the Chicken Sausage pizza which was pretty good but I'm always impressed with the crust
The chicken breast was good a little dry but I had no problem cleaning all the meat off
Quick spot to pick up some good food on the way home from work
Cafe Monarch has atmosphere in spades and excellent food to match
The greatest feature of this restaurant--besides the delicious food--is the chef who is also host and server
The meat was slightly undercooked and the flavor was just okay
I wandered up into Terminal Four exceedingly the only port worth venturing from with its hoards of awful fat inducing foods that I would never let my indulgences approach
A pity to have to post a star rating on the basis of policy rather than food quality
All of the dishes are really good but be sure to bring something to freshen your breath
Not only does the sushi presentation always look amazing the flavor and quality is top notch
The whitefish carpaccio is amazing and so is the seabass and halibut sashimi
I was excited that they would prepare their Pad Thai a dish that serves as a very good baseline to judge everything else served in these places Thai hot despite it not having the associated chili icon next to it on the menu indicating that this was an available option
It was actually delicious but tasty Thai food without any noticeable spice is not what I call Thai food
Probably more due to being out on the patio and the good service rather than the food
I really was impressed with this place I thought the service was fine but we sat at the bar and the food we had was delicious
Upon first biting into the burrito I thought it tasted good the meat wasn't dry and was tasty and the vegetables inside were fresh
If you're not used to good Mexican food or you don't care what your food tastes like then go here
Being that it was happy hour DH and DS and I took a hi-top table in the bar and settled down looking for some good food we could smell those burgers everywhere in San Tan Village
Cantonese dishes are characterized by sweet and mellow flavors not spicy so you shouldn't be reaching for that chili oil =  Also Cantonese cuisine has what we refer to as Liang Tang which basically means delectable soup which are supposed to be seasonal
Recommended dishes - I forgot what section its under but in Chinese pinyin it is Guangdong Hong Shao Quan Yu
The dish took about half an hour to cook but its worth it
- I will try these dishes next time but I would say other marks of a good Cantonese restaurant are beef chow fun winter melon soup I think they use bitter melon instead
Ok so the sushi is decent - I mean it's definitely not the best sushi I've ever had but it IS good
The people food is out of this world wonderful too
There are a lot more exciting places to eat within a few blocks but I'm old and I like restaurants that serve good tasting food
You take a pile of beef and flavor it with your favorite spices
The entree was good too but there were bites of just bread with no chicken in the panini
Even if Travis had been sub-par I would still give this place 5 Stars because that's just how good the food is
all such healthy and delicious food options
which is a city lawSo if you can handle all of this the food is pretty good
I gobbled up the lobster I don't know how they are suppose to taste though it was only the second time I've had lobster The first was at the seafood buffet in Vegas and I liked it a lot so I decided to try it again it was good but the buffet was better that makes me question how good it really was though
then I get less than a $5 walmart quality piece of meat
I also had my eye on a dessert that sounded really good I wanted to save room see I'm forgiving
Very good value in just oz per dollar; however they also age the beef and offer 2 infrequent choices for how you would like it cooked blue rare on one end of the spectrum and Chicago style as an oddball
The ambiance was great the concept of putting the restaurant underground is clever  The service was great and I think the pricing was reasonable for the quality of the food
Tried the lentil soup some cucumber-red onion-tomato salad amazing and a lamb dish with delicious white rice
Munchies is probably a 3 normally but I'm giving it four stars because the owner was so nice the food served it's purpose and it's a good option after hitting up the Mill Avenue bars
Delicious breakfast food and great space really make this place
Patty's day the day before probably exacerbated the wait but the wait for the food is still worth it
A long wait for the food once we were seated but chatting with good peeps I didn't even really notice
I brought two newcomers here today who were impressed with the food
The service was excellent and our food was good
AMAZING service here and the food is great
All the side dishes were of the poorest quality
Maryland crab cake and meatballs were our appetizers
Food cannot be too expensive when it is that good but be prepared to pay for the finest grade of aged meat and fresh fresh seafood
This place has good pizza except it is always SOGGY
I never get a good crispy thin crust pizza from here
There is no good Chicago style pizza out here in Tempe
The food at Ruby Tuesday's is predictably average with service that varies from piss-poor to pretty darned good
I ordered the 1-slice + salad combo cheese pizza caesar salad and was pleased to find the slices were nice and big and the salad was also pretty good-sized
I enjoyed both the salad and the pizza -- I'm not about to claim that they were the best I've ever had but they were tasty and filled me up so I'm a happy camper
the ones they had on-hand today didn't thrill me but I'd like to go back again and try one of their more unusual-flavored pizzas
water was kept constantly full great attentive service good food not bad prices
I gave this restaurant 2 stars because the food was fairly good but the service was perhaps the worst we've ever experienced
The food is good although a bit pricey but don't expect to be served in any way
The food here was good  when we went about 200 pm
Little meat pies came next and were quite good with a tomato-based sauce thicker than salsa but without the mexican pepper spice taste
Next we had a skewer apiece of lamb and beef shishkabob on a base of wonderful rice w/ slices of raw onion
Sean S's review pretty much covered it all but I had to reaffirm the goodness of this food truck
The restaurant itself just SMELLS GOOD sitting there and waiting for your food to arrive
Mims serves legitimately good Mexican food burgers hotdogs and everything else
All their food is spicy which is wonderful to me and they have delicious sauces in the dishes
Not a huge menu so My mom ordered the shrimp salad-grilled not fried like it comes I ordered the Chicken Salad and my husband ordered the Italian Salad  I think it was called that The pretzel app was amazing
Some hot pot family-style dishes are also available
The food is good here and I can't say much more about it simply because I'm Chinese and it's Chinese food
So I dragged my coworker to probably one of the worst Thai restaurants I have ever been to in terms of food quality and ruin my foodie reputation
Only place I'll buy meat and they have a good selection
Open a new restaurant and serve wonderful food
Oh yea and the food is SSSSOOOOO good
And they have levels of spiciness for the hotter dishes on the menu -- five chili peppers next to the description means you better be able to handle the heat they serve
Hanny's is a great place to take company or anyone for that matter that enjoys great cocktails and an atmosphere that is perfect for conversation and picking at one of their amazing pizzas
Given that i am here at least twice a week i may be biased but the fact remains the quality of the Pizzas and the solid pour make it an always amazing time
I had the 12-oz Prime Rib with baked potato side glass of pinot noir 6 oysters as an appetizer coffee with Bailey's and the creme bru00fblu00e9e trio for dessert
I have also gone numerous times on non-event days and I've always enjoyed the atmosphere pub food bar staff and especially the booze
I've eaten their flatbreads their Shepherd's Pie and plenty of their Fish and I think their food is pretty damn tasty pub fare
The food may seem simple consisting mainly of salads pizza and pastas but the flavor in each dish is delightfully complex and thoughtfully balanced
we sat outside enjoyed a couple of beers and some very reasonably priced sushi
I will agree with some of the pluses and minuses that Jenn H wrote about previously such as+ A great location+ Very fresh fish+ Low carb rolls+ Good sushi selection+ Neat little complimentary sunomono type appetizer although we didn't receive ours last night
the taste of the food was very good burger and chicken sandwich
The Tiramisu was excellent and I'm truly sorry to say I wasn't able to experience more of their great food
I couldn't wait to get some good Mexican food in during my visit because we all know what extremely limited selection there is on the East Coast
And we could tell when the food came out that it may have been sitting there for a bit; it was just meh warm not piping hot as it should have been
The tempura rock shrimp while a familiar dish at any japanese restaurant was exceptionally delicious
The chicken was so good - it was crucnchy on the outside and juicy on the inside - yum
The shrimp pizza was so tasty and the mac and cheese was sinfully rich and good
The food is about on par with Denny's which is to say not good at all
This could be a great place once they get ownership who's willing to throw all the recipes out the window and start over from scratch with higher quality food
On to the food quality portion of the review
Breakfast food quality reviews tend to be the most blunt for me because there is not a lot of room for error
GRADESOverall A-Food Quality  A-        Excellent preparation of the eggs bacon and sausage
but for such a small store it packs surprisingly large variety of Korean goods plus a food stand
The dry refrigerated and frozen goods are pretty standard and you can find all the things you could possibly need for making korean food from scratch or a lot of instant/premade foods that just need heating up or minimal preparation
Kimchi is always plentiful and offer a good variety of types of jarred kimchi or kimchi in bagsThe food stand serves up truly homemade Korean food like what you would get at home
No bells and whistles just hot tasty food straight up
But to me the real strength of this market is their premade banchan - or those freebie side dishes you're always offered at Korean restaurants that act as appetizers
The chicken wings were delicious and tender with a ridiculously tasty spice rub/marinade
They also offer a hot food counter that's pretty tasty too
I was very impressed with the quality of the food the cleanliness of the dining area and the presence of a bar
Other items on the menu include several different gyros burgers sandwiches a decent selection of pasta dishes and all kinds of Greek and non-Greek appetizers
The food was very good as usual for an old country buffet
Sometimes it is good to get the good old American food for a change over all the Chinese and Indian buffets
The rest of the food was great though so if you are good and hungry you cant go wrong here lots of good eats
I'd like to roll her up in one of those lettuce leaves garnish with mint and cilantro and dip her right into that amazing fish sauce
I have eaten from the appetizer menu only had sandwiches pizza and salads
Food was good I got the hot pastrami sandwich on french with provolone
Good flavor that tastes great in a variety of dishes
Rolls salads appetizers all the way from a lowly California Roll to a few of those stuffed and baked lobster tails
i'm sure this place has some other great dishes so i may give it another shot in the future
The breakfast items are also tasty and I don't usually crave breakfast foods
Good variety of options includes all of what you expect from a Chinese buffet along with some non-Chinese items such as sausage pizza and French fries
I'm staying at a hotel down the street and really wanted pizza for dinner and also wanted to take a little walk
The pizza was so good and the flavors all blended together perfectly
The beer is amazing the food is amazing and the people are amazing
And just when I thought that all the lunch and dinner food was amazing I tried their breakfast
Go to Four Peaks enjoy the food enjoy the atmosphere and most importantly enjoy the delicious beer
I had crawfish etoufee which was excellent with dirty rice and fried crawfish
Burl Ives had fried catfish also excellent
The food is a little heavy for lunch but the restaurant itself isn't quite nice enough for a date dinner especially being wedged against the freeway in between discount hotels and a TGIF's
The food is delicious the service is atrocious
If you are going to splurge I suggest going to Ruths Chris we had a great time and enjoyed the food very much
There really arn't any other teriyaki places around that can compete with Yogis plus the food is pretty dang good
Ive also tried their chicken teriyaki large and it was good but the large is fricken HUGE
Ok I'm impressed and I ain't that easy to impress when it comes to food
I chose an appetizer achiote/pineapple glazed baby back ribs and the cucumber-avocado crabmeat gazpacho soup
This was plenty of food but I couldn't resist ordering dessert because it sounded so good even after a filling meal
After a few questions my husband ordered a mushroom and feta pizza which had a crispy crust and was very delicious
While the food is delicious and reasonably priced they've got to do something about the o substitution rule
So I fall asleep watching the food network I wake up and was sleeping through a show about amazing hot dog places all across the U
We had breakfast a few weeks ago and our dishes a breakfast bagel sandwich and french toast were cold flavorless and just plain ugly am I allowed to use that word when describing food
Crudo can be described as new-style sashimi - raw fish dressed lightly with some kind of oil and acid and garnished with tasty herbs fruit or even black truffle shavings - giving the diner a delightful spectrum of flavors and textures
The freshness and quality of their raw fish surpasses most sushi restaurants in the Valley
It isn't that hard to access and the food and atmosphere are worth it
I didn't realize this until I was at home already and was pissed but not enough to go back and let my food get cold over a salad
I am not super impressed with the food I have tried at La Bocca
The service was good and the food was good
I've stopped in several times for lunch and enjoyed my sandwiches and soup the daily chicken noodle is really good served with grilled rosemary focaccia
the chicken sandwich has brie basil pesto and sun-dried tomatoes nothing short of amazing
Boring I know but lemme make it up to you by talking about moms dish the 3 egg avocado & crab omelet which was made w/ jack cheese tomatoes scallions bacon & asiago cream sauce accompanied by red potatoes choice of one of their mega-sized hot & fresh muffins & fresh squeezed O
Mongolian beef was tasty but the sides did nothing for me
to families taking down the super gigantic hot dog that Adam Richmond dominated on Man Vs Food to college student drinking the entire bar up before the game
Don't know if that's the way the restaurant planned it but if not they should give some thought to doing it that way so the fondue can be enjoyed and then the raclette instead of serving both at the same time and the two dishes and tastes competeing with each other
The food is consistently good however the lack of service killed the experience today
The salsa is good and the food is very tasty
I had a Machaca beef chimi;  great flavor and all the fixins on top but the meat needed to be cut up a little more
The food -salads OK entrees - shrimp was dry and tasteless scallops small plate was not inspiring beef kabob was not good either but my filet was very nice
Having had good meals in the past and to go to an upscale top restaurant and receive this annoying service and less than stellar food is very disturbing and I would think it will be a long time before we return
I think the disappointment with our entree was the smoked gouda mac-n-cheese because I hardly could taste the gouda and panko bread crumb topping didn't help the dish or do justice it was quite bland and out of place for a flavorful dish
Our party was treated to a dessert sweet board of goodies courtesy of the Herb box on this confectionary tray was a red velvet cupcake a fig apple bundt cake a rootbeer cupcake a passionfruit type cake and a chocolate type pastry
Brick Chicken grilled to perfectionYummy Pork Chops fired in wood grilleExcellent Vokda Pasta purses - smack -Most extensive childrens menu I've ever seen
The food was small portions for the high cost and the flavors were not all that great
We like good service and good food and are willing to drive anywhere in the Valley and pay for a great evening
The food is darn good and reasonably priced
Our favorites are the Chicken Vesuvius Chopped Salad and the good old Pot Roast or Meat Loaf
So Wally's is a FNF favorite because the food ambiance and service are good consistent and dependable and because you get a good deal overall
The pasta salad had noteworthy Italian cuts of meat
Otherwise their mock  food was salty and pasty perfect for Americans in search of a good Orange Chicken replacement
It's supposed to be a insert meat type dish consisting of subtle flavors and intense chili pepper action
Went for Mother's Day Dinner and even with a reservation waited about 20 minutes but the food was worth it
Clam Chowder - AwesomeEntree - Sea Bass with - the fish was very fresh and good but it was not memorable
the fish was a little flavorless but the spicy and rich broth made up for it
The food was delicious  but the staff was very hateful
The sushi rolls Rice Crispy Fish Stix and another I can't remember All very good
Actually the Fish Stix was so good that we ordered another
The Rock Shrimp were just as wonderful as they were the first time Fish Stix still one of the top rolls I have had and don't forget the Rice Crispy roll
If you are looking for good quality sushi for a good low price I highly recommend Pearl
I get to Phoenix two or three times a year for family visits and when I am in town this is my go to place for consistent quality food at an affordable price
I know chicken is not an exotic or expensive meat but it is always a good alternative in case people can not handle the exotic items
The larb gai chicken salaid is good toothough they serve too much chicken in my opinion on a small plate you need to get at the lemon juice at the bottom which is hard with a small plate piled high
Now if you've had authentic Thai curries like Massaman it will come with tender cubes of beef which are soaked through with the flavor and fall apart with the fork
I recommend they stop offering every curry in every combination and get some real cubes of beef in there
I am from oregon where there is a lot of good authentic asian food
Once again we were wowed by the drinks and the very tasty food
Wildly popular Sushi Roku is now in Scottsdale at the W Hotel
Dylon offered some fantastic food recommendations
The flavors were perfect and the drinks compliment these creative dishes
Other reviewers have focused on the fish fry  - maybe that's a good bet but I'd steer clear if you're looking for a decent lunch
I crave their wonderful selections of the pizzas
Most of the pizzas here have a fresh and clean tast - which is really good with their wines and cocktails selections
The food is great so it's just sad that the owners still have not figured out that service is equally as important as good food
The food was good and it is very good corned beef and pastrami the potato salad is fairly bland
It is def better then all the fast food joints less greasy then Johnny Rockets but not as good as Fudds
Overall I wasn't very impressed with the food even in comparison to other Chinese food buffets I've been to in the past
Usually sweet & sour sauce can make even mediocre egg rolls worth eating but the S&S sauce on the buffet was a downright-scary Kool-Aid-red color
The food was amazing and fresh with vintage oldies but goodies like the Blue Cheese Wedge with bacon
My favorite dish the Adobe Salad a large with added shrimp will put you back about $15 but it's worth every penny made of baby greens goat cheese roasted red peppers tortilla strips and the most amazing and addictive orange/chipotle dressing and your choice of protein tenderloin shrimp salmon chicken or none at all
Another great dish worth mentioning are the tenderloin rellenos
Typical Mexican restaurant chili relenos are eggy with greasy filling; these are lightly breaded and filled with high quality cheese and meat
Low key place so don't bring your hot date unless she's a die hard foodie since seating is limited and hasn't quite made it to the 21st century
We also ordered the chicken flatbread which was very delicious and ordered several of those
Overall nice ambience good food good drinks cucumber martini was a-ok tho
So the dragon rolls to have impressed me is a big deal
The chicken katsu is very tasty panko breading makes anything good though and comes with asian slaw that isn't overly tart  and the brown rice was cooked well
Now I'm a big eater and was skeptical about one appetizer and one entree being enough to split but my mom insisted this would be more than enough food and per usual she was correct
The food is affordable and if the other entrees are the same portions as the curry you certainly get your moneys worth
Their pizza is by far my favorite in the valley and is always consistently good
They have an excellent Caprese salad that we like to have as an appetizer before our pizza
But if you are looking for amazing pizza I would highly recommend giving Grimaldi's a try
Plenty of lunchable dishes tho so while my 3 yr old devoured the perfect thick pancakes with custard and blueberry compote my wife and I enjoyed two tasty flatbreads - mine with prosciutto bellissima
And the prices though a tad bit steep are very reasonable for the food quality
The only dish I have ever really liked is the Edamame Dumpling appetizer - if another friend of mine has their heart set on True Foods in the future maybe I will just have to get 2 orders of those
Very delicious food here and I haven't been disappointed yet
Food- 5+ stars- I can't wait to go back and try some new things and get more mac and cheese- and give Chelsea a 'good game' on her back side
A few too many cocktails great food fantasies about noodles and hot cheese that I stored away in my spank bank and the company of the hottest girl in the place
The boys also had some garlic cheese knots to starts and those were pretty darn good as well over all a great place for the kids and the pizza and of course they do a pretty good pizza cookie to so if you are in the area it is well worth the visit
From the garden setting to the table settings to the top notch service and delicious food each piece provided just the right fit in the puzzle
The food and service were both outstanding and we will definitely recommend you for any catering needs
needless to say we had totally fun & memorable experiences filled with great conversations great food and good prices
1- great tasting dish 2- good value  3- atmosphere location service ambience
pickles were on the oily side but still good my mom ordered the mushroom burger and sweet potato fries and my sister ordered a chicken sandwich with the smash fries all were very good and next time I'm in town I will definately be back for a burger
The food is along the similar vein of Padres; but featuring a guacamole appetizer that shouldn't be missed as it's mixed for you fresh at your table and served with big round chips
Cheap prices for high quality food um win
The food was really good although I can't rave about it because we have so many other great restaurants that I believe are much better for the price
While I don't consider myself a sushi connoisseur I do know good service
Too expensive too poor of service good food I guess but most sushi tastes the same to me
It's a simple place with pretty good food
I ordered the roast beef with carmelized onion sandwich and I thought it was very good
That said the pulled pork was good and the ribs were huge and lean and meaty but dry
The meat was very difficult to cut but well cooked and the spicy sauce was very good
I was going to order the meatloaf sandwich but the waitress gave the steak sandwich a higher rating and I have learned that you should always trust the wait staff's recommendations
I can't say too much since this was my first time but aside from beans; my dish was pretty good
Perhaps one would consider me 'spoiled' 'high maintenance' or 'snobby' in regards to my standards for good food and possibly in regards to several other personal attributes but that's besides the point
Having lived in Boston for many years a city with greater ethnic diversity than Phoenix I became accustomed to delicious and authentic Indian food
You'll hear the main proprietor calling out your order across the room to the kitchen and soon enough you'll have amazing food on your table
The karahi chicken was delicious and had just the right spicy kick
When the food was served it was hot and displayed nicely
I'll definitely go back and hope that I recieve the same service and quality food that I did before
Wings are above average pizza pretty darn good
I then ordered the Strozzapreti Pasta w/Mushrooms Spinach Toasted Pine Nuts & Parmesan Cream as my entree after the bartender recommended it and mentioned it as one of their best dishes
I usually either get shrimp or scallops with my dish and they always are fresh and high quality
The server showed up minutes later to find me starring at my own food as it got cold while my wife had no plate at all
There's a variety of Italian dishes salads appetizers and personal size pizzas
The guacamole is neon green without flavor the food swims in grease and the beans and rice are often cold by the time they get to the table
The meat was flavorful juicy and crispy in parts
The beef taco was also good but after the carnitas it did kinda pale in comparison
If you like spicy/flavorful food this might not be your place
We also had three dishes sent to our table twice we had to have them taken back and removed off of the bill which took a good 10 minutes on top of the 30 just to get the check
Restaurant was a '4' good food and not as overpriced as I would have expected
But it's a store with plenty of food at low prices so it's worth a visit for your Asian cooking needs
I had the shredded BBQ chicken sandwich with a side of the cowboy beans sooo spicy and delicious
The cool slaw was a nice contrast to the very hot eggrolls
It's a little pricey but it's a food truck so it's quality food and I;m okay paying a little more for better quality
The service is good they have great drinks alcoholic and non and the food is amazing
Some perfectly amazing chef forgets to salt his dish or over/undercooks it etc
And oh yeah putting hot oily food in a plastic container so that the oil eats through the plastic and you don't realize that half your food is essentially touching the not terribly clean table
I'm hungry now just thinking about their delicious pizza
A massive pile of corned beef between two pieces of rye and some wonderful sauerkraut all grilled to perfection
We went on Saturday and got really bad food cold stale and received horrible service had to track down waiter to order no refills never came back to check on status of meal
Attentive personable good recommendations on food but not intrusive
Also there was a certain dish in the cart that I wanted but they told me they would get me a newly cooked one which didn't take long at all because the one in the cart was cold - i thought that was very considerate of them
I would willingly give up seafood if all the world's oceans were made of Lolo's ice cold Arnold Palmer in perfect proportion
The prices are pretty good and you get a decent amount of food but the quality of the food is not great
I believe this place's best days are in the past and unless they improve the food quality they will be in trouble
They have tofu so good that even my non-vegetarian friends order it instead of meat which is fairly unusual
He really seems to care and that is at least as delicious as the food
NOT StarbucksBreakfast has paninis and other hot items plus rolls and muffins for sale
Lunch and dinner has a wide range of items from wood fired pizzas to vegetable salads and the very tasty Liberty Bowl
Food is also available To Go and there is a small but good selection of food paraphernalia
My corned beef sandwich was good but the service was only so-so
A family run joint with amazing food and huge portions
For meat i ordered the brisket and hot links
I really do not recommend anything in their meat department
Once we ordered this big seafood soup with a bunch of shellfish in it - it was very good as well
Speaking of which the sourdough was an excellent foil for both pizzas absorbing the flavors well and getting to that savory slightly fatty satisfaction in the interior but not greasy in the least on the exterior
We had amazing service from the moment we were greeted at the door til the moment we strolled out the door stuffed to the gils and happy as clams
Everything was wonderful food & beverage wise and every moment of our service was sheer perfection
Why yes I did go back the next night to have some more delicious food at Gallo Blanco
For dessert we ordered the tres leches cake so good and the brownie cake which actually tasted store bought
The food was all quite good though a bit on the pricier side for thai
Good relaxed nice place with good staff good food and even a baseball player sighting though we have no idea who he was probably a minor leaguer
All the meats were good but my favorite was the filet mignon
How we had room for dessert is beyond me but the hot molten cake and the tres leches wow
Food aside I have to say that the entertainment was really good
That first visit I had one of the pizza Not sure about the shape which I though was decent I prefer a thinner crispier crust but overall good
The service was slow the music was too loud but the food was good
Overall the food at Crust is good and it has a decent wine list it's just a bummer to eat somewhere where the wait and bar staff are apathetic
The food was good not great and really nothing special or out of the ordinary
Had a couple of drinks mango margarita was amazing calamari Vegas roll and rainbow roll which we split
Every item on their menu is delicious but my preference is either the Machaca burrito or the Chicken Mole
Also some music would help to set a relaxing setting-  Old and really old customer base-  Friendly service- Tandoori dishes were well prepared including Tikka Masala and the chutneys- Prices are high and naan is extraOverall good place to go for Indian food in N
Thank you Esther for opening up Fu Fu Cuisine the Valley needed your delicious African/Caribbean  food
But we went ahead and ordered the Toffee Banofi Sundae which is consisted of double scoop vanilla bean with fresh bananas toffee butter crunch salted butter caramel and whipped cream Alton Brown's recommendation - Food Network
Now for the food - went here for a quick lunch and ordered the philly steak sandwich which ended up being really good
My friend and I split the chicken sandwich which had a delicious fig spread on it
My girlfriend and I go here often and we know that the food is amazing
The food portions were large and all very tasty
We can only catch this place on the weekend they close by 2 and sometimes there is a wait but every time we have gone the food has been excellent
The price is about where good breakfast food is these days this isn't a 99cent breakfast slam it's approximately 8 bucks per choice other things are a la cart so it's really simple to get what you like
Pizza was excellent--great flavor and fast delivery out of their great looking wood burning oven
They even beat the Las Vegas roll although that one is amazing too
So in the end it's worth $14 for a rather large Chimi roll we had 10 large pieces one time instead of the usual 5 at Ra
We pretty much ordered everything that was available off the menu - the chicken appetizer in peanut sauce was very good
The oxtail curry was pretty good but not sure about the quality of the meat they used there was a lot of fatty parts
Over all I liked the food but not sure about the quality of the ingredients and portion sizes
I don't care if food is good or bad the service is horrendous
Rolls are small and expensive but good
I was throughly impressed with my burger and the rest of my family seemed to enjoy their food as well
So overall the food was not what I expected in a good way the service was slow and lack luster but I enjoyed the sporty ambiance with all the tvs
We ordered the Fez Burger real yummy the cinnamon pears really add something special the italo kisra flatbread pizza-thing with mozzarella basil sun dried tomatoes and a bit of salad on top pretty good but not super unique and an order of half-harissa/half-garlic rosemary fries the spicy harissa fries were the winners here but we liked that you could mix and match
Food was reasonably priced good for bar food and VERY large portions
The food is very authentic and super tasty
We shared the bruschetta and hummus appetizers which were part of this deal - great tasting lots of food and great price
The chicken was really delicious and the carne asada was on point too
So we kept our mouths full with good food and kept the talking to a minimum since it was hard to hear
Most of the food is good sometimes the fish portion sizes vary once my husband ordered it and it was huge the next time is was like 3 times smaller
Start with the green chile chese crisp and then dive right into green chile burrito or their uniquely delicious baja chicken burrito
The chicken and brocolli was good but besides that I didn't even enjoy their fried rice and that is the staple I primarily judge my Chinese food experiences on it was yellow rice with unappealing looking pork and a bag of frozen peas and carrots mixed in
I ended up wiping the sauce off the pieces and trying to maintain the flavor of meatloaf
I enjoy meatloaf I enjoy the flavor of it this didn't have any of that
I love their spicy tuna tartare and I would also recommend their crazy roll
Both cuts of meat had a beautiful seasoned crust packed with flavor
It's predictable and uses good ingredients -- fresh veggies all white meat chicken
By the time the food came I had already decided not to return unless it was the best lunch ever and the meal was between okay and good but closer to good
The chicken cubes were juicy and the tahini sauce was good but lacking
Acacia Cafe is just a few short blocks away they really care about their customers the food is GREAT the parking is much better and the service is EXCELLENT
Once I got through cutting through the whole chicken the marinade and seasoning on the fresh tortillas accompanied by the sauce was quite tasty but it was the process getting there that makes me want to try something else on the menu
There is also a gourmet hot dog stand directly in front of the enterance that per the owner offers all-beef hotdogs with 22 different toppings
Despite my disappointment with hanging here on New Year's Eve food was surprisingly good
Hey anything with Jack Daniel's in the food is bound to make it delicious
Pretty muchall that's left is deep fried bar food appetizertype stuff
Its nothing fancy just plain old delicious fattening Chicago style food
Anytime I can support a cool local restranteur and get good food EVERYtime I am down for it
For dinner I had the butterfish miso-style and it was  pretty good as well
My honey had the fish sandwich with sweet potato fries and it was good-the sundried tomato aioli spread really made the sandwich
I have since tried the breakfast dish which was absolutely delicious
a shredded beef gordita gordita means meat wrapped in lard then deep-fried in Spanish and a cerveza ice ice cold BTW
The waiter did a good job answering any questions for those of us who hadn't had persian food before
The beef was excellent moist and flavorful
nothing too great or special but I just love Chinese food so much and it is good so Golden Egg Roll gets 3 stars from me
Pros excellent food fantastic service menu changes regularly did I mention the  food is phenomenal and the service superb
The inconvenience of the waiting for a table and the noise level inside is made worth it by the food and service
The lettuce wraps don't even come close to PF Chang's wraps the chicken skewers with peanut sauce were overcooked - dry and chewy the peanut sauce gloppy and thick the chicken fried rice was not flavorful at all
I am normally wary of seafood here in the desert but the ceviche was flavorful
The beef was tender the chicken was average and the shrimp was over cooked and cold as if it were cooked much earlier and kept warm
Most importantly the food was different but not excellent
We'll keep going to Classic Italian Pizza and Venezia's for real good quick fix and Bianco and Cibo when we want take our time and enjoy the best
Now I know good pizza should be a little greasy but this was soggy-greasy
I enjoyed all of the food I tried at Sakana
All of the rolls were good but the tofu salad was a little watery but since I got it to go it might have been better in the restaurant
It's hard to fully enjoy take out sushi but Sakana was good
Today it was the Arizona Iron Chef Competitors with chef fun live demos and excellent food & pairings
The appetizers started small with ham & cheese pathivier by Chef Lee Hilson and asian beef tartare on spiced tarot root by Chef Beau MacMillan accompanied by lindauer brut new zealand n/v
Oh Dear food quality and service goes downhill
Since Oct 2011 staff service and food quality has been slowly getting worse
Both entrees had poor quality meat - chicken was chewy and tasteless and the ribs were very faty and floating in grease
Its good to know beforehand that this is not a New York style pizza joint but more of your artsy eclectic CPK type with fresh flavorful toppings and out-of-the-box combinations
I will be going back here for sure this time getting a large instead of medium to have more cold pizza leftover awesomeness for later
If you want really good Mexican food you should try out Los Taquitos they have the best Mexican food in the valley
The Clams and Linguini was very tasty but I was hoping for some more clams on the dish as it didn't seem like a lot for the price $14
Overall everything was very good and I will be back to try a few other pasta dishes for sure
Lemony chicken soup was flavorful and creamy but not heavy
Even the rice is amazing as are the beef dishes and I love the slaw with mint
Poli is a little different than some of the other ~bertos places with a bit of variety in the menu and a bunch of quality in the food
Poli's was average to good in the meat generous with lettuce and cheese but the hard corn shell was not the right consistency and crumbled into my hand as i ate
It looked impressive but the meaty bit I sampled had a wierd taste -- good at first but then almost 'fishy' later
So we pressed further Eastward in search of good Chinese food and gave Super Dragon a try
s' experience I actually had really good service and mediocre / decent food
The Fire Island is a pizza with chicken breast red onion green chilies and a cream cheese sauce that is absolutely finger licking tasty
The beefy flavor combined with the soft texture of the English muffin was excellent you can taste the quality and the smokiness of the green chile
Food and Shop quality varies WIDELY between terminals
If you are unfamiliar with Panda they offer great chinese food at the ready at good prices
For dinner we each ordered a pizza - margarita excellent capricciosa good and salsiccia con patate excellent
My SF friend was not as impressed as I was but I truly enjoyed the food and the overall experience
Wonderfully crafted melt-in-your-mouth good right down from the juicy meat to the focaccia-like bun
It's best to enjoy while it 's hot so just pick up your food in a paper bag and find a seat anywhere you can at Fashion Square
I get that it is British food and not fine dining but that doesn't excuse mediocre quality food
The Beef and British Ale Pie was pretty decent flavor-wise
It was not a good fish and chips experience for him
Wine tasting with light food or just wine to go - both are good at this location and they have numerous bottles that you don't see at the larger wine shops in the valley
This place is pretty good from the dishes I tried but I was clearly not as impressed as other people
I suppose I was expecting more for the price point of this place but it is certainly good food
The orange beef sauce was delicious and a slightly different take on it than I have ever had before but the meat itself is the typcal frozen thawed and deep fried meat that I have come to expect from mediocre takeout places Or at least it tasted like it if it wasn't
I've noticed that this place has gotten a majority of 5 stars well that may be due to the awesome chicken with the tasty skin that you just have to devour and the greens that had me picking up my bowl and consuming the goods like 3 year old but can I get some room please
We also got a large pepperoni pizza which came out nice and hot
The food quality and value are very good and their service is stellar
Pros+ Great variety of fresh food always tasty
When the pizza arrived it was hot and DELICIOUS
If you are looking for good mexican food and mostly chips and salsa that should be part of the food pyramid then Via Delosantos is your place
check out the photos of the dishes I added my Tempura Udon
I really don't understand why people open up restaurants if they can't serve quality food
My husband the strawberry chicken salad which he also enjoyed
Came to this place to show some friends from Jersy a good time and good food
The only good thing to a slight degree the food but not enough to make me come back again
The food is fresh from scratch with tasty fresh produce
The food is delicious and you will most likely leave with a doggy bag
Healthy food delicious tea but crowded on weekendsFOODI am usually not a fan of hummus- but this was the first place I've gone and liked the hummus
Every dish around us that was brought out to other tables looked delicious
Most of the dishes are hearty and tasty
One of our dishes may be really good and the other barely okay
They have delicious pizza pasta salads wings everything
It is a scrumptious dessert and the perfect ending to a wonderful evening
I've always been impressed by their meat selection
You get what you pay for and at about $3/roll that's what you get-most roll options were of the mayonnaise variety or tempura and the tempura wasn't good
Good food lots of TVs with games on fun atmosphere - but where you can still talk nice outdoor seating with misters on those hotter than hell days and an amazing beer list
It was Boxing Day and I didn't want to settle on plain ol' hotel breakfast food
Not only was the food appealing to the eye but it also tasted delicious
At J&G we had better food more reasonable prices more hip environment and crowd and excellent customer service
We also had the buttermilk salad and the chicken pizza which were both very tasty as well
While they may not offer alot of selection when it comes to rolls what they do serve up is mighty tasty and sure to satiate even the most hungry of sushi lovers
Overall good service good food and will be back
I really enjoyed the sushi roll- nice and spicy
Surprisingly I found the pizza to be pretty frickin' delicious
The sausage had wonderful flavor the cheese seemed like REAL cheese unlike that weird yellowish stuff on Little Caesars pizza ;]  and there was just the right amount of tasty sauce
I recall one drunken night I even found Gus's Pizza to be tasty
We heated up the leftovers and ate them and the pizza was still super tasty
Lots of hands working quickly allow for the food to come out hot and fresh
Right after the pizzas the sides/appetizers and desserts taunt you from a cooler covered with glass that seems to sparkle thanks to all the delicious treats inside
I could go on and on but basically the food is delicious and the wait times are manageable the food arrives within 10-15 minutes after you sit down if that
Amazing quality of meat and very fresh ingredients
The sandwich was meaty and tasty albeit a cold sandwich
They are very tasty even without the sauce with a nice peppery rub that did not dry out the meat
As a third generation semi-native of Arizona and part Mexican myself I can say without reservation that the food here is plentiful for all the big eaters out  there but as far as authentic or even flavorful I would not waste my time
One of the things I look for in a Mexican restaurant that gives me a pretty good idea that the food is decent is by how many actual Mexicans are eating there
We paid $18 for the food even after the coupon and I honestly think that even at the price it might be a bit of a rip off considering you can get cheaper higher quality sushi at Teharu
The sad part is that the interior is very well done if the food was actually good this place would be extremely interesting
The southwest egg rolls were good they're always a favorite of mine
Everything was delicious no complaints and all just that i did not have any room left for dessertwhich i picked out even before i picked my entree
The food came out fast the restaurant was nearly empty and it was excellent
Sushi station has a ton of variety and the other choices are plentiful and high quality
The food is good the service is good the selection is good; I'd sum up that in general it was 'good'
The had oatmeal granola and quinoa bowls with fruit a tofu scramble and a variety of breakfast and dessert baked goods
The food always come out pipping hot bursting with flavor
Do yourself a favor and break away from the mundane chain restaurants and visit this locally owned and operated New Mexican restaurant where it's clear the owners care about their food quality service and most importantly you - the customer
The food has no great flavors and tastes overly microwaved or possibly like it came in a bag from Sysco
The dish was small by diner standards but very good tasting and filling
My mom had their bloody mary a thick but delicious fresh blend of horseradish and veggies
They were crunchy creamy and smothered in corned beef not those flavorless bacon bits you'll find at Friday's or Applebee's
Had the Panang Curry chicken and it was very good
Good amount of chicken and good amount of rice on the side
Good prices cozy friendly restaurant and good food
Make sure you get a dessert to go so you can split it with family or co-workers My boss calls this place Calorie Jumper with good reason to
We also tried a couple of sushi rolls and the gyoza appetizer
I would recommend Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen as a better quality experience
If you are looking for a interesting bar with fair seafood appetizers this may be ok but as a fine dining experience I would pass on this one
luckily every issue we've had has been with confidence for the front of house stuff speaking up looking at you in the eyes -- the food is always excellent  generally they don't always offer everything on the menu but it's generallty the cod or sole
I have eaten here several times and always found the food to be good but pretty greasy
While driving back to the office the scent of the hot food was KILLING ME
My girlfriends and I have been there for ladies lunch and enjoyed the all you can eat pizza and salad
The good score isn't just about the pizza though our service was GREAT
Save yourself the calories and skip the dessert it was not worth it
The ordering process was easy and the food was delicious
I'd recommend this place because of her even if the food was bad
The food was of decent restaurant quality and definitely a good place to get steaks but it was no where near the quality you would get from Texas Roadhouse or Outback and neither is the price
Pool was nice bed was comfortable TV reception sucked room and bathroom was big towels felt like sand paper parking was terrible food was good but pricey even for that place
The food is good and cheap - think a slighly more upscale Filiberto's without the resulting stomach ache
Our server was very quick to get the food out  which seems like a good thing but was also ready for us to leave ASAP
The meat & veggie quality seems to be high
I wouldn't have minded paying that much for a good Italian meal but the food was not worth it
Food was about as good as what I remember of hospital food
They have tasty sandwiches delicious and organic desserts items perfect for any dietary restriction and plenty of snacks that will keep your tummy satisfied and your waistline small
Some people don't need atmosphere to enjoy really good food
Good selection of comfort food in a hip industrial space
This place is a good place to come watch a game or UFC or just for getting some food
Effort is put into putting together quality dishes but one piece of advice
We had the plato tradicional appetizer a platter of Salvadoran specialties - for $9 you get two pupusas of your choice two beef empenada-like things three fried yucca things and a chicken tamale
If you want a nice exposure to different Salvadoran dishes I highly recommend this as a meal for one or a starter for two or three
Next we had some chicken dish with onions in a gravy-like sauce--also delicious--that came with a side of rice and beans and a salad that was just some iceberg and tomato with a wedge of lime
The price is right the service is friendly and the food is delicious
Their pizza is very good and they make rib-eye / romaine / crispy onion salad that is amazing called the Beefstro
They gave us champagne massaged our feet forever and  my toes were smiling when I left The food was fresh tasty and of course not too filling
Some tried the Cuban Sandwich the Steak Sandwich Chicken Sandwich and I had the Cuban Shrimp in creole sauce with the rice & beans just wonderful
I swear my eyes almost rolled back in my head it was THAT good
So - if you want extra good pizza and skip the salad Zpizza is your game
The egg rolls were actually pretty good
and the pizzas were quite  decent though not really hot
Good hostess + decent service + lousy drinks + lousy and mediocre food = a place I'm not running to ever visit again
excellent value for money 45 piece sashimi platter for $45 is your best bet and mostly fresh fish
The best tasting thing was the miso soup bulgogi was bland sushi was bland calamari was overfried and just not good
Skye in a nutshellDrinks Pretty damn goodFood Decent nothing spectacularMusic Great esp after drinks - an older British fellow and his Bonnie Tyler-wannabe partner do a pretty decent job of getting the fifty-somethings up to do The Hustle although to be honest it's more like the Shuffle with that crowd
The meat in general has to be good I usually stick to the ribs
just a big friendly restaurant good food and lots of memorabilia in a nice atmosphere of dark wood and crisp white linens
For dessert donuts with caramel sauce - very tasty
Moving on to the food options they have a large selection of cold and warm sandwiches as well as salads
The food 2 mini samples i got were delicious but the wait was too horrible
Seester ordered some finger food fried zucchini & mushrooms $3 and a bowl of american fries $3 and both were very tasty
Food was always average but service was either very good or very bad
The food certainly isn't good enough to tolerate that
Steamers seems to be a Phoenix/Scottsdale staple for good seafood
The menu has some good combination dishes and a mix of seafood staples and chef creations
Waiter was friendly however that did not make up for the quality of food
First time in a CPK was not thoroughly impressed with the food
The food wasn't horrible just wasn't worth the money spent
All i know at this time is the food is amazing and i cannot wait to go back
Perfectly fried very meaty and their wing sauce is not too spicy it was delicious
Give it a try Cant go wrong with nice people and good food
The food is a good value for what you get so I'll add another star
The food can be a bit bland but it's consistent and good
While it's still not a 5-start spot nor the best Thai restaurant in town the service and food quality has been noteworthy recently and I have been pleased with every visit
On this visit I got the fried dumplings the original chow mein the orange chicken meal and a bowl of hot and sour soup
The dumplings were deep fried potstickers chicken filling served with a ginger-garlic-soy dipping sauce that I really enjoyed 6 come to an order I had 2
The orange chicken meal came with a good portion of chicken white rice fresh steamed broccoli and fresh fruit apple kiwi grapes strawberry
The orange chicken its not the Panda Express orange chicken and while not as orange flavored as I like it was very good the rice perfectly steamed and chopstick friendly
you may save a few bucks and that's a maybe but the quality of the food is so mundane
One door is closing for us and Costco is regaining our business back by offering high quality organic foods and to die for half and half for only pennies more than were were paying Fresh and Easy
We feel downgrading the quality and raising the price is deceitful and dishonest not to mention a potential toxic addition to our all ready overloaded with toxins world
After all great atmosphere and sangria should enhance the food not mask the fact that it's really overpriced and not that flavorful
I have absolutely no problem paying good money for a small plate that is really flavorful and is large enough for 2-3 people to get several bites of the dish
I just can't get too thrilled about a place where the food--the crowning glory of any great European restaurant--isn't that flavorful and isn't generously enough portioned to allow everyone in the group to really share in the flavor experience
Every cut of meat--the lamb steak and fish was excellent
Be prepared to skip an appetizer and save room for dessert--it's by far the best I've had anywhere in PHX
The pizza was very good and fresh--no complaints about taste
The gluten-free pizzas were apparently quite good and some of our other guests liked the pasta plates they got
Chicken skewers were good but small portions
Restrooms were miles apart and too few in number the food was overpriced for the quality and the vendors lacked any imaginative products
and Pink Pepper has some very good Thai food
The food's quality is superior to any of the upscale fast food burrito chains it may even be better than many full service restaurants but you'll get a lot more for your money at those other places
Everyone elses food was really good  we are samplers so I can't really give them a bad review
I have been here a few times over the years and the food is pretty good
Sometimes but not always there pitas can taste a little stale as if they were sitting out to long but all in all the food is quite tasty
Maxim is my favorite restaurant based on quality of food but the service has become very unfriendly to the point that I feel uncomfortable even picking up my food there
The broth had a much stronger beef flavor than the balance I'm used to at Maxim
5 stars for delicious and inexpensive food such a friendly server and for being generous with the portions
The place is a little strange b/c it is cowboy/ranchy but the food is very modern and VERY GOOD
We started with a pasta dish on their menu as an appetizer and a pork cheek ravioli
The hotel recommended True Food to satisfy my needs as well as my non-veg coworker
Pizza is unique the pretzels are ridiculously good
Just be patient if it is taking a little longer than normal because the food is well worth the wait
They did a BBQ and the meat was dried out buns seemed stale the sides did not have much flavor
Never in a million years did I think Irish food would be tasty
I normally hate corned beef and cabbage but their version is served with a very tasty gravy and has a ton of flavor
I can't put into words how amazing the food is and the service is just as good
If this hasn't convinced you yet it's soooo cheap for the quality of food that's served
I kept waiting for a catch or food poisoning or something because it was just too good to be true but no no catch or food poisoning
Now to the food and as much as I enjoyed my turkey curry sandwich and my butternut squash creme brulee I don't think without my groupon I can justify the prices
If you haven't been to this place I would say for sure check it out they have a lot of local goodies and desserts and as stated on a nice day you can't beat the setting
As for the quality of the meat the chicken breasts were good and the chicken tenders seemed a little old
I was so hoping that this place would have good Chinese food
From 3-7 just about all their appetizers and a good portion of their sushi is  1/2 price
Now being a vegetarian it's hard to get excited about a veggie roll but they also have some great appetizers  pineapple cream cheese wontons veggie tempura and my favorite which is their Dengaku Tofu
Leaving room for some dessert The Blue Mountain Coffee has got me on full alertMan looking so good got a girl doing the slurp slurpHe's trying not to get hurtAs he reaches for the sweetLove'n potato pudd'nOverall Breadfruit was the bombFelt like I was in Jamaica passing that bong
I was eyeing the porkwich but I also appreciate a healthy meal I love home-made kale chips if that gives you a good idea of my tolerance for healthy stuff so my friend and I decided to split a couple dishes
The wine selection was excellent but the food needed just a little tweaking
However I don't remember how good the food options are in Terminal 2 so
I recommend trying one of the lavosh pizzas the bruscetta variety was delicious without feeling too heavy
What I do know however is that it is indeed that good if not better than I ever dreamed simple breakfast foods could be
It's a great place to go for fresh healthy delicious food
I saw food that looked really good being served to other tables
Unfortunately the food was not as good as it looked and certainly not as good as the restaurants interior would have you believe
The Pilgrimage to this wee building on a small side street in downtown PHX was made on a cold rainy Sunday - perfect weather for comfort food
After strategic review of the menu consisting of a price volume mix analysis to determine the right combination of entrees and side items to reach Pareto Optimality my friend and I ended up with a table full of goodnessLo-Lo plate 2 waffles + 3 chicken breasts 1 additional waffle home fries and no surprise here mac n cheese
Each were very good in their own unique ways the meat was good quality and everything had the appropriate amounts of seasoning and flavor
The only slip up this place maybe has is that my girlfriend that was with me who doesn't eat meat was not overly impressed
They also have a smoked salmon sandwich and I also tried a chicken curry soup that was really freeking good
Recently this place has become busier so they raised their prices and the quality of the food has decreased tremendously
We had two desserts-the lavender creme brulee and the lemon cake-both excellent
All in all the food is good they just need to serve larger portions
Francis must be the patron saint of deliciousness the best food you might have ever had
We were not shy in ordering several appetizers and a few pizzas plus dessert for our party of six
Here's what we ordered and our impressionsAppetizers Il Tagliere an assortment of Italian Meats and Cheeses - 4* this is absolutely the best thing on the menu for a groupBresaola - 3* the table seemed to devour this oneCaprese Salad - 3* standard deal the pesto was a nice touchEntreesLa Noce - 3* the arugula did not seem that fresh the crust was very plain and flavorless the sauce was a little sweetProsciutto Crudo - 3* my parents asked them to add some pecorino on top
They liked this pizza but it was a little bland to their likingSiena - 3* the table seemed to like this pizza the best the spek was an interesting addition though I don't eat pork and DH liked itDessertsFresca crepe - 5* this was absolutely delicious and we ordered a second one for the table
My experience--I enjoyed the casual atmosphere the service was speedy and the food was great for no more than $8
Taste and quality of the food were typical for a diner - OK not great but the pancakes were definitely more than I could finish
your acoustics aren't great and your tables do need a bit of cleaning but your food is so delicious I see and hear nothing else
Huge piece of perfectly grilled fish crunchy salad with cilantro salsa guac and black beans and cute little hot corn tortillas on the side
The veggie rolls were tasty and larger than we're used to which was a nice surprise
I'm a big fan and lover of Pita Jungle and have frequented the original Tempe location numerous times ever since hs back in 98 and have enjoyed many chicken shwarmas and hummus plates BUT the Chandler location rocks
The rest of party had ordered Kalbi sul lung tang a hearty luxuriant beef broth made from ox bones and champong hot spicy noodle
GREAT date night spot great place to get together with a group of friends great for appetizers just dessert wine anything you can think of
Great western decor outstandingly delicious food good old-fashion hospitality
I am amazed of do called 'experts' on food who slam this place they just do not know no better on what a good authentic gyro is
The flavor of the fish combined with the sauces was incredible
We couldn't even think of dessert but it sounded amazing from the descriptions on the menu
While the food here is pretty good there is much tastier pizza around the valley like at pizzeria bianco and la gran Orange
We began by asking for our waitress' recommendations on food and ended up ordering four dishes that she mentioned five total  -  Tortilla Espanola This was one that she didn't mention but some Yelpers did so we started with what appeared to be potatoes au gratin minus the cheese served in the form of deep-dish pie with sour cream drizzled on top
i could have gone down the street to khai hoan which i highly recommend to those who really want to know what good vietnamese food taste like where their service is fast their price is much more reasonable and their food is superb
I don't claim to know Mexican food or it's various subgenres but I did live in San Diego for three years and I've definitely had what I would call over-the-top blow your socks out your a** good Mexican food
Other than the service the food was delicious but I'm not sure if the high prices suited the dishes
The food is all consistently good the drinks are good and the service is great
I had jerk chicken and at first I was not overly impressed
But the flavors are just more subtle than I am used to in this type of food and by the fourth bite was was sold
It doesn't get much better if you're looking for good food
What keeps me coming back to the 'Dillo is the perfect blend of- Delicious food drink or no drink- Reasonable drink prices- Servers who go out of their way to learn about their customers Yes 2PM on a Monday can be depressing
This sounded on paper like a dish that had potential for some flavor
If I were cooking that dish it would have been cooked in butter which would have helped but none of the ingredients were that tasty on their own
Hot rolls and real butter always appreciated
Something else that makes it bearable-Yelping good food
The roast beef was sliced very thin but there was a good amount so much that my mom deconstructed her sandwich
The beef had a good texture but the sandwich overall was pretty bland
Overall the food was pretty good for the price the service attentive and the place busy but still conducive to pleasant conversation
Excellent food worth the price the menu has classics your choices of burgers and mesquite-grilled meats and some more imaginative dishes
A good choice 5+ of salad bases to combine with either of 5+ meat/fish small portions on top
Best dish was the soup - a beef chili that had amazing flavor
I can think of worse evils than going back and forth and eating good pizza and glorious Tirumusu all night long all right-LOL
I promised him I would bring my friend in for some good pizza  and desert and his response was just so funny
This place has the typical bar food and a good selection of beer
good food in a car wash/convenience store
The BBQ platter with a 1/4 chicken macaroni salad and potato salad was quite tasty  but way too big of a portion for me
My friends got the cheese pizza and they were unimpressed by it
The only way I can think of to describe the quality of the food is that it was cooked by a line cook and not a chef
Each roll was packed with thin slices of pork and 3 good size shrimps
While I was impressed by the amount of pork and shrimp the roll tasted dry and not very refreshing
After much deliberation and asking for recommendations I chose the Chicken Tikka Masala pasty
The charro beans fresh tortillas guacamole and rice were wonderful additions to the almost overwhelming amount of food
Go here for happy hour $2 drinks and good food
Tom & Dina serve up wonderful pizza gyros & sandwiches at a very reasonable price
The service was friendly the food was good but if you can't keep reservations don't take them and sure as heck don't offer them
However Denny's food is realllllly good now
I did hear about them revamping their menu and really working on improving their food and believe me when I say they did a really good job
If your in the mood for chinese and you dont want to drive very far  they will hook u up but make no mistake its not good chinese food
This place had some seriously amazing Louisiana style sea food dishes
The food itself was very rich and delicious
The mushroom pizza is delicious and the lettuce wraps are pretty good
We were all full after the entrees but decided that dessert would be a good ending to this phenomenal meal
It's a sweet roll with mango on top though which isn't what I usually prefer but the presentation was awesome and it looked delicious
Sushi was decent the gyoza was delicious and crispy
We sampled the Hayden roll that was ordered by another couple and it was VERY spicy from the jalapeno but delicious
Food has great Flavor and the hotter sauce was good enough to drink although I had to ask for it
Didn't taste too fishy but had a nice full lobster flavor
was good the cake was passable and the cut fruit didn't add or detract much from the dish
Our food was prepared quickly and the service was good for being as busy as they were
As mentioned this isn't the most cost effective meal if you're on a budget but for the quality of the food I'm ok with that
They both were delicious and generous with the crab meat
Our friend ordered this sushi-like dish Hiramasa ceviche that he shared with us it was delicious and fresh-tasting
Mom and I split the Los Hungos huaraches dish which was mushroom it was delicious and warm
Overall this place is great high quality foods and toppings and a great staff
I got the chicken tortilla soup to start off with and it was soooo bland and flavorless and loaded with tons of cheesy goop
When I feel like great mexican food this place is as good as it gets and I'm not even mexican I'm central american
In fact all the rolls were very flavorful
Roka Akor was a combination of excellent service ambiance and most importantly exceptional food with a wide variety of great dishes to choose from including hot and cold plates tempura grilled steaks seafood sushi as well as a diverse selection of drinks cocktails sake shochu and beer
This place is quite pricey especially because you want to try so many of the dishes but well worth it
We ordered small plates and a dessert and none of it was good
I would have more inclined to give Green House a 5 star rating had a couple of poor Customer Service issues not occurred because the food was excellentFirst we ordered drinks there were 4 of us but only 3 drinks were ordered
I think its a shame as I said the food was excellent and hope that the owner or manager reads this
The curry had a nice flavor with nice small pieces of chicken with juliened red bell peppers
We need low-priced good food with college-kid-type prices
corned beef hash was pretty salty county potatoes very good
I am sorry Julia T on so many levelsThe other day I happened to be trolling around The Biltmore infecting people with my excessively shiny good mood when I happened across Teavana and the lovely ladies out front providing samples of their Jasmine Dragon tea
If there are good fresh biscuits this could be a great dish
curse their delicious yet filling coffee and desserts
I go to the chili's by ASU a lot and the food is generally fine it is what it is but it's convenient and good
Not the best sushi  but it's prolly the most decent place to go to if you're looking for good sushi in Tempe
The tacos were loaded with fish and very very good
All in all the food surprisingly good
I ordered the Yahoo on Foccacia Hot sandwich with roast beef mushrooms and cheese potato salad and had a raspberry iced tea
There was plenty of food and the shrimp was higher quality than the standard tiny-and-too-hard-to-chew of AZ Mexican restaurants
Good place to go grab some not so expensive sushi
While not exactly the most amazing food it was tasty in the way that sometimes you get something at a food court at the mall  that's tasty
Toasted bun tasty meat and not greasy at all
The pesto chicken pizza is amazing I've had it while sober too
Their coffee is pretty good and they have a much bigger selection of snacks food drinks and toiletries than you'll find at other gas stations
I have to say that I was still remarking the next day about the excellent quality of the food
Lovely atmosphere delicious food and service with a smile
All the dishes use your typical flavor enhancers like some kind of hot or garlic when you can't add the good stuff like butter cream and cheese
The food is always delicious and the selection more unique than other restaurants
I'd hate to see a wonderful restaurant such as Crackers lose their edge in this competitive food service industry
In this case the food was good but not amazing
The PB Bomb which our server brought out for dessert was really tasty and I would recommend this if you are looking for a nice way to end your meal
Awesome fresh produce lots of freshly prepared foods a good bakery section and cheap fresh meats
Various cheeses meats salsas and hot foods such as tamales tacos and elote await your taste buds
It was definitely enough food to feed 4 people and everything tasted excellent
The slight flavor of the sliced green onions really made the dish something special
I got home at 1115PM and I am glad my fishing license is good until 2010
The rest of the food I tasted was good
It tasted good but there was only a small albeit very fresh piece of romaine to go with it so if you like a burger that is pretty much just meat and starch this is the burger for you
Very tasty light and my whole meal including dessert was under $12
The menu is a throwback to the good ole' days of diner foods
Nothing super amazing but definitely better than your run-of-the-mill pizza joint
It's a wonderful Middle Eastern and Mediterranean food market and THE BEST place to buy olives oils middle eastern spices and pita bread
It's the same wonderful aroma and quality of food but they've made some changes to their menu
The chicken and beef schawarma are both some of the best in town but I prefer the Shish Taook ~ two huge skewers of grilled to perfection chicken seasoned in taook spices on top of a large bed of seasoned and delicious rice served with hummus mixed pickles tomatoes and their garlic sauce
I also recommend getting some of their small meat cheese or cheese with spinach pies the small square ones that are folded heated for an appetizer and share a plate of hummus
Their homemade pasta dishes are also very good
Anyway it is nice to have a cozy friendly Italian spot with good food so close to home
Their dishes have a distinct flavor that is very good not overwhelming at all but not just the same old
Mamma always taught me what good Italian food was from her homemade recipes and this was instilled and passed along to my wop a$$
I never imagined that food was served and excellent food at that
Personal favorites homemade chicken noodle soup odd for an Italian place I know freshly grated cheese in their shakers which I eat as an appetizer in itself and their alfredo sauce which is NOT to be messed with
Aside from the excellent food which is the reason for the 5 star rating this place is a bar
Every plate that I saw delivered to a customer looked pretty tasty and piled high with food
All the dishes were fresh flavorful and plated beautifully
It was fresh cool spacious rooms really nice bathroom good food in the cafe
The jade red chicken on it's own is wonderful but pairing it with black beans or putting it in a gooey cheese quesadilla just enhances the whole experience
The best value is their happy hour and the food choices at happy hour are moderately varied and fairly good
The crab in the dish seemed frozen and did not have a good flavor or consistency
Why pay $18 bucks for a cold pre-made pizza when there's so many other options
I included the prices of our entrees and they were a bit high but when my Mom is willing to overlook the higher costs to have another slice of that wonderful pizza w/ such tender chunks of filet and pungent bleu cheese we ate all but a small slice which I took home and ate for dinner that evening
The food is fresh and bright and delicioso the atmosphere is pretty good the clientele are upscale and eclectic
This is a good spot except that we are starting to get  bit bored by the food
Only complaint I have is of their 4 sauces I only loved oneSweet & Mild but the meat was so tender juicy & delicious it didn't need much sauce if at all
My favorite Caribbean side dish is fried plantains and Caribbean Fusion's version was pretty good
I'm talkin' really delicious Italian food
Everything I had here was excellent- the app the entree the dessert- all delicious
I also got to try my boyfriend's food and everything was delicious as well
The BF and I waaaay overate but it was worth every tasty bite of the ahi sandwich with Asian slaw seafood combo plate chocolate malt and chocolate-coconut bars
On the positive side my main dish was the Caribbean chicken which was delicious and a large portion size
You have sandwiches pizza pasta bowls appetizers
I have come to believe that most of us generally desire that unique union of a robust menu composed of carefully planned and executed dishes with a splash of unique drinks a dazzling wine selection excellent service that offer suggestions to round out a dining experience and finally an atmosphere that lets us focus on our palette not our survival instincts
Starting with the appetizers the oyster and shellfish platters were well done and exceptionally fresh especially when you consider we are in the middle of the desert
The atmosphere is a typical BBQ lunch place; lotsa chotchkies on the wall;  I do like that they have a hand washing station stationed right smack in the dining area - I was able to quickly wash before and after my tasty BBQ meal lotsa sticky fingers; they also are generous with big bottles of about 5 different BBQ sauces on the table as well s giant rolls of brown paper towels smart
The sauce is hand-made from scratch at Stacy's the meat is smoke tender and there is nothing about this restaurants food that isn't good
The food is consistently good and the employees are generally friendly and accommodating
Everything came out in great time and our beers were cold and food hot
So happy to have a sports bar in our 'hood that has decent greasy food and cold beers on draft
Had it been reduced by 50% it would have had a lot more flavor and would have actually adhered to the veggies and chicken
The food is VERY good very fresh and great presentation
The last time I was there I had a really good seafood pasta I don't remember the name it was one of their specials and it was really good for the most part the shrimp was a little overcooked though
I have enjoyed every other pasta dish I have had there and the chicken dishes I have tried were very good too
I need to try the pizza sometime it looks good I am just typically more of a pasta person
The food is very good and there are infinite possibilities to how your wrap or salad can be prepared
Their hummus was so delicious full of flavor but not overwhelming that I had to thank our server for her wonderful service and the amazing food
The service can be a bit slow but you can't rush delicious food
I order my jerk chicken she recommends different sides to go with my food
It seemed a bit bland it if wasn't for the amazing cornbread would not have completed the dish
The food isn't the best ever by any means but it's always been pretty damn good
I've taken the fam here before too and we had the typical everything pizza and also have tried their pasta which was good too
I started off with every intention of a good review about this place because the food was amazing and because I love to give props to local joints popping up in Sky Harbor
Also oddly enough chicken one of the hardest things to find in the entire section you can walk 10 feet of meat but if you want something a bit more healthy good luck
The deli another area that really leaves me scratching my head always pushing house brands pre-sliced mystery meat on sale and always what they gravitate to first before you tell them you want something more high end or a name brand and my experience the hams aren't very good Safeway Brand not sure what it is but they never satisfy my taste buds so I order something better
i'm definitely not a mexican food connoisseur but i definitely know fresh tasty and homemade food -- and this is where it's at
there was enough depth of flavor for all dishes to be interesting and enough simplicity to make it casual and easy to eat
I say iconic because I can't tell you how many times the restaurant has been recommended to me by locals resort concierges foodies etc
The mac and cheese was shaped like slice of meatloaf with crispy edges and the cold tomato salsa seemed fresh but  for some reason didn't  really make a good match
It may also be due to the fact that they have a great prix-fix deal on Mondays where you can get almost any appetizer entree and dessert combination for just $37
I think if you have fresh high quality seafood then you should just let the flavor of the food shine through
She calls it good Jew food; I call it happiness between sliced marble rye
The food is decent but sure as heck not worth the poor management and poor service
I am so pleased this neighborhood cove found its way to realizing the fortune this hood can provide given the right prices decent food a chill patio and good service
We shared an apple dessert which was very good as well
So much amazing food - and the pitcher of margaritas was also fresh and fabulous
Got a specialty pizza and some honey hot wings
so we walked away with a lot of food but were not that impressed
The pizza was good and settled our rumbling stomach pains but didn't eat leftovers and leftover pizza is one of my favs
for me to pass on it was a sad morning when i usually would have went for that cold pizza which of course is breakfast of champions
Would my search for good Chinese food within the confines of the greater Phoenix area come to an end at Jimmy Woo's
FYI not only do water chestnuts lack flavor but I'm not even sure if they are really food
But to have decent Chinese food that is actually quite good in the Phoenix area that is worth a slightly higher price
Yet again another incredible independent business playing a huge roll in the amazing resurrection of Downtown Phoenix
While waiting for our food we enjoyed our drinks and looked at the memorabilia of John Wayne who frequented Casa Grande often and the San Francisco Giants who had trained in the Casa Grande area
The food was excellent served promptly and in large portions
Good food in a comfortable and casual environment
My husband had chicken in an artichoke cream sauce and it was very good as well
I am sure that was not intended and is probably just my pet peeve and not a reason not to return to a place that had really good food in a beautiful setting
With that being said the food was fresh and absolutely delicious -- a welcome relief from all of the franchise food we've experienced since moving here about a month ago
I was surprised how many people came in while we were there it's not good food
It took nearly an hour to get our food and when we did 2 of the 3 plates we ordered were cold and one of them the nutter didn't have the extras that we ordered on it
I have to admit that the food was really good
A small family-run type of restaurant; friendly service good food and speedy
Good food and a good place to go for a quick lunch
The pie was good but the entire time we were eating dessert there was this awful burnt garlic smell assaulting my nose
I'm a blonde hair blue-eyed Italian and I have made more flavorful Mexican dishes at home
We can both enjoy a glass of wine a night under the stars and delicious pizza for under $50
Quick friendly service good food and drinks good prices
But when you want good BBQ'd meat do you really trust someone that spent too much time baking
The only reason why I gave it 3 stars was because I've been twice and wasn't extremely impressed with the food
They brought the butterfish out first; it was good but not as good as some of the other reviews made it out to be
It's the best quality fish I've ever seen which made it worth every penny
The managers were beyond great the staff was awesome the food was good and its so amazing when customer service is a valued part of business
OMG ssssoooo much food that I found to be all so tasty but a few family members weren't that impressed pssh
So my wife & I sat down and had a delicious sushi lunch in the middle of our grocery shopping
The fries & clam chowder were good but the fish had absolutely no flavor at all & the cole slaw was just as bland
My wife loved the Chicken Salad Pita which had a nice flavor and spicy finish
The pizza here was good but not the greatest
It is not worth the 3 to 5 hour wait just to get a pizza
The service at this location is typically good and they bring the food to the table quickly
Flavor was spot on meat was fresh off the grill hot and welcomed into the perfectly toasted bun
The service was great even though they were busy  i went at lunch  they were quick getting the food to the table and it was piping hot
Yes the wine the appetizers and the food was simply that good
Try the blacken Wasabi Fish also a good choice
and have always found the food good the lady behind the counter unfriendly the decor an eyesore one of the reasons why I never ate in and the harsh florescent lighting makes the surrounding even more unpleasant
The food is consistently good and the service consistently poor
The atmosphere is okay the service is good you don't wait forever for your food
For dessert they had 6 different flavors of ice cream chocolate cake strawberry cake flan angel cake and cookies -- all mediocre
Just a mild flavored oil tossed with slightly charred noodles beef and veggies
The service is good and the food is great
This place is great for Breakfast but don't be surprised if you have to wait to find a seat because this place can get very busy and that doesn't surprise me since the food is absolutely amazing
The plate came with two delicious sopapillas filled with ground beef and generous portions of rice and beans
And the other amazing part was that they give you a sopapilla for dessert too
After ordering our meal we asked for the non filtered sake and the waitress said it was definitely a good pairing for our food selection it would nutralize the heat with the suttle sweetness man was she right it was like horchata
The sushi is about as good as most places here in AZ maybe a little better than the average but not stellar off the chart good
The food is pretty good and the menu is pretty typical brewery pub fare
The Southwestern Chicken Sandwich I had last night was pretty good but for some reason the bottom bun became really soggy shortly after I received the order
I'm not a huge dessert person especially chocolate ones but it was good
It has a lot of flavor- I highly recommend this dish
The pizza was delicious and what really makes it is their italian dressing
Don't pass this place up for tasty pizza and pasta
Each of us went for the $67 Waygu Rib Eye - and the quality of the meat was worse than an Outback sirloin
As they were served I thought mine looked a little bland but assumed all the good stuff was buried under the pile of iceburg and chicken breast cut into three pieces
The chicken had no flavor the garlic chipotle chili dressing was excruciatingly mild and all that iceburg just annoyed me
So much food but too good not to eat it all
The pizza was amazing especially the crust
It's right in Old Town the food is good and the margaritas are cheap and large
She makes sure to leave every single dish on the table just in case you missed one delicious crumb
The sushi is WAY too expensive for the quality
It's not BAD sushi it's just not worth $10 a roll
But this isn't the kind of pizza where you eat the good stuff and leave the crust
Their prices are modest and the menu is ripe with dishes all of such delicious properties as to make you come back and sample and savour every new choice
Food was really good and the portions were huge
Oh and it's good fish and chips the sad part is that it's hefty so unless you're really just craving alot of fish you'll only be able to handle one serving of fish and chips that it'll be too hard to stomach a second plate
Overall a good pub to hang out have some fish and chips drink some pints of black velvet for me and have a good time
While the food is super delicious for the price ~$8
I recommend the Crispy Spinach '2' dish that is on the menu under house specialties; it's a bed of fried spinach with a spicy chicken shrimp and vegetable medley on top
The wonton soup is also very good a little different than I'm used to; the wontons here are filled with meat and seafood
All the seafood at C-Fu is wonderful very fresh and prepared the way you ask for it
The short version good sushi decent prices decent service decent atmosphere
Compared to some other choices Sushi101=small cramped poor quality; RA=dirty smelly loud it seems to be the best in our book
Let me tell you- if you ever have a hot date or an apology to make do it over wine and dessert crepes at Cibo
You can tell the makers put a lot of thought in finding the right spices and flavors in creating healthy choice dishes
Their hummus is extra smooth and creamy just like most of the rest of their food which can only be good
the food is pretty good and sometimes really freaking good
amazing even though Mcdonalds in general is a 1 star place i loved spicy chicken sandwich
The ball room fitted many hundreds of people and the service and food was excellent
I'll be back for the good food and friendly neighborhood service
While all the food was amazing the Grapefruit & Hamachi was my favorite
Dessert wise the crepes with nutella are lip-smacking good as well as the nutella shake
It was a Kraiser roll but cracked just enough to amazing
hmmmso this employee didn't assume i was trying to get new dishes for the holidays he took care of me and was super helpful in assisting me find quality dishes
I have yet to try dessert I always get too full from my meal to try it but they look very tasty
Granted it's not the best food I've ever had but there is a lot to like about this chain and the food IS of good quality
The place is tiny - but it's packed full of good food and good people
Next on my list from these great people is Baratin - they just opened up a little wine bar cafe and I'm sure the food is going to be just as amazing
But the pad thai and beef panang were both good
50 lunch special with a pot sticker a green salad and stir fried chicken with peanuts plus added a pot of hot Jasmine Tea for another $2
Attentive service and good value but average quality food
The stir fry vegetables were hot and tasty but I was not impressed with the texture of the chicken
Place is at a good location but service OK & food quality OK
Quality of food and freshness were horrible  only ate a small amount because it was a family function 1 hr from home and I was starving
I've been craving a good roast beef sandwich for a few days now and finally had the chance to venture out someplace new to fill the near bottomless pit that is my stomach
Food Quality over all was very good I will order from them again but I'll never order the sesame chicken again
Next time I'll skip the fries and stick to the single burger which for a fast food burger was pretty tasty
For dessert my son enjoyed the chocolate dipped strawberries and I had the Oreo Fudge chocolate cake
The hot food came out hot and the cold food came out cold just as it should be and right on time despite the packed house
Hubby and I usually go to Scottsdale for really good Thai food
We started out with the chicken satay appetizer
While the flavor was pretty good the bright orange color and slightly rubbery texture of the chicken was a little off-putting
White meat was a bit dry but the dark meat was very tasty
As an aside I used the leftover chicken in a fried rice dish I made the next day really good flavor and the Pad Thai actually tasted better the next day
As for the people who say expensive - I don't know where they are eating but this is very reasonable especially for this quality of food
The fact that the food doesn't just taste good if you've smoked your breakfast is star number two
As for food we got three appetizers guacamole and chips slider trio and buffalo wings
The kitchen is open pretty late the food is excellent there's no cover and the food/drink prices are reasonable
The buffet was really good with a lot of dishes
However I'm not that impressed by the rolls
but as far as food is concerned its amazing
The starter menu includes some unusual and tasty items like the hot and cold wedge salad and a Kobe beef foot long hotdog
The dessert fry bread gotta go honey w/powdered sugar is also amazing
Overall the food was as good as what I would expect at a Church's or a KFC
Especially now that they moved into a new larger building they are super fast and have delicious food
The waitress sounded like a sad embarrassed corporate robot giving us a memorized recitation about their aged beef stash and some special gourmet appetizer that is actually just a taquito yawn
The guy working the front desk at the Holiday Inn at which I'm staying recommended this place and given that it was only about a 10-minute walk and I had a hankering for authentic nonchain Mexican food I thought I would give it a whirl
The food there was plenty of it came out fairly quickly and was hot
The family was worried that when they left Chicago for Phoenix back in the 70's they wouldn't be able to find good pizza
We got to the table determined to see if the food was worth the aggravation
Of course the best sweet potato fires are at Delux but these were pretty good for a pizza joint
I had the portobello chicken pasty and it was wonderful
I tried mostly cold dishes such as Greek salad chickpea salad grape leaves etc and they were quite tasty not the top quality but good enough considering this is buffet food
I found falafel and chicken were bit dry but still tasty
and their waitstaff need to learn to get food to the table while it's hot because I've never received a hot meal here
Food comes out hot delicious and I've never turned down a plate due to a wrong order or something not cooked properly
We also got a thin crust pepperoni pizza which was also very good
The Republic Ramen dish was good and spicy
My bf had the stuffed chicken breast coleslaw dill mashed potatoes and I forgot what else Never having schnitzel I was a little nervous but it was SO GOOD
Even my 20 month old son who refuses to eat meat ate this and didn't even realize he was eating bacon because it was soo delicious
If you are in the Glendale/northwest Phoenix area and are craving good Chinese food this is the place to go
The quality of the food is definitely above that of most of the Chinese restaurants in this area of the Valley
Since I'm often in this area often hungry and often craving good Chinese food and have a limited budget  I believe I've found a new favorite dining spot
Although not located in a choice area of Phoenix this establishment is clean has a very efficient staff and serves really good food - definitely better than in many of the good buffet establishments I have tried
for lunch here at opening day and was impressed by the appealing interior decor and the wide array of tasty choices which includes Mongolian grill they have killer mini-kebabs sushi clams in ginger-jalapeno broth as well as many of the staples in Chinese buffets but very nicely seasoned here
That's the happy consequence of having such a wide variety of good food available
Their dining experience has not been much better in terms of food quality and the last time we went there we were left standing for 10 minutes before anyone even ackowledged us
As a poor college student who loves pizza Slices is a good place to go
XDThey have a good selection of pizza [chicken pesto = fave
But that was okay we got two delicious pizzas out of it and the accommodated to us with the bill too
I had a mini Hawaiian pizza on my last trip and was delicious
Good variety on the menu sushi rolls brown or white rice noodles chicken steak seafood combo plates - the full gamut
Spicy Kani Roll and Shrimp Tempura Roll were so good
Delicious sauces hugely generous portions speedy service all for around $10 per dish
Good Chinese food - not from a chain - is hard to find in downtown phoenix
The prices are right there's a good variety of ethnic food the cashiers are quick and friendly and they're just helpful
Overall Exactly as advertised which is what I like about this place and the smallish menu emphases food of high quality
I followed the advice of several others and started with the smokehouse beef and cheddar brisket and it was sooo worth it
Service was good - I expected so much more from the food
Friendly staff good drinks and delicious food
The food is not as good as it once was and the portions looked smaller to me than previous visits and the $12 margaritas still get you way buzzed You will need that buzz to tolerate the parking and the awful wait where you are pretty much ignored by the flamboyant douche bag host who while has a hip cool shirt could offer people waiting some God Damn chips or something or even some f^&*@$g water or better yet acknowledge that I am indeed alive
You know what good food and a really small establishment do not make a great restaurant
Price-wise it was a lot of food for the money and you could tell it was high quality ingredients
Who know though maybe they're trying to target the 'My date's ugly but I want good food' crowd
they are soooooooooooooo good it's like beachside fish tacos without the freaking beach the taste smells and overall experience eating these totally delicious fish tacos can give you a mindf*** yes it's that good
it's soooooooo good so creamy so perfect with their fish taco and afterwards enjoying their horchata with fruit and cinnamon on top
It was juicy and had some flavor it was only because they use very fatty meat and salt the hell out of it
Parking can be pain but the food is tasty
The food was moist hot and above all nothing short of perfect
Very casual fast food ambiance but definitely dine-in restaurant quality
One thing I don't agree with is their fried chicken is not that good
I also went with the duck breast for the main course and enjoyed it very much but in looking back probably wished I ordered the catfish or short ribs since those also looked really good and my party finished them completely
Food  Very tasty diverse and I thought they could even increase prices
I realised today that I was so close but so far away from an amazingly delicious kitchen of Pappadeaux Seafood for those 4 long years
I had the California Chicken sandwich and substituted the broccoli for the friesThe chicken sandwich was excellent  very tasty
He did a great job making unique and tasty rolls and I have loved sushi ever since
Good evening Yelpers this is a live action review of the newest pizza joint on Mill
The sourdough crust also added another layer of flavor to the pizza
At $15 it was a fair price for a quality made-to-order pizza
The place does have a view of the fountain if you are there for the tourist thing but I would recommend going across the street to Euro Pizza
The saving grace here is that the food is quite good
quality ingredients Boar's Head meat and awesome bread
While they have a decent menu including some attempts at irish classics like boxty bangers and mash corned beef and cabbage and fish and chips which can be quite tasty the quality and tastiness just aren't there
The sushi was very fresh and of good quality and the menu was quite extensive with classic rolls and specialty rolls as well
Overall we liked the quaintness of the restaurant and thought the food was fresh and tasty
Also noticed they had burgers hot wings and pizza
I recommend this resturant if you want pizza pasta or even a slice of cheesecake but their sandwiches could use better quality of bread
Primebar has reasonable Happy hour pricing as well as premium drink choices and quality foodWe sampled the Pomegranate Martini ~ The Silly Goose ~ Margarita ~ Beer
After almost 15 minutes our food finally was ready although I can't understand the delay since neither one of us got any hot food that needed to be cooked
The price was right and the staff is friendly food A++++++++Good for lunch if you work in the downtown area not too packed
and a nice menu with good choices of good ol' American food
The roast beef was excellent and paired with the horseradish spread
there is another one that I lovecant think of the name but its pretty much chicken on a stick over a bed of cabbage with a wonderful sauce which is also an app
The one thing that I thoroughly enjoyed was the cinnamon apple desert pizza
I gave two stars because the fried chicken actually tasted good
I did like that there seemed to be a lot of regulars in the place which bodes well to me that the food will be very good
The spring rolls were excellent and so far have been the best I've had
The Pho was excellent; the broth was lovely and the cuts of meat were nice and lean and in the right size to enjoy without a struggle
Good news for me is that he is going to make chicken sancocho this weekend and I'm right around the corner
The BF got the meatloaf which was suuuuper good
Overall I think their food is good and if I had another groupon I would for sure come back as some of the food is a little pricey but if I came back without the deal I would skip the bruschetta skip the dessert and concentrate on some tasty entrees
After that i tried the hot food items that were all excellent
Favorite choices included the cauliflower eggplant chicken tikka masala and veggie tofu tikka as well as the mint hot and curry sauces
It's been several months since my last visit and I still recall the flavors of the individual ingredients on my pizza
But seriously the pizza is amazing and memorable
I sampled the garlic beef which they prepared with a kung pao brown sauce a decision Maggie and my wife arrived at after several minutes of discussion it had a nice robust flavor and the veggies were fresh and flavorful
All of the food came out very quickly and was extremely flavorful and robust without being too greasy or salty
If in the mood for lunch fare they have a wonderful chicken club sandwich
The best for last  the ribs are tender tasty  and meat falls of the bone
The chips and salsa are tasty the food has always been good
I had the Sesame Chicken which my three year old ate almost the whole plate - SO I ended up eating his Teriyaki Chicken which was very good too
They have a wonderful variety and it's a nice kick with meaty not-sweet menu
Very delicious12/11/07 - After having a veggie burger and fries for lunch at a Hard Rock Cafe I thought I'd balance it out by having something healthy for dinner - I ordered the Diablo Rice bowl with chicken and brown rice
Our food took about 10 minutes to come out I went to wash my hands in their bathroom and the water would not get hot no matter how long I waited  I HATE THAT
The spicy chicken is indeed hot but the texture is great and it was cooked well
My pita burger I ordered with red pepper hummus and it had lettuce and tomatoes on it as well the beef was somewhat an odd texture but still good
The meat dairy deli prepared meals seafood frozen foods canned goods and international foods are available in vast and varying supply
I don't recommend going to this Pizza Hut
The food is also old school diner type food the meatloaf is pretty good but it is meatloaf after all not a porterhouse steak
The desserts are rich and the ice cream is decent wish they would have more flavors though
The food is standard American fare but very good and always served HOT
The highlight is the cheeseburger sliders but the Chicken Sandwiches are very good too
All the food I tried was fresh and very good overall
The kobe beef was good but I have had better still excellent for a buffet though
Overall my friend was very happy and I really enjoyed the food so it was a great evening
The gluten free pizza and pasta's are really good
I have gotten several varieties of pasta and pizza and tend towards the southwestern flavors as I'm also intolerant to pork products
My man even beat everyone in pool and won a $10 gift card to the bar Men in speedos and scarves dancing on mini stages $1 jello shots free pizza if you show your c*ck
When it came to the actual pizza - yes it was good but I think you can find better - or at least comparable elsewhere
The food is good and the prices are a bargin for breakfast especially in such a great location
i ordered the lolos special i think it was the #3 anyway the chicken was real tasty and so were the waffles
Had heard good things about the beer and the food and decided to spend the evening hanging out with friends over a few cold ones
The rib tips were excellent - meaty nicely cooked with a nice smoke flavor that didn't really need any other sauce though I did try a little of each sauce on the table for comparison
One companion had the chicken and pronounced it to be excellent but again did not care for the brisket
From the menu the dishes appeared as if they should be creative and tasty
The chopped steak was definately not just ground beef and was very tasty and tender however the sweet potato spaetzle was a mushy disappointment
Ultimately no matter who the chef is who developed the menu and concept - the food is only as good as the staff cooking it
This place is synonymous with excellent pizza
The french fry freaks got theirs we had some great food the beer was cold and the jukebox was
Its a good concept basically DISH without everything
I saw some of the food go by and it looked tasty
I got one chicken taco and two carne asada and they were equally delicious
And quality really plays a huge role in inspirational food
Great consistent food and wonderful friendly service
Stayed here for work too bad I don't really gamble Otherwise it seems pretty good kind of got a vegas feel to it has a food court and quite a few restaurants inside
They do serve a bowl of rice soup with chicken at the beginning of all courses had a good flavor and reminded me of a Chinese soup chowI tried the yellow curry with deep fried tofu the curry has unbelievable flavor indicating it's been prepared well
The food was pretty good especially the french toast but the service didn't match
If the food wasn't as good as it was  I would've given this place 2 stars
I highly recommend the shrimp tempura roll - it's different than I've seen at any other place
The food was excellent and wonderfully priced
I think I ate a week's worth of sushi for $25
Again the quality of the sushi was great
I enjoyed the rolls and the prices were excellent
we came to enjoy good food but you didn't have any
Oh Edited Had the sushi a couple of times here dont recommend it
Its not cheap so if you want sushi just go somewhere with delicious sushi
The free bread basket is certainly a good start complete with four warm rolls of both white and wheat varieties teamed with some questionably-sweet soft butter
The grits and sausage trio are certainly a marked improvement however my comment on the popular app would be that the grits need a bit more flavor because they totally get lost in the dish - the flavor is great though so I see why it's so popular
This is probably a personal preference because the flavor was nice the heat from the green chili came through and I polished off the dish
We had the Kimow - hot and spicy clear noodles chicken broccoli snow peas sweet onion Thai chili garlic and sweet Thai Basil - Delicious
It's time consuming but it's inexpensive and the food that you get is legitimately delicious
Full of melon grapes and other deliciousness I had enough food for two people and ate every bite
Highly recommend the pancakes or the chicken fried steak
Attended for Restaurant Week for the first time and enjoyed everything from the decadent  yet relaxing decor to the atmosphere food drink and attractive wait staff
For dinner I had the rainbow trout with green beans and toasted almonds which was so delicious I ate every bite and for dessert the carrot cake
I decided to go with this choice last night because I wasn't in the mood to cook and I'd remembered seeing commercials about Pizza Hut serving pasta and thought I'd give it a shot
This is the cutest pet store that carries high-quality healthy cat and dog food the type of non-processed food you can't find at a traditional chain store and a variety of wonderful cat and dog supplies ranging from beds pet shampoos treats leashes collars clothing dishes etc
The food is definitely good fresh and tasty but if you are really hungry you could spend $25 and still feel a little empty
Great decor wine bottles being opened frequently and excellent food that I can't pronounce
Had the privilege of meeting both the manager and the head chef and can say that both are wonderful people who are passionate about giving great experiences and great food
Chicken Enchilada Soup - It was good but again a tad salty for me
Triple Dipper  Wings Over Buffalo - Good and spicy                           Fried Cheese - Good and gooey                           Original Chicken Crispers - Good and cripsyThe server's attitude bring down the mood
The tender mallard leg was succulent and intense in flavor while the lentils performed well by countering the richness of the meat
Great food good prices and excellent service all set in a romantic atmosphere well; there is one caveat the hours
Right in the heart of downtown a hop skip and a jump from Civic Center Park or Jellyfish Park as I like to call it and best of all its attached to the haunted Hotel San Carlos
the boneless chicken portion was small the rice was good and  the veggies consisted of cabbage and that's it
The food was very good - I wish I'd had room for dessert
Someone got the chicken which was also highly rated but it really didn't taste that good
O's was on the way and I remember always having good pizza from there
tasted good too but it was strong so I couldn't finish it as our food arrived a few moments later
We also really enjoyed the roast beef sliders
A little horseradish and some good au jus
The pizza finally arrived and it was AMAZING
It's worth the wait for the deep dish pizza
For dinner I have had the Firebirds Chicken Pasta it was creamy and full of flavor
Odd yes delicious yes it was great with the salmon or at least my daughter thought so since I don't like fish
The Chile Rubbed Delmonico has this delicious rub that makes the meat melt in your mouth
The meat itself is very fatty which I normally wouldn't even try but the rub gave it a flavor that was worth the fat
Good thing he couldn't see my post-pretzel food baby
If you aren't familiar with Salvadorean food I'd recommend you start with the pupusa with loroco an edible flower which is the classic pupusa and extremely delicious
With early reservations we got there just before it started filling up and started with the antipasto some tasty cheeses and meats - really liked the red pepper puree
The pizza's arrived in a timely manner looked and smelled great and everyone agreed - that's good pizza
The service was good and we noticed a few tables of repeaters there I believe the chef/owner strolling around chatting with them
At the end of the day I'm a foodie so I'll put up with some extra stuff to have some good eats
In any case I recommend all of the broken rice dishes
The food arrived and visually was good looking
We ordered the cookie chipwiches dessert to go and those were good when we had them later
I think this may be a case of BE's trying to be touristy friendly and have food that is safe and not too much flavor
We visited this restaurant late on a Sunday night which may have taken away from some of the excitement of this trendy upscale restaurant even still we both really enjoyed our food
Always nice to find a good local business with great service and great food
However they charged the full price of the Beef Souvlaki which is a FULL $5 MORE THAN THE CHICKEN and was completely not worth it
It was like the kitchen had forgone the standard seasonings of salt and pepper and dunked the enitre dish in a vat of lemon juice to the point that not a single thing on the plate other than the beef and it had to fight for it's life had any other flavor than lemon
My sandwich the Grilled chicken procsiutto was pretty good but I'd sub a different bread next time -- it was a 9 grain ciabatta that didn't fit with the tastes of the sandwich
You get great customer service and really great quality sushi
50 per person which is a bargain considering the amount and quality of food offered
The meats are highly salted to bring out the most of their flavor and the beef is cooked to the rare side
Fogo has many fine deserts though I tend to stick with the recommended Papaya Cream which is a lighter fare after consuming pounds of meat
When the restaurant closed and moved down the street on Indian School I wasn't sure what happened but the quality of food and the service started to wane and each visit become increasingly disappointing
RecommendationsMoo Goo Gai Pan  This is a light white meat chicken dish cooked in a light sauce and with sauteed veggies
quesadilla the food that's really hard to mess up so I got it is only fair but the drinks are very tasty
Very much more like a pizza joint than a bar even though they have a wide variety of good beers both local microbrew and imports
Being the only real game in the area they will do good so if you like pizza and beer check them out
Now I'm no sushi snob but I know what excellent and mediocre sushi tastes like
But for the price we paid we should have gotten higher quality sushi
The service has always been great and the food at the club level is generally good
You have to stir it with your spoon to get all the rice veggies and meat mixed up and a little crispy hot
Also for a restaurant based on the use of simple fresh pure ingredients that are locally and or organically grown to create a healthy and flavorful menu; I would expect to find a few more vegan and vegetarian entrees please note I am neither vegan nor vegetarian I just prefer veggie dishes
This dish has spaghetti squash with organic tomato zucchini and fresh mozzarella and is served piping hot bonus point # 15 in an individual casserole dish
First rate and I will highly recommend this dish
It doesn't matter if your joint is stylish your servers are great and your dishes look like works of art unless it tastes good
Had the fish tacos simple but so fresh and tasty
The prices are on the higher end but it shows in the quality of food location and decor/ambiance etc
The sushi is interesting most of it could probably pass for soft candy as everything was covered in a syrupy sauce but also full of flavor
Ah the memories Hot crisp sweet and sour pork lemon chicken really good low mien egg fu yung and great fried rice it was always so simple so hot so fresh and all you can eat
First event food was inconsistant dry and unappetizing service was amazing
I was waiting to get my haircut and had a bit of sinus congestion that needed some clearing up so I figured so good spicy Cajun food should do the trick
I got the chicken and sausage gumbo with the side of Cole slaw and an ice cold beer
I would highly recommend if you go anywhere else for sushi you at least give this place a shot you will not regret it
Great diverse selection of music playing excellent & very friendly service great wine and the food
Cool art modern space unique/fun drinks pretty people and good food
If you want good sushi in Arizona try Hiro Sushi in Scottsdale
The atmosphere is pretty standard fast food style with fairly plain decor but don't let that make you think the food isn't worth it
The supposed amazing chicken sausage was as bland as could be
The food can be ordered table side and  ranges from steak to a very tasty Asian menu
High quality and great service but the prices have more than doubled on many dishes
Let me say that I wanted to try every item on the food menu as all the options sounded delicious
We will definitely be back to try more specialty cocktails and sample more of their delicious food
The waitstaff were quite nice and very accommodating, and the rolls were quite good and reasonably priced
The rolls were very good and the fish tasted very fresh
The pizzas are delicious, especially the Roasted Eggplant, which I swear has bacon on it, but apparently it doesn't
A glass of white wine the 6-dollar one is good works well with the food I've had here
Organic, fresh food always is a little more expensive, but well worth it for taste, your health, and supporting local agriculture
This is why I give it three stars the food is really good
I still give it 3 stars because I love their porkchops and another friend said her fish was really good
I gave up $30 tonight for what might have been the least tasty food I've eaten in at least 6 months
In fact to say that it was the least tasty food I've had eaten in at least 6 months doesn't even begin to adequately describe the horrific culinary abominations I consumed against my better judgment at this establishment
The food certainly is not worth that much
Food was also wasted which I don't feel good about
I'd heard great things about the food love the concept and was looking forward to a wonderful experience
Very friendly staff good service and good food are all I need
the a/c is typically running on way overdrive and you end up being cold the entire time that you are having your food
When I first went to Subway I wasn't impressed with their tiny meat slices and lack of cheese but I have started ordering the chicken breasts and getting the cheese toasted and I now I feel that I am getting my money's worth
Yelp pointed me to this place while on a business trip-- looking for good pizza in the area
Overall a very nice place with great quality pizza that tastes delicious
My wife has enjoyed the salads I have tasted several of their homemade soups and they are great and we all love the pizza without question
But for those not following an alternative food lifestyle it's still incredibly tasty and makes me rethink my cuisine decisions
If they push the cinnamon roll on you it's because it's like a cinnamon god's protege and worth every calorie consumed
Service Service was a little slow given that we were only ordering ice cream sundaes and not hot food but this was a very minor problem
Food  We came just for dessert and ordered a Top Hat Sundae creampuff filled with ice cream and topped with hot fudge and a Tin Roof Sudae ice cream hot fudge and salted Spanish peanuts
The Atlantic Roll - delicious and ONLY $3
And the food at the venue is very very basic hot dogs and
Family run Italian food with good prices and servings appropriate to the price
Mostly pasta dishes served in tasty sauces
The Meat Ravioli's were very good and the Stuffed Shells were excellent and both reasonably priced in the $10-$12 range with a side link of Mild italian Sausage for under $2
Food was pretty good but service was horrid
I saw food come out pretty quickly and everyone seemed to be having a good time
The Good  - overall basic dim sum are good - food temperature is nice & hot   a plus when the buns are warm- dim sum cost the same for stamps A B & C $2
Every time I have a special event or just want some good food or drinks
Unfortunately service was horrible and the food was ice cold when we received it
Been going to Aunt Chilada's for over 10 years now and I'm sad to see the quality of the food and service declining
Food was so so and i never got a refill of hot tea until i had to ask for it
The food is on par for sports bars so don't expect gourmet but it really is quality and fairly priced
My favorite part are the featured baked desserts but when I went today the chocolate lava cake was lacking flavor and sugar
The ingredients are quality but pizza was still dry
I definitely recommend the kobe beef burger
For appetizers we ordered the avocado spring rolls and the roasted plantains
The flavor was excellent and I would definitely order this entree again - if I can get over the extremely realistic meat analog
My dinner companions all ordered a chicken dish and all enjoyed them thoroughly
The food was good Festivals=crack the atmosphere and the service is EXCELLENT and it is close to home
Admittedly I would have enjoyed this meal A LOT more if I had recieved a meal that did not contain meat
i had the chicken which was TENDER and tasty
the staff are wicked friendly and the food was SUPER tasty
Kwan and Wok may be a fast food Chinese restaurant but I have to say I was impressed at the quality of the delivery we received
The mini hamburgers were pretty good but only because they were on hawaiian rolls
It could be a combination of the ambiance and the foods presentation but I was expecting much more flavor from my meal
The rest of the food we ordered was pretty good
I ordered the ruby fish curry and since I had the choice of spiciness I chose Thai hot
The fish was a whole sole filet lightly fried to perfection and the curry was spicy but extremely flavorful
I also shared an order of veggie spring rolls with a friend and they were crispy and tasty
Nice to find a place that serves tasty food and at the same time invests in creating a lovely space to round out the whole dining-out experience
Had very tasty eggrolls to start and they were some of the best I've ever had anywhere
I normally send items back if they don't arrive the way I ordered but I was hungry and I thought I'd just grin and bear through the allergy attacks as long as the dish was worthy of them
This may not be fine dining but it sure is good food
The meats were succulent and delicious i love the lamb chops the filet mignon and the signature sirloin
This is also the group I fall into as I mainly hit them up for their amazing rolls
I've searched for a long time to find really honest to goodness European style rolls for breakfast and the like and up until the Balkan Bakery I wasn't sure they existed anywhere in Phoenix
If you're not into the rolls they also have excellent freshly made loaves of bread in a few varieties
Ive you haven't tried them out and you're looking for some good rolls or just a new bakery I highly recommend it
The servers are great and the food is pretty good too
Although the level of authenticity does not reach that of the restaurants in say NYC's Chinatown the dishes here are definitely superior in flavor to those you would find in the majority of American Chinese restaurants where the food has been modified to suit the general American palate
The flavor of the food may be superior but other attributes of some of the dishes fail to make the grade
I once had a soy sauce chicken noodle soup which was very tasty but had too much skin and bones; I wish it had more meat
The beef noodle soup I ordered this evening tasted good and had generous chunks of beef but had so much red pepper flakes in it that I wasn't  able to finish the meal; I've had the same dish in other restaurants and it wasn't overloaded with the fiery stuff
My friend ordered the fillet mignon Chinese style; again good flavor but the meat was very tough
My goodness the food is amazing the margaritas to die for
all that I know is a good pairing brings out the flavors in the wine and the flavors in the dish right
I enjoy dining and  I get excited when I can tell my waiter really enjoys the food explaining I get two sides and then I can pick a chicken is important like a instruction manual making it a conversation to find out what I like and then recommending something is even better
The hummus was good but overwhelmingly garlicky - similar to the dish at Switch's little-bit-nicer brother Fez
The dessert saved Switch from a two-star review but after perusing other recommendations I'd consider giving it another shot for some of the yummy items mentioned
Nobody can deny that the 2 most delicious and important meals of the day are breakfast and pizza meal
Drinks all set we start looking at appetizers - their Facebook page advertises $5 happy hour in reality they have about 4 glasses of wine and a few vodka drinks for $5 there is no food in the $5 happy hour
So when we finished our appetizers she asked him for the specific dessert he said that they were no longer serving it
I did think it was kind of lame that they charged my sister almost a dollar when she went back for a tiny side of sour cream after we ordered almost $20 worth of food but I understand that they have to keep costs down or whatever
This was first time trying out American Indian food and I can't say I was all that impressed
Just went for lunch with a friend - friend had chicken pho which was good we split an order of spring rolls which were tasty as hell and full of transparent rice noodles shrimp and pork
I'm surprised to read some of the other reviews as I really enjoyed the food service and atmosphere
it is a bit of a shocker to chose your food from a cold stand
Ate at this location last night and the pizza was good as always
I would not get the white pizza again while it was good I miss the flavor the sauce provides to me the white pizza was just cheesy gRlic flatbread
The food was fine - we did add the coq au vin which was a flavorful sauce of fresh herbs mushrooms garlic spices and burgundy wine
Anyway I ordered some baba ganoush with pita for appetizer and then the chicken shawarma combination plate for entree
For grilled-to-order chicken the 2 minutes is definitely worth the wait
I crave their Citrus Basil salad which is delicious and even more satisfying when you add chicken and unshelled edamame
The red chile beef is good but I would like it a whole lot spicier
While I was chowing on the delicious grilled-to-crisp roll filled with various pork products queso fresco avocado and the usual sandwich veggies my friend asked Is it number one
Though the sandwich tasted good was worth the price and is my new fast-food of choice while in the Arcadia area it does not trump The Del Rey from Los Reyes De La Torta overall
I could see how the service may be a little bad but food it good
Zinburger has a lot of what I look for in a restaurant experience -- nice staff cool atmosphere and good food
The menus and prices are simple and excellent and the food is phenomenal
Its all good and probably the best in AZ considering you're in the middle of the desert and eating raw fish
The pizza is great the pasta is excellent and even the stuff like the chicken rollatini which I usually wouldn't get was amazing
There are plenty of choices for food but I usually get the Maxwell Street Polish Dog which is pretty good
I get the concept of this place with a simple fast order menu but if you are looking for good Greek food
We ordered a few appetizers and four personal 7 pizzas
The Trio of Meatballs appetizer was awesome
Huge meatballs in a delicious vodka sauce that is fantastic as a dipping sauce for any type of bread or pizza crust so ask for a side for only $3
The BF had the Here's the Beef pizza which looked meaty and delicious
I probably would have had a bite but my Da Greek pizza was overflowing with fantastic toppings feta kalamata olives pepperoncini spinach and tomatoes that I didn't want anything to mess with the flavors
The food was wonderful the service was great and the atmosphere is something I wanted to be part of
The focus of a farmer's market is mostly food and produce offerings -- and a lot of it -- from local farmers with perhaps some select flower crafts and other tchotchke vendors
Food is good but the portions would be too small for my husband who still eats like food like he's a teen preparing for a football season
My friend got the Chicken Mole Enchiladas which were pretty good nothing great and my other friend got seafood enchiladas which had hardly any filling to the enchiladas
It had all the major meats plus hotdogs cheeses and a siracha type sauce
The food is delicious I had the citron chili with tofu and my girlfriend had the pad thai but the portion sizes are way too small
The Chicken Adobo and the Beef Caldereta were amazing but I ended up getting the Chicken Coconut Curry with steamed rice
Anyway the food was excellent everything was cooked with lots of flavor and had a kick in every bite
The only MILD saving grace of BJ's is their pizza its decent not amazing but decent
They clearly are obtaining the best/highest quality/freshest meats and vegetables and doing amazing things with them at reasonable prices
Mido is the perfect sushi place because it's exactly the right balance of quality and value
We eat there whenever we want decent sushi - we know we'll get a good product for a good price
And if you sit at or near the bar a sushi chef will throw you a hot towel and speak some Spanish to you - very fun
To sum up - go to Mido if you want to eat a lot of good sushi and not spend a ton of money
He doesn't skimp on quantity of beef or quality with no fatty strands to be found and even if you ordered this dry with au jus on the side it would be succulent
I get the 2 meat combo which comes with a side beans chips good chips and 2 meats of your choice for like $7
The flavor of the meats speak for themselves you really don't need bbq sauce but the drizzle is a nice compliment as opposed to being the main dish as it is at other gross bbq places
My half-sandwich of shaved corned beef swiss cheese fresh sauerkraut on Acacia Cafe marble-rye bread looked tiny Mom and I noticed the wee-portion right away but it was full of flavor
Now had my spanish been as good as it was in Highschool i would've been hesitant to try this thank god it wasnt because this was one of the most delicious pieces of meat i have ever eaten
My dish was absolutely delicious and the perfect hangover food to wash it all down we ordered a litre of inca cola- a golden limey coloured soda that is indescribably wonderful
The service was good would have been much better is there was a way to serve the food without having to ask who had this and that; as with all the small tapas plates it gets pretty annoying especially when its barked right mid some fabulous conversation over and over it makes it feel like a friggin dinner no matter all the beautiful surroundings
The food is pretty good and not too expensive
Me and my fiancee both purchased a torta and while service was excellent the food was just well average
One thing that hit me was how low quality the ingredients were the meats tasted like they were purchased in the lunch meat aisle at a supermarket and brand X meat at that
I have been meaning to grab breakfast/lunch there as all of the food looks amazing
Unique delicious food with consistent excellent service
If you like spicy food Last week I had the philly cheese steak it was a special on the menu for the week SO GOOD
The Margaritas are very good the black beans better for us than the refried and the fish tacos on corn tortillas just plain scrumptious
However the quality of the food was excellent as Grille 347 prepared it
The food is pretty good but the portions are ENORMOUS
They also have a few really good desserts including a great cheesecake
All in all the food is pretty good and prices are decent for being a cafe in Nordstrom's but I still think Tomatoes is the best place to eat in the mall
Overall the place is clean the service is good and the food is great
So Saturday night I braced myself for a super long wait to get some good not great pizza
Excellent food paired with a jovial friendly owner make for a great casual lunch experience
During our visit together we took home a variety of groceries including some fresh peaches and apples peppers steak grain and veggie salad Charleen's delicious granola and a pretzel bread roll that was amazingly paired with a tangy mustard
I eat around the chicken though because I don't find that the chicken enhances the flavor of the dish
We will most likely revisit this place because it is in an ideal location right in the middle of Tempe Marketplace and the food is pretty good for the most part
I recommend any and all of the seafood dishes - my favorites include the shrimp quesadilla and the scallops
there where several tasty chicken dishes that were excellently seasoned with big chucks of flavorful chicken
if you want people to come back teach them a little bit about the food share the culture don't mix chickem mcnuggets with a tasty pulled chicken dish just because they both have chicken in them
tell me why this is good food help me learn something the cook knows about his homeland
it's a family business it's a huge building it has a good talented cooks somewhere in the kitchen it is good tasting food
I can see why this place has gotten the accolades because relatively speaking there isn't a lot of good accessible chinese food here in Phoenix well unless you go to Cofco Plaza Lee Lee Market Great Wall etc
The pesto spinach and tomato pizza is amazing and the Shwarma is equally delicious
You can pick your meat your veggies and your sauce and they cook it up for you- so fun and so yummy- each time you go you can get what you want but switch up the sauces or keep it the same and since it is build your own you will definitely have leftovers and they are just as good the second time around
-Food HUGE portions very tasty delicious & fresh
We were all ordering food booze and overall having an excellent time
I highly recommend eating a Tammie Coe pastry while waiting for your food
The food came out one dish at a time and each one was delicious
So delicious in fact that I ordered cupcake a la mode for dessert and they were very friendly when I asked them to check to make sure there was no coconut in the recipes
So I came here in a rec from everyone and yes the food was pretty delicious
Yep good old food poisoning and this was the likely culprit only other thing I had eaten to that point was pizza that other colleagues had joined in on
Almost all sushi appetizers  and drinks are 50% off so you can eat a and drink for a reasonable price
It was delicious nice moist chicken with the tang of the goat cheese and sweet figs
I got the greek pizza which was delicious
The next time I was there I got the veggie pizza which was also very good
THE BAD la condesa has gone well downhill in terms of food quality since i visited years ago
Its family-owned friendly and the food is always good
Both the service and food were excellent to say the least
Capital Grille is an excellent place to experience not just for the food but also for the experience
Anyway we came to this location recently and really enjoyed the food
The food was delicious some of the best we've had in town was it Native American
The food is just not good enough for such poor service
The husband had the bourbon chicken and it was very tasty
I ordered the orange shrimp and received orange chicken by accident but honestly I didn't even care because it was that good
it's not about big plasma TVs chain restaurants Peter Piper Pizza Coldstone Panda Express etc etc and signs that tell you when you need to cheer for your team
We really enjoyed the food and the $3 Long Island ice teas
Unlike Fish Tacos there are indeed great hot dogs in Phoenix so let me try and prove it now
A group of us went and from around the table it seemed folks enjoyed their food but wasn't necessarily impressed
so let's put my preferences up front  I'm a NY thin-crust kinda guy but know a good deep-dish when I taste one
After the pretzels a 14inch pizza and 1 ice tea we bounced with a little under a 30$ bill which seemed a little much but it was good and they took good care of us
the food was ok Good overall for arizona But the choices and lack of food really was a turn off
The tripe was definitely a unique style and the chicken feet were pretty tasty
As for the food it was very good but not the best I've ever had for breakfast
The waiter mixed hot sauce and syrup together which took the whole dish up a notch
I chose the chicken fried steak which was extremely good the batter was light and had a lot of flavor
The broth was tasty and the noodles firm yet cooked to perfection and the beef was tender and seasoned well
When we spoke to the owner about our food we were insulted & told that we don't know good food
The food and service was good but I have one major complaint
I get it they're hip the food is tasty and they're kitsch so the prices are high
Definitely tender with a real hearty rich beefy flavor
All were wonderful but the particular standouts were the escargot and the desserts
While the fish and chips we ordered were very good the fact that despite being part of the largest party in the place we had to go and pay for our meal at the bar was slightly annoying
they redecorated the interior recently so it's not as gritty as it used to be but the food is still as delicious as ever
Most of the things sold there seemed to be value-added foods or processed foods like Decio Pasta which while delicious can be ordered off a website or at other markets
They also had baked goods prepared foods like tamales italian food but since I was shopping to make a meal for a vegan friend nothing there really was useful
Their soup for all their noodle dishes are very flavorful and well-portioned
* Chicken Breast - This was pretty good
My party of three was impressed with their Yukon Gold Potato Pizza
Each flavor was delightful-- I can see why this place is voted a favorite among the Phoenix Foodies
Aside from the tasty food and reasonable prices this is a joint with unique music and appeal
Good beer good food and outdoor seating is a plus
definitely not worth the gourmet pizza price tag
Overall a good atmosphere to hang out and have some food
My fiance said the chicken parmesan was pounded thin and tasted really good
When I have a craving for Vietnamese food I'll be back to have my fill until I can make it back home and eat some good food in San Jose
I think it's a little bit pricey for what they serve but the food is good
It's easy to navigate and has excellent food choices
The smoke taste was in every bite the meat was quality and tasted fresh the self serve condiment bar was a plus the red cream soda was a nice surprise
The shell was nice and crispy shoved full of very flavorful shredded beef lettuce tomatoes and cheese
The food is pretty good too Here's what we ordered$11 - Cheese & Bread platter Melted Italian cheese with tomato jam + toasted Sourdough bread with olive oil -- this was pretty good especially with the tomato and fruit jam in the middle of the cheese to spread onto the perfectly toasted bread
The food is the best quality the pricing is the best value and the entertainment is the best
It is grown up sophisticated and has a huge emphasis on quality and interesting food
Don's catfish was very good as well according to him
In addtion their Pot Roast is consistently one of my favorite dishes and is so tasty I dream about it sad but true
First I did only try their tacos and only 3 kind I can not review the whole restaurant but I figure these are basic foods so if it is a good restaurant they would get it right
each time i receive exceptional service and amazing food as well as great scenery
the food here was pretty good but i found the menu actually better then the food tended to be
i found all of the food that we had so rich with almost too much flavor
i had the catfish which was good but over flavored
I simply take it out the night before slip it in the fridge and it's good to go the next day for homemade pizza
It was not fall of the bone tender like I prefer those style of dishes but it had good flavor
To be honest when it comes to eating sushi i have never ever recommended it to a single person and frankly tell people to stray from it
I prefer to sit at the bar to avoid being distracted from my delicious food by the oh so lovely kids
From the flavorless cardboard pizzas from Peter Piper for which I will always hold a place in my heart to the foodie favorites crafted at world famous Pizzeria Bianco Arizona is a pizza lovers paradise
While I have enjoyed many different pizzas here my all time favorite would have to be the Artichoke
I have not had their sandwiches or pasta dishes but can only assume that with the quality of ingredients being used there can't be much to complain about
The kids' menu contains the usual suspects but the pizza is of the same quality of the adult menu
All of the orders were correct the quality of food just as phenomenal as always and they were incredibly helpful with our request of separate checks
Overall Humble Pie is one of my favorite spots in the Valley to enjoy myself with my family and good food
They forgot my side of guac but the flavor of the marinated chicken more than made up for it
Consistently outstanding coffee AND baked goods that should be on the food network
Knowing my love of pizza and my search for an AZ favorite a co-worker highly recommended that I try Ray's
Wanting to to see if the pizza was really as good as he claimed I braved the never-ending strip mall/parking rodeo that houses this location and oh I am so glad I did
Now the main meals good to bad my son's philly cheesesteak on flatbread was terriffic my wife's fish was badly overcooked & had to be replaced and my Gyro was surprisingly bland & luke warm
Overall I would give it another shot  but I'm not expecting the most fabulous food from this place
This is your typical all you can eat low quality Chinese junk food
The service was also good and I was surprised at the server's ability to memorize my order of two rolls a sashimi and several nigiri
I do love the flavor of the food but the portions-- particularly on the tacos-- are pretty small for the price
However again the personality of the server was nice and accomodating and the flavor of the food at The Mission is delicious
We ordered a TON of dishes mostly salads appetizers and flatbreads for sharing
The food was very good though judging takeout -- without proper heat and presentation -- is hard
The food is fresh but it is also pretty flavorless
Cost * Overpriced for the quality of food
There are far too many other Italian restaurants in the valley with better quality food and atmosphere
The prices are more than affordable and you get a good amount of food for what you pay
The staff was nice the food was really good and my only real complaint is that the center island that has all the fixins was really low
I got the grilled fish tacos which were good good all except for the sides
SIL got the HUGE Chicken Fried Steak and really liked it she is finicky so this is good
The only good thing about this experience was the quick delivery but my delivery consisted of the wrong pizza
Normally I would call and request that the order be fixed but the pizza wasn't really worth fixing as it tasted like it had been prepared at the mall
I highly recommend the Autostrada Sopresatta Italian ham cappicola mortadella provolone arugula and tomatoes with spicy pepper relish and the Nine Iron Hickory smoked bacon layered with grilled chicken fresh burrata mozzarella lettuce beefsteak tomato and dijonnaise
Food is good beats the pants off of Subway
Classic joint good food great prices and a delightful decor
But for the price I expected more  taste from a bolder sauce generous veggies or better quality beef
By itself the caviar was a bit too fishy for me but when combined with the egg it was very good
We were then served an excellent soft shelled crab dish
The other non-seafood dishes are great but not excellent
After the food is delivered good luck trying to get another beer
Potbelly Sandwich shop good food made by people who might be aliens
Good thing we had that groupon because it paid for that total disappointing dessert
Don't be fooled by their terrible food photography
A meatball should not be photographed in the same fashion as a couch
I never thought we could get them to like Chinese food in Phoenix as they are from New York where good Chinese food lives
They gladly substituted chicken for pork and as other people have noted their chicken is the good stuff
Its even better because they start delivery at 10a the food is always hot and the orders are always correct
Nonetheless the food is very decent and I would recommend that you ask for a side of the hot green sauce which is entirely constituted from peppers with the same name as the restaurant
Given that the chicken parm came out hot this is classic die in the window waiting to be served while the other order was still being prepared
Overall this place seems to have good food but there are some down sides which include not many non egg options BF is allergic to eggs the pancakes were meh and the call ahead didn't really work out
I really enjoyed my food though so still an overall positive review
Yes the upstairs cafeteria has a good selection of cheep food but I prefer to skip the crazy lines and snag me a piece of pizza and a coke for $2
If you've never been there the pizza/hot dog stand is by the checkout lines so when you walk in go past the escalator and take a sharp left
The food is good and you always get more than you should eat at one sitting
No one has ever complained about the quality of food
There's free self serve sun tan lotion in the outfield and the variety of food choices was excellent
The bar food is fantastic the bar plate is a great value for the quality of food
There was plenty of seating for our larger goodand I was a fan that they serve food late till 2am
Stroll and listen and look and be impressed
There isnt much room to sit and it isn't fancy but if you want good food this is the place to go
Nonetheless they were very tasty and a nice different take on a dessert for a bbq meal
such a fresh authentic flavorful taste to every roll and all of my girlfriends agree
There was a lacking of authentic flavor in our dishes
The food is good but frankly it is a little expensive
I want to update this review when I've tried other dishes so conceivably this place could take a tumble down to an A-OK 3*** but that's still good because remember I'm a cranky reviewer
that is pretty good food at pretty fair prices
the chicken and beef are also sadly over seasoned and rarely served as piping hot if a hot dish as you'd like
Every single dish was AMAZING and the egg drop soup was THE BEST I have ever had
We had 4 dishes on the table and everyone enjoyed everything there wasn't a scrap left on the plates even the picky toddlers that were with us got down
BUT the food was soooo good we didn't care everyone was excited for the next dish
The food's good the beer's usually good the brewmaster's awesome
Food way above average he even asked if we wanted an extra appetizer that was made free of charge spare ribs yum We split the duck and enjoyed the tenderness
We had a pizza last week which was really good but yesterday ordered the breakfast quesadilla and although it was humongous enough for two it was kinda greasy on the inside
The burger itself was very tasty they must put special seasons in their meat very nice
The important thing to remember when you go is to make sure you go hungry because it can be a little pricey so you want to get your moneys worth of food
It's a very nice wine bar with very good food and excellent service
It is lightly seasoned letting the rotisserie flavor come through meat on a spit is a thing of beauty
She was expecting the chicken to be warm; it was cold but still a tasty sandwich
Have had the opportunity to try multiple different dishes here aside from the vietnamese pho and so far all of the dishes have been tasty
Alice Cooper's Town is a mix of good food and rock 'n' roll and has a fab bar
My man enjoyed it so much he finished The Sister's leftover meat
Dessert The Man Man's Dad Breakfast of The Champions - i had a couple bites - absolutely delicious
Yes the food was good but the service was
The food was good but we were greeted by two servers--one plus a trainee
In the years that I have been going there the food has always been delicious and everyone I have taken has been won over
Every restaurant there has good food although they are very busy so sometimes you can expect a wait
We had overpriced hot dogs that were ok but dessert was much better
If you don't like to cook or you like to cook easy but good quality food F&E is the place for you to shop
And you can buy everything you need to make a fresh pizza their cheese department is amazing
Aside from that I've heard from a fair number of people that the food is delectable and worth the price but I've never been in the munching mood here
My one gripe is that they keep it cold as a meat locker in there and my little toesies need dethawing in the Arizona heat after I exit the building
The food is very good but the portions are rather small for the price
Don't get me wrong It is a great spot and the food is delicious but I think they need to increase portion size or lower their prices a little
This place is close to where I live so we were hoping to find a great bar with good food
The saloon serves quite good burgers and pizzas from the wood fired oven in the main restaurant
My wife and I both cook and we were quite impressed with the quality again I had low expectations due to history with the resort brunch which is generally lowest common denominator food
Summed up 3 stars for the overall food quality and taste but an added 4th star for the exceptional service at the restaurant/hotel and the marvelous dessert
If you're looking for random import foods like the real Hinze Baked Beans or a really good wine this is the place
Creativity does not count more than food quality
Then I farted for a good 12 hours in response to the food
The food is good but I just stay away from the sandwiches now and stick to the pizza
the meat was bland no flavor what so ever I'm glad the peppers and onions had some flavor or I would have asked for my money back
Tell your friends tell your family it's good food in N Scottsdale
Although our food was very good the people at one table kept returning their food items maybe it was because they couldn't stand to eat it after one of the millions of black flies that were milling about the dining room landed on their food
I have eaten here one time prior and had a pasta dish that was really good so maybe it's just the breakfast items
I think that for pho the broth flavor is every bit as important as the meat
I had their chicken poblano enchiladas and they were really really tasty
Thankfully their food is good and the atmosphere is nice because otherwise I wouldn't recommend this place based on service alone
Food was excellent service was friendly and price was great
Whole Foods is that uppity bitch who I hate having to let in my life but her produce is so sumptious her samples so tasty and she lets me eat whatever I want
Check it while I break it down two whole new rows of fake meat to try killer fresh produce sushi to go that is actually tasty cheap juices to try mocha chocolate sandwiches cat food good red wine delish cheap soy yogurt with real fruit vegan granola my favourite shampoo and conditioner pineapple empanadas cheap soy milk feminine products 55 cents dark chocolate no preservatives or additives and frozen raspberries and Spanish quick race that kicked TJs ass
All in all I was not that impressed with the food and the price
Fine dining quality food in a non-fine dining atmosphere
I can't remember which fish course I enjoyed more
Unfortunately the food doesn't worth the bother to park walk etc
I wouldn't recommend this place if you have someone with food sensitivities or allergies in your party
A must try for any person who enjoys quality food
The steak had a little too much butter on them but were high quality beef
Amazing food great presentation and sleek space - with NO WAIT on a Saturday night
He must have noticed that I hadn't eaten much of my dish as my friends were feeding my bites of theirs which were better than mine though still not excellent by any means and he came by and said he'd fix it in a flash
The entire experience was sub-par and for the pricey dishes you'd expect a better menu better flavor and better service
If you want to be at Daily Dose or Breakfast Club not that the food isn't good there to people watch and 'be seen' this is not your place
If you want incredible value and delicious food - jackpot
All 3 of the meats were flavorful and nicely cooked
Seriously though this location has great service and Paradise Bakery has some darn tasty food despite being a chain - *gasp*
Yep the food is that good and the joint is that cool
mouth salivating for my delicious Buffalo Chicken Wrap and what I found was a new menu
It had absolutely no flavor and had a horrid texture I don't know if the meat was overcooked or what but it tasted like a taco with beans and cardboard
they can get their food to taste like something delicious
The thing that's best about this place is that the food is always so flavorful and there is no guilt or remorse for eating too much or eating food that makes you feel overly full later
No it's not fancy & no the pizza isn't great but by the time you add in the delicious soup the excellent salad bar the tasty meaty chili add your own hot pepper seeds cheese & onions crispy fried chicken & more plus super friendly & appreciative service you have a lunch experience here that really beats the competition from the buffets at Pizza Hut CiCi's Peter Piper Pepi's & LJ's
Spent over $16 for a buffet lunch and expected the pizza to be hot and ready to eat
The pepperoni pizza had a small hint of cinnamon flavor probably due to not cleaning the pans well enough and was nasty
We had at least 12 rolls including the spider caterpillar and sedona and the sushi was fresh delicious and beautifully presented
The chicken shawerma was tasty but it was just not the garlicky goodness I am used to
We'd just make sure to ask if they had any garlic-heavy flavors next time since we are BIG garlic eaters and we love garlic in our food
Good orange chicken mongolian beef and cashew chicken
Usually pick up for take out and they are quick and food is hot
It's fast food in a healthier Mexican style not fast greasy Filiberto's style but let's be honest that style is still delicious food
The food is pretty killer too I had empanandas with onion rings and I cleaned my plate-really good very very slight greasy on the end of the empanada but others would have crested much sooner
Usually I get to sample other dishes but my companions were fully content keeping everything for themselves at this place a testament to the quality of food being offered
The quality of the meats was just terrible
Simply poor quality meats all the way around
So now I've upgraded it because the pizza is really good
Our food arrived and my wife's gyro was cold and the lamb and beef in my souvlaki plate was literally raw
My wife went in to leave a few dollars in the tip jar despite the cold and raw meat and asked what was going on
I tried the chicken parm sub as well it was tasty after I removed about half of the chicken
It was more like a hot chicken/cheese sub
The food is a bit pr icy for the location in the AZ Center but the service was excellent and the food was solid
Super nice servers and surprisingly good food for the type of establishment but overall
On my second trip I got the number 42 which is vermicelli cold noodles that come with a pork shrimp sliced egg roll sliced grilled pork patty and veggies all in the same big bowl
The pork patty was very good; juicy and tender the egg roll was good too and the vermicelli was kind of bland by itself until I mixed it with the veggies which where hidden underneath it and added a little salt
Also I've ordered pork shrimp egg rolls as an appetizer and a banh mi sandwich for take out my four times there
posted pics of the egg rolls and a sandwich tho it's the cold cut sandwich Inspired by Da Vang's delicious beef stew / bo kho I decided to try the beef stew with rice noodles here at Pho Thanh
If you want a generous amount of good beef stew I recommend trying it at Da Vang
I love their special hot sauce for the pizza
I never used to put hot sauce on my pizza until I went to this place
When I was last there I had asked about 'added sugars' in the sauce a lot of asian restaurants add a lot of sugar to dishes to enhance the 'addiction' quality of it - he I think it was the owner kindly explained that he could absolutely make mine however I liked it - that is customer service
The chicken in the chicken wrap was really good
They have a great hot and cold bar as well as made on the spot sushi which is not too bad for a grocery store
The soup base was good but the meat was not as good and I wish there was more noddles
And yet again a large portion of food for a good price
Overall the best ramen I've had in the city minus the meat and all for a good price
The chicken parm had delicious fresh bread and flavorful marinara sauce
But they only time I've ever had a chicken parm sub that good was at Andreoli Italian Grocer and that place is THE top rated Italian Deli in the city
What I do like is there soup bar 5 to 6 different types of soups are very delicious ranging from chicken noodle clam chowder Irish potato lech spicy chili bean minestrone lentil Fresh baked goods are refreshed every hour
I had the beef carpaccio which was pretty tasty
Again we've been on an epic sushi expedition since moving here trying to find GOOD sushi in Phoenix
However the food once ordered was delicious
The iced tea was super tasty and my partner got a crunchy roll and a spicy salmon roll
Granted it came out about 10 minutes after my partner's sushi did but it was worth it
This is one of our favorite places for healthy flavorful food
Bombay Spice also has a good selection of inexpensive wines available for $20-$40 per bottle that complement the food well
Its interior is a bit tacky but the food is darn delicious
the food was supah tasty but supah salty and all of the tortilla skins both fried or steamed were really thick
The service is decent and the food - well the pad thai and chicken curry are flavorful and delicious
It was a nice experience I had the corned beef sandwich that I found fairly bland but my husband's hot pastrami was great
All in all this is definitely in the top two pizza places I've ever been to with Apizza Scholls taking points as my amazing local joint in Portland
getting back to that cheesesteak with everything it was amazing perfect in every way the bread the way the meat and the cheese were working together to win me over forever
the meatball was good i really wanna try the off-the-menu reuben but the portobello mushroom was STELLAR and actually complemented the meatball sandwich nicely
I had the pepperoni and kalamata olive pizza the olives were fresh and delicious as well
- Circle Key Farms they have excellent goat and beef etc selection and the guys that run it are great to talk to and learn more about goats
The highlights for us are the relaxing atmosphere good Mexican food attentive service cold Negro Modelo beers and talented mariachis playing music
As advertised there were seven types of seafood combined with a few vegetables and was delicious
Overall a good bar to get a properly poured Guinness above average bar food and a really unique atmosphere
So U know come here expecting seafood well prepared wok dishes cantonese style cantonese/hk style bbq and U will have a good meal
I cannot vouch for their orange chicken or mongolian beef but if U want asian american food there should be a good offering inside the mekong supermarket at the food court
who opened a jar of hot jalepenos and poured it over the food
However my friend ordered a cheese pizza and it really was good
The ground beef was really high quality too so I definitely see why they recommend you order it that way
I also had the fried chicken which our server said was one of their best selling entrees and it was also good but I've been spoiled with excellent homemade fried chicken that tops this one easily
I know that the seafood in the desert is not nearly as fresh or delicious as if you are closer to the shore but I've still had decent seafood here in AZ and this is not it
You can try anything you want out of the cold deli counter and prices were reasonable for food that is not only good for you but made from scratch
The food was all beautifully presented but lacked great flavor
Their ribs are ok and so is their chicken but I think their brisket is no good at all
With the exception of a hum-drum tomato sauce on our veggie thinbread pizza the flavors were excellent
The chicken was delicious and the grits were creamy and soooo comforting
This place was fun different and I thought the food was good
I can only guess that they are overwhelmed by nostalgia for a simpler time because while it may not be Kierland pretentious nor a crappy chain restaurant the food just isn't very good
Whatever the red pepper on it was super hot I was warned it is a spicy dish and was feeling adventurous
I had their carne asada quesadilla and carne asada tacos the meat lacked flavor and none of the salsas were hot enough
My parents had the late-night summer 3-course special that included two glasses of wine one appetizer two entrees and two desserts for $50
It was an amazing deal and the food they ordered was great - the Arugula Salad Atlantic Salmon Braised Short Rib Sorbet peach and the amazing Spike's Chocolate Bars of Sin
I had the Pacific Cod Fish & Chips which was really delicious
In the cooler months it is so refreshing to walk there eat some amazing sushi or dinner items and then walk home satisfied
It's most of my favorite songs so it makes me cheery while I eat amazing food
The ingredients were fresh and tasty and the dishes themselves were traditional but oh-so perfectly original
Mucho Gusto is perfect for the Mexican food purist or out-of-towner that has never experienced true south of the border flavor
The first time I decided I should get the Redfish Plate because I figured it oughta be good since they are named after it
The food was good but I'd definitely recommend another place for the future
The raw meats and poultry are presented in this freeze-dried thinly shaved manner making it difficult to a put enough in your plate and b really tell if it is good quality or crap meat
We had good food good drinks and a good time in general
The Chicken was moist and had a very good flavor
For the the amount of food and the quality I'm not going to be going to Panda anymore
My food was made to order so it was nice and hot and the syrup in the Diet Dr
We ordered a couple of delicious drinks the Spring Chicken ate some of the very good bread and started discussing the menu
Most significantly he strongly recommended trying the beef tenderloin charred rare which from what I recall of his description involves searing the steak on a very hot grill and baking it briefly so the whole thing is heated through
Kirk came back later to make sure we'd enjoyed the food and insisted on buying us dessert
We were too full and the cheese and strawberry preserves were a good dessert substitute but he sent a slice of Pumpkin Cheesecake home with us I still haven't had room to try it but my husband said his bite was delicious
We were very impressed by the ambiance the service the food and by Kirk who clearly knows his stuff and believes in the food they serve
My fiance loves the italian beef which I had before and thought it was good although the burgers are amazing so I don't like to go astray and get something different
I'll sum up the rest of the visit  food was good but I'm sorry not great
Defined as an Appetizer on the Lunch Menu we decided to share this dish as a side order
let's just say I've had my issues with experiencing sushi but I wished I liked it because I know it is good for you and it looks amazing
see pictureSo back to the quality of the food
For the most part their food is very good
The better dishes like Lamb Adobo are pricier than the usual snack-type meals like tacos but are worth it
If you can handle this type of service the food is worth the bother
Although my dish was good some minor improvements can be made to make it perfect; toast the muffin more mine was hardly toasted at all and the hollidase sauce needs a little more pizzaz it was on the bland side
All food at NOCA is fresh flavorful and well prepared without being overwhelmed by too many ingredients
The chorizo makes that dish oh so flavorful and savory
So in short or long if you will the food is awesome from appetizers through dessert
My only complaint would be that service was a little slow but it's a quaint quiet atmosphere that is not packed with hostesses and servers jostling everywhere so in my opinion the quiet evening with fantastic food was completely worth waiting a little longer for service  This is a great place for a date night or a girls night check it out
and Camelback Cyprus Pita Grill appropriately brings excellent food and ambiance
A quaint restaurant with excellent food in a nice part of Phoenix makes Cyprus Pita Grill well worth the visit
The moist brisket is really just a bit more fatty cut of meat than the non moist but it has much better flavoring and texture
It gets my recommendation and a great rating for authentic Mexican food this side of the boarder
The food was pretty good but the waits are too long wouldn't recommend stopping if you have a flight to catch soon
I dislike meat on top of pasta or potatoes  because when you cut it you crush it into the pasta  The wine list was good the teramasu was good
I have been on a quest to find a new sushi place since moving to Goodyear from the east side
I would not recommend this place to anyone and will continue my search for a decent sushi restaurant
I had the pizza and while it was good I would suggest getting a pasta dish
All of the pastas looked amazing and the pizza looked reminiscent of a frozen pizza
Starting with the food we had  the grouper cheek appetizer with Asian mushrooms was absolutely scrumptious
I'm not big on rolls but this one was very nice spicy tuna is the star and the supporting cast makes this a good roll for the money
The Chicken tiki masala was pretty good the chicken was tender and the sauce was pretty nice
We had a great dinner at our first visit to Noca and thoroughly enjoyed the taste presentation and unique flair of the food
Regarding the of the dishes I would be nicely sated with an appetizer and an entree or only an entree for a light meal
The food is good and very reasonably priced
The food is absolutely amazing possibly the best grilled cheese and tomato soup on the planet and the honeymooner is incredible as is the cheese plate
We enjoyed the Rosa and Sonny Boy pizzas and pretty much finished both
The food was terrific and I enjoyed their Veggie Hash squash onion mushrooms as a side to my smoked turkey & brie omelette
It comes to your table smoking hot and I love many flavors and so get the combo Beef Pork and Chicken
Put it this way I am getting hungry just thinking about how good this dish is
Pick your favorite food from Gourmet Hot dogs with Short Leash or Mexican with Luncha Libre Smoothies and Salads with Mojo Bowl to Pies with Mama Toledos and Creme Brulee with Torched Goodness
The pizza is a little pricey but for the different toppings and styles they make it's totally worth it
I didn't exactly know what to expect of a place that calls itself Qwik Chinese - doesn't really lend itself to delicious quality or any other adjective that is the opposite of fast food
That having been said the food was good
The chicken dish itself was pretty good as well using quality chicken not that questionable is this rubber thing I'm chewing actually chicken
Glad to see some good bottles of beer Dogfish Head Odell's etc on the drink menu and the wine list has some nice wine selections as well
While the cheap sushi may be tempting the service is the worst and the waitresses have far more attitude than the trade off for cheap sushi is worth
Food was tasty and well presented with ample portions
Good thing too because Hubby's beef potato mushroom & dark beer boxty was out of this world
My go-to dish of fish & chips was delicious as always
Don't get me wrong the food and service is wonderful but overall the restaurant is lacking just a tiny bit in the awesome vibe factor if that makes sense
We were impressed with the food and the service
On a recent trip to visit my mom's place I just got the biggest hankering for some good ol' Chinese food we all get this right
The sesame chicken was crunchy and sweet and the sweet and sour pork was the kind where you put your own sauce so I got to drench my food in that wonderful sauce
Needless to say it was a good meal definitely good Chinese food and will return
Thai food is all about flavor and about the food not how fancy you can plate it
Everything else is just an Americanized version of Thai food which I guess is what is good for the upscale area that it is in
The Chicken Cordon Blu was good but the service from the waiter was terrible
Queen Creek Olive Mill's food has the same nutritional goodness
It's not the best Thai food I've ever had but I definitely enjoyed it
We started off with the egg rolls which were good and then I had the pumpkin curry with tofu for dinner which was excellent
Desserts are put in generous sized shot glasses and only cost $2
They also had a cheese / lox/ fresh fruit area that looked super healthy   I must tell you the Kobe beef was very delicious and I wish I had had that first instead when I was full
Can't say too much for the food because I didn't have any but damn that fondue the couple at the table in front of me was having looked tasty
The atmosphere left a little to be desired but the food was light and delicious
Microwaving seemed likely re the hot spots in the dish
Why have two main ingredients that proclaim your quality the  fresh OJ and the for real ham on-the-bone and then phone it in with institutional canteen grade casserole meat and potatoes
The breakdown  I would say a good dining experience is the sum of the food the environment and the service
The way they handled things and the food quality even prior to that would have gotten them at least 4 stars
we ordered the last 2 rolls on the menu which was the most expensive so we figured it ought to be good
For dessert we ordered the blueberry cheesecake and the hot chocolate cake
It's not super authentic but they have good food
They cut their meat and cheese fresh because that's actually what you're supposed to do rather than pre-slice it and pre-package it so it can stew in its own juices while it gets shipped out to the nearest chain location My Ultimately Worthless Factoids-2 Subway-0
Goodcents I think it's safe to say that all that meat and cheese probably isn't doing our hearts any favors
The chicken noodle itself is worth a visit or two as is there chicken alfredo or pasta salad
I had a really tasty buffalo chicken wrap
Which i ended up taking half home it was a good amount of food
make sure to check out the hall of fame/shame to see good ol' Adam Richmond's mug up there from Man Vs Food
It was quiet service was very good and food was good
Having lived in Japan I have tasted the real good sushi and other traditional Japanese dishes like udon tonkatsu
Nice list of rolls appetizers and beverages at happy hour prices
i defiantly recommend Teharu to anyone that enjoys Sushi
We are snobs when it comes to good Indian food and we were giving up on finding another good place to go to
Fantastic retro style unique culinary approach fresh food good service and a relaxed casual atmosphere for evening dining
Lime cilantro rice would've been amazing with the dish
Everyone tried something different and everyone stated that they enjoyed their food
Their pineaple chicken is so yummy and the black bean shrimp is DELICIOUS
The place itself isn't much to look at but the flavorful food more then makes up for it
I'd stay on the meat wagon just to have one of their delicious burgers on an egg bun with sharp cheddar cheese any day
The chicken lettuce wrap was good as always
The moo shu chicken was okay when it was hot though lost it's appeal quickly
The customers who arrived shortly after us ordered the same menu items we did yet they received their food a good five minutes before us
It's a good place for pizza and you're not compromising anything in return
omg it is sweet and delicious it melts in your mouth not a taste of dry or fishyness
i do remember that the dish was excellent and big enough to supply leftovers for lunch the next day
we will continue to patronize Tottie's as they are consistent and the food and service has always been very very very good
Sushi Chef Jose - EXCELLENTAlso when we went there was only one sushi chef Jose
I don't profess to be a sushi expert in any sense of the word but I thought the sashimi here was pretty good especially considering the price
We also got a spicy tuna roll that was pretty good - nothing exceptional but good
However the spicy tuna hand roll was not that flavorful - maybe needed a little more spicy tuna - but it was decent with soy sauce and wasabi
The food quality itself is unsurprisingly on par with other 'berto's
I ordered the chicken with vegetable combination dinner which was very good
So basically the food is good and the service is so-so
We were greeted at the door and given small printed menus as they explained that the meats were sold by the half pound there were cold sides in a large refrigerator case drinks on a huge ice filled table and an order counter
96 The meats were great moist delicious well smoked some of the best BBQ we've had
The potato salad was fairly good I'd order that again as it goes well with the meats
Other than the quality and taste of the meats nothing else stood out
I give them 4 stars because of how good the meats are
My corned beef hash was tasty but had several chunks of chewy gristle mixed in
So this place gets points for ambience but loses stars for food quality and price
So like a good roommate I went with her last night with a couple of our friends and I have to admit the ButterBurgers are much better than your average fast food joint fare
Food is good andportions presented well and adequate
The food is excellent and the portions are large enough to take some home
The fried riced was excellent and meats were succulent
I'm a thin-crust lover and was impressed with the pizza crust here
If you want a good old fashioned pepperoni or sausage pizza then go somewhere else
The flavor of the pasta dishes we ordered were good but not great
Lobster was a bit rubbery and dish had very little flavor
the food is good and prepared while you wait and and unusual
Thanks to the two Diners Drive-ins & Dives' episodes on breakfasts I'd seen during Monday's treadmill routine I also had a craving for some corned beef hash or those wonderful hash browns from Matt's in downtown Phx
The food was typical bar food for appetizers
I would recommend going here if you are in the area want some cheap happy hour food and just want to watch some sports
The servers always steered me towards great dishes with their recommendations and I've taken many people here much to their delight
Last time I had the pleasure I ordered the Spicy BBQ Chicken Pizza and found it SO good that I did not even need ranch
All the the food was good but only if you like fried food
I also had a decent pumpkin beer for 5 bucks and they had free pizza from Slices cold on Sunday
I tend to make my own mixture of two of the sauces and double up on what they recommend because I usually have a TON of noddles and meat
I recommend getting a doggy bag at the beginning because if you pile on your food you will have extra for a few days
The waitress as far as I know kept up with everyone's needs and the food was really good
Athletes and Food Network Stars We've been here before and have always enjoyed everything
I was greatly impressed with the variety of food offered
As for the quality of the food some items were on par with other buffets and others were slightly better
I didn't love the very-full parking lot but I guess when you have food this good it's a given that parking may be an issue
The pizza menu looks wonderful by the way
I recommend you stay clear of this dish
Steaks were like rubber Asian food was as good as Panda Express the gelato was just basic ice creme so if you want almost as good then go here
Cheap fast delicious food but be sure to bring plenty of cash because they don't take cards
I had a polish chicago style a small fry and the beautiful abomination that is only known as a pizza puff a deep fried pizza pocket style item that was tasty but really greasy and certainly very unhealthy
The yellow curry here is my favorite with a delicious balance of coconut spice carrots chicken and potatoes
All in all Z Pizza had a nice atmosphere and good food
Other than that a most excellent place for decent food very friendly servers and excellent beer probably the best microbrews in the Phoenix area
I had the Italian beef with peppers and onions and my only comment is that I wish they would dunk the entire sandwich in au jus I think it's OK to get messy to have a good time
My lunch companion had the chicken parm he had never been to De Falco's or really an italian deli of any sort and he was really pleased with his selection as well in fact as we were leaving he saw one of the pizza's and said he was going to give them try for pizza this weekend so he really was impressed
and yes they were part of our groupI will say this the food that we did receive was good and the staff was friendly enough but still it does not make up for the service
can't say that we will come back there are just too many good pizza places in town
The food is delicious the atmosphere is warm and inviting and the people are really nice
We got an Olive Appetizer a Cheese Plate and Bruschetta Brie & Apples with Fig Spread Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone Tomato Jam & Fresh Sheeps Milk Cheese and Roasted Peppers with Goat CheeseI got the Nine IronHickory smoked bacon layered with grilled chicken fresh burratamozzarella lettuce beefsteak tomato and dijonnaiseMy wife and her friend split the VegetarianGrilled asparagus roasted artichokes red onion vine ripetomatoes goat cheese and house made pestoAnd of course a bottle of wine
I had the pollo poblano- the sauce was lacking in flavor chicken was dry
The shrimp dish had butterflied shrimp with french fries and the main lobster was enjoyed but I think I would have preferred the Caribbean lobster because the meat would be much firmer
It kills me when you see someplace with good food and good wine ignore something that goes better with their food but ignore it because it isn't upscale rnough for them
As for the beef most of the time it was done right and flavorful sometimes not so much
The sushi here is actually pretty good but in the two times dining in the service was very slow and the orders were wrong
The other must-order items are the kobe meatballs we all felt a little embarrassed at first over our love for the meatballs but once you've had them you'll order with pride and the rolls which are served hot and infused with trace amounts of some sort of cheese
how ever the service was good & the manager came to ask me if the food was good after the waiter told her about the fries being so bad but i just said yes all is good thanks
we receive such great service and its the one place that we can go and KNOW that our food will arrive hot and delicious
Anyway I must say again that the food and service were excellent
One of my greatest laments is how hard it is to find good fried chicken in Phoenix
Or good Southern food generally for that matter
Everyone else has summed it up pretty well- great fried chicken very good waffles and you can't go wrong by ordering up a kool-aid to go with it
All said and done it's good stuff and some of my favorite fried chicken in the Valley
Overall a very unique experience great ambiance and delicious food
Not only is the ambiance great amazing local artist's work on the walls open yet cozy dining room cool/hip looking wait staff but the food is amazing
They seem to have a good selection of stuff including all sorts of seafood and some produce you don't generally see at your local grocery store
And if you like Indian food take it from me that this is the only high-quality Indian meal to be found in all of central Phoenix
I ate the food and it was good but I was upset about the fact I had just paid $13 for a ridiculous amount of food
For an appetizer we ordered the chicken roll which came with a great sweet jalapeno sauce
Parts of the chicken were burnt and dry; and the Bourbon Chicken and Shrimp lack flavor and complementary sides
They absolutely get it right handling a huge volume of brunch orders on weekends and keeping it all moving relatively smoothly with always good food
The food is excellent the service generally good
It was very good and I like that they do not give you too much food well portioned
We topped of our wonderful conversation with some chocolate dessert Mexican Chocolate Torte
The patty of the burger was dripping with fat and the meat used was such low quality extremely high fat/meat ratio that the patty didn't even appear to be beef
I feel like if you're making something blatantly unhealthy there should at least be a method to the madness; there should be some attempt at wanting to make it actually taste good it is food by the way
I thought the food was very very good and the staff was very pleasant
There were several humus types fresh feta and other cheeses various olives and many hot and cold dishes
Too much food - very good value and we took chicken wrap home - was just as good next day
It's a brilliant concept really non-threatening food brussels sprouts are probably the scariest thing on the menu given an interesting tweak here and there to make it worthy of a night out
I really liked the chicken apple sausages on the other hand they were tasty and not the typical greasy kind
We all really enjoyed our food I got the chicken street taco they were tasty and exactly what I was in the mood for
The fried fish and fried shrimp ones were tasty too
The food is great the staff is laid back it is locally owned and has been around since I was in high school so many good memories in this place
The food was excellent and so was our waiter
Good quality beef not that fatty crap that some places serve
I like their hot italian beef sandwich with extra hot peppers
I may have had a once-in-a-blue-moon shitty pizza but that's enough for me to drive to Thompson Peak & Hayden to make sure I get the quality food I'm paying for
The fish itself was good but the fries tasted stale
to complete your dining experience it's important to leave room for the excellent dessert selection
The roast beef which has been good in the past had that one day too long in the fridge smell
For appetizers we have four different pizzas the crispy Frito misto and the antipasto board
A huge serving of tender lobster salad was spooned inside of a grilled buttery roll then served with shattered potato chips was amazing
InteriorIf you're nitpicky about a place having good interior design well this is just average regular fast food resturant look almost nothing special
Good old fashioned and uniquely Arizona outside dive bar/historic landmark/good music/greasy food/decent beer selection/edible burgers
The egg rolls were just as delicious and even the chicken fried rice I know rice at a noodle place
The wait staff wheel a presentation cart to show you the cut and quality of the beef
You'll see lined up a bunch of wonderful appetizers and entrees and you'll wonder why you have put up with inadequate food during your trip to Scottsdale
It's a great little place and you'll know that for such a small place to make it they have to construct interesting and tasty dishes like Hibiscus Enchiladas
Good pizza went with a large group and was able to try several different styles
Heres what I had Diavola pizza The Vortex pizza Southwest Chicken Pizza Hawaiian pizza Classic Gluten free pizza  They were all very good
But I fully enjoyed my chicken and mole tortilla casserole along with a delicious tasting set of sorbet zesty lime pineapple mint and colima tamarind for dessert
Salt and pepper shrimp all types of pork and chicken dishes salmon delicious sushi even some american food for picky kiddies
The decor was great but im here to eat good food and great service not look pay premium price for decor
ALL IN ALLPROS Great decorCons OKAY sushi for premium priceServers like to flirt with the sushi chef instead of helping customersSushi chef doesnt like talking to the customers instead he likes to flirt with the good looking girls there we running a sushi hooters now
I highly recommend this establishment  Excellent Food Service Family Atmosphere or perfect Date Night & we look forward to celebrating my upcoming birthday here
The shrimp was good sweet and sour pork ok but the teriyaki chicken was definitely NOT chicken
I have always save once recieved excellent service from you Mind you I worked at a Denny's before and your staff work wonders to get the food out fast
For the meat eaters I hear the prosciutto one is pretty good
The newly revamped restaurant Gallo Blanco is another welcomed addition to the Hotel the food is stellar top notch quality
the pizza is flavorless and leaves ya needing a gallon of water afterwards
It's definitely quality for a fast food chain
I agree with the reviewer who said good food costs
Finding great sushi in the valley is an overwhelming challenge so I am relieved to finally have a default place to go for amazing sushi
We had several courses the first of which was a sashimi tuna cut from the belly; it was very rich in fat which makes it just melt in your mouth served with freshly made wasabi followed by a beautifully prepared salmon with an amazing ponzu dipping sauce we took them up on their offer to fry the remaining head and bring it back we had incredible little lamb ribs which came served with little japanese fruits kobe beef I think they call it something else which blew my mind
The pizza is also delicious and the ingrediants in the chicken salad were so fresh and crisp- nothing but oohs and aahs from the crowd of us
Foodies all over the world make journeys and take treks to discover a new flavor
There are a lot of good Mexican food spots here in AZ
I just feel like the food needs a bit more pizzazz and maybe some more distinct flavors/dishes to set them apart from the crowd
while they're good reliable Mexican dishes it'd be nice to have more adventurous options like some of the higher end Mexican spots offer
My impression here is that folks who rave about this place have never had really good food with flavor
The oils can be used for many different types of cooking and give great flavor to any dish even cakes and breads
The food is so flavorful and seemingly fresh
You get a savory and spicy eggplant dish and a slightly sweet and spicy peanut sauce dish and the combo is excellent
This place came highly recommended by not only Food Network's Guy Fieri of DDD but ALL our friends and everyone swears we must've just hit it on an off night
ALL of the food had the exact same flavor and texture uber-salty flavorless mush
Maybe they stopped making quality food when they learned they could ride on the notoriety the TV exposure got them
As an appetizer I also had a NY style egg roll
For about ten dollars you can feed three people your cardiologist will not be happy with you but the food is so tasty
With Mexican food I generally believe that there is an inverse relationship between taste and price Bisteces is an excellent example of this phenomenon
The appetizer list is pretty extensive - the chicken and beef skewers were tasty the sushi was decent  and the vegetables were yummy
The dough centerpiece of a pizza for me is amazing
I think Big Jimmy's stole mucho sabor lots of flavor from Food City and put it all into their pizza
And the couple of times my rice-high from the sushi place next door son dropped his cone on the floor they were so kind and understanding about it they just scooped up the mess while they joked around with my little one about all the ice cream they've had to wipe off the floor in the past with other customers and made him a fresh new cone adding extra sprinkles for good measure
I've had the fajitas which were good and the chicken enchiladas which were amazingly average - at least for the prices which are dangerously similar to a certain competing restaurant 1
It's a small little place pretty simple inside with a great menu of chicken waffles kool aid and a variety of other menu items that are tasty
I went with the Chicken and Waffle Combo for $10 and it was tasty
I ordered Corned Beef Hash with Jalapeno in it it was really good
This place totally makes up for the other pizza place that unfortunately shares the same name as this place but has absolutely no affiliation thank goodness
The coal firing gives a wonderfully smokey flavor to the pizza and leaves yummy bubbles in the crust
Chicken fingers like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches have tragically been dismissed by most places as something not worth trying to make well
Here however all things chicken are prepared and seasoned to actually have flavor and the myriad of unique sauces you can choose from enhance that
The table-side guacamole and chips was pretty good and my friends' ordered the same trout as myself and the fish tacos
My son had the quesadilla from here which is pricey for what it is considering he orders it plain but the cheese is yummy and the rest of the food makes it totally worth it
There was a good selection of pre-arranged burgers or lots of choices to build your own including 5 different meats cheeses fois grois etc
Takes a bit of time to get your food but it is even posted it takes a while to make a quality sandwich
The Beef Carpaccio being my favorite- it had all the right flavors
It's exploding with flavor and they let you customize your order if you want chicken and beef
So many to choose from Luncha Libre with their mason jar drinks Short Leash Dogs with their insanely creative hot doggies Emerson Fry Bread with their flavorful concoctions on Indian Bread Mojo Bowl with there fresh handmade smoothies Creme Brulee with their rich torched goodness Hey Joe with their fun Filipino Street Food Taste Rite with their oodles of noodles Burgermania with their American style classic burgers n fries or how about some Buzznbeez Good Food with their soulful Cajun southern dishes
The creme brulee dessert was not very good
The food is very good the waiter was very nice and the atmosphere is fun
He ordered the cold sub with italian meats hehe and mozz and the usual veggies
The grilled swordfish with arthichokes was also extremely good but way too salty as was the ribeye my boyfriend ordered
The atmosphere is laid back the dress ranged from t-shirts and shorts to sun dresses and collared shirts the wines are good and the food is really good
Amazing food and drinks but sadly a little too pricey for me
I liked Roaring Fork because it has a wide range yet short list of food good portions cooked well and I definitely got my moneys worth with the Huckleberry Margarita
It comes with a dark flavorful sauce that substitues for the traditional fish sauce
Tofu spring rolls and the accompanying peanut sauce is delicious
The key lime cheesecake we got for dessert was not so good - it had a strange trying-too-hard-to-be-different tinge to it and it was drowning in a sea of raspberry sauce
All in all I would go back to and recommend House of Tricks because the food has been fairly consistent in quality and its ambiance is a rare find in Phoenix
It's tiny it's not a good place if you really want to sit down and eat and it kinda sucks having to work your way through the crowds to order food and again I feel like if they don't know you they don't pay as much attention to you
A good place for a date or friends and family although a little over priced for the food
It was good though I would have liked to know beforehand that the seasoning on the lobster was going to be a little spicy not a fan of spicy dishes
All in all the food was alright but I don't think it was worth the price
I'm a big fan of mixing sweet and savory foods and they definitely did a good job of that here
The service was great and the food was excellent
I really wanted to get a photo of my dish because it was a work of art despite just being pasta et al piled onto a plate
Being that my wife and I are both Korean we know what good Korean food is and QQ grill so far has our thumbs up
It is a Korean style fried rice made with beef bulgogi thinly sliced marinated beef vegetables Korean style spinach bean sprouts zucchini carrots to name a few spicy Kochujang chili pepper sauce on the side that you mix to taste depending how spicy you like stuff and it all comes in a sizzling hot clay pot
This isn't exclusively a Japanese sushi restaurant so I wasn't expecting the roll to be amazing and it wasn't
The sushi price is a tad high if you order exotic items which is why i only come during happy hoursTheir happy hour is awesome an array of appetizers/drinks/rolls for 50% of the regular menu price
I highly recommend Crazy roll i normally get some spicy tuna roll with itThe servers are always helpful and nice it's a great place to have sushi
Switch has a reputation around town of being a gay friendly atmosphere and for using top quality ingredients in the food
The menu is a tasty combination of sandwiches salads burgers and other comfort foods
The blintz is a good sweet dish but also savory
Because the food in that area is way too expensive for my pockets my best friend recommended Fresh Mint to us
We all shared the Autumn roll which was delicious but definitely not enough food for how much it cost
It comes in a large combo with lots of meat & broth is very flavorful
good summer dish for me* Both the egg roll & spring rolls
My friend's food was delicious as well service was attentive and FAST
We enjoyed the food and we enjoyed the service
In retrospect it may have been a blessing in disguise given the absolute mediocre quality of the food
I suggest some kind of combination like the followingSzechuan Pepper BrothChickenSpinachVermicelliCreate a hotpot from this
I'd say they were pretty well done and although I thought Hana's sushi was better in the quality of the fish as well as presentation he's not called Mr
The Cauliflower App Caprese is pretty tasty and the Gongozola Cheese and Pistachio Slaw is yummers but the rest of our food was plain or terrible
The dessert menu looked good but we did not indulge
Finally the pizza came and it looked nice and smelled very good
Service was excellent and the place was nice and in a nice area but the food was nowhere near up to par
This is a tasty dish served with enough shrimp to make it filling
My wife's favorite is the orange chicken which she prefers hotter than I like it so we always tone it down
They always accomodate requests and come up with flavorful dishes
In addition to electronics photo lab optical center bakery meat department they also have a little know clearance section at each Sam's
The food is good -- shout-out to El Bravo -- and the airport is super reliable probably single most important criterion if you ask me
For exotic wines and exotic meats appetizers look up Down Under Wines
Yes the name is lame but the food is good
I love Greek food and I thought everything here was pretty tasty
My boyfriend had some sort of lemony chicken piccata type thing which didn't seem very Greek but he enjoyed it
If you like hot food ask for a side of the habanero salsa
Note that although I opt for hormone free chicken and beef when I grocery shop and go out to eat when available I understand that this place may not have the highest quality protein ingredients
We did stop at the bakery and purchased a cinnamon roll that was really good they heated it back up for us before they served it some sort of apple crisp thing and a chocolate chip cookie skip the cookie but everything else was good
The service was extremely fast and friendly the food hot and fresh and they serve the most amazing iced tea- the old school Lipton variety fresh brewed clear and cold
There was quite a bit of sauce on there and in this case it was probably a good thing since the meat was presented in a less than ideal way
The food here is really good and the main saving grace
There are plenty of reviews here about their food yes it is as good as everyone says but I wanted to talk about their customer service since I am big fan of customer service
I definitely need to try some other menu items because there were some other dishes at the other tables that looked really good
the very first time I ate here was over a year ago and i was pleasantly surprised with good quality rolls satay pot stickers not the best but good and decent drinks
but again poorly constructed rolls loose and falling apart gamey tasting sushi avocado rolls had no flavor and almost cold calamari barely fried
As for the food I agree that the SUSHI here is always tasty but I've gotten rolls where the rice wasn't sticky and the roll fell apart never a good thing
My only criticism is that as delicious as these wood-fired pizzas are they lack enough red sauce as is lathered on pizzas in back East Italian eateries
Lunch on Friday was very flavorful fried rice with chicken tasty shrimp and vegetables
This is a higher-middle quality end chain food
If you just moved here and are craving good ole fashioned Indian food check out Royal Taj Guru Palace and Dehli Palace
My parents said the devil's food cake was pretty delicious
The chicken was very moist and tender but it had a strange flavor
Very disappointed at the poor meat quality and the inattentive wait staff
One of the worst meals I have ever had - This place will not last long with the quality of food they serve
All in all we had a fun experience here and the food was good
Weekday lunch is great here with the extensive menu especially appetizers and of course the dessert
The Fried rice was your basic rice with peas and chicken and was good
My best friend and I were out and about and we wanted some food from the delicious Blu Burger Grille which just so happens to be VERY close to Francesca's
The place is small and cramped but the food service is quick and tasty
It is our new spot to go get some delicious food
You can experience surf and turf east coast style or a blending of traditional american dishes with flavors from around the globe

After reviewing their VAST menu of over 100 dishes which covered everything from every colored curry under the sun to  vegetarian dishes Barbeque Chinese favorites and soups that I'm looking forward to sampling when the weather gets colder; I ordered the Pad Thai and my mom ordered the Cashew Chicken
The chicken mole enchildas are delicious with the mole leaning towards a red mole sweet with a bit of spice
And lastly the sopapillas are oh so delicious but unless you want your dessert with your meal I recommend requesting that they be brought out afterwards
This comes off like high quality bar food but the execution isn't quite there
I'll start by saying the food is delicious
I just figured the food was so good that people had to be forced to leave
That said the quality of food is so much better that it's really worth every penny
I must say however that I enjoyed ten twenty times over the simple chicken torta I had chosen at the Phoenix Ranch Market on Central and Southern a few weeks back
So the first thing that sets me off is the fish smell when I walk in the door - not good to sour the stomach of this midwestern girl turned sushi lover with the smell of pond and old fish
I won't waste your or my time with obtuse banter so here is the rundown - Atmosphere typical black and red Japanese decor - Bathrooms cool stone sinks that drip and slosh water on your feet so be aware - Sashimi overpriced so-so quality served in a glass bowl over ice - Rolls underwhelming - Calipico soda fabulous - Deserts yummy but small - Birthday celebrations abundant and noisy with little tambourines that lit up
I wanted to sit outside and people watch over good food at a NEW restaurant
Everything was fresh and flavorful but being a really good cook of latin food I am going to make this recommendation to the cook
Too full to try dessert but they had some interestingly delicious offering
Ok good service nice atmosphere good food excellent sake not priceless
We ordered 4 sushi rolls and some Goyza / edamame as appetizers which tasted perfect
The diamondback roll was the best of the three and would be a definite the next time we stop in absolute lightly fried goodness
The other appetizer I tried was either chicken or turkey on a stick with a rosemary and sage rub which was good but not excellent
The food quality is just above Denny's IMO
The food was so good that our group came back the next day for lunch
The guy who took our orders was nice and chatty we sat and our food came out fast - I was pretty impressed with the setup really nice modernized and delicious
My salmon had a great consistency and was flavorful but had a smidge of a fishy taste
I guess it says a lot about the quality of the food when you are willing to get stuffed into the seats like you are about to takeoff on a Southwest flight to Midway and still you choose to give this place 4 stars
The vermicelli noodle bowls Bun are extraordinary in their vivid flavors and are perfect light food for those craving a change from heavier Southwest standards
The quality of food was horrible and the service was even worse
The price is right for these street tacos rolled tacos tamales and Mexican hot dogs at newly-opened Tacos Atoyac
Overall dinner for two was about $13 which included six tacos one soda a spicy chicken tamale a rolled taco and a Oaxacan hot dog
I wasn't wild about the texture of the mock chicken and the pieces were too large but the flavor was good and definitely added to the salad
I won't pretend to be a Pho connoisseur but I do know good food when I taste it
Throw it in roll it up and dip it in fish or soy sauce oh so good
Well the really good quality food of course
But more than that this is a place that has quality food for all types of people
with respect to the other rave review their only saving grace is good service esp for people who had not had vietnamese food before as their servers do speak better english and because they are not crowded usually they would have more time and patience to explain the food to you
The reason why they are not crowded is because they are located in a vietnamese/asian centric mall with large crowds of asians shopping for food and groceries at the mekong supermarket and they know a good pho from a bad one
You're close your food is fairly good your drinks are hefty and your 2 dollar bloodies are quickly becoming a weekly excursion for me
But if you're craving general Asian flavors and don't mind a touch of grease in your food then Noodles Ranch may do in a pinch
Overall not a bad pan-Asian food place but the flavors just didn't fulfill my craving for Vietnamese
All in all though the food is yummy and good for kids we took our 9 month old who is always a gem in restaurants and there were several other kids there
White chocolate banana cream pie was my choice and it really had an amazing flavor but the dessert you must have is the French white chocolate bread pudding - wow - wow - wow
Needless to say good food - the worst service I have ever experienced
That dish is generally a good barometer of the quality of a mexican restaurant and theirs was soggy and drenched in melted cheese
Tortilla factory's food didn't rate on par with even some of the taco carts around town some of which are actually quite good so it's probably in insult to the carts to compare them with this place
The flavors of the sauce as good but the meat was dry and tough
This is about as good as it gets for brunch food
I think next time I'll ask for aluminum foil to line the styrofoam takeout box so the sauce doesn't leak in my car and the hot food doesn't melt the styrofoam a xenoestrogen or if I think of it in advance I'll bring a sheet of aluminum foil with me
We started with the Carne Adovada Quesadilla - let me be the first to say I'm not a huge fan of pork except bacon god's most perfect food but this was so tasty
With the appetizers it was perfect for 4 people to split if it had only been 2 of us the appetizers plus the platter would have been WAY too much food
All the meats were done to perfection and so much flavor
Veggie pizza was tasty as well but they only put itty bitty bits of toppings on the lunch portion pizza
The food was really yummy - I highly recommend the a fried fish offering an off the menu item our waitress was nice enough to tell us about as well as the Gyoza Soup
Food at the restaurant is good; there is better elsewhere in Scottsdale
It's also a good place for families with picky eaters as they have some selections of non-asian dishes available; pizza fried chicken garlic bread deviled eggs etc
My friend ordered the Casablanca Chicken Sandwich with Rosemary French Fries and said it was really good too
The service was good the food was delicious and I walked out with a few good photos
Had the chicken picatta which was excellent
Most Greek/Mediterranean places tend to overflavor their food I thought Eden balanced the flavor of their chicken brilliantly with just a compliment of nice spices
Decent Prices a bit pricey compared to thai or pizza or something but its well worth it
Apart from the Chicken Tikka Masala that i order everytime i go the Eggplant dish is also very good as well as the lentils and the Garlic Naan
Typical blunders are not all ingrediants are in the meal food brought out cold or burnt
As far as the two hour wait  well it was worth it this food rocked
The spring rolls had a decent flavor but were mushy
The fish and chips were tasty made more so by the awesome tartar sauce and the corned beef though a little dry was tasty too
There I discovered vegan 'frozen shrimp' made of some sort of root mushroom 'meat' and other tasty bits
The Saigon Bun was okay - the dressing was tasty but too many dry noodles needed a little more meat in it
The service was really good they all seemed very nice even the cook was asking us how the food tasted
The burger was delicious well the beef patties were
I really wanted a tasty Italian beef but I guess it wasn't in my destiny
Inexpensive good food that really hits the spot
The service was adequate no complaints there and the food was adequate not really impressed
The wife enjoyed the salad but the pizza was as I said meh
Oh the meat-lovers had plenty of meat on it but oddly flavorless
the service the food the ambiance have always been consistently above par sometimes even excellent depending upon the time of day dining
The food isnt bad for sports bar fare the beer is ICE cold and for an older central phoenix building this place is really well maintained
We also had the margherita pizza which was pretty tasty
The chicken was the moistest most flavorful most succulent chicken I've had in my whole life
And for the dessert again so I could provide you with this thoughtful review I had the grand marnier-flavored cinnamon roll
I don't typically like nuts in my food but the texture and flavor of this bun was so perfect I got over it quickly
The first time I went I had the Asado sandwich with criolla sauce and today I tried the rotisserie chicken both delicious
The food was good and they kept the margarita's coming
The food was good but I wasn't particularly wowed by my meal
We only had dessert and it was quite good though the portion was a bit small
I will be back soon for appetizers and main course but so far as dessert spot with a few pints this place is great
The spicy shrimp and eggplant appetizer was the standout dish in my opinion
The staff is very friendly and they think it's awesome if you're daring enough to order more traditional menu items like the special beef soup or the durian boba which is really tasty despite its stinkyness
The place has a good variety from sandwiches and salads that are good to items like meatloaf and fish and chips
I'm a pretty big snob when it comes to Mexican food since I was raised on the good stuff
The pizza was pepperoni with fresh basil on top and some hot wings with a 2 liter bottle of Pepsi
So I open the pizza and it's cold and just a plain pepperoni
If you can get past the overpowering smell and taste of the garlic then it was a good dish
It's pricey but generally good particularly the pizzas
I don't know much about Greek food so I found an item on the menu that looked delicious -the chicken caesar pita- and it was
The charm of the owners is a rare find among businesses and the food is fresh and delicious
The rainbow roll was pretty good but the sashimi was questionable
I'm always satisfied with their friendly quick service and hot fresh food
The food here is true to hispanic culture and very delicious
The gyro meat is really tasty and I've now gotten the gyro and chicken kebab salad the last two times and the chicken is super good as well
I will keep returning for the tasty meat
I think next time I will just try a pure chicken dish so I can get more of that tasty chicken
I guess it's a New Mexican hot and New Mexican variation of Mexican food that is suppose to burn more in your throat than on your tongue
Do people really think this is good Italian food
However I was quite impressed by the freshness and quality of the food - my relleno was very good - and the 'ritas were tasty as well
Flavorful food reasonable prices strong drinks what more do you need
Good prices consistently excellent food and friendly/helpful staff
This is my go-to place when I want to pick up something wonderful for dessert
I know its a lot of food but we wanted to try a good variety and it cost about $27
At that point we both agreed no matter how good the food was  we were not willing to wait in the parking lot of a restaurant
We were extremely disappointed and ended up getting some Mexican food and taking it back to our hotel room and watching television
The Chicken Picatta was enjoyed by my husband though a touch salty
The spot's super-casual really fast and has a patio to sit on making it a great lunch spot full of tasty comfort food
Comparable to Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles in Southern California Lo-Lo's is pretty good
Open late with no long waits to be seated especially with a big group Lo-Lo's is a place to visit in Arizona for some good chicken and waffles
I love my food to come out hot if it is suppose to be hot or at least warm maybe but when I order their special rice plate the meats came out cold and the rice was a little warm
I ordered number 7 cheese enchilada + green corn tamale which was good albeit pretty standard and my mom got the chicken tortilla soup which she said she would definitely get again
As far as food goes I have only had their fish and chips but it was delicious
I had the crispy chicken sandwich which was delicious but ginormous
It is these small differences that make good food great food
The wings are meaty and tasty but are not as superior to the pizza
Anyhow my sister and I sat down and ordered a yellowtail appetizer and a few drinks and then she ordered a few rolls while I stuck with the sashimi plate that I usually get
The colors of the salad were dreadful and the chicken was boiled with no flavor
I may give this place a second chance because the service was good and there are other good reviews but if I had to make a judgement on just food
We were starving so we immediately order the traditional spring rolls and some hot tea
The sticky rice was amazing and the flavors and freshness of the papaya salad and chicken were fantastic
The beef pho was also very good but since I just had Pho with Oxtail stock from Monsoon in Seattle I'm a little picky right now
Wonderful food classy atmosphere but from almost the minute we sat down they were telling us that the food would take a very long time and that the service was very slow
Good food is one part of having a restaurant its usually not the most important part
TL;dr amazing mediterranean food with plenty of meat options that will blow your mind
Gyro meat by itself is usually amazing simply because its meat but when its accompanied with an amazing sauce it really becomes stellar
The entrees are just good plain food
The food was all very good not super duper but very good
The food is good it's only eggs and toast but the waitstaff is is slow forgetful can be rude and doesn't know the menu
We also ordered the chicken tenders and I just wasn't that impressed with it
I have had the pastrami sandwich there many times and love it but the honey mustard tasted funky and the chicken just tasted like the oil it was fried in almost no flavor
The food had a ton of heat but lacked actual flavor
The sushi itself wasn't half bad although I've had better and the service could be a bit more attentive out on the patio but all in all a nice little joint right on Scottsdale Road that i've always had a good time at
We then followed up with a pizza which was so amazing it left me wondering what I actually got because I was so happy with it
Food is generally tastier than the other concepts in my opinionServers are friendlyValet parkingNow the negativesFood was 'meh'Awkward patio seating with uncomfortable chairs sitting on dirtSlow serviceOver-priced especially for a kids grilled cheese plate that didn't even taste goodDon't come hungry  gnocchi was ok but was served as a diet portionValet parking I don't get this place but then again it's a Fox-owned business catering to the masses looking to make the big bucks
The burrito was packed with meat guacamole & Pico de Gallo very flavorful and yummy
And a little bird told me that the most amazing thing on the menu thus far is the Oregano Lime Chicken
In the past the service has been okay and food is pretty good
We got dessert to go it was very good bread pudding and a brownie the next day
The combinations of flavors in the various dishes ordered left me feeling like I had traveled to another country in my mouth
The prices are reasonable and you get a good amount of food for your money
When I think of authentic amazing Mexican food I think of Caramba and then drool a little
Everything on the menu is delicious but I always end up ordering the beef taco combo
It also smells wonderful and I loved both the croissant and the chicken sandwich that I ate
We came here on a Monday night for a celebratory dinner because we found a $25 for $50 worth of food on Local Dines
We had the duck meatballs as an appetizer and I ordered the sea bass entree
I imagined they would be succulent and have the same delicious texture that regular meatballs that you find on pasta dishes have
The seasoning that they used was amazing and the vegetables married very well with the rest of the dish
The food was slightly above average but the service was slow and below average overall a good choice if you are in the area but not worth the drive
It is half a plate of polenta half a plate of Bolognese which tasted and looked  like spiced ground beef in a dark red sauce think higher quality manwich and a large piece of French bread
The chicken pot pie with a puffed-bread on top as the bread element used sage at the just-right level and apparently was very good
For one the food is really good but not excellent
Unlike the other stir fry places here you need to add maybe 7 ladle's of sauces to get the correct flavor and then you get a BOILED vegetable dish
You can get decently spicy food here that's extremely HOT to some of you or skip the heat entirely
They don't make the most awesome Indian food I have ever had but it is good hearty and comforting
Recommended any of their tandoori dishes; a vegetable curry that may not be on the menu but comes as a side in one of the special dinners; saag paneer; mango lassi; their relishes
Each lunch special includes a cup of hot and sour OR egg drop soup 2 fried wontons 1 egg roll and your entree served with steamed rice
The cashew chicken was a tad salty but mix it with the steamed rice and you're good to go
Regardless of who said what  I truly enjoyed what I consider a GOOD pizza
I highly recommend packing a lunch and eating in the picnic area though as food is abnormally high priced even for a zoo/amusement park
For the most part I thought the prices were high considering the quality and complexity of the dishes and the service
I got the seafood stew which was highly recommended by the server
Some of my favorite dishes in the past have included an excellent spinach salad with wasabi dressing a Pork Tenderloin that was tender enough to cut with the edge of my fork and the often reviewed lobster
I do recommend a reservation unless you are stopping by for just dessert after a dinner elsewhere as it can be very busy with only approx
The search for good Chinese food in Phoenix continues
The food offered at lunch is good but I wouldn't go out of my way for it
We tried the hot and sour soup with beef the silver noodle soup and the drunken noodles
She and our waiter checked on us several times and were very good about explaining the dishes
Also the food did take awhile but this is a small shop with authentic recipes that were well worth the wait
The handroll contained an adequate amount of fish and the taste was very good
I enjoyed a wonderful pizza here last night
Last night when we were decided what to do for dinner I said let's have pizza and let's look on Yelp for a recommendation
I definitely recommend this restaurant if you like family owned pizza places and great New York style pizza
Maybe their shellfish and meats are different but the fish fillets just aren't worth it
The gallettes and the hells fire fries extra hot sauce on the side are the best apps for sharing and I never get anything besides the AZ88 chicken salad chopped and tossed with ranch on the side
I would recommend everything that we had caesar eggplant pizza chicken parmesan but most of all focus on the dessert paired with an outstandingly foamy latte
That was a fun afternoon ;-The food was amazing as usual and the service was outstanding
There is a great authentic mexican flavor to their food and they have amazing Tequila's that keeps you coming back for more
The chicken was super tender and the sauce was plentiful and tasty
If it's anywhere near as good as the chicken I'll be a happy island girl
If you're looking for good down home Cuban food & great hospitality your Cuban friends talk endlessly and proudly about growing up with then will likely not steer you to Havana Cafe
If you want good Cuban food and you're ever in any of these towns here are some great places to eat & they're truly authentic Cuban food
The food is very good and a decent value
The food was good and the prices were good just very small portions
Good food for the price and everything is grilled
The low fat/low calorie food actually has a great flavor and their teriyaki sauce is the best ever
If you want good food without a lot of fat but need it fast this is your place to go
The dessert was good but a little to potent for our liking
Let me tell you if you want to taste some of the BEST pasta salad on this good brown earth order the seafood pasta salad
The pizza here is the only thing I like from here but man oh man are they good
Make your own pizza and pick some random things to throw together just not too many and it'll still taste good
I wasn't impressed with how crowded the area was but I got over that once I had myself some pizza
The food is consistently delicious and the staff is friendly and attentive but not hovering
All of the dishes are wonderfully prepared and pleasantly presented
Great to find out that the split didn't impact the quality of food or service
Why would a place like this not have made to order hot fresh food
I highly recommend Mastro's if you are in the mood for a great steak not to say their seafood isn't just as tasty
But I can't recommend the food and feel great about it
I would give a 3-star for that not-so-fresh lumpia and the filling but the manager was so nice and sweet that I want to keep coming back --- and to add to it their other dishes like dinuguan and the arroz caldo are delicious
But it was still good but not as good as what I am used to eating back home in small food stands along the smoky and busy streets of Manila
Pub Burgers Pretzel Fondue Fish and Chips Fried Chicken Potato Chips and you know I'm a sucker for fresh house made potato chips Prime Rib Dip and rest have all been tasty well prepared and nicely presented by very friendly and attentive wait staff
Don't be thrown by their cheesy name their pizza is pretty darn good
Everything was quite wonderful this was my first encounter with Ethiopian food and it won't be my last
I am quite the foodie and I love trying new foods from different cultures and quite particular so glad that there is at least one good spot in Arizona for this
Ok-  first this I NOT fine dining it's a fast food that saidIt has a good selection of  Chinese and sushi
Rainbow roll- looked good and tasted good
Yellowtail sashimi- good for fast foodFried rice-standardOver all worth a visit if you need take out on your way home from work
My swordfish was excellent firm yet succulent and the fries were surprisingly good and plentiful
The food wasnt horrible but also not good
As far as the pizza goes I've only tried the Mama Spinato's pizza because it's so good that I can't get myself to try anything else
We always get great service and they are very accommodating just wish the food had more flavor
We ordered -Roka Akor Butterfish -Crispy Fried Squid -Roka Akor Hamachi Serrano Chili Roll -Salmon Avocado Roll -Roka Akor Soft Shell Crab Roll -Mushroom Burger -Roka Akor Sweet Corn Skewer -Roka Akor Sweet Potato Skewer Everything was delicious
What a perfect day with good food good friends a sunny day and a cold glass of bubbly
This place is clean friendly and good food
The pizza was only the personal size but easily big enough for my girlfriend and I to split and very tasty
Their menu is handwritten on the wall with color photos of each dish
I took an order of chicken to go and ate it later in the day also meaty moist and flavor filled
I had the Curried Chicken and Dumpling and I wouldn't recommend it
They also usually have delicious renditions oif Saag Paneer Daal Mahrani[sp] Chicken Vindaloo and Chicken Tikka Masala
Despite all these negatives I still rate the place tops second only to Star of India [where the food is at least as good if not slightly better and everybody speaks English fluently]I recently moved very close to this place which has been a real trial of temptation
It is a fantastic place to hang out for a while and eat some good food
I have had both Grilled Chicken Flautas and a Chicken and Spinach Quesadilla and both are pretty good for lower calorie fair
Service is almost always good it's never too crowded and the food is not bad and very affordable
Food was good all around the table- chips & salsa street tacos breakfast burrito mini chimis & chicken flautas
The service was a bit slow but the food was really good and good for you
Recommendation To anyone who is a healthy eater and everyone that shops at whole foods
To people who are vegans and non alike that just want a good meal come to true food kitchen
The fish and pups were served right from the fryer piping hot and perfectly done
Breading on the fish was thin and crisp just as it should be and the fish was flaky and flavorful
Not just because it's close but it's a fun atmosphere with good food and good service
The pizza was tasty thin crust healthyish style
I was a little sad that I had to wait for my salad while I had my pizza because I planned to eat the salad first making sure the last taste I left with was delicious pizza but as it turned out the pear and garganzola salad was the highlight of the meal
Overall the food was very good service was attentive and the ambiance was chic & bright
My sister got the meatloaf which she said was excellent
All the food did not taste fresh and tasty
Over a total of four visits to CPH I've sampled five of their cocktails and a number of their appetizers and desserts along with two entrees met and interacted meaningfully with all three of the owners including the at least locally-renowned Chef Bernie Kantak creator of Cowboy Ciao's Stetson Chop Salad [which is recreated here] and generally thoroughly enjoyed myself on each occasion
The entrees I've tried thus far the salmon and the chicken didn't quite plumb the depths of my soul and while the appetizers I sampled on other occasions were excellent I don't remember any of them well enough to cover them in any detail
I will say that the salads I've tasted are all amazing and that the bread pudding dessert was an absolute revelation right up there with the one delivered to John on the Isle of Patmos
In sum good food and great drinks served by lovely people in a nice setting for reasonable prices
If you are from New England and live in the desert now and miss good pizza look no further than Sal's
I'm not sushi expert but I know what's tasty
I'm not super adventerous with sushi but the basics were good
Good sandwiches pasta dishes fruits veggies meats to grill that day
For our appetizer we got AZ egg rolls which were really melt in your mouth good served with some delicious dipping sauce
For the main dish we got the pork tenderloin and center cut steak with Parmesan cheese melted on top which came with fries that were very tasty
So all in all I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice place to go on a Saturday night the prices are reasonable the service is good even if they aren't as flexible as they should be at times with the menu and the food is very tasty
The FoodFortunately the range of additional toppings is pretty good but every little bit adds up
Service is hit or miss but I have always been happy with the food quality
It looked delicious but my food was near cold
The food here is good that's why I'm giving it a 2 but other than that they need to teach these girls serious customer service
The food was good not the best I've tasted and definitely a bit pricey but the Poke Tuna I got was fresh it was drowning in a pool of some sort of sauce was strange but helped cut the spicy so I liked it
I have never ever tasted spoiled seafood at a good restaurant
The appetizer menu could use some work but the desserts make up for it
The food at Chino Bandido is really good
So imagine the pressure my co-worker Gabi K was under to find a sushi place worthy of my snobby and know-it-all sushi taste buds
Service is good du00e9cor is nice not too noisy lots of food for the price not that it's cheap but at $12 for my entru00e9e I got a very large and tasty chicken breast
The first time I went the person I was with didn't know much about sushi and the server took the time to explain and recommend some of the rolls which was very nice
Service was nice food was good prices were silly chairs were cramped pretty much what you'd expect
The food was good but the service was so-so
While this is not the trendiest sushi place nor the cheapest but it delivers decent quality seafood and better than average service
Plus the food was great everything we've had has been very tasty now it's all been off of the happy hour menu but that's the only time I'll probably be here the scotch eggs are delicious and my main recommendation
It's enough to add even more flavor to the taco but no so much that it overpowers the meat
Mostly because while I adore most of their concepts I have found the quality of their food to be uneven at best
The food has potential and there are still several things on the menu that I haven't tried that sound good
The whole dealio is very o frills  the food and utensils are disposable and they process are very cheap for pretty good Mexican
After about 5 failed attempts at finding a pizza joint worth the money we were invited to Spinato's
and I often find myself adding Fish Sauce and Chili just to get it to be good
It was a pretty good amount of food for $12 and it was well presented
Good flavor nice tasting chicken no complaints at all
They have good selection on better pet food grain-free Innova Evo etc
Overall if you're in the North Valley and you want some Italian food I'd recommend it
Not sure what they're putting in the food to make it so good - could it be love
The wine and the food is good no matter where you sit but the outdoor seating by the fire is where I like to be
I was just there to socialize so I didn't get a chance to try the food but friends said it was good
the beef was delicious the bartender was friendly and efficient despite the standing room only conditions and the valet was literally running to make parking smooth and hassle-free
we ordered our food it was sooooo cold in there I couldn't order my salad instead i opted for a breakfast dish
my food was not good- i ordered the breakfast enchilada
The pizza is so delicious very unlike the chain pizza restaurants in the area
And third the food was OKAY but not amazing or awesome in any way
Unlike others I don't take off a star for service unless it affects the quality of my food
Food-wise I've now had the Southwest Breakfast Burrito which was excellent filled with eggs veggies meat of-your-choosing and home-made and perfectly seasoned potatoes
I will note that the food took a little longer than expected will eat here if I have 20+ minutes to spare but was worth the extra wait
Another good thing  they don't add any MSG to the dishes
They have a good Mexican portion of the menu burgers salads steak chicken past wings and my fave the Spinatch and artichoke dip
But again the BBQ meat is about as good as it gets
everything from the Mesquite Grilled Artichokes to the Roasted Chicken to the Filet Mignon Cobb Salad and my favorite the Maytag Burger more about that in a minute is well prepared and delicious* The service has always been first rate and I have to say that I expected that when the server is aware that I am friends with Bobby but there are ton of people there that don't know me from Tyler Florence and we still get great service
The lamb could have been better quality but over all the food was good
Their salad dressing is amazing and the meat is great
The pinch of salt brings out the flavorThere's so many snacks and frozen foods I just love from there
+I used to think TJ was like whole foods fancy and overpriced but when you stop and look at the prices and quality a lot of the snacks and frozen foods and some of the vegetables are reasonably price and worth it
Very frustrating when all you want is to treat your out of town guests to some really amazing pizza
Now I've had several actually discussions with the bf on what constitutes good pizza it's VERY subjective but still there are universal goods and bads
I had a chicken pita and tried my friends gyro and thought they were both very good
Had the scotch beef which was extremely tender and flavorful but next time I'll ask for more gravy
The mini apple dessert which he used on Iron Chef weren't as amazing as hoped
I'll say that the food is good but the service on my last trip was pretty lacking
The food was cold service was slow and it was not worth the money
I love their Housemade Mozzarella Local Tomato & Basil  food was fresh and the bread was excellent
while they cleverly name their sushi they don't deliver the quality and prices were slightly higher than usual
Margaritas taste like antifreeze unless you order the super premiums which won't leave any money left for ordering food and that may be a good choice
i love this place for good food and cheap prices
it's not a classy place but you'll get good food and cheap drinks
They have a good selection of pizzas flatbreads wines on their HH menu
The flavors in the salad were awesome; the goat cheese was mild and not over-powering the spinach was very fresh and not wilty at all steak was well cut and cooked with no fatty bits or gristle and the dressing worked together to balance the sweetness of the strawberries with the tang of the cheese and the mild spice of the beef
Orange chicken was ok the chow fun was incredibly salty and the beef lacked any flavor at all
They're all absolutely satisfactory but if you are looking to be blown away by flavorful and inventive dishes go somewhere else cuz it aint gonna happen here
Out of all the dishes that I tasted the tortilla soup was by far the winner of the appetizers the 3 bites that I could get down of my Shrimp Fajitas were actually pretty tasty and everyone was pleased with their desserts minus a few moldy raspberries that were thrown on my friend's Tres Leches cake
It tasted pretty good no complaints there but the meat was pretty tough even for this price range
If you are seeking simple bar food I would recommend Jacksons on Third and Cooperstown over this place
Based on the tasty food and the almost anachronistically low prices this place should be rockin' every Friday night
Empanaditas with shredded beef Good but was hoping for a little more flavor
I always and looking for a good place to have pizza
I have to say it was the most delicious tasting pizza I have had in a long time
but if you want  a high quality mouth watering pizza try Grimaldi's
At the end of the day the food is still  just as wonderful as it always has been but the portions were weak and I figured two stars was a bit extreme
I don't mind spending  over $100 on a meal for two people and hardly getting any food if  1 every bite is savory and delicious or 2 if it's a really cool place
Was over cooked and should have been served sashimi style and the roll was not as good as what I can score at Wegman's
It is a slender fish that yields small tasty filets
Pretty good Thai food Pad thai is yummy imo however the curry was kinda watery
Other dishes are good and they are reasonably priced
We walked in to place our lunch orders and I was a little surprised by the cost of the food but it looked really good
good portion size and chicken was great and I am very picky about my chicken
The server said it was a traditional dish from the Puebla area and it was excellent and finger licking good
Bottom line creative food a good attempt at bistro dining tarnished only a little by a self-impressed server and prices a bit on the high side
I give it 3 stars b/c it's just good fresh food and for the most part cooked well the hashbrowns were a litte more greasy than I prefer
While the food is supposed to be good here we were never able to find out
I wish the lady next to us would have had the chance to experience the joy of eating such a quality piece of beef but she ordered it as a butterflied medium well
This was the first conveyor belt sushi place that I've been to in the US but I knew that just like all sushi in the US it wouldn't be as good as what I'd had in Japan
This is a good place to introduce people to sushi and it's cheap and fast once you have a table but if you've been to Japan and had the real thing this Americanized version just won't cut it
From the Chicken Parmesean to the Layered Lasagna down to the garlic cheese bread and apple salads I was impressed with the flavor and presentation of it all
Half off their wine sangria red & white and their house pizzas which I might add are large and tasty
The Chicken Adobo was definitely my favorite but the other two were very very good
Every item was totally bursting with flavor and I was in a food coma before I even finished eating
I ordered the 'bangers and mash' while my wife had the salmon both were very very good and for dessert we had the chocolate baked bread {that might not be the exact name but its close} good god it was soo damn good
Below is my first review of this restaurant in which I raved about how good the Pizza was but after our second dining experience I have to give them 2 stars
Tonight the pizza crust was soggy and the flavors were only ok
What a shame as we were so excited to have found good pizza but if you cant be consistent you cant have my business
All of these items where bursting with flavor and for the first time since New York we could actually smell the garlic on the pizza
This pizza packs a flavor punch and I was out the door for under $25
The Pizza has been excellent and full of flavor
The service was excellent and the food came in no time
The Good The pizza here is EXTREMELY affordable
Couple the killer lunch special $4 for two massive slices of cheese pizza and a can of soda with a Groupon $20 for $10 and you create what scientists refer to as a value vortex - a deal so good it should not be able to exist stably in reality much like antimatter
In this case I went with four friends ordered five specials paid with the Groupon and we ended up stuffing ourselves with hot pizza and cold soda for a combined $10
The Meh The pizza just wasn't that flavorful
The food is good for what is worth -- Mexican bar food
Fish was my favorite and grilled not fried which is always good
This experience was a different one and I took my boyfriend here for the meat to compensate for all the vegetarian meals he shares with me but overall I would say the food was great but not the most amazing thing I've have ever experienced
It's not the greatest Chinese food in the world but it's better than the over flavored calorie bombs at Panda Express which btw my friends is NOT real Chinese food so stop using it for comparison
The food was good I had the pork chili verde and he had the burger with bacon and fried onions
I ordered the large Beer-B-Que pizza pie which was deliciousness in a pan and a ton of pizza I've never had anything like it
In regards to lunch you have Subway which I am sick of dirty water pizza at Cafe Roma hooters greasy tasting Starbucks great service Unos dark interior mediocre pizza 1130 Sams Cafe Big Fat Greek Restaurant Coldstone NY & Co AMC theatre and a barrage of touristy places as well
The place is cool the food is good and the girls are pretty but my only draw back is there is only one poorly lit pool table
Don't expect good service or a clean bathroom because neither are there but what you CAN expect is to fall in love with the food every time you go
I can forgive this because the food is so good
The waitress brought us a free dessert for the appetizer mix up so we were very happy that they took care of us
We also ordered the veggie pizza which I was lucky to get a slice of since the table devoured with good reason before I had my chance to attack
I'm not trying to be a traitor to a timeless institution or asking that it change its essential character - I just think that a few little tweaks here and there would keep the local population loyal and keep folks like me who want really good food part-way there in an amazing environment with friendly service check coming back
After several years of debating if a 4hr wait on pizza was worthy of my time-I finally pulled the trigger and set off to taste the holy grail of pizza
I've never seen a pizza deck with onion filled with so much flavor
I just wasn't impressed with the sushi and the rolls at all
Our food was pretty good but then again it's just your standard bar food kind of hard to mess up
It is a little pricey but for the amount of food they serve and all the leftovers I think it's worth it
I've been to other Maggiano's in Chicago and to me they're all pretty much the same - good and plentiful food and fast friendly service
I know we took the kids there for the pizza but not even that was good
Now I don't have terribly high expectations of Chinese food outside of New York but we were pleasantly surprised by both the price and flavor of our meal
the Lunch combos come with fried rice a cream cheese wonton and a spring roll--all steaming hot and very flavorful
Their chicken is never frozen which goes a LONG way when it comes to quality frying
I have enjoyed every meal I have eaten at True Food and I did not feel any bloated guilt when I left
The pizza that I had was soggy and had no flavor
It's a wonderful combination of great food ambiance and service
I have not come across Thai dishes that are as good as they are at SaBai
I feel it whenever I arrive by the awesome service extended to me by the staff and the deliciousness of the food
I was not expecting this quality of food or artisan style pizza from this little unassuming restaurant
Actually I enjoyed my meals here more than Pizza Bianco
The bread is dense unique and delicious it is actually the left over pizza dough that they bake right there in the wood oven in loafs
Wonderful foodI was eager to try Barrio Cafe as I recently hit Barrio Queen in Scottsdale with a friend
The food was wonderful we had the guacamole with everything which was interesting because they added pomegranate seeds
We also ordered a chopped chicken salad - I have no idea what the name was but it had a great flavor - and the addition of grapes and celery just made you want to take your clothes off and run through the sprinklers
Really every time I've been there is a long wait - and your food is worth it but isn't there a way for you to speed things up
Bottom line - if you are not in a hurry and you want some good food - go to Dafalco's
That honor would go to Wildfish twice the price and worth every penny
Dizzyingly spicey for medium I think they toyed with me  but absolute curry-citrus-coconut milky perfection with a good amount of white meat chicken
If a place is gonna charge $20 or more for an entree the staff better be trained on the dishes and be ready to give some recommendations
There are a lot of folks on Yelp that love you but I have to say that for food you have not impressed me
The fish tacos were fishy and their wasn't much flavor going for them or the rice
The food was very good and the view is spectacular
This location was worth a squawk because my Baja Grilled Chicken Burrito was fresh made and always is every time I visit
I'm not a carmelized onion fan but they were on the BBQ chicken side and I actually enjoyed them
Its just right there in the middle good pizza
-was told their fried chicken is amazing but haven't tried you might want to check it outCons-possibly long wait on weekends and during prime dinner timeVerdict-Go go go
Only one fault once the hostesses were too busy with their personal conversation to say good bye--no biggie since I go for the food which you can't get anywhere else
Price is good considering the extra expense they incur for procuring higher quality ingredients and the extra cost of food prep requiring more labor
Although the menu is a little pricey it's definitely worth it because you order from the alacarte menu and you get the salad/seafood/appetizer/dessert buffet for free
There was also a caprese salad mozzarella and tomato prosciutto salami and other cold meats
Excellent food fast service excellent customer service great prices
I can't give Yasu all five stars because some of the hot dishes we tried were not as flavorful as we had hoped based on the reviews and the prices
but we found the sushi and other fish dishes to be really fresh and flavorful the service to be attentive and the overall vibe to be trendy but laid-back
However these two dishes aside we loved Yasu for the fresh sushi which is probably harder to find that good Asian-inspired steak the amazing octopus and eggplant and the good service
Pholicious does a great job with their food-went their for lunch over the weekend and tried their oxtail pho which was very good
My buddy had chicken & vegetable chow fun which was also delicious
They offered tons of samples and suggestions for mixing flavors to resemble candy bars desserts fruity drinks etc
The food was good here the pancakes were fluffy and delicious
Nice mix of hot and cold choices on the menu and tempting desserts mocking you from their glass confines
I am updating because I have gone since and had their pizza which was amazing and certanly deserves five stars
We all loved the chicken very tasty and quite crispy
I always leave wanting more flavor from the food and to eat something a little more authentically Middle Eastern I guess
adorable and comfy designer dog beds great quality collars leashes food bowls toys balls wet food dry food packaged treats bones and all-natural pet biscuits made fresh in the store daily
After round 1 of picking up a toy and some treats I asked Steve the owner who was working at the time for some advice on which wet food he recommends I use to make Minnie's dry food more appealing
go to the hostess and she tells me it will be 25 min we said ok the food is good right and we are already here
1155 food arrives by some other guy who only delivers food; husband's plate looks good kid's food yummy mine is set
but the food was so good you kinda overlooked that this time the service suck and food suck and once I find a hair in my meal one that you cannot miss it shows you don't care about quality
And the veal meatballs rival Lisa g's meatballs not in size but certainly in taste and flavor
One thing that is consistent is the quality of the food it's pretty decent for regular bar food
I've put off trying this Italian chain for quite a while because I am super spoiled rotten - my hubby makes amazing authentic Italian food at home so my discerning palate is usually disappointed when trying to have it somewhere else
;- Room service was prompt and the food was pretty darn good
The food is always pretty good and the service is always friendly but frantic seems like they are always short staffed
I have also had their Pad Thai Thai Basil and Drunken noodles dishes which are all pretty good
Definitely not fancy but the food is good
Good food and good service place has a lot of potential
Pretty good selection with your typical bar foods burgers wings
I love finding amazing food in the pockets of the Valley where you wouldn't expect it to be there
If you are a seafood fan the cioppino and seafood salad loaded with shrimp and calmari are both excellent choices
The food was ready just a few minutes after I got there and they must have packaged it *really* well or made it super hot because it was still hot when I got home 30 minutes later
This is our favorite place in town and the food was wonderful as always but soup came room-temperature
However while the space suffers and so does the ambiance a lot of the same food offerings are there and the same friendly Boba Barista is there to make my delicious Green Tea Soy Taro w/traditional Boba-YUM
Among our group we ordered 4 different dishes and all were excellent
I had the beef tacos lunch plate and they were good nothing mind blowing but good
Good beer & drink selection and good food selection
Santisi is a great neighborhood sports bar who happens to also make some damn good food
They were very tasty and reminded me of the Armenian food I had tried once in California
If you are looking for fine dining this is not it but if you are looking for someplace different with good food this IS it
the decency of the food is WAY overtaken by the quality of the service and the sudden price fluctuations dictated by the ownership
They are exactly what one would expect that they are - nachos blanketed with cheese and the regular nacho supreme goodness topped off with a generous helping of diced chicken tenders and buffalo sauce
I had the grilled chicken sandwhich and that was so good
They have a great staff serving tasty burgers and awesome pizzas made to order
TI've had the chicken tenders and fries which is good
They still use good pitas but the kefta was not how it used to be they don't even offer lamb kefta anymore just ground beef
The food is good but I have to say it's the overall experience that earns the five stars
The food was so good I'll probably give it another try but I hope the big bald guy will be having a better day
If you haven't been here in a while check out the new meatball entru00e9e Moroccan spice tomato sauce hen egg and olive oil toast and if you thought the chili was good this will rock your world
We often eat at the nice cafe upstairs where she can explore her love for Swedish meatballs while I may try their dill salmon with red potatoes seafood salad or one of their other amazing meals
I said no we were good but when I went back to the table they had forgotten the ranch for my daughter's chicken strips
Food was good but I'm giving it four stars since it was such a bargain to eat there
Everything was very tasty but I would say the sweet and sour chicken was the weakest dish as the sauce was warm and made the breaded fried chicken a bit mushy
That said it's pretty good for Asian food in the greater Phoenix area
On weekends you'll get some live music calm accoustic music from nothing but reguar joe's outside on a picnic table entertaining the old fashion way with guitars and other instruments to soothe you into the delicious food that awaits
Keep up the good food and the tradition that flows in your menu
The sushi is pretty good very fresh and I've tried a few of the Korean dishes which were also pretty good
Our food took quite awhile to come out but it was hot and servers were very pleasant and nice to our kids
Food there is on the high side but it's worth it
My vegetarian dish essentially a tofu rice bowl was good but also very greasy
Only having had their coffee pastries and wine I can't comment on the food but it looks delicious
Great food and good service the owner seems to stop by every table to make sure everything's good
spring rolls were good as well but there was just 2
Doesnt even look or make eye contact with me but a lady rolls up there and hes helping her and making sure shes ok while Ive been standing there for a good 5 minutes
The pizza is simply amazing and it gets 5 stars
The chicken is dark meat cheaper but more moist and a perfect fit for Asian flavors
I'll post some photos of the food when I get a chance
For this kind of money I will stand in line at Matt's and know that eventually I'll get food worth having
The spring rolls were crisp hot and well kinda bland
We were served soup they had miso i had chicken; somewhat bland and salty and I had a small salad nothing special but the sauce was tasty
The chicken was tasty although slightly overcooked
The volcano roll was greasy and badly overcooked; the rattlesnake was flavorless and squishy not to mention cold
Sake is damn strong and tastes fantastic with the wonderful food we had
So for dinner and a show the place is worth it even if the dishes are a little higher than most Greek places
AMAZING food full gift shops Starbucks Spa
The first the food was absolutely amazing
In all honesty the service was great but I was not impressed by the food
They aren't gigantic like some other places they are a manageble size and quite tasty with seasoned potatoes cheese and eggs along with the meat
Everything was good but not great and while the food won't bring me back the service just might
Food comes in somewhat small portions so I wouldn't recommend coming here with more than 4 people if you plan on stuffing yourself
Nice atmosphere friendly staff delicious food
The Gyro is also good several of my coworkers order it consistently and my mother loves the Chicken Shawarma
Pizza is okay not great and service has been good so far
In fact almost worth going to Dominos for the BFD pizza
The staff were great the food and atmosphere were good but I think I was expecting a more tapino-esque menu
On my previous review I stated how the pizza tasted great until it sat overnight in the fridge thus gaining a salty flavor
A friend had the Tuscan pizza which was pretty amazing
I thought that apple slices on a pizza would be odd but the texture did not offend especially since the flavor did so well with the proscuitto fig marmalade and gorgonzola
The service and the food are just fantastic at Cave and Ives and I would highly recommend giving them a try
Though the design is interesting the atmosphere is good it won't blow you away and you should avoid sitting nearer to the casino as the occasional smoking gambler passes by and crop dusts your food with their cancer stick
OK now that the disclaimer is done the food is really really good and surprisingly affordable for the quality and quantity that you get
The other dishes and soups are equally tasty
anywhere in the valley is usually an expensive proposition but here $15-$17 gets you generous portions of very good food and $25 gets you more shellfish than two people can finish
The shrimp and crab are the stars of the show and the clams and oysters are fresh and tasty but mussels do not have the same distinctive flavor as the other shellfish; they are a bit bland
Stingray's happy hour menu is smaller than most but there are great deals on entrees and classic rolls like spicy tuna the Vegas roll dragon roll shrimp tempura roll and the crispy spicy tuna my favorite--it's not so much a roll but it's delicious  panko-crusted rice topped with tuna and a jalepeno slice
It was so creamy and delicious that we stopped in the following night for dessert again
We had a choice of egg drop or hot and spicy soups an egg roll and many choices of beef seafood chicken pork dishes yet not many vegetarian dishes if any
Definitely give this place a try if you're in the mood for delicious authentic Middle Eastern food
The chicken and hummus on the starter menu is sooo good
Some of the food I found to be off which could be a bit too salty a bit too bland a bit oddly tasting or a bit cold for my liking
I really enjoy it here I almost always have terrific service the food is consistently good I love the overall atmosphere of the place and sitting at the pasta bar to watch them cook everyones food is mighty fun it's just that the prices have gotten out of control
While the food was appetizing and provided decent flavor it was lacking in something special--something that really popped when you took a bite
I love this tasty dish with the cut up fresh fruit and lychee
It is a good thing it is dark inside since I like to go when I have to eat by myself and craving something fresh not fast food
from the yummy fresh warm bread to the salad with the awesome shaved tomato pieces to my HOMEMADE chicken alfredo which was most definitely the best Ive ever had in my life and the raspberry cheesecake everything was just absolutely amazingthe service was great and the wine selection was HUGE
If you cannot drink AZ tap water you cannot expect to make delicious food with it
I've been to all locations and San Tan is probably the best in terms of service and food quality
My friend got a basic sushi roll California and said it was good too
waiting sixty nine minutes for lunch I am not sure of what kind of quality the roast beef should have been but on this past Saturday it wasn't like real roast beef it was like that lunch meat that comes in a tub but thicker
I tasted the roast beef and agreed it wasn't what we were expecting it to be since we read the chicken and turkey are roasted in house we thought the roast beef would also be good
As for the pizza itself the Margherita pizza I had certainly was good
At the end of the day the pizza while good was just too pricey
I lucked in during happy hours so saved a bunch of mullah while enjoying the tasty draft and excellent bar foodReasons to go back1  Smoked Salmon Rosti --- a tasty potato pancake topped with more smoked salmon than I could shake a stick at
50 for 17 oz of tasty draft3  Darn good Bratwurt and the crunchiest most well seasoned fries that I've come across in a long long timeAnd it was a friendly crowd to bootMy only disappointment was the absence of my favorite german dish from the menu
The food was really good some of the best thai food I've had in phoenix
not the best soup ever so that knocked off a star but other than that I thought the food was very good
The prices were a little bit higher than at other Thai food places in the area but I am willing to pay a bit more for better quality
bubbled and complete with a perfectly juuuuuust charred crust  This is the kind of mad genius that is essentially non-negotiable because it's so eye-rollingly delicious
I got the chicken tikka masala pasty and it was delicious but a little too spicy for my taste buds
At certain times you can grab some really good fish other times not so much
I admit that the food was pretty good but the owner ruined the entire experience for me
The meat actually tastes like it has been smoked for several hours and is good enough to eat on its own without any sauce
Last time I was here I had the bbq pizza with mock chicken and it was amazing because I have been crazing pizza like crazy
In summary  the food was pretty good the pace of the food and service was rushed and random company was excellent and the atmosphere was warm//cold//warm//cold//warm//cold
I was a little leary going in because a the buddy is pretty hit or miss on his food recommendations mostly on the miss side to be honest and b at 830am on Saturday morning there were 3 cars in the parking lot
Besides people watching though the drinks are good average priced for the area and the food I've tried is actually good
we looked at the menu for appetizers and i was gonna pass on the food looked a little over priced
The meat shop in the back offers some good selections for you
The quality of the fish isn't all that great
Their fish is fresh and delicious but more expensive
The service is great the food is delicious and when I order to go it is fast and the order is always correct
Nothing great they were super short handed we got a free waffle because it took so long the chicken fried steak and eggs were grissly but the gravy was good
My husband is notoriously picky about his food but he rather enjoyed the molasses fried lollipops he got
The service is really good the food's even better and I have yet to find somewhere in Texas that comes close to having that brownie
The stew is such my comfort food thick and juicy with potatoes carrots tons of hot green chile & roasted pork then covered in Colby jack and served with a tortilla
I also had the shredded beef tostada and it was amazing too
I think this place is a ripoff but their food is good
but the menu is HUGE no WAY they don't have SOMETHING that strikes your fancy on that thing and the food is all pretty good
I liked the flavor of the green chili but as with most places there is always too much tortilla and not enough meat or insdies
About the food it was very good no complaints
I like this place because they always have some cool and unusual beers on tap as well as local favorites from San Tan and Four Peaks but the food is pretty good too
So after trying Thai Elephant about a year ago I really enjoyed my food
Their Pad-Z-U was really good I love this dish and usually ordered it
I was really surprised normally each dish has such great flavor and tasted different
I am not sure if it was just an unlucky day or if the quality of food has gone down
This was during the summer however and I will say that based on the 6 years of living here in Tempe many of the restaurants that stay open during the summer start to falter with the quality and freshness of their food
For appetizers I had the Plantain Avocado Spring Rolls $8 and the Pimento Wood Smoked Mussels
Overall the most food was really good and unique the prices are just a little too high for the portion size
My dish was really good my only complaint is that there was hella black beans and a small amount of rice
My wife ordered the fish and chips which was good
Over time we have tried almost everything on the menu and found every dish to be unique and creative with the greatest most complex but enjoyable flavors imaginable
The meatballs were delicious and the portion size more than adequate for two servings
Everything at Sakana is just a variety of a the California roll and they are super generous not in a good way with the imitation crab
But regardless the food was really amazing
Decent wine selection tasty desserts and a fun atmosphere
The Pro's--Happy Hour is awesome--The Mozzarella Encorozza is delicious though it is basically mozzarella sticks--The rustica pizzas are delicious - went with the garlic + eggplant and bella rosa both good--They have gelato and mini cones that are just $1The Con's--The pizzas are odd shaped
I liked FEZ - it wasn't AMAZING but the food was great service good and atmosphere trendy
for the latest yelp event we were absolutely thrilled at the delicious food they offered
i would come back for their regular menu based on how good their food was for the event
Each dish was only $10 bucks a bargain considering the quality of food that you get
The food is above average - as are the prices - though I don't know if the prices reflect the quality of the food
Much cheaper than Whole Foods or AJ Fine Foods Sprouts was the comfortable medium between fancy premium goods and the average supermarket
They are a little high priced on the pizza's but definitely worth going
I really never get any of the Mexican dishes not sure why but I've scavenged stuff off my friend's plates and of course it tastes just as good
In addition to regular hotdogs they've got footlongs jumbo all-beef white hots veal & pork bratwurst polish sausage italian sausage and burgers
for NYE the service was a bit slow but the food was delicious
the wife had the ginger fish and it was tasty as well
The food is always tasty - I'm a fan of the sandwich with prosciutto and hearts of palm and their pizzas which are large enough to share
What I religiously ordered was the J's Salad with Honey Mustard & the main entree the amazing Lime Chicken
So I opted for the Rotisserie Chicken with their amazing smashed potatoes
I can't really knock the service too badly as they don't seem any better or worse than any other chain on a busy night but the food is just not very good
Double Headers features traditional ballpark food like hot dogs popcorn and nachos
Big Dawgs emphasizes big food items such as a variety of foot-long hot dogs to a very large $16 soft pretzel that comes with multiple dipping sauces
It's a bit small and it took about 20 min to get my food they were really busy but it was worth it
they are good but seem as though they might use canned fish instead of fresh grilled chunks like most places
assuming your mother was a good cook The breakfast offerings are hearty and full of flavor the lunch offerings run the gamut from light snack to full blown food coma material
It is a nice neighborhood sports bar with good bar food at a great price
This is just a relaxing bar with good food and a friendly staff
The house special garlic beef was amazing as was the Sirloin house special
The food was very fresh and tasty the service was okay coffee strong and really quite nice
The food came out cold no surprise there lol and here is the best part
Cuz any place named Sprouts that is known for it's healthy food and can still satisfy the likes of me is pretty good in my book
The food here is good the drink menu is extensive which is always a must for me and the scene was pretty good
I just moved from San Francisco where the Thai food is cheap and amazing very authentic and spicy
I prefer to pay a little less and have a good amount of food
The shrimp are battered to perfection and served with amazing hot sauce and the standard fish is also deep fried to death perfect if you're in a greasy-food mood
The mizithra cheese however is so good the chicken marsala amazing and flavorful and the tuscan chicken sandwich only available at lunch time very craveable
The regulars will help you learn darts the food is griddle-fare and the guys behind the bar are always good for a chat or to grab you a pint
This time the fries weren't as crisp but the meat and everything else was still good
So anyway - in spite of this place having great wine selections at reasonable prices considering the cost of the food great pretzel bread the illusion of great service and good food when they allow you to order it I won't be going back
but the food is worth it and the atmosphere is beautiful
Names like these don't inspire a lot of confidence in the quality of their food even though that's not always the case for example China Food was actually pretty good
Still wary I ordered the hot tea Thai sweet potatoes and chicken Pad Thai
All in all it's a pleasant place that belies its' strip mall exterior and is worth a visit for respectable Thai food
The food was solid but not amazing- we sampled the the burgers yum and the buttermilk fried chicken caesar- pretty tasty
Dynamite roll is good as is the lollipop roll
Simple rolls are also good as we are partial to the spicy tuna or yellow tail
Overall the food was tasty selection good and prices reasonable
The meat they use for the original wieners are good quality
I've tried a few other food trucks and Short Leash is by far the best both in quality and value
The beef was pretty good but overall I was unimpressed--the arepas were unreasonably greasy and the cheese was chewy to the point of being almost inedible
Anyway the food was as good as I had remembered it from the year before and the bean dip was exceptionally good
I had a wonderful Pollo Ranchero dish that filled me to bursting
the salmon quesadillas was on the fishy side the pollo relleno good but a little dry and didnt get the poblano and goat cheese flavors that drew me to choosing the dish the cilantro mousse sounded more interesting on the menu but was cream cheese and cilantro the Obama burrito was the winner on our table though
We have been to this place at least once a month for the last 6 - 9 months and the service and food quality have remained excellent
The atmosphere was wonderful as was the food
As I said before the food is good but it isn't the main reason I go there
Just watch out their dishes come out really hot
They have the most delicious pizza and calzones for a good price slices and small calzones for lunch and salads that are just amazing
I really do applaude the folks behind this little chain and hope that they will never sacrifice the high quality of their food
My wife and I had their delicious chips and salsa then split the mexican pizza
With fresh crisp veggies that accented the beef perfectly it was everything a good burger should be
If you're looking for a vibrant atmosphere with delicious and healthy fare do yourself a favor and try True Food Kitchen
The food is good but the service is impeccable
So service was wonderful but the food was meh
the food was good but i am not a huge fan of the overall experience
The food is always fresh locally sourced as much as possible and absolutely delicious
Chef Eugenia your food is amazing and addictive
good food ginormous drinks warm atmosphere and awesome service
If you are looking for good Mexican food with great service this is the place to go
So overall their food is really good and I'm so glad they opened near me
The food itself is fresh the salad is always crisp & tasty VERY well cooked and the service excellent
We have tried a wide selection of dishes between us and everyone has been pleasantly surprised with the quality of the dishes presented
This place is good enough to add to the list of pizza places worth a return visit
We had some good food but the overall Old Town experience was lacking even at the best of the galleries and sh*t shops
Have some simple amazing food sit down and relax in the park-like setting walk around the farm a bit then top it off with a perfect coffee from The Coffee Shop at the end of the property
The mushroom/potato dish is the second best out of what we had and then we had the squid ink risotto which is so black it stains your teeth-- and is absolutely amazing
The seafood stew was good but the broth was  the best part of it because the veggies were so raw that it made them a bit difficult to eat
I love a good burger but usually hate fast food burgers
I had gone to The Elephant Bar a few times when I worked at the mall and I always enjoyed the atmosphere and food
I love sitting in the booths that look like train cars - it is just a fun place to hang out and have good food and good service
The food is pretty good not overly proportioned but just satisfying in appetite
The time it took for me to get my food was  long the time it took to get a refill was extra long and the time it took for them to bring out the check let alone getting back your credit card makes it not even worth it
Like I said the quality was good and tasty the proportion of bread to meat was just a little smaller than expected
Good food too the sweet & salty teriyaki was nicely complimented by a char-grill smokiness
And you know when there's a good mix of customers they are there because the food is good not because of 'the scene'
First let me state that the only reason I am deducting a star is because I didn't like the entree that I ordered but due to the fact that the quality of the food was great I would return to try a different entree on the menu
The drinks are delicious and the food is well prepared
It is not Tex-Mex more Southwestern/Mexican but the really important fact is the food is delicious and full of flavor
The service is usually outstanding and the food is wonderful
I ordered fish and picked it prepared jerk style it was sooo good i have never had jerk style sauce but highly recommend it
My b/f got the jerk chicken it was so tender and moist and all the flavors blended well together amazing i may have to get that next time
My boss is a Southern gal who knows that good food = good teamwork
We love their enchiladas and there is a fish dish whose name escapes me right now that is amazing
I've been to several different Someburros and they all consistently have good food service and atmosphere
The burger was well made and delicious on the onion roll
Have heard a ton about Matts and I do have to say that they have quality food Went there and had waffles with bacon and a side order of potatoes
They do make basic food very well and that is a good but it is basic food
Again though they do basic food very well which is harder said then done and that is why I would recommend it I would not go out of my way though just because of the location and the size of the place but I only judge by food
If you can get in the food is very good even great
The meat was chewy and on the cold side
The food was decent but I don't think that my fish sandwich was all that amazing
Aside from the stodgy food Turf has a good character great happy hour and a fun inviting pub
The salad was really good and the pizza tasty though it was slightly soggy in the middle pieces
The rolls are on the more expensive side but it is quality
I had the 69 roll and it was spicy and all good
This is def a good place to go for some quality sushi
The best part aside from the really delicious food was Pia our server
5 - We were really looking forward to eating kobe beef burgers since we had a good experience with another restaurant at the resort Il Terrazzo
That one was a fairly standard burger so the flavor of the beef seemed to be more of the centerpiece
My 3 year old ordered chicken strips & fries it came out to 3 good size strips and about 8 fries scattered across the plate
Their Southwest Chicken Caesar salad is surprisingly delicious
The Creamy Chicken & Wild Rice soup is quite tasty as well
The Food is good say all you want about the details in the restrooms and the side rooms but the food is very good
My only minor complaint is that sometimes the chicken and beef dishes have a fishy flavor to them
I don't know if they use the same oil for all meats but takes away from a particular dish's flavor
Upon being seated we were given complimentary samples of both the Thai Toast and Fish Cakes both were very tasty
Overall great food great service highly recommended
The dishes were all tasty and very obviously made fresh by cooks who care
While their food was decent it was overpriced and I never got over just how cold and unwelcoming they were to not just me but everybody
Fez makes a pizza-like item on the menu with pesto and fresh mozzarella which is quite tasty
Gluten free pizza with squash was amazing
Boyfriend enjoyed his sandwich -- my pizza was pretty good
Food was okay definitely not coming back and not recommending this to anyone
As we sat down and looked over the delicious-sounding menu I remarked that if the food was as good as the atmosphere this may become my new favorite place
I love Chinese food and this place was good
The food was good and the portions were just right for lunch was hooked until
at this point I could have left but loving their food as much as I do I just moved to another table and finished my delicious food
I admit I have not been back there since but the food is good
However I am a sushiholic and while I do love a great place to enjoy my food I value the quality of the food a bit more
The food was pretty good - the oysters Rockefeller were outstanding and were clearly the best part of the dinner
The coffee is amazing and the food is just as fantastic
Lunch has delicious salads although I typically split a pizza with someone
However when food is not good for you it better taste good
The vegas roll was good but the rainbow roll was flavorless
we should have left right then but I had heard such good things about this place I really wanted to try the fish
Not only is the sushi good but the other things such as tempura are also amazing
We didn't try too much food as we had a big brunch but the food I did try was good and I liked the small plate set up
Don't get me wrong it was good and for $10 less I would have been extremely happy but the presentation was very basic and the way they offered the spices just a small dipping dish kind of let me down
The waiter had recommended the Hamachi Serrano Chili roll which was very good too
Filled with veal and pork two essentials in making a good meatball it was perfectly crisp on the outside and had a small scoop of tomato sauce on top
I can also recommend the papaya cream for dessert
I am a creature of habit with Mexican food its either chimichangas or burritos which are always wonderful
I have to echo so many other reviewers when I say the food was good but the service is a nightmare
Not the decorations not the menu not the friendly staff not the quality of the food
Please someone give her a clue regarding  customer service and food quality
Their oven baked pizzas are really good too
Their delicious pizzas and wings are only served at dinner
The General Tso's chicken was pretty spicy and a good flavor but a little bland
The Egg Rolls had good flavor but were a little soggy on the inside
Good thing they only gave us one roll apiece or we'd have filled up on those
Bottom line- super good food but I can't afford it all the time
Good to know since getting food anywhere else downtown on a First Friday is next to impossible
The boys have eaten the hot dog meatball sandwich and chicken sandwich and always happy
Their breakfast is good old fashion diner food and they do it well
So no thanks Gelato I will be getting my cold dessert fix elsewhere from now on
I had had some delicious smoked cod and candy salmon on Easter Sunday with relatives in Pasadena and learned the fish came from the Pasadena Whole Foods
Luckily the food came out hot and was good
Also the table next to us just got their food as we were leaving And had to send it back cause it was cold they had the MIA clueless waiter
Brio is a bit pricier than say Olive Garden the appetizer itself was $15 but relatively reasonable considering the food quality service and restaurant ambiance
The serving sizes are hearty and food was good
Even though Brio has the cookie cutter chain restaurant feel the service and food was good and enjoyable will definitely go back
The chicken breast was small and looked like a shaped pattie sort of thing instead of a real honest to goodness chicken breast
I ordered the portofina linguini and was impressed with the quality and amount of seafood in the dish
Pizzeria Bianco was recommended by a friend that owns a wood fired pizza oven so we definitely were expecting the best
We got the Fennel Sausage pizza and honestly it wasn't that good unfortunately
finding good seafood in az is always a chalenge so i thought that f&e might be worth a try again but i was saddley mistaken on the shelf sat a few lonley packs of sea scallops and some  shrimp alot of hamburger and a few highly overpriced packs of lamb and a sh&^%t load of chicken
At the same time they are treated with impeccable food great presentation and a wonderful setting all very effortlessly
Naturally we headed straight to the back counter to take a look at their fish quality and selection
Their food has sadly nose-dived into average while their prices have sharply risen like a Vegas hotel room on a holiday weekend
I had the agedashi tofu fried oyster mixed tempura spider roll and eel&cucumber roll which were all very good and very filling
We examined the menu and concurred on the 3 dishes to share based on preferences for separate meat dishes and flavors for that overall balanced palette experience
The dish though flavorful with garlic and spice seemed a bit dried and lacked the sauces that makes it a wonderful messy occassion that it should be
The pepper chicken with broccoli was good
The most awesome attribute about most noteworthy traditional Thai and Lao places was that most dishes are about $10 and normally you have 3 people share 2 large oversize dishes
Our group agreed that the food was good though not memorable; just could have more sauce and quantity compared to the other Thai places nearby
The food was tasty though I may be hungry still but that is better than going to an Americanized Thai restaurant where I wouldn't have eaten much
Bringing me small tastes of delicious food I didn't even ask for is the perfect way to win me over
It was a good burger although if you order it more cooked than medium I could see the meat becoming very dry
I was impressed with the place - both the food and the decor was excellent
Needless to say I was unimpressed with the food
Both dishes were very tasty but the Greek fries were amazing
Very good in that whole comfort food kind of way
The food is very good the sushi bar has many selections more then other buffet with sushi bar offered
Our egg rolls were good but we only got 3 and most places usually serve 6
Good food but I think it's run by a high Shool student
The hot wings are also a good choice -- lots of meat and tasty Harp-soaked sauce
The food is not bad and it's worth the low prices on the menu no question
Since they were celebrating their anniversary and pizzas were half price seemed a good time to go
The bartender warned us that the fries were good sized orders and maybe we wanted to split  an order but we were starved and each got an order and its a good thing we did as the pizzas were on the small side
My tikka masala had great flavor and the chicken seemed so real that it maked me nervous that maybe the waiter messed up and gave me a real chicken tikka masala although I know that did not happen
We were all too stuffed for dessert but I got a cappuccino to sip on while my sister finished her wine and it was tasty though more of a latte since the milk was mixed in rather than floating on top
unfortunately no room for desert because our gluttony got the best of us but we saw the desserts other people had and they looked fattening and tasty
OK it's not a place you actually want to dine in at but the food is so f'n good just order and leave
The gyro tasted good but was lacking meat
On the good side- Very well decorated- Clean- Speedy service- Big plates of food ;-On the downside- Food was thrown on the plate- Potatoes were blah a little salt and pepper would have helped- I had the house omelet full of runny cheez I'd swear it was cheez whiz- Dining companion had the avocado omelet - not bad but not great
My girlfriend and I are always on the search for good and truly spicy food and when we saw the living social coupon for Jalapeu00f1o Inferno we were pretty intrigued
One of the managers also recommended a puru00e9ed hatch child sauce which made things much better and had a nice kick but we felt this should have been somehow infused in the dishes
Service seemed to be good around us but I think that our server was just over sat and forgot about us after our food came out
Over all we wouldn't recommend this for spicy food enthusiasts or authentic Mexican food connoisseurs but we think that it'd probably be a good place for families
Good bread for sure but the beef was stringy not at all rare sauce was weak no real vege dressing just a brick of huge huge bread and slabs of stringy beef my dentist will be finding fibers from for years
The food took a bit longer but knew it would be worth the wait
But they do have meat so that's good enough for me
The team ordered the buffalo chicken pizza and really enjoyed it I didn't try any because it had meat but wished I had ordered a veggie pizza after I saw it come out
Every dish I have tried had bad flavor
I have to admit that I have only ordered appetizers and entrees and have never tried a dessert
I will come back again to try the pizza but for the pasta there are other options around for a good meal but for  date this may work well
The roasted red peppers bring out the rich flavors of the Italian meats and provide the perfect acidic balance to the fattier density of the meats and cheese
Not only did they have a good number of dishes you can choose from there was also soup pad thai and sweet potato won tons that you helped yourself to
We especially love the ninja jalapeno appetizer and the Double Double and Cactus rolls
The parking lot was packed which we figured meant the food had to be tasty
With plenty of time to spare we had some delicious rice pudding for dessert
nothing comes even close to their glorious flavors and it's always fun picking and mixing the different salsas with the food
However I was not as impressed with the food
To be fair the appetizers and desserts were MUCH better than the main courses
I mean there was absolutely no seasoning what so ever and it was served with a cold beet salad that made the fish cold almost instantly
The cowboy dish was amazing it is a big bowl of delicious well seasoned slightly spicy chili with two over easy eggs on top and two pieces of toasted and buttery bread
The pizza was pretty good though I found the crust to be a bit on the salty side and the appetizers were excellent
This place came highly recommended on the Food Network so I had to check it out
It was between this and a deli I saw a little bit down the way but pizza always always sounds good so I made my decision
In my mind in a fight between a pizza and a sandwich the pizza would always win because it has the power of molten-hot cheese and pepperoni shields
If I were a teacher and my class assignment was Make me a cheap ass piece of pizza that tastes good I'd give this slice of pizza like a C
Great food good service and awesome wine list gives Cowboy Ciao five stars
Part of that is because they're operated by people who actually care about the quality of food that they sell their customers
So if you're into drinking this may be an amazing stop for you with its huge list of tequila if not you can probably find better food elsewhere with about the same prices
I'd definitely say skip starbucks and the scone or whatever and head to the FM for some fresh good food
The food isn't bad here it's just not that good
I think the garlic cheese knots are pretty good and for the most part the pizza is alright
It's a wonderful opportunity to sample new dishes that may or may not make it to the big leagues the FEZ menu someday
As for the pizza we got the buffalo chicken pizza which really needed more chicken and hot sauce
The chicken was tasty though very sparse and the hot sauce was tangy which is what I expect
The dough was very good though and the pizza tasted decently cold the next morning
The fresh fish in the tanks and live lobster look too good and I hope to be able to sit down and order one but for now since I dine alone I will just stick to my favorites
They're excellent at adjusting the temperature of the food for whatever suits your palate which is great since I'm a weakling but my boyfriend likes things extra super spicy
The vegetable pakora is great as well and I've enjoyed several of their other vegetarian dishes from time to time
This is based on the food not being that flavorful or impressive given the prices they normally charge
The portion was small which we usually don't mind if the dish is high-end and super-flavorful but that wasn't really the case here
Since we weren't blown away by any of the other dishes we had tried it was really nice to end the meal with a delicious rich dessert
But if you want a lot of food at a good price
Looks and tastes like store bought  I have had a variety of foods and they have all been good
While the food overall was good it was not spectacular
And how I was delighted to fill my belly with its meaty cheesy goodness
The pizza slice was on the smallish side but he said it was good
The beef enchilada was filled with huge chunks of beef which were tender but lacking in flavor
The place has good food and friendly service
The food was good plenty of it and they have dandy pastries
I tasted the jerk chicken which was excellent
We didn't have any of their food but the beer selection was nice and the red sangria was AMAZING
I enjoyed the misoyaki butterfish the most
The park could use a bit more maintenance; nevertheless it is a good place to find some quiet and have a leisurely stroll while gaining a better appreciation of the desert and its natural and cultural history
All in all a pleasant evening with good food the ambiance is what really makes the occassion
--The crispy eggplant parm and teriyaki bowl were great and filling we didn't have a problem with the portions here--AMAZING desserts
We had the truffle deviled eggs cheese plate duck confit tacos ahi tuna duck fat grilled cheese and kiltlifter fish and chips- everything was delicious and perfect for sharing
I'm from Chicago and have eaten enough soul food to know good when I have it
The sides are delicious and the desserts look amazing too
the chicken kebobs gyros and lamb dishes were tasty
All of the items on the menu look very good and a part of the proceeds from sales of menu items with chicken breasts go to breast cancer awareness
My pizza crust was good however the chicken had a horrible taste to it
The food is generally good but some items are a hit-or-miss
I highly recommend the Mongolian Beef and a vegan soft-serve cone for dessert
Aside from the fantastic food that literally bursts with fresh flavor THIS PLACE HAS CHINESE DONUTS
The burger was very tasty and not dry People who kavetch about grease HELLO a burger is supposed to be greasy this is not a heath food choice
Very nice venue but the food is only good and the prices are high for breakfast
From their awesome selection of easy to make Asian food amazing looking produce the super bulk foods the great selection of Newman's Own right next to products that were made locally and lunch/dinner options that include their great pre-made section from sandwiches to tabbouleh salad and their smoothie/sandwich/salad bar spot - everything was great
all were A+ dishes and had very intricate flavor combinations
Le Chalet is an amazing place for newcomers to swiss food
The desserts sounded delicious but we were so stuffed we dared not order any
The Cowboy Breakfast Chili & Eggs AZ Power Ranches Beef Local Tepary Beans Melting Cheddar Cheese Two Over Easy Eggs Sour Cream Fresh Cilantro and Griddled Bread was really good
I have had the pizza in the past and it is good but I feel like almost any pizza joint can put out an okay pie
I'll come here again and try more pizzas and of course more of their delicious beer
The food was delicious and the service was amazing
The meat was not that tasty and I wonder if it is that fresh but all in all the place is okay
So good service so-so food but maybe this is as good as it gets in the Chandler area
My friend's fries were good but the french dip's meat was extremely salty and hard to eat
I thought I was tough I thought I could take it- but this is fried red meat covered in fatty cheese encased in delicious carb centric white italian bread
The Baja Chicken Burro a chicken burrito deep fried and then baked then topped with cheese and cream cheese sauce was delicious
It was so juicy and so flavorful I thought I might have a foodgasm
My husband and I very much enjoyed our food this time around
Portions are intentionally a bit smaller and although healthy can still be really flavorful it's not the same as the food you get elsewhere that's smothered in butter or deep fried
I would recommend True Food for vegans/vegetarians people who want to go out to eat but are still looking for a healthy meal or a girls night out
Dessert was their bread pudding which was highly recommended by the waitress and I guess it was good but I just have never been a big fan of that type of dessert
For dessert we had the flan which was a bit rich but still very good
Unfortunately they lack what every good buffet should have - good fresh rolls/biscuits
My friend had the Pot Roast; probably a dish better suited for cooler temps but delicious and satisfying nonetheless
Overall the food was fresh and of high quality
As an aside I highly recommend Soy Curls as a healthy replacement to the meat in your fajitas or cheesesteaks
They will load you up will all sorts of delicious and traditional Thankgsiving day food veganized
Oh the glorious tasty want it in mah' belly-right-now food
They had several different buffets going and many dishes that looked good
I was looking for a quick good home cooked dessert and stumbled upon this place
Amazing prices amazing FRESH sushi and even better service
Usually a menu with over 50 rolls to choose from is not a good sign but from the variety I tried not a single roll was bad
The pesto pizza was good but nothing to write home about
Good food great service easy to dance to
He is spoiled for food and is not easily impressed
We were originally told that the brunch was booked but when we showed up Sunday morning they found us a table and the food was really good
Hard to choose a favorite but Chicken Delight is really good
My pizza had fresh ingredients and the oven flavor was strong but I found myself yearning for a New York style pizza
There is a downfall to that It allows for a slip of service and quality of food
However delicious food is not everything
I guess my food was good but a little too spicy for my mild request
I liked the veggie egg rolls a lot they were really tastyAnd kudos to our server for letting me watch the nhl playoffs instead of the lifetime movie they had on tv
I had the warm chicken salad very fresh & tasty
The lettuce wrap came with 5 stalks of Romaine lettuce and the chicken was mixed with cranberries dried apricot dates almonds- absolutely filled with flavor
We thoroughly enjoyed our drinks and our food and would definitely go back there again
The food was good ambience was lovely service was a tad slow but very earnest he was very busy running around from table to table
grilled asparagus side - very good tender and flavorfulanchovy olive appetizer - good and tastypepper cured meat plate - not bad but doesn't taste like it is house-cured wish it wereThe entrees
I think the pasta could be a little more al dente but the sauce was tasty and the meatballs were very tender
The dish overall lacked flavor - could have used more olive oil red pepper garlic clam flavor
The menu is quite limited although the food was good
The food is and has always been amazing
Sorry for the rant there in other words I recommend getting the food to go
Ok I admit I'm not a huge natural foods person but its hard to deny Whole Foods goodness
I was craving sushi and had a hot date with my sister-in-law last night to do dinner and a movie
-The sushi itself was good; not amazing
The meat is hot and fresh which is not always the case at Greek sandwich places and the vegetables are crispy
With the exception of the toast and jam the food never rose above good
What they did right was have good crisp broththat is not oily a fair amount of rice noodles and superb well cut varieties of meat to go with it
If I look at just the food only for which I'm basing my rating on  then the pho overall was conservatively basic but good in a wholesome sense since it is un-Americanized
Really the head is the most interesting part and I would highly recommend anybody eating shrimp sushi to go ahead and ask for the fried head
My favorite of the three fish was the young yellowtail but all were good and fresh
It was delicious and making sushi out of it is an interesting concept
The quality of the food and of the menu is second to none as far as sushi restaurants are concerned
Their drinks are good and so it their food
All in all the food was good but not worth the price we paid
However I was not impressed with the food maybe it was our choices
I recommend the Bulkogi Plate which is charbroiled beef in Korean barbeque sauce
The Teriyaki Chicken Plate is also very good chicken is all white and tender
The savory chicken mixed with the syrupy waffle goodness
Consistently tasty fresh good quality food with fast friendly service
Honestly I'd make it a dry martini light its cigar cook it dinner with a piping hot apple streusel  for dessert every night if I could
Third reason  I haven't eaten there yet but I'm super impressed with food options
You can choose from a variety of healthy food options hot or cold breakfast/lunch items and if you do feel like splurging - they do have some tasty pastries of normal portion sizes to try too
On a seemingly quiet Monday evening we were in the mood for good chinese food
The fresh rolls and sanwiches are worth 4 or 5 stars the value is worth even more than that the food is CHEAP
You can get out of here at lunch with a belly full of delicious food for under $7
So my friends and I had to roll each other out of the door after this meal was over but it was sooooooooo worth it
I also did enjoy their chicken mac & cheese and collard greens but none were the best I've ever had but very good
At this place the staff is always great to the kids and the food is always excellent
I'm not a big fan of the side dishes I'd recommend passing on them and just having pastys
The patrons at Lon's are mostly an older crowd but it's a classy place with really delicious food and great service and a rustic atmosphere
Everything was fresh and tasty with the Butterfish being the favorite
The menu is split into different areas Appetizers Sashimi & Sushi Tempura and Robata Grilled items sides and entrees
The presentation of the food is excellent and you can tell the chefs take pride in their creations
Food HighlightsSashimi Chef's Selection - This was amazing
The food they do well is excellent and easily eclipses the lackluster items
I'd also recommend asking your server to space out the food orders a bit to allow you to enjoy each course a bit more
The taste and quality of the food however were so bad that I will not be able to return to this place
The food was amazing and to name a few favoritesFirecracker Shrimp - Lightly breaded and tossed in a spicy aioli sauceEnlighten Me Roll - Tofu asparagus jalapenos jicama crispy rolls and sriracha served with peanut hoisin sauceShaking Beef - Holy deliciousness
The summer rolls were a huge disappointment - dry chicken too much noodles ZERO flavor
It completely overpowered the dry chicken and bland noodles and the overall effect was not a terrible flavor combination
Good thing too as the Pad Thai was revolting and tasted basically like a chicken-flavored lollipop
On a side note portions are pretty enormous so half portions are a good idea  terrible food aside
The prices were reasonable and that along with the service and quality of food made it a very enjoyable lunch
My pizza with spicy salami was good not the best pizza ever
I recommend the lobster and crab cakes or the calamari for an appetizer the seared tuna or the lobster for dinner and the coconut cream pie or the crme brulee for dessert all are amazing
If you can force yourself to veer away from steaks when you dine here they have excellent seafood
3 out of 4 of my dishes were delicious the previous mentioned not being one of them two were even spectacular and the experience was just plain fun
They have a great selection and the line moves at a good pace its well controlled
The food service and atmosphere are old school good
The chicken tikka masala was rich and savory and delicious and even came with some GF bread for dipping
Prices are very reasonable considering the quality of the food
My wife has special dietary needs and a request for a dish with no onion garlic or pepper hot
Friendly staff nice atmosphere great tasting food with quality ingredients
They have ever flavor of Primal dog food best dog food ever
They have meaty bones and a lot of other high quality raw meat dog food options as well one of the few places around the valley that do
Chicken Marsala - wonderful mushrooms and sauce
The District in the Sheraton next door is a restaurant in a hotel that has amazing food that is priced better than this
I'm not going to repeat what others before me have so wisely stated but this event was like all the others an evening of delicious food and drink
Food was no better or worse than anything at average-quality restaurants costing 25% less
Tending not to like overly meaty flavor I often try to avoid Brazilian restaurants
If you dont have the patience to wait for quality food call ahead or go to Denny's
Their Cob salad was also very good nothing fancy but a good balance of veggies bacon egg tomato blue cheese avocado with grilled chicken
Really good food- go for the lamb but not quite worth the $$$$
The Pljeskavica was a patty on the same bread but had more of a lamb flavor to me than a beef
Both our meals were excellent - my husband had the French Onion Burger and I had the Seafood Cioppone
I got a chicken caprese sandwich sounds good right
With a few minute walk bike or scooter ride from my front door to Lux the wife and I like making this a frequent stop for a hot beverage or cold people watching dessert or snack outing
All in all an affordable lunch good service and decent Thai food
The sauce is flavorful and the half plate which comes with a side of garlic toast is more than enough food
The counter is rife with delicious looking salads and desserts and there are countless sandwiches and pastas
You can generally get out of there with a $10 or so lunch and considering the quality of the food it's a very good price
They are very accomadating to special dietary needs and have really good brown rice-upon request and will even add tofu to various dishes
Their bakery looked pretty amazing as well but I filled myself up on all you can eat sliders so I didn't get a chance to try any dessert
Now the first issue is the style of the food some people do not consider ANY kind of Mexican food to be gourmet or worth any combo plate being more than $8
The rest of the sushi is average and predictable and their iced green tea is good
The Blue Moose is a fun place to go to hang out with friends and enjoy some good conversation and some decent food
It has this tasty sauce lettuce  tomato and cheese as well as warm chicken wrapped in a flour tortilla
The rolls were also sliced unevenly which is a fine detail that you appreciate at good sushi restaurants
The cheese was good and the basil was actually exceptional which threw me off because they present it shredded and I am used to nice whole leaves on Margherita pizzas
The food was delicious service was spot on environment was cozy - one of my favorite restaurants
Crunchy California roll is still good
And of course the Wagyu beef served with several different salts was amazing
I ordered the pan fried noodles with chicken and it was very tasty
While I was there I had the Original Hummus amazing Cilantro/Jalapeno Hummus also amazing 4 Cheese Quesadilla once with chicken once with steak [I'd prefer it without meat but just had a few bite of someone else's] amazing Greek Salad good but not the best I've had Mediterranean Roasted Chicken really f'n good and big
Falafel yeah baby perfect Lentil soup I've had better but it's still pretty good Pesto Lavosh Wrap I did chicken [recommended by our outstanding waiter] instead of turkey awesome and big
Great beef dogs we ate in perfect winter weather while dreading our return to the cold weather of Washington DC
My wife had a roasted pear salad with red wine glaze and a huge hunk of quality blue cheese and she added a chicken breast and he didn't bat an eye
I had the hummus appetizer along with the chicken kabob sandwich both were yummy
; The simple but classic Pho Thai which consists of Rice Noodles Pho Stock and Thin slices of beef that are placed in the Pho bowl just as they are served is flavorful and great for a newcomer to the Vietnamese Cuisine
I use the whole bowl it adds so much great flavor to the dish
Also their salad and hot food bar was lacking significantly in comparison to the Chandler location
Each dish was very thoughtfully laid out with amazing-sounding garnishes for each protein
I only experienced Wright's for dessert but I wasn't overly impressed
I can agree with the quality of the chicken on the regular rice bowls dark meat could be better; rather than raising the prices lesser quality was chosen which was a shame
He got the famous Italian beef sandwich hot with cheese and I got the little veggie sandwich and an order of the chili cheese fries
The atmosphere is very nice the prices are reasonable and the food is very good
Of course there's a wait it's probably the most famous breakfast joint in this state and there's a reason people flock to it 6 days a week because its really good food served by a really good staff
We want good food and we want it now screw everyone else and if you can't feed our bellies within 30 minutes we'll take our business somewhere else
Ours recommended too many side dishes and adding extra shrimp to our appetizer
Chicken tortilla soup good meld of flavors and a bit spicy
Service was incredible - got seated quickly waitress right there to take our order quickly and food came out amazingly fast given that it was a full house
My friend was really happy with his jerk prawns and rice while I had the brown chicken stew which was really flavorful
The market side has some amazing foods you won't find in many other places around the Valley - definitely worth going out of your way to check out
Let me put it this way - the prices were so low I questioned the quality of the food I was about to eat
Also they have a toy sushi set that I really enjoyed
I have had fried catfish which was excellent
We also got the Fresh Snapper Tacos nothing special but the fish was really really good and the Stacked Enchiladas - SO GOOD
The dough is light and airy the cheeses are tangy and savory the meats are generous and better quality than most
I enjoy that their food has higher quality ingredients than the regular grocery store
I'm in and out in no time and the people working are always friendly and give me good advice on new food
for 6 courses you get a cold appetizer a hot appetizer a fish a meat a cheese plate or truffle fondue my pick and a dessert
when we were served each course our server primarily nicole who was amazing identified each ingredient in the dish offering more detail than what was given on the menu
my cold app was a poached king salmon with sake-cured salmon roe cucumber pickled onion and dabbed all over the plate by a dill-horseradish emulsion and creme fraiche served with a little glass of cold cucumber soup with chipotle oil
A lot of parent hung out for pizza Mexican food and Ice cold beer
If you're used to authentic homemade Mexican food this may not be as good because it is more of a chain restaurant
However I still feel their food is well seasoned and they give you good portions I would pass one the fried ice cream though for dessert for the price not worth it just make it at home
After the meeting I took a stroll on down to the store with my wonderful mocha
We love the high quality food they sell no gluten fillers etc
I certainly recommend trying the funghi pizza with a fresh farm salad to compliment
Brevity is also a wonderful thing when it comes to the waiting time for your dinner of Italian peasant food
The food was very good and had over 100 selections
Some of the items that stood out were the hot and sour soup ;chicken balls on a stick BBQ pork spareribs and the deep fried breaded shrimp was awesome it tasted like they breaded there own fresh shrimp I have never had them taste as good as here
The beef sandwich makes my mouth water just thinking about it but my table was craving to share pizza and wings today so we ordered the pepperoni pizza thin crust and it was truly amazing
Even though they were busy we felt very appreciated and the food and wine were excellent
and the food and beer selection is good too
They are pretty good about getting the food out quickly and the food
The flavor was fantastic but the bread was too large for the chicken breast
Surprisingly the lime did nothing for this dish - but a couple of big squeeze bottles of hot sauce had been supplied and I used that instead
Go for the Spicy G if you want a spicy faux-chicken thing or the Argentine PoBoy for a delicious sweet flanksteak-type meat sandwich
The chicken club sandwich was pretty good
Normally we don't eat at the hotel restaurant but when I saw beef stroganoff on the menu I was hooked
Again I'll say this is one of my Favorite places to eat I know it is always consistently good fresh food
We had the seafood hot pot  i love the broth pad thai papaya salad and hot and spicy noodle
Seafood hot pot the broth is really good- the seafood is ok normally it would come with more greens- but this pot only contains various sea creatures and the broth
The meats are marinated and gilled having lots of flavor
Flavorful broth with noodles beef slices or meatballs yes meatballs and more of those great herbs like mint and cilantro
Similar to Tsing Tao but seems to have a little more kick ;If you are trying Vietnamese food for the fist time I highly recommend Little Saigon
This place is not only the best bang for my buck but consistently good when it comes to food quality it's not low fat if that's what you're looking for & outstanding service
It seems like they get a bad wrap on their food but I think it's pretty good
I had the Torta de Pollo - grilled chicken breast served on a warm pannini style bread and slathered with great flavors
Maybe it is just the vibe from the location being too family friendly that makes BLD seem bland but promising bordering on the edge of being a nice joint to have some tasty food instead of a middle-of-the-road crowd pleaser
Saturday morning we decided to cruise around downtown and find some lunch me and the wife are not big fans of commercial eateries but unique good food isn't always the easiest to find
I finished my wife's burger and have to say that it was a great burger good quality beef chargrilled to perfection with thick bacon and sharp cheddar
You have a little coaster for each person and as long as it is on the green side the wait staff will come to your table offering you delicious meats and sausages
My favorite meat was the lamb rib eye and rack but all the meats were excellent
I recommend Green to anyone who likes good food which I think is everyone
Oh and when we were ordering we asked about what tasted good and she was like I haven't tried any of the food
A good amount of Chinese and Japanese food and quite an impressive selection of Indian foodstuffs - from refrigerated sweets to frozen kulfi pistachio and falooda flavored ice cream 40 kinds of frozen naan/chapati/paratha/roti and an impressive dry goods aisle including a wall of spice mixes
Unless you want to end up back home with 4 kinds of Chinese hot mustard and a rack of beef short ribs to grill when it's 5 billion degrees outside like me
The view was amazing the drinks were wicked expensive albeit tasty the food was fantastical and the ambiance on the patio was pretty darn romantic
on their chopped salad the dressing is super good and the sliced beef brisket yummmmmy
The menu changes every few weeks and you have at least 2 choices for appetizer salad soup entree and dessert to choose from for a little over $20 per person including tax and tip
Generally the quality of food is very good for the price and you get a lot of food for your meal
I acquired my sushi addiction back in NY/NJ and am always in search of some good quality fish
Sit at the bar grab a beer some cold sake and prepare to have a food-gasm
Lots of nigiri rolls beer/sake and appetizers to choose from on that menu
This hotel is at a good location closer to the mall and some yummy restaurants such as True Food Kitchen
So delicious and flavorful but you won't get that heavy sleepy mid-afternoon food coma that their burros tend to induce
This is a superhero themed joint and though a pretty cut and dry burger joint the prices are reasonable and the food is tasty
The crunchy coating the moist flavorful chicken and the slight citrus after taste were absolute perfection
For the beef eaters there is a spiced skirt steak $18 served with parmesan lentil mashed yukons and mushrooms that was so hearty and delicious I can't imagine having this anywhere else
There is usually only one way to finish a good meal like this and that's with my favorite self proclaimed food group chocolate
The corn muffins and chicken are excellent
At Pet Planet we work hard to provide the best possible everyday prices on quality pet food supplies and services
If you get past that though the atmosphere is good and the food is pretty decent too
Sushi rolls are a little small but other than that it is good sushi for half price
I got a very traditional chicken/rice/veggie dish and everything was amazing
Chicken was tender and melted in my mouth and the veggies were fresh and delicious
The food is always very fresh and with a great deal of flavor
on my recent visit--I had a nori roll with a great peanut dipping sauce--it was again a wonderful blend of tastes
What I do know for certain however is that the food I was eating at Vitamin T was very very tasty
Vitamin T offers you a salsa/condiments bar so that you can alter the flavor of your dish however you like
I know it's a chain but I think the food is tasty
I've been going there since literally before it opened the dry run and have always had good food and service that ranges from acceptable to great with one notable exception
The food and service was good and the owner's over abundance of personality provided the atmosphere / entertainment
The only reason I stopped going is we had tried all the appetizers desserts and most of the entrees on the menu
Had we chosen a table I am not sure what it would have been like but I could hear the servers talking to the tables behind us about their food options the recommendations based always on input from the customer and the lovely specials
very hip- good selection of wines- excellent friendly serviceNot so much- food was good but not as interesting as other wine bars we frequent- too many kids
I stopped by Jojo's tonight around 915PM to grab a slice of good ol' cheese pizza
On to the food the burger was juicy and had good flavor but the bun was TERRIBLE
i have a love affair for horse radish so um yeah i enjoyed the wasabi from that
Very good food but to be honest it better for being at the price range it was at
The food is great excellent hummus and PROPER pidepita bread
Was looking for some dessert and a good coffee and stumbled across this place
We shared the chochinita and fish tacos they were very good
The food was excellent as always the the drink was even better
Our food came out it was good as usual but our pancakes didnt show up
Nigiri was best the rolls were yummy - Diamondback and Crazy - but not amazing
The service is always good and the quality and cut of the fish is great
The BBQ chicken has a pretty good flavor to it but it was a little greasy for my taste - I think it might have been better with white meat instead of dark
The food itself was nothing short of amazing
A nice bottle of Brunello caprese appetizer and fantastic wood-fired pizza
We shouldn't have to ask for cutlery & plates when you bring the pizzaThe pizza was good
Besides the very friendly staff another thing you don't find often in this valley the food is wonderful
I grew up in Calif enjoying the Calif /Mex food from local friends and this has that flavor
We never thought it would be hard to find good mexican food in Scottsdale but it is
Today the entrees and side dishes were more along the lines of comfort food and included the followingBBQ Beef Brisket w/ BunsCornmeal encrusted Trout/Sauteed Red SnapperRoasted Chicken & PorkPepperoni PizzaMashed potatoes/gravyRoasted Red PotatoesMacaroni & CheeseBaked BeansSauteed green beans w/ red/green pepper and onionJasmine rice w/ black beans and peppers deliciousClam chowder/Chicken & bean soupBlack Bean & Chipotle prepared saladBaked potates w/ all the toppingsThe service is always top notch and I just love the dark cozy atmosphere it almost reminds me of a steakhouse
If you're looking for good breakfast food - hearty omelets with fruit and potatoes or wonderfully aromatic pancakes - then this place is for you
It was delicious albeit heavy because of the cornbread - a truly savory Southwestern dish
I ordered 6 beef tongue tacos and I tell you IT'S AMAZING
On the side if you want more pickled jalapenos or carrots radishes amazing salsas they're available
The fish was cooked perfectly with a creamy texture and a simple sweet flavor
The restaurant's atmosphere isn't anything to write home about but the service was decent and the prices about $15 a person were definitely really reasonable for the amount and quality of the food we tried
This is an especially good stop for the vegetarians in your circle but the meat lovers won't go wanting
I ordered the lasagne and I know it is not a freshly made pasta dish but I can make most of the other ones at home but I'm too lazy to do lasagne  -  anyway it was delicious
That sauce aside the food is pretty good but it's not the best I've ever had
The location is a bit odd essentially behind Party City in a strip mall but the food and beer is amazing
Fresh hot perfectly salted real potatoes and the price to feed a family with this quality of food was highly reasonable
Definitely worth the drive from anywhere in the area if you are looking for great Thai food
My friend and I ordered $20 worth of food 2 drinks a bag of chips sweet potato fries a provolone & veggie panini and a flatbread
Their prices are CHEAP but are definitely NOT a reflection of the excellent quality of food and drink etc Their produce is always amazingly fresh
Let's get to the food - had the crabcake appetizer which was yummy two small very small portions
Very impressed with his ability to select wine for my wife and I we proceeded to order a selection of meat and cheeses which we also let him pick out for us
Would also recommend the chicken roll ups
I need to go back and try the food to really make a judgment call but the service was great and the one appetizer I tried was pretty tasty
The orange chicken came out cold for my daughter
Tuna - a bit stringy not very tastyYellowtail - basically my favorite sushi a let down hereTobiko w/quail egg - about the worst on the plate too much lumpy rice
The wings were the typical but still good wings you get in any decent pizza or bar
The thin crust pizzas were terrific - crunchy and very flavorful
Food - Looking at the menu we decided not to split an appetizer
Instead we'd split an appetizer a side and a dessert
Not just andouille sausuage either - there was also hot Italian sausage and a southwest chicken sausage - all from Schreiner's
Granted we started late and neither of us were super hungry - but the shared appetizer side and dessert really was plenty for us and we left feeling full
They have above-average bar food with slightly above average bar food prices and obviously good beer
The meats were all good and the veggies were fresh
But honestly I have never been impressed by the food once and I always want to be
We had plenty of left overs and quality food for about the same price as Panda Express which I am not a huge fan of
I ordered the orange chicken it was really good slightly crispy on outside and the orange sauce was great
Downtrodden servers and questionable service aside the food was delicious and I can bet we'll be back whenever we're back in the land of the cougars and $30K millionaires
Food started off OK with the combination appetizer plate
In summary overpriced want to be PF Changs but at least PF Changs food is good
The food is delicious - I always suggest anyone try the bruchetta planks and any of their salads are a delicious choice
We ordered them with ground beef which was tasty with a bit of a kick
Great ambiance good location decent food and mediocre parking
I like the idea however in practice the sandwich was a bit dry I  mostly got bread flavor and it would have been nice if they cut it in to two smaller hand sized pieces instead of one long roll
Good food Great Service even better specialty cocktails
The food was excellent and very affordable too
They have a good menu and the food is always well prepared
I'm an avocado snob and you can get a good selection of the buttery green goodness in any omelet or egg dish you choose
We narrowed down our selection based on the recommendations and ended up getting Vietnamese egg rolls the spicy beef soup and the soft noodle sauteed meat combination plate
I've been searching for high quality sushi for months and I finally found it
There was a LOT of rice in the crazy roll which was good balanced out the tempura shrimp and bad I prefer to fill up on fish not rice
Everything is made-to-order and the chefs hand over the plates with pride; I've been to countless sushi joints where the chefs whip out as much product as they can without giving any care to the quality
The decor was fine I still felt like I was in a hotel basement and I really got the vibe it used to be a sushi joint but that wasn't really the issue
The issue was for the amount and quality of the food
Delicious yes substantial no; don't be fooled the kobe beef tenderloin on casabe flatbread is not as hearty as it sounds
The soup comes in a bowl bigger than my sink and contained literally a few spoonfuls; for what its worth the consistency on this dish wasn't too great
I would be embarrassed to recommend this place for a certain price point dining experience even to people with oodles and oodles of money to burn looking to eat latin american cuisine in a faux sushi bar at a hotel
Service was a bit on the slow side but the tasty food made up for it
They do have some good food but they could use some more options
With the waiter the bartender a chef or two and myself now being entertained by The Red Hot Chili Peppers my main course of Kentucky Fried Quail would arrive as I was slowly enjoying the foie gras and with the small bird surprisingly plump I again set aside the liver and moved onto the hot dish before me; the first bite a crackling of deep fried skin and lightly herbed breading that would set the tone for everything on the well composed plate
unnecessarily upscale comfort food perhaps but damned good as well
With the hour now nearing three Spencer returned to ask if I wanted to see the dessert menu and with my mantra that it never hurts to look I said sure and received a short list of four choices all of which sounded okay but none which sounded great and as such I deferred to my server's opinion and he recommended the Fourplay based on his own personal preference for cheesecake a good recommendation though certainly not on par with the savories
Described on the menu as Flourless chocolate cake New York Cheesecake Chocolate Cream Milk Chocolate Parfait and a Chocolate Fan and mere minutes after ordering it was clear from the start that this was a pre-prepared dessert and while each texture was nice enough the cake itself was a tad spongy thus relying on the 'fan' to add a bit of crunch-rich but not heavy cold but not frozen the flavor itself was not all that different from a Hostess Ho-Ho
A long day of dining behind me and dinner yet to go I hope Praying Monk is turning better business on other days of the week-my guess is that it'd be an awesome place to watch some College Football in the coming months particularly given the quality of the food and beer list if you're into that
For dinner I have enjoyed their chicken lasagna that utilizes the Meyer lemon olive oil which gives it a really nice fresh taste buy a bottle to take home and enjoy it on chicken veggies and fish
Havta try chicken & other flavors next time
They're super fast and we had an amazingly good chicken burrito there last time
I personally love the broiled chicken pita a simple chicken pita with a little extra flavor
The hummus and chicken is also really tasty
There are many choices and we have had some wonderful meals here so I suppose we shouldn't have been surprised to find the food fabulous and the service stellar especially considering the great reviews here on yelp
I had the steak salad which was refreshing and tasty  with enough meat to fill me but not heavy
Really wanted a dessert to spoil my  good eating but just no room
Someone else got one of the pizzas which was delicious with goat cheese and garlic my brother got the meat trio special and was in heaven
Then we got a tiramisu and creme brulee for dessert the creme brulee was everyone's favorite -- vanilla bean flavor with berries
A big ole' burrito is always good but typically I go with the chicken bowl
Two chicken bowls and a side of chips & quac will run about $16 but it is good for what is somewhat fast  food
Normally that itself is plenty good enough but then there's the food that comes out of that wonderful oven
Finding good Indian food in Phoenix has made the move here easier
Parking is easyService is always fantasticTake-out is always ready very quickly and very hotGood variety of spices at the attached little storeTried and recommend Shahi paneer chicken tikka masala veg korma
There is nothing quite like enjoying a cold brewski outside with good friends and good food and Four Peaks delivers that
But if you go in with the mindset that you are going to be surprised with a meal full of the freshest ingredients wonderful combinations of flavors and fantastic stories to every dish you will not be disappointed
For a description of the amazing food we ate please see Camile H's review
I could swear I had a full half of a chicken in my three pieces and they were smothered in some delicious form of gravy which I could have just as easily poured straight down my gullet
Amazing creative and delicious food great service
Buying as much of their food as possible locally and daily really makes a difference in the quality of the food
The food is not cheap but it is a great value for the quality of food
if you can get beyond lunch costing as much as a new car hey in an airport you're a captive audience the food and service were both good
This hurts my heart as I wish independently owned businesses would thrive in the area and I miss good mediterranean food being a Dearborn native
I ordered the chicken taco salad and this is the first time I've had cold chicken in my taco salad
I've never spent more than $10 here and that usually includes at least one appetizer or dessert
Of course I'd recommend getting some Pho stick with chicken unless you're either very adventurous or completely sure what the other ingredients are
Don't go there expecting to pay less than $10 per person however the food is fresh and very tasty
The food is not only original but good an healthy
The salads are all good too and their chocolate dessert with the ice cream not sure what it's called is amazing
i feel like this was their forgotten dish - the fish had zero flavor and the color on the plate was white and light orange from the butternut squash puree
Upside is the service was good and my boyfriend liked his roasted chicken
The sandwich really was excellent but I have ordered the white pizza every time since and never looked back
They have some decent side dishes and desserts notably the red velvet cake which is usually a little dry but good and the salt river bar which is VERY yummy
The pizzas are pretty good calzones are pretty big and the italian nachos are the best
The fish & chips are good too it's not all batter and not greasy either
The food was delicious at their restaurant also
Your food what I can remember of it is tasty and your servers are super polite but you really should have banned me for life or at the very least called the police on me or something
The restaurant is good - food is decent and service is accommodating
I just love the combination of the rice and seasoned chicken it is out of this world good
Between the 3 of us we orderedMushroom pizza Pretty good lots of 'shrums for those who like mushroomsCorn and Avocado Now that was delicious covered with chunks of goat cheese
The food was excellent the ambiance was beautiful and the service was very good
Thank you Sens for so many great years amazing food and kick ass Sake
Service was nice everyone was friendly food didn't take too long and the food was pretty good
The food that you delivered was actually quite good
Don't get me wrong The food is amazing the chicken focc
Only complaint is their seafood selection is crap nothing is really that fresh there at all everything usually smells fishynot good when looking for fresh seafood
For relatively fast food Pei Wei is an excellent option for delicious and healthy dining out
I just returned from my honeymoon in Italy a couple of months ago and was impressed by the quality and authenticity of the food here
You can't this quality and quantity of food for less than $8 anywhere else
I had some difficulty choosing an entree to order but once I did I was very impressed with the sandwich named Phoenician-chicken-something I believe and the side that came with it
great food have the cranberry Margarita and carne asada tacos great service and wonderful all around experience
An hour later we had a large group of 6+ we were seated on the patio next to the fireplace and we had a blast munching on the meat and cheese board another bruschetta board - the apple+fig jam+brie is amazing and more wine
The quality of the food here is higher than other clubs and sometimes you can get things here that you can't get in a normal grocery store
Thankfully the sweet potato fries were amazing and we tried to eat them slowly as our stomachs rumbled during almost an hour while we waited for our food
In summation the food is excellent and the martinis are even better
The food is appropriately tasty and filling
Their burgers are some of the best in town as long as you're not looking for healthy fitness related food that is And the chocolate peanut butter shake is amazing
The Sushi restaurant is delicious but they don't even know what Goma-ae is and they don't have seaweed salad
My Omelette was huge filled with black forest ham three peper bacon which was really tasty and tequilla chicken sausage not to mention a huge helping of hashbrowns
Even though we were all really full the cookie dessert was amazing
The food came out hot and looked great although it was way sweet to me
All four of these pizza types were unusual and very delicious
Flavor was good but there was water NOT OIL in the center of the pizza
---Had some chicken special thingy good but not 5 star Yelp good
and did make it up to my party and myself and thankfully the food was good
However they made an impression and it was bad but I tried to overlook their obvious lack of service gave them the benefit of the doubt good food will always win me over
Imagine my surprise when the food I received looked like someone had just thrown random items on the plate with guacamole that was already turning brown as compared to when it came neatly presented to me and looking so tasty and fresh the first time
but lack of customer service and inconsistent food quality will have me avoiding this place even if I was starving and desperate
Here you go-Urban Market Salad with watercress red pepper dried corn sugared pecans avocado and blue cheese vinaigrette dressing on the side-Citrus & Rum Free-Range Chicken with watercress pear-gorgonzola salsa-Alaskan Salmon with maple-ginger glaze-Asparagus couscous with feta and mint-Grilled vegetable feast with farmers goat cheese and herbs-and of course my favorite the Signature Sweet Potato Chips dusted with mild curryWe arrived at the above menu after looking through around eight pages worth of gourmet menu items that are all appealing possibilities if you choose to use the Herb Box to cater your event
We tried A LOT of dishes and all were very good
I oNly had the chance to try the bi bim bop rice bowl filled with veggies and a fried egg this visit and thought they could do a few things to improve including  using bulgogi meat instead of the ground beef offering it 'dolsot-style' aka in a hot clay pot so that the bottom rice gets toasted adding more variety of vegetables and leaving the gojuchang  hot pepper sauce on the side to add
Also the menu had a variety  of good things including the lunch bento box and sushi happy hour
For lunch I had one of the chicken sandwiches which was good
These few incidents of confusion were masked by the overall pleasant service atmosphere and quality of the food
It's a littler pricier than a place like Streets of New York but the service and food is better it's a little less than somewhere like Pizzeria Bianco or Le Grande Orange but again it's a little less you know delicious as those places
Indeed all of the food tasted very good
The food while good was nothing outstanding
i heartily recommend the st louis ribs over the baby backs bc they were cooked SO tender and were so nice and meaty
The meat tasted a bit processed but the croissant was delicious
The in-house bacon a la Newport Meats was perhaps a bit under-done but had a nice flavor to it so I didn't really care
One dessert was a chocolate tort which didn't have much chocolate flavor and the texture didn't help it
Overall The Grind might work out in Arcadia for the scene but they need to work on a few things 1 if you're a burger joint the burgers should be within five degrees of requested specs 2 if you're advertising a 1000 degree oven you're letting everyone know the burger isn't going to take long to cook so food should come out quickly 3 when you keep mentioning the chef came from a highly-regarded fine-dining establishment you better deliver the goods
The foods are excellent and the portion is great
I went with the curry chicken salad instead and it was tasty - as long as you like curry
Full bar live music dancing good food and a great staff
The entertainment draws from some of the best rock  bands in the valley and brings some good ole rock and roll that you you just don't find anywhere else
He made impeccable recommendations on the menu and timed the delivery of our food dessert and check perfectly
Very good food if it was cheaper I'd eat here every day
Fish was good atmosphere stunk service was incredibly slow and it seemed like a cross between red lobster and chilis
Although my food was good it took about 15 minutes to order my appetizers while eating at the bar which was almost empty
Overall it is good fish and it is very cheap but not sure it is worth it
The only criticism I can make is that the selection of pizzas was a little weak but I had no problem waiting three minutes for the next piping hot pepperoni pie to spring from the oven
DQ in general must be the most overpriced place to go for fast-food considering the quality and quantity you receive aside from the blizzards
One look at the pizza and was pleasantly surprised at how tasty it looked
Every bite of all this food was way more delicious than I was anticipating
The broaster chicken is done to perfection; juicy crispy hot
The lobster roll was good and fresh but it was difficult to taste the lobster
But all in all most everything here is good especially if you stick to the traditional american food
As if that wasn't enough reason to get you there the food is pretty good
The staff is more amazing than the food and that is not an insult to the food but as a restaurant mangers view just as important
We ordered beef fried noodle in XO sauce with thick noodle seafood fried noodle with hand pulled noodle ox tail noodle soup with shaved noodle - all very good
Well I heard the food was good here so a couple friends and I decided to give it a shot
Is this their first shot at the restaurant business is there no order to what food goes where
The tacos from Loco & Distrito were both good; I especially liked the slaw on Distrito's seafood taco
Excellent food options such as Asian Mexican and your typical ballpark fare
I highly recommend the Crust Pizza a local pizzeria who have a stand here
cooked to perfection served with scrumptious sides mushrooms mashed potatoes so deliciously creamy you need a straw to enjoy them and sauteed mushrooms3 Dessert - so mind boggling delicious
So a half order of chicken fried steak comes with smashed red potatoes green beans with bacon so f-ing good big garlic bread and of course a dinner salad to start with
So friends- an hour for our food from time of order food that wouldn't even be good if we waited only 5 mins for it and sucky wine choices
Food  Needless to say we all were guided to wonderful dinner choices
Marcellino had the quaintness of a family owned place combined with the experience and food quality of a fine restaurant
I cannot say enough about the quality of the food and the service
I think their broth is consistently delicious  and the peanut sauce that comes with their spring rolls is quite possibly the best I've ever had
If you want quality Vietnamese food and fabulous service you should definitely check this place out
Prices are very reasonable and you'll likely have the pleasure of seeing Johnny as he grabs waters brings out food and otherwise performs quality  control
I went here using a Groupon coupon today and im half Peruvian and I've had my good share of goood real Peruvian food and this food was literally the worst Peruvian food I've ever tasted in my life
The chicken was dry and barely had any seasoningthe fries were good the salad had a mustard dressing on it
So if your looking for a real Peruvian restaurant either try to find a good one here in az or go to los angeles California where Peruvian food is well known and they know how to prepare it
The pepperoni pizza tasted good although the crust was a bit doughy
They has some secret ingredient in the pizza that made is so so so tasty
I swear there is something in this pizza that makes it so good
A very California menu with cucumbers in the water and fresh avocados on their tacos this is a fantastic place to get very good food at very reasonable prices
I am used to places over selling how hot a dish is but this place undersells
A small annoyance that does not get in the way of the delicious food
Plenty to eat and drink; no need to waste your time on appetizers or desserts
I'm happy we got to try so many delicious dishes and look forward to our next visit when I'll only order one item in order to save room for dessert
Again the serving size was way more than enough for a big guy and there was enough meat and goodie falling off of each taco that you could make two new tacos
I would just end up picking the meat out just savor how wonderful the texture and flavor were
Sushi quality is certainly as good as any place I've ever been
That way you can order a good variety and not have to eat entire rolls by yourself
We usually share the Combo Porch Platter it has the right amount of food for 2 or 1 REALLY hungry person with my husband getting the Baby Back Ribs myself getting the BBQ Tri-Tips the Pulled Pork and Beef Brisket are good too and we split the half chicken
mmm-mmm good drool So with a check of around $35 when sharing the Combo Porch Platter scrumptious food and lemonade and left-overs that warm up great at home
If you seek a quick place for some Hawaiian type comfort food this restaurant is pretty good
In short Pretty decent Pakistani food good buffet too
The food is pretty tasty and the portions are not bad for the price
Food was pretty good with burgers and fries being the main point of focus of course
The chicken gyoza has been delicious both times i wish they served more than 5
The other rolls we tried and that were tasty were Spicy Tuna Foku and J-Pop
I am a pescatarian and unless I am eating seafood I steer clear of meat even the mock kind usually however once in a while it's delicious
We got take out from there the other night and we went on a recommendation by a family member with very good taste and a food fanatic who gives us all the local spots since we just moved here
I'm a sucker for good German food but quick to be annoyed by German slop claiming to be good food
First Watch continues to deliver consistently good food in this location
If you don't expect it to taste like a PIZZA at all a Totino's frozen cracker with sauce and toppings can actaully be a little tasty
There are a lot of items that are cooked that way - chicken taquitos turkey flautas tortilla chips sopaipillas etc - that are so good when they achieve the proper consistency on the delicate Crispy~Greasy Spectrum but so nasty when they are not
We had the veggie spring rolls which are very fresh and delicious
We've found the beef broth to be a bit more flavorful but for those adhering to a vegan diet the vegetable broth would still provide a flavorful option
Nothing to write home about but the food was pretty good
Just tasty greasy food my brother said it's the perfect hangover food and they are open late so
We got our salad and sushi appetizers but no place settings
The sushi was good we had a Sun Roll which was on the specials board
So far my fave rolls are the Vegas Bama Voodoo Crab Special and the good ol' standbys California and Philly
Went last night 9-17-11 for my first time and can't stop thinking about how impressed I am with both the service and the food
I am not a big meat fan so I would probably get it aked next time but holy cow was it good
Buoyed by my resolve to not inflict copies of myself upon the world I took in my surroundings and was bemused by the relatively classy surroundings on my left with sleekly lined contours contrasted to the relatively campy decor on my right right with a wall that had a built in wave and photos of their food with descriptions on colored paper
This was a wonderful dance of complementary flavors while the peanuts and scallions added poignant counterpoints in rougher texture compared to the smoothness of the rest of the roll
This is an excellent family run restaurant with lovely food + service that will provide you with a completely satisfying meal at a good price and Yelpers should congregate to this location and partake in a  feverish frenzy of foodie bliss
The flavor is as good as anything you get in Brooklyn or Miami but a lot more meat on the bones
I was so impressed that I order the Curry Goat and Jerk Chicken to go plus 2 beef patties and 2 jerk chicken patties
The drinks are good wait staff are nice and food ok when you get there early enough
Don't miss this place if you are in the mood for great food and wonderful decor
At this point we had been craving a hot dog for the better part of the day; so much so that any other type of food was just simply not going to cut it
But I'd rather pay a bit more for good quality food to eat at home than eat out one more night a week
Spring rolls - all filler no flavor the lettuce decoration a bit much
I called in on a Friday night and ended up ordering the Swedish-cured Salmon Sandwich following a recommendation from the person over the phone
The Chicken Cordon Bleu was fantastic and lived up to all of my expectations while the Laxpudding was just as savory and delicious as was described to me by the son of the owners
I cannot wait for my next meal at Beaver Choice and I suggest anyone/everyone give it a try if you truly enjoy delicious homemade food
This isn't a destination for schmancy food-- it's a great hole in the wall to chow some satisfying grub ; take some time to peruse this place's walls nooks and crannies-- they are covered with some worthy kitsch
The food is excellent I recommend the seafood diablo dish and its only about 20 bucks
I've been a couple of times for lunch and I have enjoyed it but neither my mom nor brother eat a lot of food that follows this concept
I definitely recommend this for anyone looking for some local selections a unique mix of mostly healthier food and anyone wanting to enjoy a good meal
Go early it's only around 30 and your pizza will be old and cold
'I had smothered chicken breast with waffle and cheesy grits on the side The smothered part gravy and grilled onions was amazing
'The Healthy Special' - chicken teriyaki white meat veggies carrots broccoli cabbage on brown rice with a really amazing Iced Tea
We have eaten at that location several times and although the food is always good they often times manage to screw something up
Overall delicious food and pretty good service
I will say that the food ingredients themselves were very good
I love the egg rolls and the spring rolls were tasty as well
There's not much to complain about - it's close it's clean good service and the food is good
I really expected to like Cantina Laredo - upscale mexican food darkly intimate interior nice outdoor patio with a fire pit & lights interesting menu options and prices that would indicate good food
I go out to eat to get food I can't make as well as home but I'll settle for food that's as good as I make at home
The dish concepts really sounded so good if only they used fresh and good ingredients
- Chicken Enchiladas My boyfriend got this dish & enjoyed his enchiladas
The food and drink was better then expected Our server Kendra did a wonderful job and made sure we had enough to drink and eat and made sure we enjoyed ourselves
This was a good way to end the food after all the fried foods and carbohydrates we ate
I was skeptical I like my salmon either smoked or sushi raw but this was delicious
I've been 3 times and I don't think the quality approaches what Mike his wife and his mother offered in terms of food quality
My husband being the foodie of the family used me having a bad day as an excuse to give Sprinkles a shot
meatloaf was soft and spongy and packed with flavor but I have had much better
While I admit I'm not a fan of their egg rolls everything else is amazing
I recommend any of their chicken or beef dishes personally Orange Beef is my favorite and the Crab Wantons
I was impressed by the quality of the food
They say 25 minutes I show up in 25 minutes and the pizza has obviously been sitting there and is cold
Next best thing to Brunchies other than service is their fine quality food
All these foods are quality made and each meal on the menu has a southwestern or mexican inspired name
It's meaty the tomato is fresh the pickles are tasty
The Tootsie was fantastic as always but I wasn't a huge fan of the Lighting roll I'm not sure if I just didn't like the flavor combination but it tasted too oniony
All in all if you're craving sushi it makes a great lunch spot and it made for a good cheap dinner with friends
There are better sushi places out there but Sushi Q is worth a stop if you're in the area and in the mood
We got our wings which were black round little crispy balls of dry chicken with Italian dressing g with some hotsauce mixed in drizzled on top
I dont know what the big hype is with this place this isn't real Italian and its nothing to write home about there was nothing to be impressed with from the soups to the lame salads to the meal - all was mediocre and if you ask me they charge to much for the quality of the food
The pizza was good I enjoyed the flavors pepperoni cheese and sauce was very good
The spaghetti was very good especially the meatballs
Daughter hardly gave me a chance to taste the chicken Parisian but what I did taste was really good they do like to pile on the cheese that's the way to get my daughters heart
Winter and early spring when it is too cold to swim are good times for solitude as there is usually little boat traffic other than the fishermen who stay around the shoreline and the sailors who stay out in the middle
Fishing is good there are several tournaments held here year-round
Like the music I can see how the Pasta Bar dishes may appeal to many particularly those who favor flavor intensity and/or creativity over all else
Despite my personal intolerance to hot food a more delicate approach would have been better
The carbonara was an intense combination of garlic and black pepper flavors and probably the dish I enjoyed most of the three
You can eat the same quality and quantity of food with much less fat at Chipotle for half the price
Because I think there pizza is very good when they are not busy
That said the food was as advertised and was good for what it was
Chicken Marsala was lacking flavor as well
It's not on the same level as SF but all the fish was prepared well and had a good texture
I'm not a big roll guy but we tried a few rolls and they were all pretty good big beers were $4 during happy hour so a huge meal for two with drinks was only $70 total which is great considering a similar meal in SF would put you over $100 without a problem
I LIKED the use of cucumber in the dish was light and tasty and successful
The last time I was here I had the sizzling rice dish and that one impressed me because they cook the rice quickly in a very hot oil and puff the rice
Me and My Husabnd are from Rhode Island Maine and We Went to Oscar's Pier 83 Fish and Chip's in Glendale Arizona sometiime in December 2011 as we were Visiting the Area and we wanted some Good Fish
The food was amazing and the service was great
I highly recommend this this place if you want good baja Mexican food and great service
When we finally caught them on an odd morning when the wait was reasonable found the food was good but not worth the hype
I enjoyed the Grilled Italian sandwich and was pretty much blown away by the incredible amounts of delicious Italian meats that were used on this huge sandwich bursting with flavor
It wasnt a cheap lunch that is for sure but the food is super good and the portions were  a decent size
Oh fellow yelpers is there anything more wonderful than an unexpected food find a bit of culinary serendipity to brighten one's day
It's definitely the type of hole in the wall so bad for you it's good type food that one craves every now and then
This place has a pattern for bad service which is unfortunate since the food is excellent
The wings were pretty good but had almost no meat on them
But the dessert was what really impressed
If you have kids I would not recommend going here because of the nasty food and the extremely long wait
They have special offers for #evfn guests and the food is amazing
We have been here four times pervious and it was great the food and serving portions were wonderful
Postino's has the best deals with consistent and high quality delicious food and wine
**Sunkissed Roll - flavorless**Smoked Philly roll - don't be tricked
Fabulous location [in my work 'hood] wonderful building capable and friendly staff and the usual ahmazing food
Other then the chips and salsa 5 stars for salsa the food is good but not so much that I go out of my way to eat there
But overall it is a Scottsdale landmark that is fun to bring out of towers to and the food is overall good
My meal Shanghai Style Meatballs meh arrived a good 10 minutes after my husband's Kung Pao Chicken
I had the crab enchiladas which were tasty but the sauce was so spicey it could have been any kind of meat in there
The warm inviting atmosphere plus the delicious food makes Crackers & Co
The drink specials on happy hour are pretty non-existent as well so for me the food better be damn good if I'm going to go there
This roll is particularly good with roe because the baked lobster is hot and warms up the roe so it's not so cold which can make it taste fishy
It's also pricey but the quality of the food does match the price for the most part
The food is great and the salsa is really good but I was shocked when we ordered the fried ice cream and it came battered and fried instead of the nasty mock batter basically ice cream rolled in corn flakes and re-frozen yuck that other places serve
I usually give 4 STARS to all restaurants; but had some challengesHere are the positivesThe special fish dish cod; it was excellent; moist and very tasty
I enjoyed my cup of cream of mushroom soup and my entree beef tips
The lemongrass chicken was good but my favorite lemongrass chicken so far is at Khai Hoan where it is more saturated with flavor
Their location is across town but decided to give it a try hoping that their pizza would be as good as their samples from the event
There are salads preset pizza flavors and then the oh-so-awesome make your own pizza exactly the way you want it option
Well onto the food and it is well worth the visit
All food is very flavorful and fresh tasting
I had the most amazing chicken and the sides which usually I just take for granted as filler food were sodelicious that they caught my attention in a big way
I love their buffalo blast chicken appetizers
To sum a large review that you won't want to read Thai Elephant dishes offer a powerful flavor but a small amount for the price
We have had several bday family gatherings here and the food is good the staff are nice and the price is right
I love their Peking Duck and walnut shrimp but they are usually only available for dinner and on the weekends at an increased price so that kind of sucks but the fresh sushi bar is well worth the price every time
I attended an event at Cafe Carumba and I was impressed with the food and the service
The food was good and the fresh squeezed juice was a my daily indulgence
We shared the sticky toffee dessert which was really sweet but oh-so-good
The dish was quite good - a nice balance of flavorful chicken and fresh vegetables
It's unfortunate because I had heard good things about the concept the quality of food and service
I've been looking for a good French restaurant in Phoenix and have finally food it
French food is best know for its flavor and sauces and Coup Des Tartes hits it on the spot
I would have given 3 stars because the food was ok and we enjoyed the atmosphere but the  staff/service bumps it down to 2 stars
I was impressed by the friendly staff and the other food options including bottles of wine and yes delicious sugary looking pastries  Hey I didn't say I was against the sweets did I
It's good to see a restaurant that can focus on the food as much as it focus's on it's ambiance
Not only do they have other tasty food they also have some pretty darn good drinks
The fish tacos are STELLAR small homemade coleslaw and the seasoning of the fish is wonderful
Up to then I had been occasionally going to another local chain that had a place near me but was often turned off by the attitude of the employees despite the food being pretty good
Over the last few months I have been happy to enjoy pork chicken and beef from this place and regularly try to stop by on Wednesday for their excellent wings
The pulled pork sandwiches are served with their delicious cole slaw right on the sandwich the regular smoked chicken is flavorful even without the sauce and the briscuit is amazing
So hopefully that was an isolated incident because the food was so good I can't wait to go back
I ordered the Pho Thai so did the boyfriend we also shared the crispy egg rolls which were amazing
Other wise it was very clean the staff was great the soup and egg rolls were amazing and I would highly recommend the chicken fried rice for the little ones
Fun atmosphere nice bar great food great location clean bathrooms and cold stone next door if youre craving a sweet treat after
The pork was a little sweet and smokey the asada was well seasoned and smoky and the chicken too was a winner just not as a flavorful
Cheaper than Starbucks and the food looked pretty good too
The pizza was really good not like anything I've had before but really yummy
The texture of the chicken was moist it just didn't have any flavor at all
The actual meat patty was tasty but the whole thing was just a mess and I couldn't enjoy it
It also made me realize the pepper had no flavor and the beef was the only thing that was tasty
Good food low prices friendly service and close to where I live
I have tried a few more things on the menu and I highly recommend the crispy chicken wrap
The atmosphere is not 5 star but who cares this is about good authentic mexican food
Pho #1 on the menuSeafood Fat Noodle #29BBQ Pork Short Ribs Served with RiceSpring RollsSeafood Hot Pot
Tasty Pizza - plenty of veg options and crispy seasoned crust
It definitely was an experience and the food was amazing
That would be OK if they were great but the ground lamb dish doesn't have flavor the chicken curry dish is filled with chopped up fatty dark meat and the tandoori chicken is dry cooking under the heat lamp for long periods of time
Had some Spanish Rice refried beans a beef taquito an excellent beef tamale hand made not some fast-food thing pretending to be a tamale
The tasty treats over at the Chinese hot table included TERRIFIC big meaty barbecued pork ribs really good & crispy Sweet & Sour Pork Hey Iain
The food was very good but I'm giving it only 2 stars because it made my stomach upset later that night
Service can be abysmal as long as the food is good
The chicken tikka masala was actually pretty good and was the only decent part of the whole meal
Giuseppe's on 28th isn't fancy looking but the food is absolutely wonderful
The steak I tried was impressively delicious and everyone else said their food was really good
The handmade pita is wonderful and the food is usually good
The chicken portion was pretty small but I did enjoy the overall flavor of the crisp apples and crunchy pistachios and cheese
Give it a shot to find out what food is suppose to be before the invention of artificial everything just not often
we went ahead and ordered the guiness barbque sauce wings fish nuggetts w/chips and for a potato overkill the skins as well all the food was very tasty
Great atmosphere and the food quality was fantastic
The salmon dish I selected was a good portion and was cooked to perfection - moist and flavorful
So in the tradition of My Mother's I joined the others at the salad bar piling their little plate up to the sky with delicious cold food
*  Don't miss Mother's great Potato Salad or the really delicious little round slices of meat Smoked Pepperoni
Our food arrives and thankfully it was hot and fresh
I dig into the roast beef and it's pretty good the horseradish is spicy enough to give that classic nasal burn
The ingredients were all of very high quality the vegetables very fresh and the food was delicious
In keeping with high quality and healthy food both my wife and I felt great afterward
The prices are very reasonable for the quality of food you get
If you're looking for a bargain and your standard low quality everyday food Dairy Queen is right next door
If you're looking for tasty fresh nutritious food this place is it
Invariably the conversation of good pizza comes up when you are speaking to new friends in this wonderful city
I have been to three of them and the atmosphere is good at all of them but the pizza is great
The only reason that I can truly give as to why their pizza tastes so darned good is the ingredients
And I was impressed with the chew on the beef it had a nice give too it and was delicious
Sushi is pretty good and if you go during happy hour it's a steal
I usually go to Morton's for quality of food and service
The quality of food is still there that's why I gave it two stars
My neighbor had the roast beef sandwich and it was no better or higher quality
I earlier chastised someone for judging food on opening night but now I see it really is bad there is really no quality
Perfectly seasoned and barbecued meat that was non stop good
Hubby's meal - a completely unpronounceable chicken dish with cashews peanuts water chestnuts onion and pepper was similarly amazing
Nice to finally get good service great food and a great atmosphere
The coffee is great particularly their iced coffee and in my experience the food has been consistently delicious
We had the Vegie Sampler as an appetizer and it was incredibly delicious - I'd go back just to order that dish
This dish was the only real winner - and was way over the top with flavor
He ate half of it and was beading with sweat so beware that even a medium heat dish can get pretty hot
The chicken and vegies were fairly good a bit heavy on the cauliflower maybe but the sauce just tasted off - not like soy/garlic at all and was odd enough that I didn't finish the dish either
It wasn't flavorful - it didn't taste like I'd had it described - and it didn't compliment the rest of the dish
Rows and rows of all types of food products canned goods snacks nice meat and produce section baked goods huge frozen section deli clean and organized and fairly priced
The standout appetizer here is the chicken phyllo pakcet stuffed with a delicious mixture of chicken feta bell pepper and spinach baked in a flaky puff pastry
The pomegranate chicken is tasty but my favorite dish here by far is the inventive strawberry blueberry cashew salad -it's just a terrific explosion of different flavors
Had lots of chicken and came in a pretty good size
The food took a little longer than I would have liked but my husband's duck was very good
Pizzas are excellent as welll as the Hummas and their brand of chips
I've been here over 10+ times the last few months with girlfriends for Happy Hour or with my boyfriend on a weekend evening and I have always had outstanding service amazing food and awesome drinks that knock my socks off
My boyfriend did decide to take advantage of the offer though since again we came in starving and we enjoyed a delicious dessert
and her BF Jared for breakfast and the service and food were excellent
The short Clean comfortable casual environment; efficient service; and ample servings of really good food
Our waitress Helene was on point all night keeping our glasses bread basket tasty crisp-crusted jalapeno cheddar bread and brown bread and butter plate full and the food rolling at the perfect pace including asking us if we needed a breather before dessert we did
It was also another good chunk of meat very thick and on the bone
We love good Mexican food and won't be going back even though it is convenient it just wasn't very good
My waiter LaLo or something like that is as delicious as the food
OH did I mention the food is sooooo good you are going to want to move down the street just so you can walk there for all your meals
I find their food good but it's not really worth the trip or price
They had $1 mini pastor burritos I think as a European I have a hard time with Mexican food and what is called whatAlso had the $4 Margarita and was very good for the price
*burp*  Cripes this was some good food
fresh ingredients put together beautifully on a plate with inventive flavor combinations and pizzazz
Hungry kids waited an hour and a half to get Kraft mac-n-cheese and cold chicken strips
Only bad - the flavored sochu is pretty gross and overpriced and the dessert was waaaaaay to sour they replaced it
$350 for dinner but worth it for us and hey my wife doesn't even like Japanese food really
Ate at SWB food was good prices were in line with resort fare I guess
But on the bright side my friend got the fish and chips and they were very good
Although why I thought that there will be good food at a British pub is beyond me
* The brick toasts are wonderful and the other food usually comes in small portions so they're good for a snack
It took me a long time to decide on the perfect restaurant for us all to get together for some wonderful food and drinks
My drinks were verrrrrry weak my food was not flavorful or even displayed in an appetizing manner
The appetizers and dessert were good but not amazing
They serve delicious takes of Comfort Food
My skin crawls when I walk in the door because they are not too nice but I am all smiles when I eat tasty food
I recommend all of their food I also recommend you call it in unless you don't mind staff who are not to friendly and a really long wait
The southern rib basket was pretty good - the meat was tender & we like the pickles & onions that come with it
I will admit the food was pretty good although I really was craving the strawberries and cream cheese
It is a wonderful place to go if you're looking for a laid-back low-key atmosphere that doesn't skimp on the quality of food
I always enjoyed their endless salad soup starches and dessert and was skeptical of the new Field Kitchen experience
I'd recommend you go with a Pizza and Salad or Pizza and Bruschetta
The food did come almost immediately after we received our appetizer which the waitress apologized for
The meat was so tender and flavorful we really enjoyed it
It's worth supposedly 'oily' and 'tiny' food if you use the restroom's facilities
Food wise we split appetizers which was perfect for a night of drinking
We also got the chicken empanada a delightful and flavorful burst of tastiness on a crisp handcooked shell
My BF and I just happened to come here for dinner during restaurant week so I was happy to see the $30 prix fix menu for appetizer main meal dessert and sangria or soft drink
With full size appetizers we only ate half of our full sized main dishes
BF had to bring his dessert home although I pressed on to try the chocolate chile torte with the most amazing malt and coconut ice cream
I enjoyed all of the food but the big hits for me were the renowned pork pernil and the corn bread casserole thingy
Will go back next time I'm in Phoenix but will likely see if we can split a meal saving room for the excellent desserts
The burgers are properly cooked to order and the meat is flavorful and satisfying
It took a long time to get my order taken and my food was not hot when it was delivered it was sitting up there
50 while still satiating your craving for delicious pizza
They also serve an array of other good foods sandwiches wings cannoli
They always bring the food out quickly and the quality of their food doesn't waver
Nonetheless my Turkey Reuben and Chicken Liver sandwiches have been excellent
The date was pretty good and the food was better
Halibut - I love fish and this was a tasty tasty dish
ok I broke my no fried food in the sake of Yelp and the fries where really good
And the sauteed spinach was a wonderful side dish
Apparently for one set price per child they will be unlimited refills of drinks and food for the party~ which is perfect if you have teenagers who don't blink twice at having 10 hot dogs
We had a table laddened with hot dogs fries pizza popcorn potato chips~ talk about a kid's food heaven
It is a fun little place to go but won't impress someone who is more interested in atmosphere than in good food and company
We ended up with I wish I wrote down the actual names of the dishes Shrimp Tempura out of this world Cucumber Roll with this amazing plum sauce this tasty salmon roll with asparagus beef skewers and scallops that were AWESOME with this AWESOME mayonaise in the center
Everything was excellent from the menu to the food quality and presentation to the service
The tacos were excellent but my favorite was the pizza
I can only echo what others have said - cozy and trendy space unexpectedly diverse and reasonably priced menu good happy hour down to earth and friendly waitstaff good food
I know there are some people who will argue but for me this Thai basil is as good as it gets for Thai food in the valley
Their green curry is my favorite dish and they have a good range of spice to satisfy whatever mood I'm in or whatever wimp I'm with who can't handle the heat
In addition to their main courses they have excellent complimentary miso soup at lunch time and tasty spring rolls on the side of every dish
Its a great dessert that's delicious but not overly sweet on the tongue
The Indian School location is my favorite but at each location in the Valley you can find quality food and attentive friendly wait service
It makes for an enjoyable dish during those hot Phoenix summers
Pita Jungle is definitely a great place for lunch or a casual dinner with friends or just to eat out on your own and enjoy excellent food made with fresh ingredients
I didn't use the lobby bar or hotel food service so I can't comment on those services
I also thought the prices were fair and they surprisingly have a good selection of pastries desserts and even in-house sandwiches
What I was impressed with was that 1 the Manager/Owner/Proprietor came to the table to ask about the food and the service and 2 the waitress offered me another juice and then offered to give it to me in a glass to go no additional charge
Based on the yelp recommendations we made sure to share our dish since it sounded like you get quite a bit of food
We got the chicken olivea salad which is like a chicken/tuna/potato salad really tasty with our pita bread
We had the persian ice cream for dessert since we read so much good stuff about it
My friend and I were seated right away and since I had been drinking wine earlier in the night all I wanted was water and some delicious food
So on the menu the sandwich sounds pretty tasty roast beef bacon arugula and even a fried egg
So when I'm looking for amazing sushi I search far and low
The seemingly unusual combinations of meat and fruit were matched perfectly and the flavors are unbelievable
The Stir Fried Noodles were very good too but the real standout was the Kung Pao Soy Chicken
Mix that with a curry of your choice the goat and chicken tikka are particularly good and you're in as authentic a Pakistani restaurant as you're going to find in the Valley
Although it has a really good halaal kosher butcher shop and international food market attached to it it is really authentic
On quality and authenticity of food I would say the Matador is about average
She even asked me on a 1-5 scale how hot I wanted the food
On a good note they make tasty Chicken Parm
Needless to say it was a great time and the food was very good
D in us all you can never go wrong with margarita but for something a bit more unique we decided to get the biancoverde - ricatto cheese on pizza is always a good thing and the arugula piled on top only added to the deliciousness
One of the most important things for me in Mexican food is salsa and hot sauce
I can't speak to the food or other house beers but I may give it another shot when I'm back in town
The food was alright but everything was stone cold which was a bum out
Spring rolls weren't as good as I've had but did not skimp on the shrimp and were tasty enough
Prices are amazing and the food is ready super fast
the wife had the grilled fish tacos and she said they were very tasty
we will probably come back because the food and tequila's were good and the happy prices were reasonable
Nice touch Food Quality I have come to find they are quite fond of celery seed it's in everything except the deserts thank goodness
I eat here at least once a week and their food is always pretty amazing
It's just delicious greasy Mexican food at its best
I was in Glendale briefly and my friend who lives there took me here for some good ol' Asian food
but after seeing the extensive menu and tasting the yummy cold soba with its slippery goodness and surprisingly fresh for the desert sushi I was hooked
This is a fast food burger place for people that a willing to pay a little more for quality
My mom got a pepperoni mushroom onion pizza which was pretty good crunchy and full of flavor
The food was always fresh delicious and incredibly flavorful
It's an extremely tender meat that's heavy on the flavor and is a melt in your mouth type
While Coldstone and Garcia's are represented here you'd be better off going to the FBR Open to eat local food
All of the food came out cold overly sweet just not very good
I've always wanted to connect with my other nationality and good food is always a great way to do so
But I would immediately recommend it even to the guy who only trusts hot dogs and fried chicken
With regards to the food - order the crab cakes - I thought Maryland had great crab cakes until I ate at Eddie V's - simply amazing
Although not on the online menu I would highly recommend the Swordfish served with diced tomatoes onions and avacado in a vinegar sauce
my MIL got a shredded beef chimi which was huge and stuffed with meat but she wasn't impressed
The service has always been wonderful the sushi very fresh with beautiful presentation
Really good deal for all the food that I got
The sushi was fresh the salmon melted in your mouth but beyond that the service was excellent
The Shimogamo roll that is on the menu was amazing
We were surprised with a great peanut butter/chocolate dessert which was close your eye and enjoy good
We made a pretty quick decision on a basic salad and a nice pizza and I don't know if it was hunger or really just delicious pizza but we managed to kill that food in no time
The location makes it fun and a little touristy but the food is definitely worth it
Feel sorry for the kitchen since cold food and long waits clearly aren't their issue
I had an omlete with veggies which was good the hubby had the special chicken fried steak with biscutis and gravy which he said was awful and my girls had pancakes with sausage and bacon
It's hard to find good mexican food here in Arizona I'm from California where it runs rampant but they have delicious food
Yes the place is a dive and the line can be long but the amazing authentic Mexican food and incredibly cheap prices more than makes up for it
Then I realized there was no salt or pepper on our table so instead of letting my food get cold while I waited for our server to reappear I asked the table next to us if we could borrow theirs
I was in absolute shock that nobody offered us a complimentary beverage appetizer or dessert for the horrible serve we received which they were completely aware of considering how they kept apologizing
I loved that the meal doesn't start out with any old bread basket but one with a delicious roll yummy cinnamon-sugar toast and excellent banana bread
I had asian wheat noodles with chicken I don't remember the name of the dish and it was very tasty
Delicious and fresh food was somehow overshadowed by outstanding service
The house sandwich and meatball sub was amazing
but the food was excellent and the prices were great
The pasta was light and flavorful with big pieces of white meat chicken and tons of yummy capers
The vinaigrette on the salad was really good and he said the pizza crust was excellent
The food came out within minutes and was hot tasty and in large proportions
The Fish Tacos I had were fresh and delicious
Better pizza than Little Caesar's less greasy than Pizza Hut and about the same quality as Dominoe's pizza
Not leave them out for everyone to see that your not keeping your seafood cold and just letting it go south
I was very impressed with the creative delicious meals and desserts
The dishes are a little pricey but I am willing to pay because I know that a lot of effort time and quality ingredients go into making this type of food
I absolutely LOVE Lalibela and it is quickly becoming one of my favorite stops for delicious vegetarian food
Imagine taking a perfectly good-but-not-fantastic from an uber-Americanized semi-fast food Asian-style restaurant like Pei Wei
It's filled wiht tons of Asian staples an entire aisle of different noodles and a pretty good meat/fish window
The menu isn't so extensive that you lose quality in food
Chicken enchilada was pretty good and seemed to have s lot of pepper seasoning
The food is quality the location has been around forever but keeps fresh with awesome and unique decor like a life size tractor and lots of space outside for families with kids to go crazy
Let's start with the good super fresh baked bread for sandwiches soup bread bowls are a different story Boarshead meats which is superior quality and excellent soups seriously try the baked potato
The spring rolls are prepared daily and are offered as appetizers
One warning  My unadventurous Midwestern meat-n-potatoes parents were unimpressed and confused by Asian style sandwiches
Although the waiter at first brought a hard taco when I had asked for soft the chicken taco was probably the best part of the meal with juicy and flavorful chicken
I would definitely recommend this place look for traditional Chinese food in the area
i also had the cilantro-jalapino hummus very very tasty i tried some of the chicken meditteranian salad it was ok and i had spankopia to die for service was a little long but we had a big party not to mention it was a Saturday night but stillother than that it was GREAT
The happy hour prices are very good though the rolls on the happy hour menu are pretty basic
When it comes to higher end quality pizza and pasta in town this is up there on my list
It's mainly getting 4 stars for food quality and lack of wait time
After looking at the menu for a good while I decided to build my own pizza choosing the wild mushrooms locally made sausage garlic and spinach
The store has a great selection of fresh products gourmet food and good quality staple items for cooking
The food it self is quite good both the noodle dish and the veggie pho I had were great was was the veggie spring roll
My wife had the cold noodle with grilled beef and chicken eggroll item B4 the grilled beef and the chicken eggroll tasted good but the nouc mam sauce was a bit on the watery side
And the pizza too was good but not memorable
3 Hmmm price has gone up like everything else and the meat still seemed like quality beef but did ya have to shrink the size of the burgers
We created our own pizza with spinach artichoke and feta and it was a very good creation if I don't say so myself
Along the way he recommended several of their dishes
My pizza came out first and it was pretty delicious
I recommend beef-jerky and cheetos let your white-trash junkfood flag fly
Everyone who works here is wonderful as well and very patience while you ask numerous questions about the food
The quality of the food has gone down quite a lot this past year
Pizza is one of those things like hot dogs and certain other foods that some people feel they have to make sweeping claims that the style they know/prefer is the best and anything else is unacceptable
But PLEASE don't come back with any reviews whining that their pizza isn't as good as Domino's or that it's not deep dish
I was lured by friends family YELP reviews and their website who all said the tour samples and food were excellent
I got the 1/2 sandwich and 1/2 salad chix ceasar - was 'eh' as well* dessert bruschetta honey marscapone & nutella - excellent
You probably get excited when you read the menu and think how wonderful the food is but I just didn't think it was all that great
I first compared the look and quality of the food to Whole Foods Market
There's also a hot food deli section which looked good
Their homemade french fries are very good and the catfish they just added to the menu is the best I've ever had
If you don't know what it is because I didn't made from a classic recipe unique to Galway in the west of Ireland Boxtys are a delicious potato based grilled pancake dish
Good Chinese food is hard to find in PHX
Okay back to the food; you gotta order from the Chinese menu; not to say the Gwy-lo menu is not good
I have tried many different food items here and they were all super flavorful
I'm a cheese crisp fanatic almost as much as I frenzy over good chicken wings
What's good Mexican food without a mainstay like Sour Cream Enchiladas $8
The Famous Spaghetti and  Meatballs were recommended to me and so I had to partake mostly because there were a lot of really tasty looking items on the menu and the fact that the meatballs were top recommendation made me raise and eye brow
The GoodInteresting menuPretty good foodNice decorThe BadSlow service if it's even slightly busyCoffee is not good at allInconsistency
Apart from bad service the food was not good
A full menu selection of delicious food available late at night
The meats were good but how much meat can you eat
The salad bar was nice and I thought the cold meats and cheeses there were a nice touch but really hard to eat that much food in one sitting
The beef was fantastic quality and the patty was a good size but not one of those we'll-give-you-a-huge-burger-so-your-gut-hurts-afterward burgers
The seats are just fine and their chicken wings with hot sauce are the best
I tried the Kung Pao Beef today and while it could have been a little spicier the ingredients were ultra fresh and delicious
For dessert the baklava while awesome with complex flavors and textures was a little heavy and a little oily on the bottom and served with whipped cream which I could have done without
Prices are'nt too bad but when you never know if the food will be good or not it's just not worth it anymore
The food is basically the same and the service is excellent
The dish came with two small garlic breadsticks which were a tasty addition to the pasta dish
Pork was pretty good meatballs were amazing and the chicken cordon bleu was delish
Worst customer service I have ever experienced - unfortunate because the food was really good
Other yelpers have done a great job describing the restaurant so I'll skip that and make some food recommendations
It can easily serve 2 especially if you enjoy some of the amazing side dishes like potatoes au gratin grilled asparagus and the most amazing legendary Alaskan king crab gnocchi
We had pizza and pasta and both were absolutely amazing
Normally I salt and cheese my pizza but I ate this straight up no flavorings
I loved the restaurant itself but honestly I was not completely impressed with the food
We split an appetizer a pasta dish and an entree
Gnocchi with Creamy Gorgonzola Sauce - This dish resulted in a good news/bad news situation
The chicken was wonderful; very moist and the sauce was great
Overall Grade = B GoodThe EV Foodie
Instead head a block over to The Roosevelt for some good beer on tap and some pretty good food
The chicken itself should be rated at 3 stars but thanks to the amount of flavors they have it bumps the review up to 4
The pizza tasted good but the texture is accommodating to those who prefer a thick and doughy crust
As the only customers left in this adorably quaint establishment decor including a chalkboard wall we were wonderfully entertained by the chef and his enthusiasm for French cooking - giving tips to my friend and discussing his ability to accommodate private parties who love his food
The decor in this restaurant is amazing as the food - just being here makes me feel like a hep chick
Food is pretty good and so are their sushi
I don't claim to really know much or anything about good friend chicken but I know this is among the best I can remember having
My boyfriend had the Seafood and Corn Chowder and that was tasty as well he really enjoyed it
It was cooked perfectly on a wood grill and you could really taste the smoky flavor and the fish was like butter it just melted in your mouth
Our last course was of course dessert and I had the panna catta and it was very light and creamy and omg it was so good
You could tell he has a true passion for the restaurant and the food they were serving and he did an excellent job presenting each course to us
This is the place to come for specialty items or take home hot meals cold salads and some amazing desserts beers and wines
they consistently have a wonderful choice of prepared food to choose from
The food here is good but on the pricey end so only come here if you're planning on dipping into the pocket book but it's definitely worth every penny
So while this isn't the latest and greatest place to hit town it's one of the oldest and is filled with history great food an amazing view ambiance and it's the perfect place for brunch or dinner
For a second choice True Food was pretty good
The shrimp dumplings appetizer you get 6 were also very tasty as was the chicken pizza that our guests had
The food was good I only didn't like the Hell's Fire Chips as much because I'm not a huge fan of bleu cheese
So good bar food is very important in the grand scheme of things
While good bar food isn't always the case Monkey Pants in Tempe makes a strong case for a nice meal when you are close to hanging over a toilet
I would recommend Monkey Pants for anyone in the mood for a good environment nice food and fun service
Both egg dishes were tasty and the redskin potatoes were excellent
Rest  assured the food is consistently amazing It's just the service
The actual patty itself was pretty good tasted more like a chicken patty then a burger but whatever
The food was all right but nothing tasted so good that I wanted any more of it
This is a little bistro that sells salads made to your specs sandwiches the way you choose and another version of not real pizza but it tastes good also served the way you want it
It's one of our favorite places as we enjoy good authentic Italian food
The wait is well worth the experience ESPECIALLY if you're a foodie
I respect a place that shows the calories and fat in their dishes and gives people options to enjoy good food that is healthier than the usual lard loaded calorie disguised foods
I went for the Voodoo chicken salad and was so impressed and thought it was absolutely delicious
The chicken was moist and flavorful the sauce was tasty and not overdone
BBD is supposed to be known for their desserts and they do look good but the blackberry pie that I took home was more than a little tart and the crust was on the tough side
the chicken katsu is deliciously crispy and sliced super thin so its easy to eat on the go
The dish is a little heavy on the sauce but overall its pretty good
It was a tad on the pricey side probably because it's in a hotel but the food and coffee were delicious with generous portions
On the ride home that's what me and my friends talked about how we just ate some of the most tender and delicious food for under $5
The service was so friendly the food was delicious and the atmosphere was so peaceful
All of the food tasted so fresh so good
Also ordered the Ginger Balti Chicken and Tikka Masala Chicken and on both dishes the chicken was tender and juicy though the ginger chicken was great & full of flavor I just couldn't get enough of the Tikki Masala
Let me let you in on a secret-- they ARE hot-- and I like really spicy food
Here's my summary she didn't know her alcohol she didn't check the quality or quantity of my food order and she generally seemed to have the attention span of a moth
I can't believe I've waited so long to review the Roosevelt as it is everything I look for in a bar amazing beers and a significant wine list  great food  friendly staff and a crowded yet comfortable vibe
As with his breakfast joint the emphasis here is on familiar yet high quality comfort food - hot pretzels roast beef sandwiches franks and beans grilled cheese and tomato soups with a gourmet twist
The food is well prepared and worth the trip
We ordered the chips and salsa $1 based on Calamari's recommendation which was wise as the food did take a while
The masa of the green corn tamale was tasty but the chicken filling was on the dry side so we were definitely grateful for the spicey green sauce
Although there's only counter seating and no ambience the food is totally authentic and kick-ass tasty
The food was really flavorful but after seeing the same chef routing more than 5 or 6 times it loses it's luster
Good soul food is hard to find in the desert and when you find one you have to savor it
But the owners are friendly the price is reasonable and the food is well worth the trip even if your taste buds know better
As far as I could tell everyone at the wine dinner had an amazing time and enjoyed the food immensely
For the 14+ years I've lived here Cuban food restaurant options have been few and far between and Mimita's is a good local option
Those who are Cuban and/or create Cuban food were busy cooking yet those serving the customer knew the menu well inquired to any likes/dislikes and made good suggestions
The food is overpriced in my opinion but its good
Good food decent price and a southwestern atmosphere
Now I've had better nutella/banana desserts elsewhere but this was still a tasty morsel
He usually gets the bobka crumb french toast which I would classify more as dessert it is so sweet but so delicious
I normally do not like buffet food that has been sitting under a heat lamp for any length of time but if you arrive early at 1100 when they first open there is a good chance your buffet food experience will be a good one
My personal favorites here are the Tandoori Chicken Chicken Korma Palak Paneer Chicken Tikka Masala and the Garlic Naan bread if your into Indian beers you will like the fact they have Taj Mahal and Flying Horse Royal Lager beer I normally drink the hot chai tea
At least that sauce actually tastes good and fits with bbq meat
The Crunch Roll is superb the salad dressing is addictive and the chicken noodle udon soup is delicious
It's a shame that the food quality has degraded over time
The food was still good but the service was horrible
The pizza is good I tried a slice from The Boys plate and The Wife said the chicken pesto was excellent
It was not that the food was bad however if you can't be seated right away it's not worth the wait
The beef was good quality but not incredibly flavorful and the burger overall was bland
* House Special Their signature pizza loaded with flavor and freshness with Pepperoni sausage ground beef onions green peppers mushrooms black olives tomatoes ham bacon and of course extra cheese
Neither my guest or I were blown away by the favors of the food but the drink menu and atmosphere were wonderful
First the foodWe split a caprese salad had the wonderful bread basket love the pretzel rolls split a chefs cut 20oz
Although I only visited the Vig for brunch I was pretty happy with their overall menu food quality and service
However since it doesn't come with any cheese or sauce the yolk from the eggs on top boost up the dish by a factor of 10 and make it an amazing hearty yet healthy meal
The food is very delicious and well priced
I ordered garlic chicken and vegetables - very flavorful and a good size for the price actually it was too much for just me to finish so I had to take it home - I'm a 5'4 petite female
Oh and did I mention the amazing ice cream cake option for dessert
The Curry Chicken was very good and no doubt about it I would get it again
I'm not gonna lie the two sushi rolls I ordered for takeout were delicious
They were americanized sushi but the fish was fresh and quality was apparent
I ordered the crab cake for my 1st course and it was goodbut hey it's contending with Crab cakes I've had in Maui at Mama's Fish house and it just cannot contend
Excellent cut of meat tasted like steak but for me the glaze was a little salty
We have good food here in San Francisco but this place stole my heart for some reason
However I think those two things are mostly because I always go there at night RIGHT before they close Yea I'm THAT customer However food's great I highly recommend it and I'm going there right when I get back in August FACT
The pilav was good but I thought the mousakka was very greasy and I could only finish half and I skipped dessert
While all of its desserts are excellent the shop is most famous for its ice cream cookie sandwiches
The food was not mouth water or jaw dropping GOOD
In every case the fried food had that really dark brown quality indicating the fryer oil should have been changed after the lunch rush earlier that day
But at the end of the day the real issue was the quality of the food--poor to marginal
I like energy and fun but if they say good food it should be better than Denny's
Flavorful juicy tender shredded chicken and a very fresh and crispy flour tortilla
Tuna crunch roll even with the krab tasted good but the tune was sliced very thin
The complimentary buttery rolls are huge and I had to force myself to not eat more than two because they are so good
The food looked good; people have complained about the prices but why are you going to a coffee place for food
The staff was cool and I don't think it's fair to blame them for the quality of the food
I always order the chicken fried steak and it's VERY good
The Cinnamon roll is delicious and HUGE
Both times I was treated to hard stale bread bland meat flavorless jus burnt greasy fries
The Pizza Cookie is a tasty desert but since it's usually shared it's made from a 1/2 pound of cookie dough it gets messy looking fast
Erin's Fajita salad was similarly lack luster  with  all the appearance of being tasty yet   bland chicken
My next visit was a lunch with my mother a few days later and we ate mostly non-sushi offerings which were also very good
Huge chunks of chicken breast cabbage that wasn't overcooked or undercooked - and was really flavorful the crepes were nicely thin and tasty
Nevertheless it was very tasty on account of the melding of the delicious meat with the perfectly warmed and toasted-in-certain-spots pita
I would highly recommend going to Jade Bar after a food coma dinner
The food is always so fresh and smoking hot when it hits the table and most importantly
This is a staple for friends from out of town that I preface with Oh you think you have good Mexican food in blank
Everything here is good but I especially recommend anything that has the chile beef the green is a little spicier than the red but neither is overbearing
Portion size is fantastic and food served hot and fresh
Overall the food is good great kids menu and great happy hour
It's pretty cool that they have the back wall covered in aquariums where you can see the live fish that much is probably worth the trip if you've never been
The food quality is always top notch and the selection is usually quite good
The bean curd and pork dishes have always been fantastic and their several varying dim sum offerings with shrimp are consistently fresh and absolutely delicious
Another thing the do very well here is the tea it is always a perfect match for the dim sum and works great to clear the pallet and balance out the flavor in the food
The meat was good but just no flavor really
Either way the food was very fresh and flavorful minus the beef in my taco
Prices were good for the amount of food you get
New Mexico food is amazingly delicious and this place is a joke if they think they're making New Mexico food
Some of the food is good most is merely so-so
The carne torta gets a definite thumbs up but I can't recommend this place on the basis of one dish
I'm from Chicago so deep dish is where it's at though that doesn't mean I lack the ability to appreciate a good slice when I have one no matter the style
But pizza is pizza and good pizza is easy to recognize
This place is so hyped-up it's difficult not to expect some very delicious food so as you can tell by my rating it did not meet expectations
Speaking of the food we ordered an appetizer of prosciutto wrapped asparagus with mozzarella cheese
Maybe I'm not hip to how they do it in Italy but I'm not a fan of carbon-flavored pizza crust which all of our pizzas were
The caveat though is that you need to support these star ingredients fresh cheeses and veggies and meats with some good spices or at least aromas both of which were M
In all actuality you could take a pizza-cooking class swing by the store on your way home pick up some fresh ingredients and cook the thing yourself and add your own flavors to boot in the same amount of time you would wait sit down eat and leave
The rush of flavors savory well cooked meats and impeccable arrangements it was a taste of heaven AGAIN
Being so impressed with everything we decided to do two desserts
I have seriously not been this impressed with everything from service to food to drinks in who knows how long
The appetizer also came with a small bowl of warm queso cheese with some meat crumbles sprinkled on top
It was the perfect evening to catch a breeze and watch the crowd below while enjoying good company and good food at a perfectly good bar
Friendly wait staff good food decent prices and close to the Scottsdale Gun Club where my friend and I like to go shooting
I especially enjoyed my fish taco's as it is hard to find a place that makes good ones
The food was amazingly tasty as usual and all five of us were really happy with the meal and the service it was just way way too cold
Not a good pace to the meal a bit frustratingFood Quality 5/5- I had no issues here
We tried several items and they were all very good qualityFood Quantity 3/5- this was a bit of a mixed bag
The sashimi and sushi rolls were a good portion size- this rating may change as I go back to try other things
Sushi Rolls - we had several and they were all very tasty and decent size
I just moved here a couple months ago from NJ where there's a pizza shop on every block and this was the closest one in quality to the ones back home
Their Chicken Parm sandwich was very tasty as well though not as good as the ones back home
I mean the place is nasty and the staff looks like they would really like to be someplace else but the pizza and calzone were really really good
I'm not big on sweet flavors combined with meats so
There was a rep for one of the lines of cat food and she explained some of the better brands and really taught us some good information and helped us get food that would best suit our new cat
The reviews said corned beef hash was good and I'm a huge fan of that so I ordered that
Taco del Mar is a block from my office--one starThey're always friendly and get my order right--two starsToday the person behind the counter recommended a great burrito--three starsThey offer a wide variety of average Mexican faire at reasonable prices--four starsSome people may not agree with me but Taco del Mar is what it is fast food
Margharita Flatbread light and good and the Meatballs w/ Polenta great but slightly salty with two iced teas and a gin/tonic our bill was $21
nice and tangy  brisket very good and the mini me had chicken and macaroni and cheese which she enjoyed
Maybe it was because I ordered takeout that everything suffered but for as good as their food and service is while eating there I assumed it would be the same
Their one saving grace was that the food was still hot when I came home
They get major points for delicious food with limited kitchen capabilities for a really cool vibe and for the best beer and drink list that I know of in all of Phoenix
This restaurant proves the theory that good food in Phoenix sells no matter what the location
Myself and companion started out with the chicken liver pate and the appetizer special of the night a pork belly enchilada
Food The Penne Marinara was not spicy but it was good said the daughter
We grabbed two sushi rolls for appetizer one crunchy roll and a spicy yellow-tail
The general manager left and won't be replaced I'm told along with their best bartender and the food quality has absolutely tanked as in toilet
They're friendly  reasonably priced and the food is always delicious
My husband and I have tried a number of their items but my personal favorites are the BBQ pork appetizer house fried rice the mushu and lemon chicken
One of the things that is so wonderful about this place is the food isn't heavy
When I get delivery the food is still hot and tastes like it was made just a few minutes earlier
We than moved  on to the spicy tuna roll which is made just with Sriracha and doesn't have any mayonnaise to mask the flavor of the fish
We then asked the sushi chef for his recommendation and he made us an order of albacore tuna sushi with a miso mustard sauce on it
Got a Pink Bikini Martini which was good Hawaiian Ceviche which was awesome nice chucks of fish yummy
I would mos def go back to this place good food good ambience great place to go just chill out
He knows good fried chicken and raves about it here it's almost better than his
If you are feeling a pizza but can't make up your mind the pinwheel pizza mixes up 4 choices so that is always good
Again I would consider this a great option before a game especially because of the atmosphere mixed with pretty good food
A good place if in the area for Italian food but I wouldn't say somewhere that one would go out of their way for chain restaraunts usually aren't
However the staff was very friendly and the food is excellent
But the food is truly amazing and I will definitely be going back
It took an hour and the pizza guy went to the wrong Radisson hotel
Nothing to write home to your Mother about but the food is good and the service was excellent
Prices are reasonable food is good and everything is clean
However the biscuits were super delicious really fresh and puffy on the inside with a slight hardened outside dunked with the white sausage gravy and life was good  I also had a bite of my buddies Chicken & Dumplings which honestly tasted really close to a home made casserole and the chicken was a bit dry guess I'm glad I didn't order it  I guess I missed out on their breakfast menu so I'm definitely going to have to try out their breakfast next time I'm in town
We also wondered if we shot ourselves in the foot ordering the pizza and wine deal at 700 PM when we could have waited until 9 and had half price bottles ALL NIGHT LONG
I definitely had to agree it definitely was pretty tasty chinese fast food
the noodle dish i ordered was full of flavor and spicy
We both ordered our food HOT but were given what I describe as Hot for Americans i
The summer chicken quesadilla is really good as well
The mushroom dish was very tasty not too much spice and it paired well with locally produced Cider Mills Vanilla Cream Soda
There is an attached small market full of spices and exotics foods and flavored tobaccos for those under 21 who seek a vice
Been a customer of the original Pita Jungle in Tempe since it opened service was always so-so but you got a good deal of good food for a fair price
It's always good to gauge a new restaurant by standard staples of the cuisine that's why my first orders at pizza places are pepperoni etc
First off - don't let the low prices fool you - the food is DAMN GOOD
I mean for Chinese fast food that will deliver to your house this is about as good as you can expect
I tried their classic pepperoni pizza and their southwest deep fried ravioli appetizer
I proud to announce the mustardish sauce on the Steak Frites brought him back to mustard no small feat  The steak tartare was excellent the french little bread was a bit dry and needed something maybe a flavored butter
The desserts were limited but the apple desert was excellent
All in all an excellent afternoon with a rare limited release craft beer some free pizza and tasty mead
Food made screamingly fast can really wreck the end product so please I know you need me at the cash register and out of your way for the next customer but for the love of Grog take your time and let's work on First Quality
Our favorites are the kale salad with chicken a side of the butternut squash w/ ketchup & that onion/garlic cheese tart as an appetizer
Then you realize if you want to eat a full service sit down meal head to the left - we didn't want to do this but the food that I was eyeing from afar looked good
We will definitely be back for the food and I totally recommend this place for grabbing some freshly baked bagels or desserts or whatever
The food has potential based on the quality of ingredients
Room For Improvement They need more contrast of flavors in their dishes
My favorite is the meatball sub for something like $5 you get about a 1 foot long sub on soft fresh italian bread with several delicious meat balls smothered in marinara and garnished with a couple peperoncini's and tomatoes really the perfect lunch
To add insult to injury the food was cold
Delux boasts a fresh and clean aesthetic in the design of the space and the quality of its food
Known for their burgers Delux also serves many other sandwiches and paninis including a chicken panini a grilled cheese version and a vegetarian paninichock-full of deliciousness
But I think what really sets Delux apart as a destination more than just a place with tasty food is the design
The food is hearty and has good flavor
I wish they had more salad options on the menu only 3 but all of the other dishes I have tried have been very good
Everyone knows you don't want to eat food at a place where nobody from that culture eats so it is a good sign when you see a lot of Mexican folks eating at a place during lunch
There's no need for side dishes or appetizer breads or anything since every delicious bite you need comes wrapped up neatly in an egg-brushed pastry pocket fresh out of the oven
I have been to four locations around the Valley and each one makes excellent thin crust coal burning oven pizza
All in all it is better than most fast food but really isn't worth it for the price you pay
Is this what desert dwellers consider good sushi
After tasting the dish which tasted like fried water I understood why they thought the edamame was so good
I love Postino for providing a great place to be with friends wine and great food at an excellent price on a Monday or Tuesday night
The steak and eggs $15 features a good cut of meat I think it's a flank steak 2 eggs anyway you want them with corn salsa and toast and potatoes
We ordered 2 appetizers nachos with chicken and fried pickles
the food was good the ambiance good - but
But the service was lacking - for this level of restaurant you expect exceptional service - and frankly this caliber of food can be found elsewhere with good service and more reasonable prices
Our thoughts - so you took an extra forty minutes to seat us - when we had a reservation and now you want us to leave your table and you couldn't come up with a more tactful method of asking us to leave note - it was 930/945 at this time we had been at the table for about two hours had a full meal drinks appetizers entrees dessert second drinks - which equates to a full check and a hefty tip
But we have concluded 1 Rokerij does offer good food - but they are slightly over priced for the quality 2 the professionalism was seriously lacking in service presentation of the wine list focused on the price and not the taste pallets and 3 they should get their ego in check - I get that you have a long list of people waiting for tables at your restaurant - but the next time I have a special event I will be going to one of the dozens of restaurants in the valley and receive the level of service that should come with the ambiance and food
TLC may not look like much from the outside it sits in a far corner of a strip mall and it's got a tiny little storefront and sign but it's a fast-casual concept with moderate prices friendly service and pretty good Vietnamese food too
If dining in I recommend going with the Tea Lite Special which allows you to sample one spring roll two egg rolls and your choice of chicken or beef pho soup for just $8
My son had an enchilada in red sauce which was four-star worthy my wife had a crispy chicken taco that was very good
Food was hot when I picked it up and was fine
The last dish looks like ordinary fried chicken breast but the sauce for it was very complex and tasty with scallion floating around in it
extra spicy with chicken usually a large portion for a very good price and a Singha
The sauce was nicely balanced not too sweet or overwhelming and each bite of delicious noodles was complimented with egg tofu or chicken
Having said that the food is so good we come back anyway
The food was very good worthy of another visit
We really really enjoyed our stay but the food and the pools really surprised us for a five star place
The guys handing you your food are almost always stoned so they know a good burrito when they're making it
The tandoori chicken was also bland with absolutely no flavor
Another big disappointment was the Gulab Jamun dessert which was ice cold
Well lets just say I'm not impressed and I will go back one more time to try dim sum but so far this place has pretty average food and mostly tastes like it comes out of a mix
The dinning room is large and utilitarian but not very fancy but that don't make food good either LOL
I think they have a pretty good selection of meats and veggies and  yes sometimes it's a little messy but I would say they are usually on top of making sure the counters are clean
I never packed my bowl the way I do now and if anything probably got less food because I didn't feel like I had to get my money's worth
I love Mexican food and these people do it with a unique flare that is worth checking out
My mom and I went for lunch before happy hour and they had nice lunch specials with a good amount of food for a reasonable price
My second favorite was the Thai Tea Truffle mainly because at first you didn't notice the tea flavor and suddenly on an inhale the flavor completely permeated around my mouth
The caramel sushi while still tasty was only a miniature rice crispy with thick albeit good caramel on top
The food is reasonably priced and excellent
The flavors are unexpected making the food a treat for anyone unaccustomed to it
Everything was super good but it was too much food
The quality of this over-priced food was sub-par at best
Chinese food has become so Americanized that it's easy to forget or never know about the flavors and preparation styles that characterize authentic and regionally-specific Chinese food
A few months ago I had a great experience learning about authentic Sichuan from Helen Y when she invited me to join her at Szechwan Palace in the Chinese Cultural Center and this past weekend she invited my husband and me along with some other very fortunate Yelpers including David S B Jason W and Alexander C to eat some more amazing and authentic Chinese at Lao Ching Hing according to her review their Chinese menu features mostly Shanghainese food with some Sichuan dishes and a few Cantonese dishes
So that you are able to order some more authentic items I'll give you a breakdown of what Helen ordered for us off the Chinese menu which she has so generously translated and posted to the business info section of this review *Cold jellyfish in scallion oil - This had a nice semi-chewy texture reminded me of octupus and a vinegary sauce
*Wok-fried rice cakes - Little oval noodles same texture as Chow Fun in a savory light sauce with fresh crunchy vegetables*1/2 crispy duck - Tender meat with crispy skin; served with Hoisin sauce*Ants Climbing Up a Tree - Unusual name but tasty dish
*Beef tendon and tripe in scallion oil - I wasn't wild about the texture but the spicy sauce was really savory and flavorful
*Green onion pancake - This has always been one of my favorite authentic Chinese dishes and has a wonderful mealy texture
One note - nothing we got was ridiculously spicy but the chili sauce that comes on the table allows you to spice everything to taste and added flavor and not just mind-numbing heat to every dish I tried
The prices are fair and you get a lot of good fresh food for your money
I've only had sushi here so I don't know what the other food is like but the other tables had non-sushi meals and they looked good big portions
Not only is the service good but the food is amazing
Say Nah Like the famous sunglasses kid Let's go to Mi Patio and have some fantastic food amazing service and keep drinking to boot
Four Peaks is an excellent establishment because they have wonderful food a very robust beer selection brewed on site and incredible atmosphere
The meatball parm sub is really tasty and toasted just the right amount
The sauce is thick and tasty but not enough to overpower the delectable orbs of meat
Had the Chicken Noodle pho and although tasty never really figured out what the fuss is all about
Anyway the food was awesome- they do breakfast all day so I got huevos rancheros which were really good
By the way the price was very reasonable before the tip we paid about $35 for our half of the appetizer 2 meals a soda 2 beers 2 side dished and dessert
Plus crazy good dishes like the Curry Catfish with Black Pepper Sauce served on a sizzling plate for two come with rice and lettuce for wrapping as well
Favorites of mine are the Summer Rolls with tasty shrimp and bits of grilled beef Bun with Grilled Pork the Pho with Meatballs and the Caramelized Catfish
One important thing to note though the waiters are perennially friendly and bustling and the owner/chef is fabulous this is not the place to make special recommendations or changes to the dishes
Just order and enjoy the food truly is so good you shouldn't have to make special requests as it is
The food was quite tasty and the service was excellent
Definitely a pricer place to get dinner but the food is excellent
My sister's chicken breast was tasty and my brother in-law liked his pork chop
I have only eaten there a few times but each time the food was delicious
The place isn't easy on the eyes but the food is well worth it
On walking in I noticed that the choice of sanwiches was compact which was good I had only a few things to choose from beef sausage or egg and some combination of these
This place is the full package the location decor and menu are perfect for an evening of relaxation good drinks and great food
The pla aka jungle princess and panang chicken curry are a few of our favorites but to be fair everything I've tasted has been as good or better than any other Thai spot we've been to and we've been to many
After over 10 minutes a sushi chef went into the kitchen trying to get the shrimp heads - someone in the kitchen threw hot food at him hitting him in the head
The burger I had here was good the chicken sandwich was pretty good too
The meat has great flavor from the charcoal and mesquite and you can get a 1/3 lb Big Juan and still have change from a 5
But the fish tacos that came highly recommended were very bad
The nachos were good but covered in beef so I had to eat them very carefully
Great ambiance friendly service and delicious food
We usually skip dessert but since we were having such a great time we splurged for the turtle of amazingness
The beef taco was good and the ground beef enchilada wasn't too bad either
I ordered the appetizer of baked eggplant for my main dish
for dessert we had the chocolate pudding and the bluberry shortcake- both amazingly sweet and decadent
The svedka cherry limeade cocktail was good as suggested but most of the food fell short of even bein ok
My first dish of tuna in ponzu with togarashi was good but the tuna hand roll was klunky and unseasoned
My friends enjoyed it so much we hit it up for lunch the next day and to our surprise $6 pizzas
Shared a seafood dish which was pretty good but what really stood out was the tofu
I got something similar to drunken noodles and it was so good and the beef was super tender
I think the prices are really good for the food
Overall great Indian food for a good price - will def return
This places serves sushi and other goodies on a conveyor belt that goes around the entire restaurant
Sushi was good for the price but not spectacular
We found the rainbow roll with salmon tuna and yellow tail to be very good
I tend to eat vegetarian dishes most of the time and can definitely say I've had my fair share of non-meat dishes with no flavor
The food quality service management attentiveness was absolutley non-existent
Some of the dishes could have been good if they were served hot and on time
The Sea Bass was extremely salty the Moroccan Chicken was cold and the medium rare lamb chops were well done
Not only is the food very good the portions are larger than the average serving
This place has always had good food and good service but in the past the service has been sort of slow when I've dined there during the lunch hour with larger groups
The food was excellent the server was polite and attentive and two different workers were constantly refilling drinks
Both dishes were very flavorful but the pork dish came in a bit less warm than we expected and if only there was more juice/soup in that curry we wouldn't have to dig for it
But overall the food was really good and excellent services
It is julienned pork in a wonderful sauce that DOES NOT  have any fish flavor or smell at all
Sichuan food is a bit oily which is authentic a chile oil to warm them since in the west up in the mountains that lead up to Tibet known as the Gateway to Tibet where the winters are very cold
Overall the meat is fresh not served frozen and the vegetable section is quite good
We've been here three times now and two times I've ordered the hot roast beef sandwich
Let me just say that the food was very good
And their pizza cookie is excellent as well
The food is good and the service is getting sooooo much better but what is the deal with the Jazz trio IN the restaurant
Mind you I grew up with a father who would make homemade gourmet pizzas that were super super good still my favorite pizza
The food was inventive and very very tasty
Great atmosphere friendly welcoming workers and of course delicious food
As we sat and enjoyed our early desserts I noticed that Cold Stone has really expanded their menu
Yes individual fried chicken wings were available & delicious
Never once apologized and to top it off the roll I had ordered was not good once I got mine when everyone else had already finished eating
I have enjoyed all the food I have tried like 80% of the menu
We stared with the baked chicken wings and it tasted hot and fresh
The tomatoes and their sauce was a great fusion of flavors despite not having any meat
Service is splotchy C+ never even knew my servers name and the food is good B
I used to go to a pretty good one in San Francisco back in the day so it was nice to see another conveyor belt sushi place
While the food is still just as good they goofed on my order and it took awhile to bring it all out despite not nearly being as crowded as the Sedona location
The food is good the bartenders are generous and it is just alot of fun
Pure eggplant flavor with a dash of spice for a perfect dish
I was not impressed with the food of the cleanliness or the service here
The food was great the portions were good and the price was fabulous
I decided on the meatball dish and man were those balls meaty and the Moroccan spiced sauce was delicious
Some of the dishes I've had were good some not
I progessed on to the Hot Pot I may have already mentioned its deliciousness and even got as far as dessert
From the meat to the dairy its all good
The deli selection is top quality and you will find meats from around the world here; cheeses too
they don't have a ton of options but the food they serve up is fresh and top quality
Other rolls covered with flavorful avocado slivers and topped with tempura were pretty nice
Their ambiance and menu wowed me by encompassing all of my seafood eating requirements FRESH sea creatures delicious sides impeccable service and a fancy but not stuffy atmosphere
For our appetizer we both ordered the Pacific Ahi Tuna Crudo a dish similar to Ahi Carpaccio and I can honestly say it's the best I've ever tasted
Just a squeeze of lemon and dash of hot sauce was all they needed to be a perfect starter dish for the meal
* Butternut Squash Cannelloni - We were debating on having room for this dish but it sounded so good we had to try it and was very worth it
Overall Grade = B+ Very GoodThe EV Foodie
Music people atmosphere food drinks desserts baked goods
maybe its because i'm a cook that i didn't like this place too much because the prices were a little steep and the quality of the food was also not so good
Both of our dishes were VERY tasty and HUGE -- I ate about half and made another meal out of it later in the day
It was a wonderful journey of food ecstasy
I can only imagine how great this once every 5 year place could be if they had even good pizza it would not even have to be great
The flavor of their burgers is good and I like that they use grass-fed beef
We ordered seafood inspired Mexican food like shrimp enchiladas   fish tacos good but nothing to start a talk thread about   and sopa de mariscos
So no Boombozz is definitely not the best pizza that I've ever had but for their style of pizza they are pretty good
The low quality cheese detracted from it overall but it was still much better than the pizza at Oregano's
I had the pepperoni and mushroom yes I am a creature of habit and while it was not amazing it was better than I expected and good for what it was - pre-made pizza that was reheated
I recommend enjoying your pizza outside since the space is pretty cramped and can get a little warm
On a last minute invite I had the good fortune of being invited to Razz's four-course prix fixe New Year's Eve dinner by a fellow Scottsdale foodie and Yelper
only the Crispy Tempura Roll stands out as being really good
For my main course I recommend the Chilean sea bass Pacific swordfish and the Florida grouper
Mastro's receives a five star rating for great service and the food is consistently good
The food is always hot not too greasy and tasty
The first two times the food was good and everyone was nice
It's a little dirty and dark in the dining room but I don't mind an old divey place if the food is good
I have had many things here enchiladas tacos Mexican pizza all of which are very good
I would really recommend the shredded beef it is very moist and flavorful
The food has definitely been ramped up now they have chicken n waffles the incredible Yucca Burger and wings with a wide selection of flavors
Relatively elegant with decent service and good food
and for years they have never failed me in making some really really good food
All in all you can count on some good food at a good price
The food is really good - especially the boneless wings and the onion rings
Now the fried chicken looked good and the pretzel balls with cheese fondue were fun
The wine list is always interesting giving you choices that surprise and please the food is well priced and the brew-shetta Geordie accent please is ridiculously good
I searched Yelp for a highly recommended sushi restaurant and people highly suggested Hiro
We demolished those and enjoyed our beers until our pizza arrived
It's a good place to take a bunch of hungry kids or a big family to enjoy for above Pizza Hut style grub
Then our main courses came and I dig into my fish and chips pretty darn good
Their premade food is tasty and the soups are awesome
Both got the Steak mine without the mushroom sauce they were good the meat was perfect and tasted organic
It's pretty amazing with sliced chicken breast big ol' basil leaves tomato pesto and a spicy olive tapenade all on ciabatta
I also like the quality of meat/poultry so fresh and reasonably priced
Food is good portions are large and the variety is awesome
My mom had the chicken salad sandwich which she really enjoyed   not too mayonaisy
Their sushi is good standard for the most part but the specialty rolls have some pretty cracked out names
One of our favorites is the Gaijin - a chimichanga styled sushi roll deep fried and delicious with cream cheese and avocado
The fried chicken was incredibly juicy and crisp and wonderful
Mexican food oh yeah some very good places mostly but Asian youre better off staying at home and cooking
the honey chicken was pretty good as well as the hot and sour soup though neither made for good leftovers
amazingly even though the food looked like greasy diner food it did not taste greasy
Definitely give it a try if you have any interest in good dessert
Rustic southwest decor with fun friendly and at times eclectic personalities to serve you PLUS flavorful dishes with hints of red and green chile or both if you'd like
If you've been before and have tried the Carne Adovada give the meat loaf a shot
Things to obviously know before entering hooters  expect greasy food slow service chicks only mildly good looking thanks to butt lifts and makeup annoying guys who think they are all going to be the next UFC champ loud sports on 13 tvs and some drunk guy getting into someones face in the corner causing a scene
The good things to expect is good food at decent prices that is fairly consistent regardless of location good happy hour depending on when you go and great cold beer
FOODI had the Greek omelette which was very good
Last time I was there they had lemon basil which was amazing an really got me craving a good chicken picata
True nothing will ever taste as good as Pizza incl
The NY strip portion of the meat was tasty however the filet side was tough and overcooked - certainly not medium as ordered
It's a big part of the reason why I only purchased $80 worth of stuff versus buying the meat that my family needs for $80 worth of meat
It's exactly what I would expect from a cut of $80 worth of spendy meat
They do have a great $5 weekday lunch menu with cold or hot sandwiches and pizza
We like to think we know good Italian food and for what it is worth they keep going back
Other than that the food is pretty good
As for the food the crab cakes were not the same less breading more filling not as good
They should really check out the food as they too would see this is not good
This is another of what I think seems to be very prevalent here dress up the place and the public won't guess that the quality of the food is no better than the local Chili's Outback whatever
I found the quality of the food to be average to poor
The tea was too strong but most of the food was good
The haw gow steamed shrimp dumplings spare ribs with black bean sauce jook rice porridge nor mi gai ti leaf wrapped rice with chicken and taro crisps were all good
The food has been consistently great i'm not going to complain anything about the portion cuz they are just good for me p I love how they pair sweet potatoes and kale salad for most of sandwiches they are not only tasty but also so good for you
This is definately a gourmet burger place and you pay extra than the norm for the options of higher quality meat and a variety of toppings
The shellfish in the dish was delicious tasted super fresh almost like right out of the ocean
Once fully cooked the pork chop was delicious but the rest of the items in the dish were pretty bland
Service is also wonderful but the food here is simply awesome
My usual Indian haunt is Flavors of India because the food is mostly good and it's close but I think this place is a close second
Tandoori chicken- The flavor was fantastic but the meat was dry
5 stars for service quality of food and atmosphere
I ordered the jerk chicken and it was delicious
It's so fresh it's so melt-in-your mouth delicious it's pretty much the best sushi I've had the pleasure of trying
Everything from the appetizer to the sushi was omnomnom
I definitely recommend anyone with a passion for ramen and Japanese food to try this place
Will definitely be back very good food and we like the way it's presented
ANYWAYS back to this AMAZING PLACE where my toasted meatball sub has been waiting 5 minutes now
it's all so delicious and vegetarian-friendly although they have plenty of meat options for the carnivores
The presentation was nice but the food itself was without flavor all together
I know it's a chain and yes it is in a mall but trust me when I say their chicken is delicious
I recommend the double meat because it's only a dollar more
Not so much the food dont get me wrong the food has still been consistantly good but the service over the years
She recommended a dish  and I had the fish specialty escoviche
My husband likes the place but I find it overpriced for the quality of food
After dessert Troy joined us with a shot of their house made Limoncello
I was pretty impressed by the concessions selection but keep in mind that's as compared to the veritable desert pun intended of food options at Turner Field
The only thing that was good was my companion's jerk chicken
What I impressed her with was a flighty vapid and giggly waitress folks all around us falling off their stools after 10 too many sake bombs mediocre fish and Nickelback grinding our eardrums to little stubby nubs
The food is pretty freaking food for hotel food
My parents enjoyed their chicken sandwiches and agreed that the food is fresh tasting and not too heavy
Some special treats this time were the real Crab Salad Duck Noodles Coconut Shrimp excellent juicy fried chicken omelet style Egg Foo Young with Duck Sauce & good Mongolian BBQ with three meats
Another thing today was that some of the premium items were missing that I enjoyed last time such as Squid Salad Bow Tie Seaweed Hawaiian Chicken & Chinese Show Peas
My food was delicious - they gave me waay to much crispy fish 2 large filets however it was cooked perfectly and paired well with the rice
My dessert frosting was good cake was a bit dry
Service excellent friendly attentive- the server was energetic answered all of our questions refilled our drinks and the saucesFood my tastebuds couldn't stop thanking me for coming here- the different sauces were AMAZING humus was good salad had a little too much olive oil but still refreshing the rice was so super I asked for more- we ordered the meal for two and it was more than the two of us could handle and I can EAT- the mixed plate had everything and we loved it all
- they didn't have the rice pudding I wanted for dessert but the baklava was divinePrice- very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food the lunch specials look like a bargainI absolutely recommend this place and will go back for more
I just wish they were closer so I could go more often  We had a party of 8 and everyone loved what they ordered the appetizers cocktails entrees and desserts were all faboulous
I was so surprised of a restaurant that is a chain would be so great and care so much about the quality of the food and service
The restaurant had a great atmosphere and each tapas-style dish was very good
As I mentioned my dad is from Canton China & good Chinese food is an important thing in our world
The beef was tender and the potatoes were good
The beef alone didn't have much flavor/spice otherwise
The husband wasn't very impressed and had to order an extra side of horseradish
So we have eaten here several times and each time the food and service has been very good
I had one bite and it was way too hot for me but I am a bit of a wimp when it comes to spicy foods
The neglectful server did recommend the food we ordered and we were very happy with it
For dessert I had the cheesecake completely blah and my friend had the brownie fudge something which was enormous and pretty tasty
On to the food - The salad was fairly good and was a good portion
I tried the Pizza Nuggets and they were good - tasted like pizza sauce and cheese slathered on soft bread
they seem to have the right formula going and their food is unique enough; good enough taste-wise and large enough portion-wise yet in my humble opinion they need to step it up to make that difference between the thought of food just being thrown together vs
We each had briskithot links pulled chicken and pulled pork
We've eaten bbq from all over the country and have come across a few not so good ones but when corn bread is the only thing that saves you from stravation at a bbq spot when theres a huge plate of meat in front of you
There really isn't a better time to go to Sapporo than RIGHT NOW to enjoy their every day summer happy hour for cheap good quality food & drinks
There are great discounts on beer wine and cocktails including the awesome mango martini and several very popular appetizers rolls and sushi
The Smoked Chicken Salad was good but a little lackluster
Nice environment friendly and attentive service and pretty good food
The sandwich was good - quality meat and bread with a nice flavored dip
And we ended up having a great time here and really enjoyed the food
I would definitely recommend this place if you're in the area and feel like hitting up a sports bar with higher quality food
The food and treat selection is amazing and the prices can't be beat
If you are in Chandler and need a clean restaurant with reliable food BLD is still a good choice
The food and service are both good so we looked passed the fact that a lunch was at minimum $30 with the tip
The first time we went we did the whole appetizers meal dessert wine
It was delicious and will be one of my favorite apple desserts available at a restaurant
For three glasses of wine a flatbread pizza which I didn't try but it looked delicious and my three cheese fondue our bill was around $45
We recently tried their breakfast buffet on Sunday mornings and aside from their usual salad bar they have wonderful options like belgium waffels french toast a breakfast buritto bar and the most addictive cinnamon rolls
The ambience the food the wine and the outdoor patio were all amazing
the roll itself was decent i don't remember what it was but it had a delicious sauce on top and a piece of halibut
you promised me sushi and samplings of appetizers and you didn't deliver
When our pizza arrived I think we were past the point of even caring if it was good or not
On the positive side I would say this place is fairly priced for what you get and they seemed to have some good specials going for locals on certain days and thankfully on that night for us still serve food late night
Although I'm allergic to shellfish I can always find something good to eat here
Off the top of my head I'd recommend the following* the bomb* vegetable tempura with a side of rice* the seaweed salad it always tastes crisp and fresh* the Valentine roll* the Frankenjin rollOne of the best things about this place is it's OPEN LATE
Great atmosphere friendly staff reasonable pricing pretty good food
But this is often motivated by laziness and downtown Phoenix is the black hole of good pizza
While that dish is tasty this place has so much more to offer
Venture away from the lure of the Orange Chicken tractor beam and try such tasty morsels asBoiled Won Tons -- a standout dish; the spicy peanut sauce is more like broth than sauce but in a good wayChicken Corn Chowder -- a reliable standbyHoney Walnut Prawns -- deep-fried shrimp enrobed in mayonnaise with honey walnuts; what's not to love
Lover's Prawns -- half the prawns are in wine sauce and the other half are in spicy chili garlic sauce; very balancedPillow Chicken -- along the lines of deep-fried chicken croquettes with savory Black Pepper SauceSichuan Style String Beans with pork -- a fantastically spicy dishThe lunch menu includes a number of their most popular dishes including Orange Chicken of course that are very tasty and wallet-friendly as they include a cup of the daily soup and an egg roll
Chef Curry preparing the appetizers fish and fowl; while Chef Badman shoveled coal onto a grill and simultaneously manning it to ensure rib-eyes were cooked to order
represented the clams nicely with hints of lemongrass flavor in the clam shell and meat
Just so you aren't as surprised as I was when I got to the register with the check in  You must buy a sandwich and a drink and you will get a hot dog Italian beef sandwich or burger for free along with another drink
Food was delicious and service was excellent
Both the Tuna Tar-tare and the Tuna Tataki are stupendously fresh as appetizers or grab a few rolls like the Kobe Beef with Mushrooms or Shrimp and Asparagus Tempura with Sriracha
My group and I shared lots of dishes on both visits - most notably we enjoyed the Kobe Beef & Black Cod entrees
The Sashimi and Sushi rolls ordered were excellent and I cannot say that I've had much better Sushi/Sashimi around  town
The selection is limited - so I would not recommend going for a meal of Sushi alone
I highly recommend Taneko if you are in the mood for something a bit different than the same-old Asian fusion places like Chang's Flo's Pei Wei etc and seeking something other than a Sushi bar
It is nice to have something unique in Phoenix - after all how often can we find a corporate owned restaurant potentially soon to be a chain where the food is simple high quality fresh and remarkably well-prepared
Louisiana Seafood Gumbo We ordered a bowl to share and really liked the flavor of the gumbo
I'm not going to say that this place is outright terrible because it's an edible burger but aside from being new and still spotless this place is inferior to it's nearest competitor the Chuckbox in almost every way it costs quite a bit more the burgers are good but nothing great the chicken tasted quite good but a tiny piece of meat on the bun for a $6 sandwich the fries were garbage there's no free parking and it just has nothing special going for it
So the mixture of very pushy service combined with tacos that were memorable in all the wrong ways make me hesitant to try this restaurant again when I can get really tasty Mexican food for way cheaper at other places in the East Valley
But any main dish worth chowing down on will dig into your calorie purse big time
Service wasn't good the food not much better
Such a good selection of all healthy foods
We had a lobster appetizer I also had goats meat which was strange unusual but delicious
The food was amazing but the service is unparalled and I have been to some extraordinary restaurants
I didn't like or trust the quality of the chicken in my chicken tikka masala
i've been to the location in chandler and also in peoria and in both places the service was good and the food comes  out QUICK
we had such a fun time the service was good food was good and the patio was a great backdrop for a casual albeit fairly romantic meal
Either way if you want to chill with some good food and drink and watch some sports check this place out
I've enjoyed pretty much everything I've gotten here except for the fish tacos
It is big and spacious and the quality and variety of the food is very good
The sushi while not on par with those in sushi restaurants is quite good nevertheless
And even after having done that repeat visits will follow;  the quality of the dishes ensures that
The Short Rib was tasty as all hell I watched my girl's eyes rolled back into her head as she nibbled on the first bite of that dish
Enjoy good conversation good food and good wine
he ordered the yakisoba w/chicken and i went for the teppanyaki beef over flour noodes--both were very good and filling
It was literally like six inches tall with lettuce delicious meat beans and cheesy goodness
Pretty decent rolls and good lunch specials
The fettucine was good the chicken was good
Anyways 4 stars good food best sushi in arizona
Also for a place that seems like would serve muledick in a tortilla and try to pass it off as beef brisket they have a surprisingly tasty menu
No pressure to flip the table good dessert recommendation and no attitude when we wanted to share
The lobster cups were chunks of lobster meat avocado and a veggie slaw-really good
RestaurantsRoy's had delicious food and great service
I swear that the tainted pet food crisis of last year made vets even more likely to push unnecessary and expensive recommended tests treatments and pills on pet owners
Taggia the hotel's new restaurant is a stylish Italian venue with a unique Ligurian-anchored menu that features fresh seafood and creative traditionally inspired dishes
BUT the rest of the food was pretty good and my mongolian beef was actually spicy
Everthing from start to finish was excellent from the service to the dessert
Chelsea's Kitchen has really good food but be prepared to pay for it
For the section we overall enjoyed the most it was hands down the Mexican food
Here's a rundown of what we tried and liked/disliked Sushi - J said they were pretty good for California Rolls
I can handle bad food if the place was clean and they had good service
The shrimp and the fish tacos are wonderful
Although I''m reluctant to go to a theme restaurant inspired by an SNL sketch I found cheeburger cheeburger to be better than a theme restaurant with mediocre food I was here once before when Tempe marketplace first opened and was overwhelmed by the topping choices Think last time I had a burger with feta mushrooms and olives trying to imagine a Mediterranean    burger really what ended up happening was flavor overload that I couldn't really taste the burger so I decided to give them another try this time around I got 1/2 lbs burger sorry a pound is just too much food with cheddar jack bacon and sauteed mushrooms we ordered a half order of the best of both worlds which is a basket of fries and onion rings with a side of cheese  the fries are good very crispy well seasoned and appear to be fresh cut  or at least a very convincing fake the onions rings are very crispy with a light batter that almost takes on a yellow tone my burger was well prepared they use sliced whole mushrooms instead of pre sliced the bacon was crispy and the cheese was nice and gooey so all in all it was a pretty decent burger I must say my burger was a bit greasy I cut my burger in half to eat it and by the time I moved on to the second half  my lower bun had become one and fused with my burger pattyOverall my experience was good and I would go back but I don't see it being a frequent choice and not just due to distance the main attraction seems to be the wide variety of burger toppings and the build-your-own inspired menu despite the food being consistent and good it's nothing I haven't tasted before though if I ever get the urge for a pepperoni peanut butter coleslaw Sri racha burger I can sleep easier at night knowing I've now got that issue handled
However the pizza was cold when I got home and I'm only 4 miles away
Native Newyorker food is always great but not when it's cold
The food would probably arrive sooner still be hot and you'd certainly have napkins if you ate at a table
Even though it is big and has the feel of a chain our hotel concierge actually described it as the PF Chang's of Mexican food but once you're at your table it can feel quite cozy and homey
The food was fresh and flavorful things weren't completely and unnecessarily smothered in too much cheese there were interesting side options other than just rice and beans I'm talking to you snap peas and a server if not necessarily our server was always accessible
For the quality level of the food the cost was a bit high
There are large portions but quality of ingredients isn't there and food is somewhat bland requiring that you season with the salsa to get some flavor
I had picked the place hearing that the food was really good
They have good food at reasonable prices and live entertainment on the weekends
While the shrimp dish was tasty there was nothing crispy about it which made for excellent fryable leftovers
I think our food was sitting for a while before it was served because all of it was cold
With the new hot sandwiches at some Starbuck's stores their food is taking a turn for the better
The meat is so tender and flavorful it melts in your mouth and the bun is specially prepared just for them
One more theory the taste of the coffee made the food taste delicious
Matt is very popular in the central Phoenix area so word spread like wild fire and he has been incredibly successful by serving good quality typical greasy spoon food and I do think it is as simple as that
For dessert we ordered the flan and it was amazing
haven't had the food at Essence in awhile because it is just too slow too crowded and too hot
essence has great food and great baked goods
Meanwhile back at the review we ordered the meat appetizer
The meat had a great flavor but the pieces were very tiny and there needs to be more
If you live here  and you enjoy good food you owe it to yourself to go at least once
It wasn't bad but it wasn't good and lets face it if food doesn't taste out of this world when you're drunk it can't really be that good in reality
I ordered the Cerveza Battered Fish Tacos which were excellent
The fish was tasty and they had just enough Baja sauce and cabbage
Essentially if your in the mood for a quiet place that serves great french food I highly recommend this place
The beef broth was flavorful the side veggies crisp and the thin slices of beef melt in your mouth
I realize the Vietnamese aren't known for curry but I was expecting a bit more based on the delicious-tasting spring roll I had just enjoyed
The pizza was pretty decent and the muffins were a little hard but I didn't really have high expectations for the hot food
This place is a small family owned Mexican restaurant common in CA if you're from there Maria is such as nice lady and the food is quite good and cheap
The Pei Wei spicy beef was still good if somewhat vinegary
Went with a group of 6 tried various pizzas all quite tasty
I very much enjoyed the Grilled Chicken Pesto pizza and the Mushroom pizza with bacon was quite a surprise
Pizzas baked to perfection with a tasty dough
It's really hard to beat the food quality service and value you get at Oregano's
We have for years went to Barro's pizzait's always been good
Their pizza is generally goodbut the last time it wasn't that great
I have only ordered salads there but I've enjoyed the three that I've tried Maggie's Jamaican Jerk Chicken and Greek
I have eaten here many times and have not been impressed with the taste of the food or the prices compared to other places
The food was really good of course it helped that I was hungry
It is a bar after all so I thought we would have a menu of nothing but fried goodies & finger food but to my great surprise they have a great menu
Dad said the chicken fried steak was as good as any that he had in Texas
This would be the perfect place for someone from/a fan of east-central Europe food and goods but for someone who just wanted a super tasty cake it didn't hit the spot
We ended up ordering the Campfire Feast for Two which includes an appetizer two entrees and dessert
The prices at Renegade Canteen aren't outrageous but they're wayyy too high for the quality of food they're serving
It's the closest one to where we live and we've had nothing but great service and delicious quickly served food
Our food came out hot and was delicious-- I forgot exactly what my boyfriend had but it was something with garlic cream sauce which was out of this world
The people are great but the food is just so-so and not worth the price
just like if you see a perpetually crowded restaurant you can deduce that the food is probably pretty good
I've only visited the locale in Tempe and enjoyed their beer and pretzels but this time around a date and I decided to make a stop in and try the 'food food'
It's a good thing I don't crave fried chicken and mongolian hot pot too often I guess
It's gelato a dessert that while delicious is simply not as popular or as easy to mass produce as ice cream
The butterfish tataki was melt-in-your-mouth the giant and I mean a foot long Japanese prawn was buttery and so yummy my roll and sashimi extra fresh and OMG good
Chicken underneath was completely flavorless and was dry and veggies were scant
Hopefully the food will make it all worth for you
You can get full off of some tasty food for a great price
I think the waited 15 min for a table for 6 on a friday night not bad at allOK onto the food I had the greek chicken flavor and it was so tasty
I must say though the flavors in the greek chicken one were seriously amazing artichoke hearts
My friend said he thought the food was good but the coleslaw was too wet
There is so much flavor and spice in the food it's unbelievable
The sweet and sour paht priaw wahn with chicken is to quote my girlfriend its delicious yummy and tasty the chickens good the sauce is good shes eloquent lol
But getting her to love a food other than cheeseburgers is amazing so this must be pretty damn good
Theres a little drive up window just like a drive through and its great don't have to wait inside all awkward but careful the food is so hot it sometimes melts through the styrofoam containers
The food is surprisingly good yet cheap and with great variety
Many Western dishes are available as well as sushi udon and cold summer noodles
The food is great and I highly recommend the Bobbie or the Capastrami
I first fell in love with rock shrimp at Nobu and I think Sushi Roku does a very good version of it
The rolls were good quality - we had a spicy salmon roll not on the menu but they allowed the subsitution tuna toro with jalapeno and a dynamite
The food and drinks are pretty cheap but they're skimping on quality
Good and consistent service and food every time
The food is good and fairly priced and you are also paying for the experience of eating at a Hooters
I have always enjoyed the food and atmosphere
For good pizza with fresh ingredients check out Grimaldi's
The meatballs are very tasty and the broth has a unique sweetness to it
They are tasty with grilled chicken diakons a radish type veggie cucumbers carrots and cilantro
The chicken fried steak is good the gravy has good the fried potatoes cubes are nice and cripsy and the scramble egg to top it off was good
Good Cheap Chinese and Food - add Buffett and it is explains why Outlook has recurring event function
75 starsI stil have it 3 stars cause I don't mind eating in a dump as long as the food is good
The hot wings and greek salad was good but the pizza although awesome thin crust and lots of toppings was WAY
I've only been to Hawaii once in my life and it has been a long time since I had some really good Hawaiian food
The meat just exploded with flavor and the salsa and lomi was very cool and refreshing
The food was actually really good and I enjoyed my Peach Bourbon BBQ Chicken and Shrimp a lot
And it's one of the ones I come back to to even when no special because the food is very good
I honestly can't remember what we ate for brunch/lunch but I know it was good quite a bit of food though - recommend sharing if you can or doggie bag it
The salsa/sauce that accompanied these dishes had so much flavor - in fact all the ingredients had flavor
Fresh and flavorful meats and great salsas
I thought a frosty would soothe his throat and do just the trick to get him back to sleep but all I got was a foomy version of one from them plus shitty cold food
The first time I went here was about a year and a half ago and I wasn't to impressed with the sushi
Flavors are very different from most other sushi joint but I enjoyed it
We are sooooo glad that we did because the food quality & taste was amazing
The prices are a little on the high side but I am a firm believer in the saying you get what you pay for & this pizza place was worth every penny
Anyhoo the food is always consistently fresh and tasty
Mom and I shared the Apricot Chicken with mashed sweet potatoes Dad had some steak sandwich with horseradish that was very tasty husband had the Salmon BLT with avacado
I tasted everything and ALL the food was delicious
However I've been going for dinner to Flavors of India for nearly three years now and have ALWAYS liked the food
Regarding the food I love their mattar paneer cooked peas in a tasty curried gravy with small cubes of homemade mild-tasting cheese
Tandoori shrimp chicken and tikka masala are good though a bit pricier the samosa appetizer lightly battered and deep-fried cut vegetables is fresh warm and crunchy
Otherwise meat and service are quite good and a very nice experience
We were extremely impressed with the atmosphere food and service
I had a huge chicken salad so good I could have it every day
When she does go she actually eats the sushi and even asks to go there for her treat after a good week at school
We have been to a number of other restaurants in the East Valley for sushi and this by far is the best from both quality AND price perspective
Also the flavor of the machaca beef was okay but I've definitely had way better
All the salads are solid and for pizza I'd recommend the Avocado Pizza
The fish is of great quality and the crispy batter is delicious
When my food finally arrives I quickly mash all the goods into my potato and start going to town on it
We enjoyed the Undead Humberger vegan slider hummus and flax seed cracker dishes
I've never had the pasta but my friends loved their dishes and they're OG italian for what that's worth
Considering that's an appetizer and one that should take less time than to prepare than a whole pizza or two pasta dishes
I considered this one of the three pizza places I could always go to for tasty pizza
But again I can get good pizza at those other two places
As usual the food is delicious and has great flavor
We both really enjoyed the chicken won ton soup that came with our lunch
I ordered the pepper beef and it was very good
The du00e9cor is the nicest I have seen at any Indian place in town and the owners are usually there and make sure the food is consistent and good
It includes a rack of grilled meats and fish as an appetizer a sampling of four or five dishes and even dessert
I normally wouldn't review a fast-food chain such as Panda but the quality of the food yes for fast food and the service was so good at this location that I couldn't resist
The beef potato taco was good but a little greasy it's the kind of taco that is stuffed and then lightly fried in a pan the shredded beef taco came with a soft corn tortilla - it was a little bland and the meat was too dry
I have to say I did enjoy the breakfasts pancakes once and farmers omelet the second The food was very good but the wait and the service were big strikes
He also offers delicious specialty pizzas
There is a long wait for your food but it's always busy and good food takes time
NOT RECOMMENDEDMediocre and substandard food quality
Of the 4 signature dishes tried they all fell short with in quality and taste
I can easily say that I enjoyed the food and that most of the food was as close to authentic as I've had outside of Los Angeles and New York and other cities with really large expatriate Taiwanese populations
They have an amazing happy hour with numerous wines beers and cocktail specials and sushi and appetizers that range between $4-$8
I won't fill this review gleaming about the spiedini appetizer that my group of 5 professional foodies actually wanted to play paper rock scissors over for the last piece
I highly recommend the place only if you can maintain an open mind if you look at some of the worst reviews here you will have a difficult time understanding what was actually bad about the food
One thing I read in many Yelp and food critic reviews was the bold marriage of flavors of the food
Q to U is a fantastic place to bring your family next time you're searching for some really good BBQ or just plain hungry and enjoy tasty almost sinfully~deliciousness food
I showed up to the box office 3 days before the show told them my mistake and they said no problem and gave me a cash refund even though it clearly states no refunds on internet ordersgreat customer service great STAR CLASS experience worth the extra $2 but had free popcorn remember amazing food for a movie theater
Ok so I only ate their once but I remember how good the food was years later and Fate was absolutely amazing
I dunno and there are grill marks on the meat instead of the prepackaged smoke salmon which I thought was very good but obviously not fresh over fettuccine/linguine in a very fresh white sauce
Inter-dispersed throughout the dish are sun dried tomatoes and capers one lending a sweet tang the other like crisp squirty little nuggets of salty goodness
The desserts looked delicious but we were too full to partake in them
The beef was also overcooked and somewhat flavorless
The food is simply amazing as is their outstanding wine list and best views in the valley
The household aisle was full of fun goodies for foodies
I've tried all four veggie sushi rolls and they were all tasty but do take some time to come out
The sandwich was pretty good but at over seven bucks it was a little pricey - any lunch at that price including my favourite Fuji Apple Chicken salad at Paradise Bakery places it into the rare treat category especially when you can buy one whopper and get one free @ less than half the price from Burger King these days
All in all I think the food here is decent but thought the wine prices were good
Probably the best customer service I've ever experienced and the food was good too
The food was average and not very flavorful and it took quite awhile
But on to the food -- all 4 of us had a real hard time deciding what we wanted since everything sounded delicious
Even though they forgot her pickle spear and she was reallllllly looking forward to it and gave me chips instead of veggies the food in and of itself was delicious and apparently they include free soft serve ice cream that we totally forgot existed unfortunately
The drinks were good and sushi as good if not better
I went with veggie-only because I wasn't all that impressed with the meat presentation
The food was as good as I remembered but now they offer a tortilla sauce over the chicken
And considering this place will make your food just about as quickly without having to wait in line with a bunch of mouth-breathing yahoos I would highly recommend a visit to Asian Cafu00e9 even if the name is completely and utterly misleading
Curry chicken dish was thin and tasted like a little bit of curry in hot water
The chicken sausage w/tomatoes fresh pasta ribbons in a parmesean broth - EXCELLENT
Tasty greasy goodness at this fish take-out chainlet
A friend who's lived here all his life raves about this place as a good fast-food alternative
Good selection of seafood and other meats
I love happy hour food because it's always cheaper and it's just as good
RA Sushi actually reminds me of Americanized sushi and not authentic sushi; however it is still tasty
I would recommend these rolls if you like cooked seafood and you don't mind cream cheese/mayo in your rolls
I think they're good but I prefer more fish and sashimi in the rolls
And before i went i checked for reviews on yelp for a good sushi place
but the reviews for Fish Market were fairly positive and it was close to my hotel
It's perfect for a bars-on-bikes stop when you're looking for something casual and good old fashioned fat kid bar food
Upon arriving home I see my hot food is sitting in styrofoam
i went there one time Cause everyone was like this place is sooo good they jack off on your food its great
that sounded good but when i went there no jacking off on the food wtf
not only did the food have quality that only McDonald's can do but the service was terrible
oh sorry anyway if u want white trash gas station quality sushi and service that would make you feel like your in the movie Saw than eat at Kyoto  Home of the Garbage Roll
I found the broth tasty and the beef noodles and veggies all very good
My wife tried the chicken pho pretty good
The bottom lineGood food reasonable prices
My honey ordered the pizza with peppered bacon sausage pepperoni and leeks - it was crispy just enough cheese and sauce without being overwhelming and the ingredients were amazingly high quality
I went the other night just for some appetizers and drinks and though the food was decent fried zucchini and mushrooms the parking lot service music and crowd sucked
It's absolutely not a place I'd want to go for a date night I'd feel very upset I'd wasted the time and effort getting cute because you probably won't see other human beings - probably why they offer a 20% discount for sit-in dining but its great for good reasonably priced take-out Chinese food
I get Moo Goo Gai Pan - basically chicken and vegetables and its good but could use a little more flavor
The house fried rice is tasty and the egg rolls are pretty good
CPK is a typical chain where you know what is on the menu and the quality and price of the food you are going to get
If you are in the area and want a decent salad and/or California style pizza then CPK is a good bet
This is a chain restaurant but they are fanatical about the quality of their food and service
It's a little pricey at around $20-$25 a plate for a dinner entree but the food is high quality
Now that that's out of the way let's discuss dessertI had a bite of the cheesecake which was tasty but not award winning
All in all the food was good and my only complaint was that I ate too much
At first he was wondering where in the world I was taking him but he was incredibly happy with the feel of the restaurant and the quality of the food
As a west coast girl knowing what good soul food consisited of never my forte
And thank goodness because their catfish was amazing collards were great and red beans and rice phenomenal
my server showed up with FOUR big hot like her rolls with plenty of whipped butter to put on with just a taste of cinnamon in it
The attention to detail with respect to both the food & the environment in here is amazing
The food had so much flavor - it tasted like everything had been simmering for days
As an aside it was the first time I tried the spinach egg white and feta wrap based on the recommendations of two young girls in line behind me and ooh it is by far the best fast food breakfast I have ever had
As for the food the pancakes were rock star - absolutely delicious
Other foods were good and I don't get the deal with everyone saying the coffee is crappy - it's better than chain restaurants so I don't know what the problem is
The chicken salad sandwich was juicy and flavorful with just the right amount of everything
It seems more like a college hangout than a restaurant and this is not surprising because it is a college hangout but one where the quality of the food has attracted a wider clientele
maybe the chicken is tasty or a burrito will be better
I'll have to come back and try some of their other dishes but the hot dog and burger were a bit above average fare
For dessert we had yummy hot chocolate cake
All in all it was good experience the food was great service was a tad too much and my sangria disappointed me
Myself and two other friends enjoyed a few dishes as we were told most were meant to be shared
It's unfortunate as the food has always been good but someone get chef Ramsay to come in and give them the 101 on service
I haven't had a majority of the menu but for basics like the bean and cheese chips with cheese and guac rolled tacos with cheese and guac are delicious when you're craving such things
There were a few dishes I thought were pretty good
Whether it be sticky pork bbq rolls Very good or some sort of beef rice noodle there is about 4 portions per plate
Head there for good microbrew selections check for their seasonal brews great food and a good lively atmosphere
Staff is friendly; our server was awesome keeping the drinks refilled and food was delivered nice and hot
Their fish meat and produce are all simply amazing
On our way to Sedona AZ from Long Beach CA we were looking for a place to eat  more particularly a good pizza place
Under these circumstances one can drive around till you find what seems to be a remotely good pizza place or log on on yelp
Other than these quibbles it was good food and a nice but small place
I usually go on a weeknight every other month or so and while the service is not snappy it is sufficient especially given the tasty deliciousness of the food they serve
It's awesome to just soak up the scenery and look at the wonderful koi fish swimming elegantly through the pond
Oh btw I enjoyed feeding the Koi fish pretty fun they just suck up the food off your hand like a vacuum cleaner
The food is always good but like I said at the beginning knowing what they do in the kitchen makes me wonder why they charge so much for the food
This place amazes me because it's one of the few buffet places where the food is actually consistently good and fresh
They also have a hot food stations that serve rotating dishes of various pasta sweet and baked potatoes pizza multiple breads and muffins desserts drinks and a 6-7 choice soup bar that's outstanding
The beef is sooooo flavorful the corn tortillas sooooo yummy and all the extras darn right essential for a complete and delectable meal
And since they are close to where I work I don't have to wait another year to devote my taste-buds to their delicious food
Believe me I have experienceAs if the food wasn't enough they have two amazing ordering systems Iphone App and Online Ordering
as in if someone is cranky as shit making your food it is not as good as if they are smiling enjoying their lives
The service was excellent and the food was also very good
The pharmacy never seems to have a long line the wine section is fairly good for a supermarket and the meat department is the best in its town
Food was ok - not amazing - not memorable even to write about
The food was all great having a few vodka tonics earlier may have helped and the iced tea I ordered had perfect flavor
Fresh tasty breadNice array of toppings and extras unlike Jimmy John's down the street where you can have it their way or you can F offFairly quickConsNo onsite parking$7 for a Small turkey sandwich is a little steepTurkey is mixed white and dark meat
I don't like dark meat I won't do dark meat and until you find a way to separate that ish out I can't partake in an otherwise quite tasty turkey sandwich
I would be willing to go back and try a few of their other options like the meatball sub which looked pretty decent but a deli that can't master the simple but oh so delicious turkey sandwich is going to be hard for me to love and appreciate in the long haul
Not as good as a Philly I had just outside of PIA from a food truck
The mozzarella and ricotta cheese was wonderfully stuffed inside the pizza dough
The owners make everyone feel like family and I think this place is worth a visit even if you don't like Italian food
However the food was really good and so I'd probably still go back
We waited for the bill to come which took a while and while we were waiting we noticed that this place must be good when actual Indian people go there to eat indian food
The food is good and the drinks are even better
They had pretty fair happy hour prices and selection of food; we had wings and chicken fingers - both good but the string fries were the best    The bartender was very attentive and friendly chat something that never happens next door
I can't remember the name but it wasn't Tuna Poke because I told the waitress that I wanted that but something spicier and she recommended the dish just below it
The food while very good was not memorable
The others had the pork dish  meh and the steak-it was again good very good but not WOW
We don't want to break the bank for dinner out we just want some good food and a chance to enjoy each other's company
My husband's new dish came out quickly and everything was wonderful
Well if you're going to reference AZ88 they you better have great drinks and at least good bar food
Instead of the rich buttery lemon/wine based sauce theirs was GREEN it had been reheated to the extent that the sauce had separated and had a granulated appearance the chicken had no flavor and was difficult to cut with a steak knife
By the way I've eaten C-Rations and MRE's that had more flavor than Mimi's food
Moving from Illinois I had a really hard time finding a good pizza place in PHX
Food was delicious and drinks mojitos + maritinis  were great
Service was good and the food was better than your average bar food
If you are looking for an old-school Sonoran style Mexican restaurant with a good assortment of foods on the menu this is the place
The only thing that was good about our experience was the food which they messed up the order
The food was good enough for me to try again even though the smell was a little overwhelming at the door
The kids meal was pretty good it came with a capri sun and chicken/rice teriyaki sauce  edamame oranges and a yakatori
I've brought many friends and family and they agree the food is good
The prices are very reasonable and despite many visits we are often surprised with how low our bill is considering the quantity and quality of food
I've had friends get full meals from appetizer through dessert before I even get my sushi
Maybe their other food is good but the salads were horrible
At this time the place is slow but the food is delicious and the prices are right
Melted cheese over a soft tart with wild mushrooms and leeks - wonderful wonderful savory dish
Aside from the wine flavor the meat wasn't very good anyway just like the other fixins and the fries
I know the food comes from the Herb Box which is tasty and the restaurant was very busy Saturday night but the food was less than desirable how and when it was served
Our bill is usually about $40 and that includes 5-6 rolls a small appetizer and DRINKS
The food has always been consistently good
I highly recommend the chocolate dipped bacon smores for dessert
It is sort of a deconstructed dish with chocolate covered bacon freshly made marshmallow whipped peanut butter and graham crackers - ridiculously good and a must-have
as for our entrees--I ordered the Spicy Scallop roll--slightly spicy pretty good
Jamie had the RSM roll--deep fried smothered in sauce but still NO FLAVOR somehow
the tuna they used in the roll was delicious with the sauce but the actual batter was bland as were the 'Spicy Calimari' bits
E is because I've tried Tokyo Lobby over in Glendale and let me tell you if you want AMAZING sushi where everything has a punch of flavor and you can taste every ingredient make that trek over to the West Val
Word to the wise never ever buy frozen boxes or freezer food that you think might taste good
Of course how can you not like the cheap pizza hot dog and churro
I enjoyed this fact however if you want a richer dish keep looking
The veggies were fresh and the meats were tasty
Descent pizza wings and surprisingly good nachos
I'm giving this place a generous 4 stars because the food is actually very tasty
I have also tried the curry chicken which is also very tasty
appetizers entrees and desserts were all superb
I was tempted to give it 3 stars because I've had a lot of Thai food in the Bay Area and I've been to Thailand once and I'm honestly not sure where I should come down on that fourth star but since Phoenix doesn't really have quite the selection of Thai restaurants I'll err on the side of arroy Thai for delicious
I've had a few different dishes there and they tended to be quite tasty without being Americanized
I think the prices are on par to the quality of the food that we ate anyway though
I just wasn't impressed with the quality of the food
Food was brought to table very quickly staff was friendly and efficient and my kung pao chicken was piping hot and enjoyable
The gaucho outfits gave me a chuckle but to each their own the beef is good the lamb was superb and there is a salad bar  that is also all you can handle at lunch which was well stocked and included three different types of cheese
I must have poor taste when it comes to Mexican food based on the review below because I think Big Burrito is pretty damn tasty
When you have a hankering for inexpensive mexican food and you're in the neighborhood Big Burrito is a good choice
The meat was tender not stringy or chewy and had enough flavor to make it through both the cheese and the onions which were just wonderful icing on the cake
The decorations are interesting the food is delicious and the staff is attentive and extremely friendly and helpful
10 minutes you have pizza that'll beat any chain and the ingredients are much higher quality
Lots of flavor from the garlic in the meat mixture
He was always checking on us and had helpful suggestions on the dishes hottest
Their food is good and they have a variety of food too eat as well
It seemed to take a bit longer than usual for my food considering I was there at an off time and my fries were a bit cold
I was so impressed with their BBQ Baguette yesterday that I had to go back and see if it was a fluke since I usually can't stand faux meats
I've had many-a-good-pizza in my day and been to some places that I thought were my favorites until I had this little joint 7 years ago when they first opened
There's lots of good variety and all the dishes are really unique and tasty
and what you've paid for could not possibly circumvent the amount and quality of food you've received
I beg you if you're looking for quality food on a budget especially that of a student's do not look beyond Los Fav's
First the restaurant is great the staff is friendly and the food is excellent
We chose to try -- Cavatelli with Vodka Sauce -- Sausage with Peppers and Potatoes -- Eggplant Parmigiana The cavatelli was eyes-rolling-back-in-your-head delicious
The cost of the trays included racks to put them on Sterno to keep the food hot and serving utensils
My fiance tried the Plato Tipico and found it to be delicious fried finger food
The chicken was always flavorful and moist with lotsa feta cheese cucumber kalamata olives lettuce and tomatoes
There isn't much sushi around Surprise and while I haven't had their sushi the rainbow roll looked pretty tasty
I had them roll it with the red hot sauce already in to make it easier to eat on the go
I had the Lamb Roll up *which was excellent
The food was pretty good but not 80 dollars worth
Though I have not sampled the food I can definitely recommend the martinis
The pizza's were mmmmm mmmmm good but didn't blow me away
The chicken was hot this time and crispy but the sauce was overly sweet
The sausage was a little light but the nachos were really good we also got a pesto quesadea that looked really good and then I got a beef sandwitch and fries that I could not finsh that's a lot of beef mmmm
I guess I woudn't technically call it New York style pizza BUT it is really good pizza regardless
The dinner size is sizable enough for an entree if you can sneak some bites of someone else's hot food to round it out
I haven't had good Indian food since I was in Seattle last winter
The meat is pretty good quality though there is that is some fat in it but you can pick it out quite easily
Very cool vibe here and really good food
But the food was so good that I just don't care - and am eagerly awaiting my next trip to Scottsdale
For our meals Jared went with the burger and I went for the fish tacos per our waitress's recommendation and a side of corn
The food is always delicious and the service is excellent
I first went to Metro in search of beingets which are excellent and much better than Grand Lux Cafe's but i fell in love with all the other savory dishes they have to offer
Sushi is also a Korean restaurant and not only is their Sushi great quality and affordable their Korean dishes are authentic and very very tasty
Another member mentioned the photographs on the Wall it's great for everyone to see the food not just read it on the menu also they've added some new dishes
One dish is called an Avocado Salad I'll post those photos you should try it you'll like it
Sushi is a hidden treasure for Sushi Lovers and Bulgogi fans I would definitely recommend J
You could tell he enjoyed his job - and loved the food
The meat here wasn't very good at all but to top that the BBQ sauce wasn't very flavorful at all either
Fresh delicious meaty and always perfect I'd order them again and again
Comes with salad and soup good portions of the main item rice four california rolls deep fried korean dumplings mandoo and tempura vegetables
I mean don't get me wrong Koreans and Chinese have good Sushi places too but they arn't Japanese
So know your differences in Sushi before you comment on things like Yume is not as good as places near by like like RA or Sushi Brokers it makes you uneducated
five stars to the food it is exactly what is supposed to be a Korean sushi place; with variety of good cooked Korean items on the menu
The lunch buffet is very good it has several dishes with meats and several vegetarian options they even have deserts
For dessert we have the Kheer rice pudding and we drop one of the Colab jamon in it which is a cheese ball made from ice cream amazing
not take out for buffetMy dinner experience was equally satisfying we had the vegetable samosas chicken tikka masala amazing the shrimp vindaloo big shrimp with potatoes and herbs basmati rice and naan they ask you how hot you want the food so we ordered 8 for the vindaloo and 3 for the masala since we have our kid with us
I haven't been able to try out any of the sweets yet but they look pretty good and if the rest of the food is any indicator they probably are
The food is very good at Country Glazed Ham but you don't feel like you're getting away with a steal like at some of the hole in the wall gems around
The price is right for the lunch buffet but the quality of the pizza is shabby
They are friendly and welcoming and the food is also fresh and delicious
I've had their 2 pizza combo before and it was good
Plus in another indication that they don't know how to serve anything other than gourmet pizza the side of marinara sauce he got was ICE COLD
Prices are also a little high for the value considering meat quality and quantity
Its smart the food is good the service is on point and its different
our food has been hot and fresh and thankfully the food has remained really really good
This is a good place to go for hapy hour but don't go to this place seeking good Mexican food
There pancakes are amazing and that  is all coming from a person who does not like pancakes or breakfast food at all
I would recommend this place to anyone who wants the best breakfast food in Arizona
The continental breakfast was $18 pp and $9 for a 2 y/o I mean really what 2 year old eats $9 worth of food
We went down anyways for dinner since the food reviews were pretty good
The food was good but I was expecting a normal sit-down dinner which we didn't get
The Pho is really quite good especially with the grandma sauce the rolls are very fresh as well
And the antipasto salad included with the meal had generous portions of meat cheese tomatoesonion peppers olives with house dressing was fresh and very good
We remembered that in the good old days Rigatony's desserts were awesome so we ordered the Tiramisou and chocolate layered cake
I have found that if I stick to their signature sushi and small plates I actually have a good time
5 stars for price cleanliness fast and efficient service and delicious food
Tasty food GREAT SERVICE nice decoration and on a large group they WON'T enforce gratuity
On one visit I tried the Fish N Chips which are pretty standard and tasty
diner and we were truly delighted by the quality and presentation of the food
At the end of such a wonderful night we were hoping for a good Italian espresso with our dessert
The food is good and they have most everything one could want but the price is a show-stopper
For dinner he got one of their chicken sandwiches which was tasty but covered in way too much mayo
If you are going to do something like this you gotta make sure the bread has some flavor or crispness to compliment the dish or you are simply providing filler for the waste can
Outstanding dishes you can't go wrong withJalepenos with Cheese Baked Appetizer $10- as long as you can stand just a little heat this will be a crowd pleaser
But inside the pepper delicious blend of meat potato and cheese
Grilled marinated chicken has just the right heat bun is tasty loaded with fresh toppings
Dishes to avoid  Ceviche not worth the price Guacamole chips suck Gauc is bland salsas just okay $9 fish tacos they flatly suck
You can easily get away with $15 after tip if you are careful and get to soak up the great ambiance good food etc
Don't get me wrong I love a good rainbow roll but sashimi is the main event
I was planning on going for a drink and a couple of small appetizers and ended up eating a full meal I am powerless against the rainbow roll especially after a few drinks of saki
Mix of young and old reasonably good list of wines by the glass the food is pretty good as well
the cheese ravoli and cheese quiche were probably the two favorites among our group but the chicken satay was also good
While the food was very good my husband and I were not blown away by the resort property
Tasty offerings include the #3 beef with egg roll and their pho bo
I recommend Slices great pizza joint just across from D&B more or less
What's a bummer is that the pizza joint on Mcdowell Mountain ranch that  changed locations was actually pretty good and this place simply isn't any good at all
The food is good but it's a chain so most likely you've been to one before and you know what your getting before you walk in the door
But despite this if your not in a hurry and you want good food Paradise is always a safe bet
The employees fit the title inside is decorated appropiately and oh that sushi comes out fresh tasty and with style
Highlight of the meal was when the bartender made some after dinner shots when he overheard us discussing dessert
The cinnamon roll itself was good but had way too much frosting for our liking it was swimming in frosting and we had to scrape some off
I stayed away from the steak sauce for my burger it had some bizarre flavor that I would not get near any meat but maybe others like it
The second go around we sampled two other appetizers  FEZ LETTUCE WRAPS minced grilled chicken with dried pears dates dried cherries almonds pomegranate vinaigrette & romaine cups - simply tasty I think one of the best lettuce wraps out there
and CHICKEN PHYLLO PACKETS crisp baked phyllo filled with spinach marinated chicken roasted red bell peppers & feta cheese - it was good not great but consistently FEZ has shown they know their sauces
The owner and his wife and daughter were all working and were all extremely friendly they're form Hawaii and the food was very flavorful and perfectly cooked and presented
John Clark is amazing he will not only explain what changes you dog is going through but explain the history of why i brought my puppy there for her rabies series im a college student so he cut me some slack on the expenses of it he gave me food advice and education on her growing process such as her weight teeth and eye sight the girls are okay but i go for the Dr
It was good as always but there were some negatives this time*  The soups  There was an ordinary Corn Chowder a weak Cream of Broccoli & ordinary Chicken Noodle
*  Over at the dessert bar there was no hot fudge & it looked not as if it had run out but rather that they just didn't offer any today
When I hear the name Vincent's I immediately think oh yikes here comes a pricey night but the best part about it is that the market bistro keeps the evening at an incredibly reasonable price without losing the quality of food
The owners are lovely the coffee is tasty and served beautifully in wonderful big mugs and the food and service are always and dependably great too
Off the topic of food but still worth noting is how cool the bathroom mirror is
Everyone's food came out and it looked really good
My sandwich was average I thought the pretzel roll overwhelmed the flavor of the sandwich and I ended up adding hot sauce to add some taste to everything
This wasn't really a problem though since these sandwiches were exceptionally tasty and served on pizza bread
the pizza is a good flavor with quality sauce and toppings but the pizza is much smaller then it should be
The food was incredible and didn't all have the same smokey flavor most brazilian steakhouses have the same taste
The buffet and sides were perfect and complimented the wonderful food
It's all delicious from the wonderful appetizers to the amazing salads to the entrees with mock meat
A work friend and I walked over from our hotel for dinner tonight- with temperatures above 100 degrees we were happy that it took less than 5 minutes to stroll over
I ended up ordering their Pad Woon Sen with tofu and my friend went with the good standby Pad Thai with chicken
The kids love sitting in the trolley give it a shot
After 11pm there is only a late night menu which consists of most appetizers and a few simple pizzas kitchen closes at 1am
ever hear of a restaurant where you can order sushi soft shell crabs and then finish it off with a delicious version of pasta bolongense or spicy korean beef with noodles
So this review is for location instead of the food which is pretty consistently good if you want burritos and guacamole
The soup certainly wasn't terrible but it lacked that certain quality that elevates Pho above mere food into the realm of the sublime
The broth was decent but not spectacular the noodles were good and the meat was alright but the vegetable accompaniments were sadly disappointing
haven't had high quality seafood like this in the valley in ages
Having lived on both coasts I'm always skeptical of going to seafood restaurants in landlocked states and have actually had some good experiences but this place was an EPIC FAIL
It was way overpriced for th quality and quantity of food provided
It was lacking in flavor the squid and pieces of fish were ridiculously tiny and the crab legs provided were the legs with the least amount of meat
They are good about substituting the side dishes
He enjoyed his buffalo meatloaf with portabello mushrooms
The gluten free pizza crust is really good
The view is amazing and the food is just as good
I have eaten at Pepin 3-4 times and the food is decent the wine is good and it is fun to watch the dancing
The lunch served by the catering department was amazing phyllo dough chicken with lemongrass mushroom sauce and vanilla cake with strawberry cream filling
Our party of four were able to share a single large pizza which tasted very good
It's a cookie baked in a large dish with ice cream on top and it was delicious
Both were very good and a had eight pieces per roll I believe
Sunday afternoon and a packed patio is always a good sign of  great food or cheap drinks
tasty and spicy and the meat something I don't always remember the names but 3 meats olives and I added serrano's to that one
Good food small hole-in-the wall place but food is authentic and yummy
Their pork burritos are great i always get mine wet as i love the combination of the flavor of the meat and sauce
The coating was pretty thin and I didn't think it had much flavor it just tasted like chicken
Service is excellent we got our food quickly
We ordered the dessert sampler but they were out of the creme brulee and the server was very gracious and was offering us a good choice of substitution
We also had some fish tacos which I really enjoyed
Dim sum carts steam the food so once placed on the table it's hot and ready
The staff here are very friendly and attentive providing excellent service even though this is more of a fast food type operation
Even though they were heavy contenders I ultimately decided to go with the Devil's Chicken which was SO good
I am not a big salad person but even the orange fennel salad that I had before the pizza was delicious
Now this was some good carne asada and the barbacoa was meaty lean and well seasoned
We did finally get the opportunity to order the butterfish appetizer and when Kate asked for the seafood and vegetable tempura she specifically asked if only one shrimp came with the order could they please add 2 more
One of my bosses ordered a beef dish for her main course which she enjoyed except that they left significant chunks of gristle on the meat
I would go back for the butterfish and the cod if someone insisted but I can get a better quality and value for sushi at Yen over on 43rd Ave
I just remember my terror at the enormous plate of delicious food that was placed in front of me
Although this Vietnamese dining spot is in a food court - in Mekong Plaza -  the quality of the food is excellent
The ingredients are really fresh and the dishes are well prepared and delicious
For the same low price you would pay in other Vietnamese dining establishments the food you get is of higher quality
Food we ordered pupu platter for 2 hot & sour soup House special chow mein moo shu pork orange beef requested not spicy total with tax $49 + change
pupu platter poop poop - egg rolls tasteless bbq pork overcooked flavorless chicken wings and drumettes fried shrimp neutral crab puffs deflatingHot & Sour soup afraid to try it for now will prep myself to try it laterHouse special chow mein definitely not special flavorless and if you like thin tasteless linguine like noodles with a hint of diluted brown color sauce as flavoring then you might like it
a thai restaurant with an authentic setting and delicious food made with a good amount of heart
6 dollar lunch special you can't ask for anything better for quality food
We enjoyed a beautiful evening with a very attentive staff and wonderful food
The meat was good and tastythe booze is good
GradesOVERALL    B- Service   B-    Service was attentive but slowness in picking up the                         check is not a plus Food     B- Burger was good but too large and fries were forgettableDrinks  B It's good but not something I'd write  home about just in case you're wondering - I give A's only if it's superior
My co-workers and I all of us except the vegetarian not sure who invited him thoroughly enjoyed the beef and chicken tacos
Delicious and inexpensive exactly like Chinese place in NY except the egg rolls are small
This restaurant is were I take out of state guests because the food is so good
We also got their sample appetizer platter and I only liked their avocado rolls and their mozzerella sticks
All the food wasn't that good except for the salmon which was above average but not great
The food is good and there is plenty of  desserts
The bolgogi had a good sauce but the meat had an unpleasant texture
We got it going on from the west to the eastOur team is now complete and so uniqueWe yelp with passion like we are possessedReading the menu sushi's good but not the bestOne of these yes oh please
It's a good place to hang out if you've trolled up and down Mill Ave
It was sort of bland with a very mild flavoring from the meat and beans within the crust
While this wasn't a deal-breaker and you still get a good amount of meat some might be exasperated by the mere presence of them in their food
Thank goodness they don't serve food on that counter
--the concept is excellent but with declining food quality it could die off quickly
#food often arrives dead cold
For entru00e9e I had the Short Ribs on grits which was a very strong dish and would recommend
Amazing how three related people ended up with very different meals especially Erik T with cod fish and Mike T with who knows what kind of sauces except they were very dark
Even though I am a pizza enthusiast I am not one who can analyze every ingredient so I won't be describing the pizza taste in detail here I just know if it tastes good or not
The food is fresh and tasty The fish tacos are made with marinated talapia and served with a huge mound on fresh cabbage pico and tomatoes
I know that it is asian fusian but the menu was mostly Thai with some sushi thrown in for good measure
I had ordered a chicken corn soup which had good flavor but more of that overcooked chicken and absolutely no corn
It was only lukewarm and I like my food hot
It can get somewhat noisy in there but the food & service makes it worth it
The food is good and they tend to keep the kitchen open fairly late 1030 or so
The quality of the food is good but only slightly above average
The Rosemary Chicken Sandwich is fragrant and hearty and the side of greens that comes with it is always fresh with a mild but tasty dressing
I didn't think the pizza was very good
Is it as good as some of the Mexican food you can get here in Arizona
On the good side--chicken was fresh juicy hot and flavorful
Greasy and some funky flavors that do not belong in Italian beef
We had drinks appetizers sushi and then teppanyaki
I have no idea what kind of sushi we had but it was pretty darn tasty too
- 4 stars6 reuben sandwich the pastrami in this sandwich was amazingly good and they don't skimp on the meat
I ordered the meatloaf as many people on yelp raved about it - I did think it was good but nothing I would rave about
You can get creative sushi in many other places and pay top dollar for it but this sushi is wallet friendly and of excellent quality
Favorite little restaurant in Scottsdale ; Delicious French cuisine very cool decor and environment and reasonably priced for the quality of food
I have several food intolerances including soy and dairy and trying to find a good quality dark chocolate without those two ingredients is challenging yes there are some bars at Whole Foods but the quality can't even compare
I have never had any food here that wasn't a least very good and usually extra good
I had the Buffalo chicken wrap it was delicious just really messy and substituted the fries for a side salad
I keep coming back because not only is the beer consistently good but so is the food and the service
I highly recommend you try their food
The catfish was very tasty and flavorful the mac-and-cheese that came with it were okay
Although not authentic George & Son's has pretty good Chinese food
We went there for the lunch buffet today and the food quality was a notch above the typical Chinese buffet
Pretty much only go if you have to have some sodium after a  heavy night of drinking heavily or in dire need of some good ole hip widening comfort food
RED CHIPOTLE CHICKEN PASTA Something different and delicious
Let me just start by saying that we frequent this establishment because the sushi is amazing
We let it slide because overall we always have a good time and the food never disappoints
I've had a few of their other pizzas too which are quite good as well
I understood nachos and we got that minus the chicken im a veg head Those were good they say it is a smaller portion of the Chicken Nachitos on the menu $13 they were $8 for happy hour and pretty good good portion of guacamole on top and we both enjoyed them
My pork sandwich was good - good quality meat prepared well
and you have to have the chilli sauce with the chicken and its just as good with everything else
for our recent trip to arizona instead of eating at some fancy schmancy restaurant in the city or spending our time at the buffet line at the hotel we searched yelp for some seafood
overall the food was good the price was reasonable and the service was fast and attentive
The meat was of pretty good grade for Carne Asada with a very flavorful Chile-rub topped with mushroom cholula sauce on black beans and roasted corn avocado salsa
Our server also recommended a really good dessert wine to go with the tarte and it was fantastic
They have quite a few trays of food and some were good but most were just OK
The deep fried chicken wings were real good and they had a soup they called Mexican soup that had beef tongue in it  it was not bad but out of place in a Chinese buffet
While they have decent wings and a couple good pizzas the menu leaves something to be desired
While the food is good it is definitely not a destination spot for me
In end the food actually comes out really good I'm huge fan of machaca and the red Jade chicken both of which a flavor packed I had the spicy diablo chicken the other day which has heat and flavor
I always get the black beans and jerk fried chicken since those are amazing the rice is probably the most flavorful rice I have had
We waited less than 10 minutes and had piping hot food all the way back to the office
The flavors were pretty good and the meat surprisingly tender
The fresh fish is good but terribly overpriced
There were fresh baked goods fresh squeezed OJ freshly made salads and desserts galore
Anytime I feel like some good Italian food our family heads to RigaTony's
It's hard to rate this place because a good part of the responsibility for the quality of your dish is your own
With talk of delicious beers aside the food here can hold its own in the Flavor Arena
Friendly service healthy food quality ingredients moderate prices - what can be bad
It's not the best mexican restaurant I have ever been to but few restaurants in the area have a variety of green chili dishes let alone good ones
My order of Chicken Vindaloo was absolutely delightful spiced just as I requested HOT
Other than that the food is really authentic and delicious
Pours on the drinks were generous and no one balked when I asked to modify my dinner selection - in fact Paul stopped by to confirm and just set expectations about how he would prepare my meal - a Hawaiian butter fish - which was excellent and the best part of my meal
The food here's good and the employees are extremely nice
This little place is quaint and romantic with excellent food
The first time I went there I was shocked in a good way that the Big Mac looked identical to those heavily made-up ad photos that always make food look impossibly perfect
I recommend anyone try the Tortilla Soup note NOT a chicken tortilla soup
The BBQ sauces are also tasty with the chips they bring out before the food
Good food fun vibe and friendly staff here
The food quality is a 2-star because it was just too bland for the usual flavorful Vietnamese dishes
As other Yelpers suggest this is probably a good place to introduce people to Vietnamese food but if you're looking for authentic/flavorful dishes you should pass
The food was wonderful we got the ahi tuna and empanada appetizers both were delish
Dessert was also really good we had the chocolate torte and the churro's w/ 3 sauces both were a delightful end to the meal rich and tasty
Their spring and egg rolls are pretty good as well and come on a plate in a very aesthetically pleasing manner
you're not ordering the duck confit or the wagyu filet you're ordering an overcheesed pizza overloaded with toppings and a greasy fried appetizer
this being the first time i consumed their food without multiple pitchers of draft beer i'm pretty impressed
it's often difficult to find delicious local food in the southeast valley
The bread is so soft there are so many meats and so many options that sound delicious and best of all I walk out of there actually spending less than I do at subway
I had a chicken burrito and was just unimpressed
I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good cheap food
I recommend the chicken gyoza seared albacore with TINY crispy onion strips chicken yakisoba squid salad pork and veggie gyoza and the shrimp tepanyaki but sub in the appetizer shrimp
The tray of meat comes with 4 nice size pieces of their amazing bread as well
All in all you get really good customer service a lot of food at a CHEAP price cool atmosphere
The food is VERY flavorful the curries really rich watch for the heat though; even mild packs a respectable kick and the prices are great
Thanks Lo-Lo's for my fix of Southern Food - it reminded me of the good ol' days I spent in Atlanta
= So if you are looking for someone to call you sweet nicknames while eating good pizza this is the place for you
The up-side to being absolutely bombarded with food is that there's bound to be something good on the plate
This happened to me as I transitioned from the salad to main dish but when I took the mushrooms home in a to go box and ate them later the more delicate flavor showed through and I appreciated it a lot more
The food was outstanding service excellent and the decore was creativedown to the flower pot wine bucket and old wooden crate that it sat on
Of course tons of southwest chicken rolls and hummus were served along with the delicious beers they are so well-known for
The pizza was fine nothing wrong with it at all - but not worth a 2 hour wait
Everything about this place was fine in my book but absolutely not exceptional or worth the long wait loud space and slow order time for the pizza to arrive at the table
The nice thing about the size is they have to keep stocking up the trays with fresh hot food
Personally I think the group I went with is SO cheap that if you get a big pile of food--discounting quality or taste at all--then you would just loooooove this place
Oh wait I know why I did not want everyone packing this place resulting in no more delicious food for me LOL
OK so it is out of the way for some and yes it does look like a place that may have been really popular in the 1950-70's but that just means they spend more time making the food taste so good
The point is try this place and make sure you do as the old saying goes do not judge a book by it's cover or you may miss out on some really good food
The service is great the food quality is awesome and the ambience is upscale and refreshing
Post soup I had a tasty salad with grilled chicken
For my entree I ordered one of the homemade pasta dishes which was very rustic and delicious although the chicken sausage was a bit heavy handed with the fennel seeds
We also all ordered dessert carrot cake meh I've definitely had better chocolate mousse pretty good but standard bread pudding with a bourbon sauce super rich pretty good and homemade sorbets the lemon being the best and very refreshing
It isn't fancy but the food is excellent and the people are friendly
If you just want some good Mexican food but don't care about the ambiance this is your place
In summary the food was good the service was excellent but I've experienced better at a lower price point than Cowboy Ciao
I just wanted to add my personal wonderful food and drink experience
It is located in an unsuspecting place and in my opinion the location is something that makes it even more appealing -- the food is good enough that if the location was slightly more hip you wouldn't be able to get a seat there
I had the hot roast beef -- and it will be difficult to switch from that option for a while
and the idea of dessert and water with good company still sounded ok it just wasn't the same since I expected something to pick me up in order to keep our conversation flowing
Excellent food good wine awesome atmosphere
I liked that we could order sushi soups  miso and wonton  and tasty currys
We waited around downtown for an hour with some cranky family but once we got the food it was well worth it
We got the Italian Stallion Pizza which was good but if you don't really like lots of meat I would stay away from it it's quite loaded with meat but still very tasty
We also got a really good Pasta dish nice combination of broccoli chicken and penne with a light sauce
The fish and shrimp tacos here are very good
The caprese salad tomato / mozzarella/basil is surprisingly good and the chicken Lavash sp
I would warn against the Chicken Tikka Masala though; the waitress said 'It's good if you like Indian food'; I'd say only try it if you've never tasted the real thing
Me The meat lovers treat which was spaghetti with meatballs and sausage I tried it because it is the Old Spaghetti Factory after all and they should make good Spaghetti and the hub chose the premier which was lasagna and chicken marsala
However if you want GOOD spaghetti and meatballs try Rigatonies all their food is great or Pesto's
This is one of the cleaner ones I have ever been to since it is new but the food is also just as good
This place offers good food at a good value which is just the thing during a recession
The combo beef and chicken fajitas were tasty too
the quality of the food that i had was very very good and the prices are reasonable as well
The food is great the ambiance is good the staff is cheerful but you're paying a lot for that when you can go down the road to In 'n Out Burger and pay a few bucks less for something almost as good
Appleton Rum Sea Scallops app was pretty good couls have used more flavor but what's awful was there were only 2 and our food took forever
They should definitely change this into a main dish add scallops more seasoning & rice and increase the price to make it worth it
A friend and I were looking for a place that boasted delicious food and drinks for brunch last Sunday and we decided to try out NCounter
The setting was as expected cockles and netting with pictures of fish everywhere but the best part for me tonight was the service to match the quality of the meal
I recommend The Fish market here for all of the above
She commented that it was more food than she was expecting and it was quite delicious
I wasn't even gambling and didn't have any drinks so my review is purely based on my love of good food
Tried the pesto ravioli which was amazing brick oven pizza seasoned curly fries  fajitas w/fresh warm tortillas
Special A was usually a roll or sushi pieces with a hot entree and Special B was usually two rolls
And they have a good variety of rolls and other menu options
It was cibolta bread and had a tasty cheese on the meat itself
I'm from New Jersey/New York and go to ASU and came to the conclusion that Arizona has NO GOOD pizza places at all let alone Tempe
What I got was a cold roll with some sweet tasting room temperature pressed meat in it mashed up with some Onions or Green Peppers topped with no cheese that was apparent to the naked eye or could be tasted and some shredded lettuce and tomatoes
High quality ingredients and unique dishes that leave you quite satisfied
It's such high quality that I don't mind dropping a few dollars over the $10 range I try to stay in for lunch and generally it really is just enough food done perfectly with great quality ingredients
This place has a long laundry list of toppings this is why I think the sauce lacked flavor as most don't miss it when they add on a whole meals worth of meat and veggies to a pizza
The peanuty flavor was very much more mild than peanut butter chicken though - fear not
The food was really good and came out in a timely manner
The food is overpriced but the portions are huge and all the food we tried was good
Most items served with fries are in a square bowl so  the bottom fries get soggy under your other food but I don't mind and they still taste good  The food servers in the theater polite and very fast to respond to your call light when you need something
Their menu includes both cold and hot appetizers many pasta dishes and dishes with seafood or meat
I would like to think that the dish is cooked with the heat in it to enhance flavor not just to show off to the non-Asian folk who DARE to have the NERVE to ask for it spicy
The burger is good but the meat is always a bit dry and not juicy
Pappadeaux and Mammadeaux too~ This place is kicken for Happy Hour Mon-Fri 3pm to 6pm with crazy good food at great prices
I would recommend this place to people looking for a small town diner feel tasty food and good prices
It consisted of pork and beef ribs pulled pork chopped brisket and hot links
The meat was very flavorful and good though you could tell it had been sitting out for a while
I have carried out from here a few times now and am impressed with the quality and consistency of the food
I ordered the Spicy Noodles with Chicken again last night -  and it was just as delicious as the last time
We also enjoyed the salmon but were less thrilled with the lobster and scallop roll
The buffet had a great assortment of cheese and antipasta assorted salads pastries huge shrimp and crab legs a tasty ceviche a couple types of sushi and more
Good foodService was good friendly informative
Making delicious rolls cracking jokes and maybe taking a shot from time to time
Still the food at Phoenix Palace was quite good overall
For dessert Gib recommended the pork belly bread pudding
The food reminds us of how delicious food is in the Bay area where we're home
For those wanting to partake of larger portions and delicious food in all of its glory The Good Egg can surely assist too
Going on a Friday morning to The Good Egg was very peaceful indeed quick service with a smile delicious food that will keep one's stomach full for awhile
Their chicken fried steak is huge and I cannot even begin to describe the flavor
My dish came out cold on top and the duck was so dry and over cooked that I couldnt eat it
After not being impressed with the dinner we opted not to order dessert and thankfully so
So everything was delicious including the  fries and some serious haggling took place over who got how many bites of the chicken shawarma
The quality of the food is not what it used to be but Chinese is like pizza- even bad pizza is still good- and China Chili is the same way
The Mongolian chicken and the hot and spicy prawns are awesome though
I appreciate all of the items being under 520 calories but I want my food to taste good and fill me up at the same time
Overall delicious food friendly service tasty drinks trendy atmosphere
I don't like digging through sauce to find meat and the flavor of the meat was covered up by the super rich sweet sauce
Their bacon wrapped meatloaf is good as is their spaghetti
We ordered three dishes and a soup as an appetizer
The noodles were mushy and the dish got cold fast
They need a little bit more work on management but the food was good not great and its Thai food in the west valley what can you say
What that means is that I got to try 10 different dishes on their menu and I only think two are worth coming back for
The spring rolls that I get have pork and shrimp in them and are a pretty good size
The food's excellent the service is excellent and they serve late enough for me to go after work
I have gone here a couple of times and was impressed with the food enough to go back
No real options beyond your standard stadium food of hot dogs nachos popcorn candy etc
When the food came every dish on the table was nuclear hot
I can handle hot food but this was on par with Los Dos Molinos
Beyond that you have earned my love based on your DELICIOUS food and friendly service
It same consistency as tuna salad which kind of throws you off     + Pasta salad Fresh and refreshing without being overly dressed     + Beef roll ups Ate these 3 hours later and they were still super tasty
Their food is so friggin good that i'm craving it right now as I type
The food sometimes is a bit pricey but the food is worth it
If you are wanting to go to have REAL food with quality service and a nice atmosphere go to Tottie's
There's a good size food court and an aquarium too
The food is honest and simple yet amazingly delicious we ordered just about everything on the menu between the two nights and were satisfied with all of the dishes
It was a generous portion of food and it tasted good though it was a bit on the dry side
In all my dining experiences here were A-OK though I'd rather go to Tacos Atoyac for similarly-priced  but higher-quality food
I have enjoyed on multiple occasions their gnocchi with Cardinale sauce a mixture of red and alfredo and today for the first time the meatball sandwich
After a delightful evening made that much better by the company of our dear friends delicious food and drink and warm professional service we left sated
I really like the Filet Mignon Salad Rice Noodles Vermicelli with Chicken All their spring rolls are delicious and I usually have a Ginger Fizz
Dessert was their signature vanilla creme brulee with strawberries for me and their espresso cup chocolate cake with white chocolate marscapone filling topped with coffee ice cream and a light milk chocolate sauce for my husband - both were super tasty
I really didn't care and just ordered 2 rolls which were pretty good
The owner himself helped me and recommended the daily special of a santa fe chicken sandwich
It was thinly sliced and seasoned grilled faux meat on top of a ciabatta and it was wonderful
Were there on vaca and went one night - loved the tacos the Tinga chicken was SOOOO tasty
intrepid war correspondent and amazing foodie recommended Los Dos in his book Apple's America
The fiery fiery mouthwatering food combined with excellent margaritas was one of the best meals I've had at a Mexican restaurant
We thoroughly enjoyed the Macheca and the Red Jade Chicken both as Quesadillas
In a place where chain restaurants and fast food joints are king Pita Jungle only a local chain beckons - even though it's 7 miles away from the hotel I stay when I'm here for work
I'd heard good things about Fez but as a Chicago foodie I have a ridiculously high standard for brunch
they wrap up the hot dog with a sheet of paper and drop the fries inside the packet and roll everything up
I don't look for food now based on what sounds good
The reviews for dessert were good and I do have my Happy Finish list to work on so as tough as it was I had to push forward
The total bill was about $45 which is a little high for brunch but the service was great atmosphere excellent and food incredible
The place was very busy which to me usually means the food is really good
Great staff very inviting wonderful food
When you go out to dinner you want good food and sometimes good service and a pleasantly friendly staff just are not enough
I have to admit that after two rolls calamari and yellowfin tuna I stopped ordering bc the food did not taste good
; I recommended to the my server and a woman he introduced as a manager that the place needed some sushi quality aspects to it i
Before tip my tab was right around $12 and for the quality and quantity of food that I received in one of Phoenix's most popular spots I had no complaints
We ordered and got our food in a good timely manner
The food was excellent and the portions sizes also very good sized
Everyone else at our table ordered chilaquiles with pulled pork and all of them said their dishes were wonderful too
Obviously we didn't have any food or anything but it looked good from what I could see
The wait for the food wasn't bad either but I hate when you as the customer have to ask for a wine list because your wine was empty for 10 minutes but the waiter didn't ask if you wanted anything else because he was focused on the table of 5 women next to us sharing an appetizer
The pasta was a little mushy and the meatballs really didnt have much flavor
They also have the beef patties but happened to be out today booo guess I'll just have to go back Overall a great little spot with perfect service for a little takeout joint excellent food and great island flavor in the heart of Phoenix
The food is fresh tasty and seemingly authentic
For the main course the Butterfish was quite good and I enjoyed the fried rice as well
I buy all my pup cakes here and ALL their food and treats are good for dogs instead of made in china crap
I've had it at their pizza place it's really good
It's one thing to pay a moderate amount for good food with good atmosphere but this place is just Panda Express in trendy clothes
We were just enjoying our afternoon hanging out and eating amazing food
I said maybe we should leave maybe the food is not good
Then a lady came by and said oh the food is very good it's just not busy this time of day
The food was very good and the prices were very low
Otherwise service was prompt and the food was fresh and flavorful
This food will make you question what the heck was that other Mexican food you once thought to be delicious
Scale of 1-10 multiple visits8 Food8 Service8 Atmosphere8 ValueBack in high school i worked at a wonderful local ice cream shop in Texas called Milwaukee Joe's
The food was good a little bit on the salty side but it had flavor and great presentation
The culture was very hip making for a great environment for good food and good coversation with a group of friends
Not too many places offer it and we both love a good chili on any kind of bad for ya meat
The food is good although nothing terribly special
But it's good tasting food served hot with a friendly staff at a good price
Always good traditional food and not extremely over priced
He had sat us down in a very artistic yet uncomfortable table and that's when our feast began~- Haemul Pa Jun [Seafood and Veggie Pancake]  The haemul pa jun was delicious
It had the most amazing dipping sauce and was quite a large dish
This is a great place to go for some drinks with friends or to indulge in their wonderful food
There weren't a lot of food choices - I had a cheese enchilada that was pretty good a chile relleno that was just okay some beef fajita meat that was fatty and tough average rice and beans
The waitress didn't want to be bothered and the meatballs and the tomato sauce on the spaghetti didn't have much flavor
I highly suggest if you like healthy food to try this place out it is definitely worth it
Sushi has plenty of the good stuff - wasabi makes you feel alive
Still wonderful with large flakes of white fish accompanied by that lovely sweet sticky sauce
I was happy to escape the fate of the exploding man in Monty Python's Meaning of Life sketch 'just a little wafer monsieur' but it was the quality of the food not its quantity which captured my stomach's praise
You have a more spacious restaurant more friendly staff amazing flexibility in customer service and more generosity with the dishes London's 'premium' menu sushi selection only included salmon tuna and yellowtail - no sign of any toro And to achieve this in the middle of the desert
BeersSmoked Porter - interestingIrish Red ale - tastyImperial IPA - yummyAmerican Brown ale - goodThey only have one Appetizer which is the pizza sticks
I did take a bite to see how well excuted the pizza was and I must say I found it pretty good with a great crust
Even though  I had enjoyed the couple bites of pizza I stopped because the gorgonzola taste would eventually overwhelm me and then I would hate it
I've made several visits to the Chicago Hamburger Co I was initially introduced by a friend who knew that I was originally from Illinois and missed some good old fashioned Midwest comfort food
It was pretty good on this occasion the beef itself was kinda average but the bread was PERFECTION and I was pleased
I used to think this place was really good when I went to school in Arizona but when I moved to San Francisco I learned what real Italian food should taste like
Nice simple Mexican food at a great price love the charbroiled steak and the beans so flavorful with out a lot of stuff added
Next time I will try the combo cause the beef was so tasty I know that charbroiled chicken will be just a good if not better
The lamb entree is good and surprisingly I tried the chicken cordon bleu and it was terrific
Most amazing though is the Grand Canyon dessert -- layers and layers of chocolate and peanut butter mousse
The food was all hot and the taco shells were really very good
There was a delicious smoky grilled taste to the food that I loved
The service here is fast the food is fantastic and this is a great place to seek out for a delicious lunch or dinner
The food is so so good but there's one huge problem -  I end up with bad stomach issues every time I eat here - regardless of what I order on separate occasions fried shrimp pineapple burger volcano plate salad fries chicken bowl
too bad really 'cause the food though kinda generic was pretty good
Postinos normally good service food is ok but that blonde server on Sunday placed a sour note on breakfast
There is no indication of how you order your food and when you finally figure it out the food does not taste good
I have never had a burger/sandwich or fries as pizza is the only way to go for us but I'm sure they are good
The food wasn't bad it just wasn't as good as I come to expect from the place
The service is excellent and the food is consistent from store to store and very happy with that
I was craving great pizza and this place was recommended by a friend so I went to check it out
I also enjoyed their chicken lettuce wraps and their french fries
a mini sandwich of Maytag blue on the sideGreat ingredients tasty food and easy on the wallet to boot
I know they don't go together  but the food was super fresh and delicious and some worked together
The crab puffs were good the egg roll was OK
One other thing I asked for hot mustard and yes they brought me out packets like you would find at a fast food place
Bryan and I have been here a few times since opening - had one bad experience with cold food
This meat is of superior quality and so there is very little needed to be done to it to make it taste fantastic
Look I can go on and on about the tasty virtues of their perfectly cooked meats
Avoid it if good food means anything to you
The first time I got food to go I was pleasantly surprised by the taste and quality of the dishes
They add in sesame seed to the mixed dumpling meat to give it an extra depth of flavor and texture and the clear broth is very tasty and perfect for a cold winter night
Roast beef Asiago very tasty and the french onion soup was awesome with the melted cheese inside
--- the food is a little overpriced and not worthy of 5 stars but the concept of this restaurant / movie theater makes up for it many times over
The food is on par with typical 4 star hotel Hilton Hyatt etc
Food  Good to OKService Good to OKOysters; YummyLike Dottsy Z
Very aromatic nice amount of meat and delicious
On my second trip I had the Chicken Wings recommended in The Republic as delicious equally PHABULOUS and have had them often since
I had the fish tacos happy hour appetizer for dinner and they we cooked and seasoned well
If you want the full dining experience get pretty much any entree delmonico and salmon come especially recommended a side of crab mac and cheese and the strawberry shortcake for dessert
You could come here just based on the quality of the food but on top of that they are VERY nice
They have fantastic happy hour deals on food and drinks--  hard to believe how they keep those prices on such good food
I actually enjoyed my meal more so than the soup and sushi
The meat is well seasoned and tasty and the avacado adds a nice creamy note
charred yet tender beef in the most amazing marinade
The other menu items are tops I loved the Stuffed Shells & the Garlic Bread with CheeseThe Desserts are good also and you have to try them
I had the Albatross fish sandwich and it was very good
Ended up going to Pong Pong chinese also based on my Yelp research had to wait a LONG time since I didn't have time to pre-order it but it was VERY good food
This is more than a sandwich shop it's a stop and shop for quality meats and cheeses
The food here was pretty good as was the location
I personally like Chase's I have gone here quite a few times with my kids for dinner and they have good burgers and home-style comfort food just never had breakfast
So I ordered the works skillet that had peppers onions ham potatoes and came with English muffing now that was some good food
The pools are heated and huge and the hotel restaurant has solid food
Very clean friendly atmosphere fast good food
If you're looking for something good and fast and don't want to settle for the typical fast food fare give this place a try
The pizza was excellent--thin crust and perfectly crispy
After reading some reviews on Yelp I was intrigued but embarrassingly I was swayed by a picture of the 'meat and potatoes martini' in the hotel tourist magazine
Overall the service is good and staff are friendly but I won't bring my guest there because the decoration is not nice and food is just OK
The food was good but not worth coming back for with the horrible service
The food doesn't isn't close to having the authentic flavor however if you know that going into it you're going to enjoy your meal
I love their appetizer list which includes mini tacos mini burritos a tasty Mexican pizza and more
And the food was good too We are new to the area and have a favorite sub place back in Michigan called Jersey Giant where everything is freshly sliced and huge
We ate the whole pizza between the two of us just because it was so damn good
It is a quality pizza place with good prices
I've purchased food from them 4 times and have enjoyed it each time
In conclusion though if you want a quality pizza or stromboli this is the place
I make sure to get a bite with waffle and chicken syrup covered and a dash of hot sauce
Now the part of town is a bit sketchy and the interior is nothing fancy but the quality of food and the prices were right in line with what I wanted
They actually give you large strips of flavorful tender chicken
Very big portion and the fish was very good
Unfortunately the food was not as good as the decor though it did show potential and maybe it would have been better if we had ordered differently
The pizza had a satisfying flavor but it would not stand out against other good pizzas I've had
The food on our visit was not great but if you order right you could be in for a good meal
Food is pretty good and definitely stands out from the normal fast food fare
Haagen-dasz ice cream shake in vanilla chocolate strawberry or mixed up creates a very tasty side or dessert
The Gladiator is your more traditional style pizza and the Roasted Corn had such an refreshing unique merriment of flavors
Adorable bungalow building CheckQuirky cute mismatched thrift-store dishware CheckDelicious buttery flaky croissant breakfast sandwich CheckSuper friendly staff CheckI went here for the first time yesterday and thought it was great
2-Their servers do not do a good quality check with food coming out of the kitchen and this is the 2nd time I've observed this - see first review; Our burgers which both should have come with more toppings on them both did not have said toppings and the server didn't note this until I had to tell her
The boys enjoyed their enchiladas mom didn't care for her mushroom dish & my sandwich was just ok
I thought I wrote a review on this place but we will try this again this place sits in a half empty mall but it is a great down home breakfast spot but they also do lunch and dinner Service is good wends day and Friday are fish fry night  which we gave a whirl as well it was good but being from Seattle we have a tough time finding good seafood except at sushi restaurants we frequent this place is well worth a try
I'm on a mission to find good Mexican food in AZ
But I'll overlook that if the prices are good and the food is enjoyable
We ordered an appetizer of Vietnamese shrimp and vegetable rolls
The chicken was a little overdone but had a nice roasted flavor
I would recommend sitting near the front sushi bar along the right hand side if you want to see what's the freshest
The radishes may vary in size but tend to be large and are always tasty
I was really impressed with the pizza I ordered the thin crusted Sicilian with capicola ham salami sausage and topped with fresh basil
It was the best pizza I had eaten in a long time and the person accompanying me had chosen a very good pie too
The pizza was good but I can't imagine ordering anything other than that off the menu
I don't go to eat somewhere for the decor anyway I go for the good food
We were showed to our table our waitress was Jennifer very nice and very sweet she explained the menu to us since it was both our 1st time there we ordered the Cowboy Stuff which was bbq ribs & chicken crispy shrimp steak & seafood kabobs beans veggies potatoes wedges and some other stuff I have to say the one thing that stood out was the ribs omg they are fall off the bone melt in your mouth good
I went here with my mother after a recommendation from one of her friends because I had a craving for Thai food
My mom had some dish with silver noodles and was also impressed
Normally that would be a good thing but it took around five or so minutes for her to take our orders in and bring out the food
I would definitely come back here again if I had a craving for some good food or spicy dishes
Look it's not high end french cuisine but it's damn good family style food
It was all really good but I think the chicken shawarma was the winner
The HH prices were very good - $4-$8 for most sushi rolls and $6 for my oh so tasty white cosmo
Amazing view and good food equals a win win
Then watch as your hot dog is mutilated in front of your eyes and what appears on your tray is what looks like a hot mess of decapitated food
I tried the Short Rib which was excellent and they enjoyed the Filet however it 'wasn't comparable to his $200 Kobe beef experience in Japan' - but then again I have some high maintenance friends
I was impressed by how tender the meat was until I realized it had probably been tenderized with a sodium solution
Food was tasty kind of like an elegant new Italian with fun presentation
Speaking of polenta I loved how my grilled prawns went with my slightly firmer polenta and the flavors in the dish
Two pizzas I enjoyed the most were Combo and Mama Spinato's pizza
It's kept very clean the staff is friendly and the food is DELICIOUS
We started our evening with a bottle of red wine Dina's recommendation of a Cabernet-Sangiovese blend that was perfect - smooth and tasty - and perfectly paired with our food choices
We shared plates of rich butterfish seasoned with basil and orange a tuna/sashimi dish laced  with truffle sauce and an incredibly delicious dish San Danielle Prosciutto that is surrounded by homemade pickles and red peppers
What an incredible culinary feast - each dish was carefully prepared delicious and the presentation was fabulous
For dinner; the tenderest steak and a side chicken enchilada--wonderful
The prices are a bit on the higher side but for the quality of food I'l keep going back
My husband was impressed by good ground beef they use and enjoyed cherry coke too
The pizza crust was just the right mix of crunch and chew and the toppings and cheese were fresh and flavorful
We came here on a recommendation as this is a good spot for sushi
Some days the overall food quality-to-service results in a five star experience and other trips are closer to three
The food is really good but there is no reason to be snobby about it
I spent a few years in the Bay Area where I became accustomed to tasty hole in the wall Indian food joints rich with sauces and flavors
The restaurants were often uncomfortable or dirty but in spite of that the food made it worth the trip
First of all there is very little quality Indian food in the Phoenix metro so that alone sets it apart
The naan was fantastique and the food was almost as good but not quite
I was having a good time eating my lunch until I noticed that there were shrimp allergy in the squash dish
Given the splendid food it hasn't bothered me all that much but better trained and/or selected staff would help make the Scratch experience not just delicious but flawless
I purchased and entire shave kit with lots of goodies more samples and the sales girl threw in a bamboo soap dish bonus
Being a fairly routine person myself I regularly enjoy their mexican pizza but have also tried and enjoyed their chalupas tostadas burros and enchiladas
As other reviews for this place go taste of the food is good
And he wasnt satisfied with the taste of his chicken appetizer either
I had the shrimp appetizer and hummus friends had the chicken sandwich sweet potatoe fries and a cheese quesadilla not many veggie options oh and they charged her $9 for it
Needless to say the service was HORRIBLE and the food wasn't good enough to make up for it
I was so impressed with the service and the delicious food that I drug a friend visiting from San Francisco there for dinner
He was impressed with the curried duck dish he ordered and that they had his favorite imported beer
Recommended  Beef or chicken Prig Khing curry pork fried rice red curry duck and a Thai Iced Tea
We tried the shrimp rolls with the crunchy center excellent the cajun chicken which reminded me of the Louisiana that I just visited and the creme brulee a don't miss with its real vanilla beans--which drives my gf wild
The seafood buffet had oysters smoked salmon shrimp cocktail and some gazpacho shooters weren't my fave but worth a try
I'm from LA so finding good Mexican food in Arizona that suits the style I'm used to has been pretty disappointing
Anyway I am obsessed with shredded beef crispy tacos and this place has really good ones
Also if anyone has any recommendations for great crispy shredded beef tacos closer to N
So how many of you actually went in for dinner hoping for good food
Pizza is quite tasty and after the bars it is just about perfect
My recommendations absolutely hit up the fish tacos and the Oaxacan hot dog
The fish tacos are fantastic - lightly battered crunchy crisp and tasty yeah for being well-seasoned
The service the first time and each subsequent visit was excellent and the food was brought out ridiculously fast
Phoenix has pretty slim pickings when it comes to good pizza or at least pizza that I'm accustomed to
Even dishes you would think would be spicy and exciting somehow manage to be tame and underflavored
Food-wise they have excellent pizza and sandwiches
I got the grilled chicken with the sauteed mushrooms and really enjoyed it
Consequently we had great expectations for our entrees- if the service was bad at least our food would be good but alas to our dismay again we were somewhat disappointed
So glad I found shar's now my family enjoys homemade wheat bread and pizzas and all sorts of yummy things that are good for them too
I mean the food is good try the Rasher burger and fish and chips the drinks are cool 3 dollar Carlsbergs but something is seriously missing
Ok it's defintely worth stopping in and grabbing a burger or fish and chips and a couple guiness' and if you feel the same way I do let me know why because I sure don't
The meat was burnt and didn't even taste good plus they came plain
Price wise it was a little higher than other restaurants Seems to be $18-25 per person we had been to however the quality of the food is well worth it
Unfortunately we were too full to try the dessert but that's OK because there's nothing wrong with filling up with meaty goodness
We were craving flavorful salsa and well-spiced meat dishes after a long warm day in the desert
Hamburger Helper-esque flavored shredded beef tacos according to my teen son
Ok the beer specials during the games was a great deal with $3 anything beers pretty cute waitstaff  I wish I remembered my waitresses name but she was very sweet and looked like she was 16 but very nice and quick with drinks especially since we had like 20 people in my group I love places where waitresses can keep up with a ton of tabs and not complainOverall very good I only had scalloped potatoes since I was not feeling well but everyone said the food was good
I like salty food but very salty and no orange or spice and the texture was odd not good
I love to browse thrift stores for good finds and I have done well on cookware dishes and books here
The quality of the food was also above average  bread was fresh meat was tender
How dare they take a day off with good food like that just waiting to be served
The timing was just fine although I've ordered one of their chicken entrees before and waited just a few more minutes longer than ordering the pho and well worth the satisfaction to follow
The meats are perfectly portioned for dipping in the sauces that are at each table and of course the ending gulps are the most flavorful
I wouldn't recommend going to this place if you want some good Mexican food
I also asked if they had any good appetizers for us to share the gentleman on the phone recommended there pizza biscuits so I figured I'd give them a try
The cheese raviolis were tasty and the meat sauce was rich
I was very impressed with the pizza biscuits; they were very greasy but thats probably why they were so good
Overall we were really impressed with the food and the order was prepared in about 15 minutes
I've never had the food here but I've heard from people who have that's it's good
Ate in tonight and the food was fine it was the service that was not good
There was a large group of odd looking hygienically challenged old Indian men running around  I think they were the bus boys but they came by to clean a table next to us and liberally spayed Windex all over the place so that added a nice flavor to our food and he then decided the carpet on the front part of our table needed vacuuming right then and there so he broke out the vacuum and went to town for about five Min's nice
Wonderful tea comfy seating and great food
Is it fair that I crave more of an original place than a chain because I've been browbeaten into believing that chains don't serve quality food
Conversely I also love pizza - and this town has good pizza joints
The food here is amazing try the Machaca beef tacos I prefer them with no garnish
This is another real authentic Mexican food place in the Phoenix Metro area that has quality Mexican food at a great price
Even the egg roll was good with fresh veg inside
The food was good and we ordered way too much
We had tableside guac with chips and salsa delicious Peruvian stew a chicken dish and black halibut usually black cod
The sauce on the roasted chicken was spicy and delicious
The dessert was full of caramel goodness and I just had to break my dessert fast to have a few bites
Grecian Delight Pizza was pretty good as well
I could taste the meat the tomato the seasonings but none of those overshadowed the others - the flavors were perfectly balanced
I should have stopped at this point but had to see if their desserts were of the same quality as my salad and entree
Oh sure the roll isn't nearly as good as Delassandro's my favorite in Philly' and it probably doesn't measure up to this year's winner Johnny's Hots in Philadelphia Magazine but these people are doing a great job with what they have
It's known to be authentic and the food was definitelty tasty and served REALLY hot
Not a good sign and a sad day for Japanese food
I hear the wings were tasty They were really big I just don't eat wings I ordered the fish and chips
Why in the world did they think having the dessert trucks way in the back all clumped together was a good idea
A friend recommended we come here but  confessed she'd never had the sushi
Would not recommend for anyone looking to actually enjoy sushi
The food is very good they slice the meat tableside
The other winners are the Burger Alfredo and the Hot Pepper Chicken sandwich
The Hot Pepper Chicken sandwich has a chicken breast that is marinated in lime juice and is topped with jalapenos and honey
Cool bar along with a good food menu gives AZ 88 four stars
6 The food is pretty good hot and fresh
The food was too salty completely masking the flavor of the dishes we ordered and making me wonder if they salvage leftovers by re-cooking them and adding more salt gross
With so many other restaurants in the area including several Thai restaurants within 5 miles we would much rather go somewhere with happy nice employees and flavorful food
The marinade in red wine gives the beef an edge up in flavor
i ordered the chicken and vegetables and it came out hotfreshand big in portion size
the hot and sour soup and spring rolls are to die for too
*Ambiance = good*Service = pretty good they were eager to help*Food = good but not superb
I have been a loyal customer over the years and even though owners have changed the great quality of food has stayed the same
The chicken wasn't that supermarket kind of ground but was more like chopped up well chicken that was moist with some developed flavor and not just cooked and tossed in
After waiting over an hour and listening to all the people raving about how good the food was outside I had high hopes
I figured why not I really couldn't remember the quality of the food so I decided we'd give it a go
All in all the dish was a good combination of flavors and adequately priced for the ingredients
They also serve food and judging from the delicious sandwich I had a ham and swiss on multi grain grilled of the build your own variety I will be back for more as soon as I make it out to Cave Creek again
We went out to brunch with a large party and had the breakfast buffet the food was amazing but the service was awful
Sandwiches aren't cheap - at least $6 for a regular plain turkey sandwich on whole wheat bread - but these guys give you a LOT of good quality turkey on good quality seed wholegrain bread not one of those sandwiches where all you're eating is bean sprouts in dire hopes of actually tasting the deli meat
I wasn't too keen on the quality of the beef plus mine was undercooked but not enough to complain
We enjoyed ribs and pulled pork the food was just right
I will tell you - Chocolate desserts that are chocoholic quality
My favorites are the#2 Big John Medium rare roast beef with simple lettuce tomatoes and mayo #3 Totally Tuna House made tuna celery onions tasty sauce alfalfa sprouts cucumber lettuce and tomatoesOf the 2 I really dig the Tuna
I went in there to get some really basic stuff for my fish tank and the people there didn't really have anyone that knew anything about fish and they didn't have a good selection at all
I heard a lot of good things about this place and was looking forward to some great food
All of the food is insanely delicious
Dessert was very good - ABBA Tribute band was awesome we had a really good time & really enjoyed the show
I've gone to plenty of sushi spots and none can compare to the quality of Hiro's nigiri
Usually it comes right before the sushi and makes a delicious and light appetizer
The food is good enough even with gluten-free options
Honestly the food is overpriced and I wouldn't go without a groupon deal on the tickets which they have available like every month but the overall experience was fun and definitely worth it
We ordered a bunch of appetizers  meat skewers and chicken skewers chicken pork and mahi street taco's guacamole and the pork ribs
There is no competition here for them - Sandbar food is not great the other 2 places here are good but not awesome
Their signature deep dish apple pie also made for a good dessert
The chicken was a little watery but delicious
Good service pretty good food long wait for your meal
The fries are really good and I LOVE the dipping sauce they give you for the chicken tenders
The food was good but not fabulous or anything
The teriyaki chicken was pretty good though and I loved the cream cheese crab won tons
I have so many dishes that I love that it is hard not to spend a fortune when going there so now that I live on my own I save this place for special occasions and good paychecks
brings back memories to the good old days waking up to food just like this that my moms used to make
good food cheap prices and friendly service
and I added chicken for an additional $3 worth it
This is a great location though you'll have to pay to park before 6p and a nice atmosphere to enjoy a glass of wine delicious food and conversation
The food was good but I wouldn't recommend going there if that is how they are goign to treat their customers
There are plenty of other options out there with good food that will be happy to take my money
Priced at about $15 an entree I expected excellent food
Also had the soup of the day which was excellent the highlight of the food
However the food is not as good as one might expect from previous Yelp reviews
To be fair some of the food items are pretty good - above average even
Their chicken is crappy and their alfredo sauce is flavorless
Food is pretty good I highly recommend the oven baked cookie with ice creme as dessert
I didn't try the food I came in strickly for some sugary goodness
Went for lunch just this afternoon as a matter of fact and it always amazes me how I forget how good the food is between visits even the complimentary corn bread
I also recommend the Wild Mushroom Enchiladas and Baked Seafood Enchiladas
My girlfriend had a chicken burrito which she enjoyed
I had the chicken fajitas which were good as well
The food was good but not great enough to make me run back out
I really liked the restaurant itself and our server was nice but I must say I wasn't really impressed with the food
The 2nd was a panko fried chicken which was moist and delishous but nothing amazing HOWEVER the 3rd chicken was an orange peel fried chicken that way just so good beyond words
Lastly the Wagyu beef short ribs were so so so amazing I mean I never wanted the taste to leave my mouth
Wife - Teriyaki Chicken very good even though all places only sell breast meat on chicken entrees
Noteworthy dishes we ordered include a foie gras starter diver scallops served with bacon and mustard and the souffle
Yoshi's is delicious for quick fast-food style asian cuisine  Noodles with broccoli and chicken is da bomb
I stopped in for lunch with my blind friend who despite having lost his vision years ago can feel out good food from eight miles away
So overall Ajo Al's gets a B for food quality but a D for prices
Still the same wonderful homemade fresh food that it's always been served in the same comfortable atmosphere
Yes it's slow but good homemade food takes time people
I'll have to agree with the previous posts about good food but crummy service
Typically you have other customers just looking at eachother wondering if it's your food or theirs
They are just plain rude but the pizza is so good argh
The Good the Bad and the UglyThe Good Food and friendly sincere service that is available late night will defiantly earn my 4th star
The plain California roll was also excellent
They also have delicious mac'n'cheese pizza and WINE
I've only experienced the bar and am eager to return to try the food-it smells wonderful
All three were AMAZING but the teriyaki beef was the winner for me
it is close cozy comfortable and has good food
I was so disappointed with the quality of the fish and the actual rolls
As for the food the chips and salsa were decent and my veggie enchiladas were good
Like others I was brought here by the good reviews; especially those of the gnocchi which is probably the only type of Italian food I'd pay money to go out and eat y'know spaghetti and all that pasta-y type stuff is so easy to make at home
The first part of my spicy tuna roll was pretty good but the pieces were overly large 4 of them compared to the other 4
I can't speak for anything else but their sushi but i would NOT recommend this place to one single person
This is a great little sandwich shop which serves fresh bread quality meats fat sliced french fries and the best frozen drink out there
Our server said it was one of their most popular appetizers and I can see why it was plenty of food for two people to split and had a ton of cheese
The mushroom was really juicy and brought a healthier aspect to the dish and I really enjoyed it
because the food was overall good in flavor
Good food and drinks there service is pretty good too with some friendly waitresses
The food was excellent I was rather impressed with how good their turkey and stuffing were as well as the bread and potatoes
The reason why I'm a fan is because I love being able to create different combinations with the ingredients that I like they have a ton of options and they have quality fish
The food is not even close to any representation of what good Greek food tastes like
The first rule of good let alone great food is FRESH
I could eat the jade red chicken all day yeah it's that good
The jerk chicken was good but it was too peppery like I was forewarned
The prices are right the food is piping hot and the menu is extensive
The food looks really good a very extensive menu and full bar
The puking makes me want to run back to Kyoto Bowl for good cucumber rolls and better prices
The salad rolls were mediocre; at a Vietnamese restaurant I frequent these are filled with lettuce mint cilantro shrimp pork and have a delicious refreshing taste
I have not had larb many times but when I first had it many moons ago it was delicious ground beef with ground rice along with some nice herbs and spices in a delicious dish
Delivery was fast and efficient but with my quibbles about the price and quality of the food well I might go back for one last-ditch try but with all the bad reviews here on Yelp already I am extremely reluctant to try anything else and I will likely skip this in favor of more tasty delivery menus in my area
They had good food as well such as chicken and dumplings which I consider cozy and a great home cookin' meal
It's hard to find an establishment that offers delicious food AND excellent service these days
Everyone enjoyed their food I had the chicken pot pie
Francis left me longing for the tiny digs and reliably excellent food of Matt's
It is never a good thing when a table full of famiodis foodies take in an entire meal at a new place without a single rave or a 'holy socks Batman this is killer
The menu is typical of Arizona mexican fast food places but Rivas is unique in that their rolled tacos are delicious and the accompanying guacamole is tasty as well
At this point the dining experience was really good but then the food came out
I recommend the Hawaiian ham pepperoni and pineapple  the Flaumbay pepperoni green bell peppers garlic and pineapple or the RASPOTLE chicken roasted red bell peppers raspberry chipotle sauce and a choice of feta or goat cheese/no mozzarella cheese
They make a wonderful tomato sauce that adds to the taste of the fresh veggies and meat
There are at least 7 closer to our house with better sushi so it is doubtful we would go back unless we were in the neighborhood and then the food was good enough to return
They dont need to because the meat is that good but most sauces are bad and you would actually want them to drence the meat with there sauce
Consequently after some time lapse from the date of reading the esteemed recommendation of this Shop having 'THE GREATEST CARNE ASADA in the Valley' we FINALLY visited and experienced their food last night for dinner
This is UNHEARD of in the Valley where GREAT MEXICAN FOOD abounds and is generally offered at a very good value
Food was good but certainly NOT THE GREATEST CARNE ASADA in the Valley
Should you be looking for a REAL MEXICAN FOOD experience with highly anticipated supreme flavors and substantial portions do yourself a favor and pass on this place
The food and drink not to mention the happy hour prices make this place more than worth it
Mainly for their awesome menu and delicious food but maybe because of that cute waiter too
Sure you spend your parking fee and then some on booze and food but we still had a good time
Food is always good here service can be slow but today was super quick
The greens were in excellent shape and rolled fast but true
We had a five-star experience with excellent food paired with top-notch service with genuine smiles and friendliness all around
I have been there a few times now and unfortunately the menu changed in the week between my visits but both the chicken tacos and the veggie tacos are both good
Both the House Special Chow Mein and the Kung Pao Beef were odorless flavorless and unappatizing
They're always going on about the frickin Yankees bitching about how there's no good pizza for thousands of miles or when they feel sappy whining about how they miss autumn
And what he should eat is the chicken wings because they're damn good and this is coming from a guy that usually doesn't bother because navigating chicken skin and tendons to try and get full is a pain in the ass
Service could be a little better from the cashierhaving eaten here twice now it is hard to get a smile out of her but the food is excellent
Instead you check off items on a printed menu much like those in many sushi places with an accompanying page of photos of the various dishes
The eggplant sauce was quite mild our server was right about the chili oil but beautifully flavored and the beef slices were a great addition
This is another place that I would encourage all Yelpers to go patronize because they serve up great food with a smile and a lot of heart and are more than worthy of our hard earned dollars
We ordered the pizza and wings special with half cheese/half mushroom on the pie and half mild/half honey bbq on the wings note was not consulted on the wings as I definitely would have gotten hot wings
The pizza had nice flavor but as I've seem to run into lately I never get nice crisp on my thin crust pizzas
Anyways I think getting a pizza onsite hot and fresh would probably be pretty good
For the purist you can order a combination plate of classic Filipino dishes and select your own items or you can go for something more unconventional yet accessible like many of its tasty hybrid burritos chimichangas and flautas
Karey's version is absolutely delicious with its rich savory flavors and tender meats
Keeping with the hybrid fusion theme desserts are few but interesting and worth the calories
Visited this restaurant last weekend and while the food I had was good the service was slow and we had to wait forever for our check
Also some great soups - both Pork Posole & Chicken Corn Chowder are especially good
I would recommend Jade Palace to anyone who wants great food and great service
The basil pizza then arrived when we were ready for it BUT it was COLD
This place is cheaper and maintains a better quality of food
I went with some co-workers one day when I wasn't in the mood for a burger and tried the fried chicken instead and wasn't very impressed
We are self-professed foodies good cooks etc
I have never had any customer service issues and the food has always been consistent in flavor
The food is pretty good and they have a wide range of burgers and wings with around 12 different sauces
The food is a little pricey compared to the drinks but still a good deal
One of the best burgers I've had in years though knowing that I had paid someone to grind up meat that good made me sad
I came here this afternoon because I was feenin for some sushi and heard good things about this place
I had a shrimp roll with crunchy tempura on top with 3 side sauces sweet chilli a peanut flavored one  wasn't feeling this and the Spicy mayo My favorite
what it lacks is good food and a decent crowd
Anyway that's my issue not a judge of the quality of food at any restaurant
My wife and I have eaten at Petite Maison twice this summer and both times we have been impressed by the food and the service
We used to be regulars at Metro but have now decided to switch due to superior quality food better value and swifter more attentive service at PM
We recommend the foie gras the fish dinner for two the salmon and the steak frites
The meat is so tender and flavorful and the cheese is fresh fluffy and not too salty
I had a Beef Nortena which was flavorful and spicy and HUGE
Our server kept our waters filled the vibe is always cool no nonsense healthy good food
While the atmosphere is a little too hippie/hipster for my general liking the food was really good and the staff were awesome and very willing to help us first timers
the music was great the lighting was nice and the food was amazing
Volcano Flamed thinly sliced beef seared on hot stone
The beef actually comes to the table raw and you literally cook it for 40 seconds per side on a hot stone
Red curry tofu - We ordered a side of steamed rice which you really have to do in order to enjoy all of the amazing sauce in this claypot dish
High quality pet food snacks toys cloths and staff that care
I just moved to the area and after doing a little research online I found that this place carried not only the high end food I feed my dog but also the brand of shoes I wanted to protect my dog's feet from the hot ground here in Phoenix
I looked some more and they carry or deal in just about every high end food on the market and just about anything worth getting for your dog and they even have a few items for your feline friend too
Couple slabs of ham Some weird chicken fried steak looking thingy and 3 hot dogs split in half and grilled
I was a fan of everything except the hot dogs and chicken fried steak looking strips
We went to Tacos Atoyac for lunch again and really enjoyed the food based on a recommendation from Iain B
Their food is extremely fresh unique and delicious
Food ~ You order your food when you walk in and they bring you your delicious oaxacan-Mexican food to you accompanied with a side of cooked jalapenos onions and salsa you can choose green red or a guacamole infused salsa
They too were very good with a nice balance of fresh guacamole and loads of meat in their burros
Probably not my favorite pizza joint but a good variety of pizza and great location for sure
Best fresh donuts aroundkills dunkin in value and freshness + tasteGood meat specials on thursday
The burger was really good save for a bit too much salt and the meat was med-well instead of medium
My food was hot and amazing when my to go bag was delivered the two friends I had with me had the BBQ chicken and Ribs with the mac n cheese and greens both friends commented on how good their food was so we are giving a local family owned Water and Ice shop 5 stars
The food and service was good but the place was small
Food shopping clubs bars Bliss spa beautiful ppl pole-dancing studios everything you'd need for a bachelorette party ;- Hotel staff were great very accommodating
An entire pasta dish w/ chicken chorizo green peppers onions etc  layer on top of the softest most delicious tortilla I have ever tasted
The amazing thing was that we were jamming out cart after cart each shopping cart could accommodate 6 shopping bags of foodstuffs for needy families of donated deliciousness and the line out front consumed them as fast as we could create them
The menu has surplus of good dishes including nice salads
Tappenyaki 3/5I can't judge on how good the food tastes but I sure enjoyed their impressive performance
Unfortunately the show was the highlight of our dining experience at Kyoto restaurant and hopefully the food tasted as good as the performance
I should put a disclaimer from the start that this was my first chicken and waffle experience but that aside this was the best fried chicken I have ever had regardless of delicious waffle and syrup additions
From the decor to the delicious utilization of local food this is a place that I highly recommend to everyone
I lopped one star due to the usually wonderful service being off last night but the seafood tower with iced crab oysters on the half shell and pink chubby shrimp the size of a child's fist can go far to assuage lax service
We ordered a basket of string fries as an appetizer and our waitress suddenly had bigger fish to fry since we didn't order the tower or another ginormous spendy menu item like we usually do
Especially when I finally did go there and realized the food here is AMAZING
The sampler was more than enough for two people -- everything was good but especially the chicken
I found the quality of food and scope of sandwiches offered to be comparable to Dilly's Deli
I found the wiseguy with italian meats and cheeses sub to be pretty tasty but I prefer my subs to not swim in oil and vinegar
For those who don't eat beef like me there's a good selection of chicken and even a vegetarian option
Smashburger's Arizona chicken burger grilled is quite good -- flat and kinda smashed which makes sense quality chicken well cooked Habanero cheese guacamole lettuce tomato onion spicy chipotle mayo and jalapeu00f1os on a spicy chipotle bun I got mine without the jalapeu00f1os - I figured I might be feeling that the rest of the afternoon in the office
Food we ordered the pretzel nuggets w/cheese because I'd had them at Culinary Dropout and knew they were addictively good
The quality of the food was okay but the quantity was very small except the bread - there was LOTS of bread
Regardless the food here is delicious and compared to other places I did not feel like I ingested a tub of butter
Delicious breakfast food with a cool hip feel
Thankfully I gave up my veggie tendencies because the food here is incredibly delicious
The horseradish had no kick to it but the flavor was definitely there
But I really love that sinus-clearing sensation of good fresh horseradish
The food is very good but you get so little for what you spend
The service was excellent the bistro was quite attractive on the inside and the food was above average
I thought my expectations might have been to high based on the name but my wife who is not fond of hot foods also thought the food somewhat bland
The group next to us ordered pizza which looked and smelled pretty good actually
The food is pretty great- I had the rosemary chicken sandwich today which I would recommend
It's in a less than desirable part of town which usually doesn't spell doom necessarily but in this case it really doesn't fit in with the local flavor of pawn shops/payday loans/fast food chains all over the place
The menu changes often so I can't really recommend any particular dishes other than the amazing Thai shrimp and coconut soup the one dish that's always on the menu
For a special occasion or a splurge night out you won't be disappointed by Mosaic's beautiful restaurant and surroundings excellent staff and wonderful food
so 3 stars for locally grown food good service and a little pricey
Have you ever had a roll so good that you thought it was laced with some addictive illegal substance
Words can't capture how tasty these rolls were - warm fresh from the oven fluffy and melt-in-your-mouth fantastic
It'd be one thing if the food were worth it but like I said I think I ordered the wrong thing
Even if you take away the amazing beer - the food is great too
But then there are the Salmon BLT the Carne Adovada and Chicken Enchiladas - AMAZING
The wieners were very skinny and amounted to the food contained in a Costco hot dog although the Costco dog is must tastier and tastes fresher
The device was ok but the food was definitely overpriced for a hot dog I could not bear to finish
Don't be thrown off by the deli style setting and informal dinning areas the food is good and the service is even better
Every time I have been here I have enjoyed the food
Don't expect a lot of meat on it though but the one or two pieces of shrimp and port were very good
I know that airport food isn't usually good but this place's just horrible
The food has been great most recently I enjoyed the Ragu which was really great
The sauce was tasty and the meat was different than I was expecting but way better than anything else I have tried elsewhere
The food flavors and presentation are marvelous
Even when things aren't to your liking there is something delicious about each dish
The food is OK if it's not cold when your get it
However I very much enjoyed their vegetarian eggrolls which were very hot not too greasy and had excellent flavor
Very nice and took very good care of us even though there was a miss-hap with out food we didn't care we had wine and it was fun
All of this could have been forgiven if the food was good
I will never go to this restaurant againbad servicehorrible foodand not a good value at all
We didn't buy food there as there was no way I was going to pay big bucks for typical zoo food that isn't really good for you anyway
They don't have a fancy store with fancy containers just good food
]  And the food is always made right then and hot as sh*t
I especially liked the kongnamulcold bean sprouts in sesame oil and the mu-chaejulienned radish in a sweet vinegary sauce with chili powder
we hadn't expected the overabundance of extra food and so had ordered another appetizer--the seafood pancake
We have dined at WCG about 20 times in the past and it has usually been a consistently good experience regarding service and quality of food
Like I said before the service has always been good Just wish the quality of the food would remain what it has been in the past
This place is certainly delicious worth the wait on a special occasion translation - not a place you frequent since the lines are so long but Best Pizza in America
The margherita pizza was good but not my favorite in fact it tasted better room temperature
This pizza was tasty as well but again not my favorite and tasted much better when it was room temperature vs
The two pizzas that were mind-blowingly delicious were the Bianca Verde and the Rosa
The pizza was creamy and wonderfully delicious
The Rosa was equally amazing - a pizza with no sauce or cheese instead incredibly delicious parmesan cheese covered the pizza and was topped with pistachios and onions
It's always fresh good cuts of sushi/sashimi
There is nothing nouveau about the food  just good standard fare
I had almond chicken which was as familiar as you can remember or imagine one daughter had sweet-n-sour pork which was a good balance of meat chunks and veggies/pineapple
Food was served nice and hot and we all enjoyed it even the one kid who was resistant to trying this new place
I would recommend this place to anyone who loves great atmosphere with their great food
it was an ideal marriage of tasty food and atmosphere this last day of April
The food was very very good and the service was actually the best we've ever had in a Chinese restaurant
We ordered one of the family dinners that came with the pu-pu platter beef sticks were a little on the tough side but over all everything else was good
Once inside the display of food and drink was amazing
Their appetizer choices were mostly seafood which doesn't help me out
I hope they turn up the appetizer department to take care of non-seafood eaters
I got the Appetizer Platter which came with a Pupusa a chicken meat pie a chicken tamale and beans
Everything we had shish kabob chicken shawarma and kifta kabob was bursting with exotic flavors
I've also had their pasta tortellini it was amazing but I didn't see it on the menu that last time I was in; I think they have some seasonal dishes they switch up
I'm surprised to hear that people feel that the food is not good and overpriced and that they have gotten horrible service
The funny thing is when I first went here 13 years ago I was very impressed with this place of course I was new to sushi and going out so my best friend and I loved this place
The service was good food was delicious and atmosphere was festive
I do love their boneless wings and their buffalo chicken sandwiches pickle and tater salad are a good combo
The meat was tasty the roasted tomato tasted very nice and if you put the tomatillo salsa on it
So we also ended up getting guac just a side dish of it so 3$ instead of 7$ at the extreme recommendation of our server and it was good but not the best guac I've ever had
Overall the food was excellent and well priced
If i wanted frozen fish and prepacked chowder i could have saved money and gotten similar quality at Long John Silvers
For you Midwestern or East Coast pizza connoisseurs that have longed for a truly tasty thin crust pizza here in Phoenix this is the place
Being from Milwaukee that boasts two of the greatest thin crust pizza joints in the world Zaffiro's and Tomaso's - I can say this because I've eaten at the best in Rome as well I had given up on finding good pizza in the valley
I got the vegetarian rolls and they were delicious
The food was good but it was not over the top
I've tried pasta pizza salad just sooo good
Not quite as delicious as Ra but I think it's better than Sushi Brokers' bento boxes
I am beginning to think my fellow Az peeps have no idea what good casual food is about
Good prices and the food is consistently good
I don't know about the stuff that gets filled with cream cheese and deep fried or other cooked stuff all I care about when I go to a sushi place is the quality and freshness of the fish and this place was great
I orderedSalmon sashimi the portion size was larger than expectedMasagoTobiko they only have wasabi tobikoSalmon nigiriHamachi Toro UniSpider RollSpicy Tuna it was happy hour and ended up taking it back to the hotel for breakfast the next day - yum
That is how tasty and fresh the sushi was
The fresh-tasting red onion and tzatziki and the warm flatbread were an excellent compliment to the meat which again was just ok
I had the Iskender Kebap which will bring me back--unique flavors of the meat are piled atop the bread and coupled with yogurt which make the dish both very complex and at the same time comfort food
Here's my opinion how they compare- Quality of food - best of the bunch their sandwich is more like a mom & pop deli- Service - from my 2 experiences they own that category
We had a group of 9  with 4 kids  and the service was terrific and they all really enjoyed the Spinach Pizza
The picky kids even enjoyed their wings spaghetti and pizza
The meat has a very good flavor - not too salty and not too spicy but definitely not drab or bland
Because of the awesome amounts of gourmet pizza available around town Z Pizza seems to be one of the only places that you can get a quick pizza to go and not have to end up with a Hot and Ready
I don't recommend the antelope unless you know and like what to expect from game meats
The chicken filet Salmon all melt in your mouth like Butta; as a matter of fact the Chicken is so flavorful you will salivate long after you masticated a mouthful
On a nice night it's great to sit out there having a drink and eating their delicious pizza
I have ordered pizza to go from here twice and both times I wasn't super impressed with it
For lunch I had the Arrogant Bastard Burger local organic beef from the Stockyards very tasty & huge
ok the area was a little scary but I heard the food was good
OK even us foodies and health nuts get caught out there hungry and no where good to go late at night
So don't give me crap about 'go eat at Domino's you don't know good pizza
When I got home with my pizza it was still really hot and gooey
They have flat screens everywhere with the game sound on so all was good until the food arrived
The food was delicious fresh flavorful and filling and the variety was incredible
For us out in The QC it's a bit of a hike for dinner but for me the food was well worth it
If you aren't getting Tortas or Tacos expect $20/person + drinks and appetizer and dessert costs
Not only is the dish tasty but its easily one of the best values to be found at any restaurant in Phoenix and the surrounding area
We were there on a busy Saturday night and we had great friendly and quick service and our food was quite good
The bread they serve before you receive your food was very tasty
Their burgers are great and their chicken sandwiches are amazing
I would recommend the Spicy Cha Cha shrimp like dish Golden Beauty lemongrass chicken or the Sweet & Sour Divine Sweet & Sour Chicken
On a positive note the dog food water and coffee are pretty good
With all this tasty food to try it's hard not to get carried away
But keep in mind if you get an appetizer drink meal and dessert
Either way I enjoyed my first Med style food experience
The pizza was bland and the rest of the food lacked the seasoning and flavors I look for in Mediterranean food
The food is as good as the other location
A cute unassuming little bistro with excellent pizza
Husband and I shared the chicken pesto pizza which was excellent
The chicken on the pizza was also good - chunks of breast meat as opposed to the mystery parts often found on chicken pizza
The pizza is not cheap but not over the top expensive either it makes sense they use very good ingredients
From the wonderful happy hourhalf off all appetizers and most alcohol to the large beer selection with a bunch of local brews and the delicious pizza we are pleased to have this new pizza joint in the neighborhood
Went with a friend on Friday night for happy hour had amazing sushi and drink specials and ended up staying way past happy hour was over because we had the BEST waiter ever
EXCELLENT service and very good food and wine
I had the chili combination taco with green chili sauce and while it was good it was nothing spectacular -- I've had mexican dishes with more interesting flavor
It was perfectly done I hate over cooked fish and the sauce was plate lickin' good
The chicken pieces were a lot smaller and it didn't have the same flavor that I was expecting
I've had many many versions of Nutella pizza and this one was distinct in that they applied the Nutella prior to baking which gave a toasty crunchiness that I really enjoyed
If you use it the dessert takes on a cheesecake flavor
We also tried the fish and chips and these were REALLY good
The saving grace was that the food was really delicious
Their service is great the food is delicious why rush though that
The black beans are bursting with flavor and the emerald chicken is a must EAT
The fried chicken was very good and I would go back to order it
I'll go back again but I'll either give the gumbo a shot or stick to the fried chicken
Bottom line a good not great dining experience for the soul food craving
The food is predictably tasty with especially delicious onion rings
The food is consistently typical McDonalds food which isn't good but it's what I go to get
None of that would matter if the food wasn't good
Nevertheless it came packed with spicy fishy goodness and whole peppercorns
He came out later in the meal asked if I enjoyed it and said that he worried it would be too fishy
Wings are always good though I do have a issue with the amount of hard breading that's on the boneless chicken wings
Sala Thai definitely satisfies my craving for good Thai food and bonus it's like 10 minutes from my house
I think a chain restaurant should only exist when the food is good enough to warrant more access to the greater population
Good sounding food selection on hh - notice I say it sounds good but it was not good not at all
My friend got the chicken wrap that actually looked pretty good and she seemed to enjoy it and a side of fries which came with ketchup and
As such the restaurant is fairly small- so if you're up for some delicious middle-eastern food on a Friday afternoon make sure you arrive early
The prices are good the selection is better and the food is great
Good cocktail and beer selection surprisingly good food for a bar and a great staff
The food is good the food service fast the stands staff always helpful
The meatballs were tasty but sparse and the chicken broth was nicely spicy
perhaps a little lemon pepper in the batter would have done some good Lastly the dish could have satisfied by just having a bit more cheese
On to the food-We didn't try any appetizers because we were determined to make it to the dessert round based upon the delicious sounding desserts on the menu
I tried a bite and it was really good - the sauce was light and did not over power the fish
Some items like the loaded chips were very tasty although hold the blue cheese if you don't love that ingredient while others missed like the chicken lollipops
The avocado/chicken spring rolls are tasty but could use a little more spice
For dinner the chicken dumpling is delicious well the chicken is but the jerk shrimp plate is a bit sparse and overpriced for what you get
Though who wants to eat a salad when there are some many good meats there to try
The sauce was flavorful and obviously homemade just had no pizzazz
My two friends loved their sandwiches especially the meatball which they both said was absolutely delicious
This is not a vegetarian-friendly establishment so I don't recommend going there if you are avoiding meat products and are asking for alternatives
That's a good amount of food for the $12 or so I paid
I will say I was very impressed with how close the food was to what I used to eat daily
I've had fairly consistently good service and food at that location
The service is better the food is better; it was worth the drive
Much of the vegetables meat wine and even the coffee are found locally and he supports the area while cranking out some amazing food
how the good food can totally make up for all of that is beyond me
It's actually pretty tiny and I think I got the shavings as all of my beef while tasty was in crumbles
*Pho portion = pretty good and there was a lot of meat in it *Rice dish = honestly the beef tasted more like Teriyaki than Vietnamese bbq
The meat is decent and the tzatziki is good but it doesn't make me crave Z's at all
They also had food vendors such as a delicious kettle corn vendor
The service is always pleasant and fast and the food is pretty darn good for a chain
I've tried some of their pasta dishes and had the grilled pork chops once and they were quite good
If you're in the mood for some good Italian food with good portions and friendly attentive service Macaroni Grill can't be beat in my book
I would have waited an hour for good fresh and warm dessert but alas after about 10 minutes they came out
The White brownie dessert was cold the other lukewarm
We had to sit around with no soda and had had the cold dessert for some time
The sweet and sour chicken was really good and typical flavors
We had the Italian Stallion and I've never eaten a more delicious scrumciousif this isn't a word it should be amazing pizza in my years on this earth
We were mildly impressed with the selection of meats & cheeses
The thing I love about Trader Joe's is the great selection and quality of the food
The sangria at Havana Cafe is packed full of fruit flavor and it's a really refreshing drink that goes well with the heat of the Cuban dishes
They're sweet chunks of bananas that make a perfect dessert or sweet appetizer accompaniment
The dish could probably give you 2 days' worth of leftovers-and they're not gross leftovers they're almost as good as if they'd just been served to you
It will not stop me from coming back but I feel you should be made aware of especially since it was a previous highlight that I always recommended to someone fond of an old fashioned homemade dish
Food are good especially the crazy boy rolls
Food Had one of the salads as an appetizer and it was good but not amazing
I had the pecan cinnamon roll which was delicious
The food was flavorful and the portions generous
Good authentic Mexican cuisine at an affordable price - humongous portions; one where in a MAN verses FOOD competition FOOD WINS
I ordered the Sesame Chicken based on the recommendations here
Overall there are local chefs that are doing amazing seasonal and organic dishes with a more personal and attentive approach
The place feels like a whole in the wall restaurant with good food
If they added a hot food concession stand this place would be virtually perfect
Their lunch menu consists of standard items such as cold sandwiches salads pasta pizza soups and bakery items
The white pizza if very good and the pesto is the best I've had in the valley
I've only ventured away from the pizza once to get a cheese steak and it too was solid; shaved rib-eye and good salty Provolone
And this place knows how to make a good spicy Thai dish
The food is good not amazing but good and the ambiance is refreshing
I had heard that this was a cool bar to people watch and the food was delicious
No it's certainly not The French Laundry which is not even a Bistro but if you're looking for the classic experience the food is spot on great service and some good French classics for those that are looking for a reliable and delicious culinary excursion to France
i recommend The House Dynamite with chickenThe Spicy Saigon with tofuThe Pad Thai with chicken or tofuThe Hot and Sour soupThe Thai Chicken saladand the cucumber martiniI love the atmosphereeverything is great exceptthe wait is always incredibly long for not only for a table but service and food as wellthe seating is uncomfortable close togetherthe food is overpriced
good deal I can't wait and if I can convince them pizzas at the bar easier said then done to convince them
The staff is great the food is good the eclectic mix of EVFN'ers is awesome
I know this place has been well reviewed and Guy Ferrari thing is way cool but the pizza here is very good
Not amazing pizza but certainly better than anything around these here parts
The Italian stallion was really good the quality of the meats were very fresh and the ingredients fairly good quality for sure
Now 2 small pizzas and a large salad close to $40 is cool as long as it is good and this was good
Thank God because there is a glut of good pizza out this way
Best place for cheap greasy tasty Mexican food
I'll disagree that you don't need no teeth but I will say that the chicken is juicy the beans are incredible and the hot sausage is amazing
The food was discussing and the black beans were way undercooked which he said that's because they were for the salad  I want them cook even for my salad nothing like a cold crunchy bean
There are lots of delicious choices - The Thai Chicken Wrap Salami Pesto Goat Cheese and the Roast Turkey are my most frequents
Overall we were not impressed with the food and probably won't go back
We split the dessert and although we were very full from the main dinner we finished everything - it was so good with just the right coating of cinnamon sugar
This restaurant has such a unique concept and they deliver with an amazing quality of food
My mushroom pizza was thin crusted and delicious and our guests from North Carolina were impressed
The food was AMAZING and Chef Chris was awesome
Top recommendations - The Shrimp and Pork Spring rolls for a starterEither the Bun or the lemon grass beef for a main dish
The resturant has a nice ambiance and the food is pretty good
Their mock chicken is very good though I like the kung-pao bowl
I also love a good plain coffee roll strudel ect
The food was good but I don't think it was worth the time we waited for a table
I know everyone comes here for the pizza but I actually enjoyed the pasta more
I also enjoyed the tiramisu and turtle budino for dessert
I really enjoyed my meal from the crispy tempura veggies not Thai I know but darn good to the salt and pepper chicken to the savory beef and chicken dishes - especially that delightful crispy chicken in creamy sauce
And they had two tofu dishes both good - a plus for me since not too many buffets serve tofu which I love
Nevertheless I found the food to be good and the service attentive though more businesslike than friendly
My favorite dish Carne Adovada but I love this dish anywhere I go The food is pretty much standard good Mexican food but the Mini Tacos rock my world
The sushi is just as good as any other good Japanese restaurant
i've never eaten Israeli food and when I first tried this place i was taken back on how excellent their food is
The dark meat was good but the breast tasted suspiciously like pre-packaged turkey
Food flavor ranged from bland to unimpressively odd
With plenty of good sushi in town they gotta step it up
Do you think they do better sushi before or after happy hour like are they thinking ha it's happy hour and that cheap-skate wants good sushi
But I'm sticking to my other sushi hot spots
Their fish tacos and breaded shrimp tacos are amazing $2
I've been underwhelmed by an entree or two note don't bother with the steak but in general the food is good
as Sherlock Holmes as I also enjoyed my sushi
The Vegas roll was tasty but different from what I've had [the entire roll covered in crispy tempura]
The avocado rolls were wonderful my old stand-by and forever simple favorite
The food was good nothing to write home about
Before I ate here today I could have never told you I ate a pizza hot dog
You will like it 100x better than Daphne's next door where all the food is low quality and not fresh
I felt I had a connection with Jason's reuben sandwich first few times piled high with corned beef and a good proportion to sauerkraut
Then came the last few visits when the service became senile-slow and the food quality atrocious
The food has always been good it was just lacking service before and now I'm much happier here
The large pizza is a good deal at $13 and is very tasty with a nice thin crust and fresh cheese and toppings
Brunch food here is pretty good - even by my snobby SF standards
The chicken was moist juicy and full of flavor
The meat is flavorful and the portion is generous to say the least
I have ordered both the shrimp and tilapia tostadas and the Chicken Rojo and would highly recommend either
As other reviews have said the menu is really interesting and the food is awfully good
Also the food here isn't completely healthy for you and might be a days worth of calories in one meal
Good mix hot sauce with the maple syrup and the chicken you gotta try it
My one recommendation besides the obvious ones being fit pack food and water is to bring some light gloves
Mango Lassi - creamy and refreshing not too sweetChicken Masala - sauce was a little thick but well spicedMalai Kofta - sauce was a better consistency but was not a fan of the homemade cheese ballsPeas Pulaou - okPlain and Garlic Naan - both good but the garlic one kicks it up a notch
If you like pizza with a lot of sauce and loaded with toppings I would recommend that you go somewhere else pizza like this only get ruined loaded down
The food was incredible the service was spectacular and the ambiance was amazing
With menu items like Chilled Avocado and Crab Cocktail with Spicy Remoulade Crispy Salt and Pepper Shrimp with Shiitakes and Sugar Snap Peas Sliced Wagyu Beef Hot Rock Ishiyaki with Soy Broth Lightly Smoked Filet of Atlantic Salmon with Bok Choi and Chinese Black Bean Vinaigrette Seared Pacific Ahi Steak with Sautu00e9ed Shiitake Mushrooms and Wasabi Potato Puree Crispy Cashew Calamari with Fine Cut Vegetables and Ginger and Soy Truffled Macaroni & Cheese and Sautu00e9ed Spinach with Garlic and Shallots who could ask for more
The only item we weren't impressed with were the french fries that came with the swordfish
The place is located quite close to the other good Indian place Kabab palace and is in direct competition with it and I already heard many people say its better than that because food is a tag tastier and a tag cheaper
The first thing that came to my mind when I eat the food was its as delicious as any Indian food that I have ever eaten in AZ
I had to order it to go cause the hubby wasn't feelin so well so I got the food and got in the car and the car was instantly filled with french fry and burger goodness I couldn't wait to the ten minute drive home so I tried a slider
The food was VERY good and they were very flexible on substituting when my taste desired french toast instead of pancakes with my combo - at no charge
We started with Italian glass of wine ordered white bean and arugula salad added some Proscuitto to the salad and had side of their appetizer meatballs
The wait staff is very friendly but the best was the Owner Lindsay took the time to talk to us and now knows us - so it is our new and most favorite place to go for salad appetizers and of course their amazing Pizza
Their appreciation touched all of us- so not only is their food amazing but the employees that work there are too
Entrees were pretty good - Chicken Parm Fettucine Bolognese all tasty but not sure I would go back
The room temperature plates tend to rob the food of its heat which is not good at all
I don't know anyone who has tried their Italian fare but my friends and I have found their Asian food selections to be delicious
I have yet to personally try their sushi but I have heard that it's also quite good
The sushi is great and has such a pretty appearance when delivered and the custom sushi rolls are always amazing
We did have a really delicious dinner and they were super accommodating with my food issues
I'll definitely be back to try another tasty tea and probably another dessert too
So there you have it friendly staff no wait if you get a reservation amazing yummy food and affordable
As for the food both the sweet jalapeno chicken sandwich + beer-battered fries I got here and the grilled chicken beer bread a wrap at the Scottsdale location were honestly about as tasty of chicken sandwiches as I've ever had
Not a big appetite so just ordered some starters one being the seafood wontons with vodka voodoo sauce which was amazing and the lamb
The food was pretty good but the service was not the best
Another dish was the Ital soup which is ideal for people who have a cold and a good cleanse after a good workout at the gym
Next time - I will inform them not to put habanero peppers in my rice dish because that was beyond too hot for me but I will be back to try their other dishes
I added the grilled chicken which was cooked and seasoned wonderfully
fantastic bartenders fun company on either side of us great wine delicious food especially the bread with pesto sauce and Dwight on the piano with a vocalist
I went with the bronzini fish that was served with some vegetables - different than what I expected but very good
We ordered the Orchid Special Combination appetizer with egg rolls satay wontons and fried vegetables
Tom Kha Kai Soup - Rich and flavorful broth soup with lots of mushrooms and chicken
Phad Thai - a delicious noodle dishPha Nang - flavorful red curyWe will be back for sure
The brisket and chicken had little flavor other than cooked no smoking  the bbq taste  only came from the sauce which you could choose spicy or sweet
The bread was good for the sandwich tasted like they trucked it in fresh the roll served with the 2 meat plate tasted biscuit like and was tastier but looked like a roll
The food is always good whether its the burgers pizzas or salads
It only took me one visit to this restaurant to know that this is the real thing--the food was amazing the waitress close-lipped the prices perfect
However their regular dishes do not taste that good anymore
On this particular night I had the Yellowtail Sashimi Pork Belly Steamed Buns Soft Shell Crab Sandwich and for dessert another appetizer
Yes two entrees and an appetizer for dessert
I was mostly impressed with the humungous size and generous helping of chicken included in the dish
If you're someone who just eats the more general types of sushi rolls like California rolls or something with just imitation krab and japanese mayo you're not going to be impressed because you'll probably compare it some other restaurant who made a better krab mix
If you're someone who is more exotic and is willing to come to a sushi restaurant to eat REAL seafood like squid roe sashimi eel scallop or soft shell crab and eat it with as minimal soy sauce and wasabi so you can taste each item as it is before it's doused in seasonings that mask it's real potential then you will be impressed
It was worth the wait in line after we ordered they gave us a pager and within 15 minutes we had fresh amazing home made food and plenty of seating inside and out
Maybe that's what makes all the patrons think that the food is so amazing
The BBQ chicken was good as well I'm told but the California pizza was somewhat bland
If I were to sit here and attempt to write an educated articulate and accurate appraisal of how good Hiro's sushi is than I would be just like one of those snobs Rob so despised
Lately however I have been ordering more sashimi and nigiri trying to learn the nuanced flavors of the fish rice and combination of the two
For the time being I believe that Hiro is a really good place to continue my sushi education
And yes everything I had tasted wonderful I just don't yet have the expertise to be able to honestly explain exactly why it was better than other sushi joints around town
Looking for some good Thai food I came across this restaurant
When I'm in the area I'll have to check this place out again and would recommend the restaurant to anyone who likes Thai food
The FoodYou would think that a restaurant called Primebar would have amazing PRIME steaks
The ingredients tasted fresh and the pizza itself had tons of flavor
The portions are good sized and I do find country/southern food items catfish okra etc
The tobacco was rich and delicious having spent it's entire life locked in a perfect temperature and humidity controlled humidor
Unfortunately none of the dishes was particularly flavorful and none were good renditions of the dish
Regardless of your dietary needs First Watch soars above the rest in Scottsdale with their defined attention to service food quality and preparation
It's fast it's tasty and it's a ton of food for a pittance
I've always enjoyed their Santa Fe pizza but this time I thought I'd try their Greek pizza
The mini-putt course is quaint adequately kitschy and can be enjoyed for hours if you don't mind fishing for a new ball out of the water hazard or just duping the staff into believing that you've lost your ball and need a new one
We went and were really surprised at how good the food was
The Pork rolls were amazing - hands down one of the tastiest things i've had in a while
His dinner was the best - the seafood having the right consistancy something that felt like squid a shrimp that was very close to shrimp flavor and something that I swear tasted like the chinese sasuage from my youth - yummm
This is not a date spot - just a good place for tasty food
I was taught that tamales are the test of a good mexican restaurant and  El Bravo's chicken green chile tamale is unbelievably good with lots of filling great flavor and light sweet masa
The mock chicken dishes were just great with the right amount of spice and flavor
The service was a bit in the weeds but everyone was friendly and nice and the food was very good
If you're looking for a nice restaurant with good food that has an American Tavern feel this is your place
The takeout service I've received was always good and food didn't take too long
I have to say that the pizza is solidly good
Call ahead and your food is ready for pickup within 15 minutes and always steaming hot
I like Goldies and we take out often because the food is usually good but honestly they cannot get orders correct
Again the food is good but under these circumstances we will go elsewhere
Overall the food is really excellent and can only get better
The best Italian food in Phoenix area by far and I'm from the east coast grew up in an Italian family so I know good Italian food
Both dishes were delicious and each were more than enough to split between two people
Overall the drinks were good food was good service was good and so were the musicians
I'll definitely have to come back here on an empty stomach one day to try their full menu because the food that kept passing under our noses looked amazing
Ironicallythey serve up some good healthy food and my car was busy smoking-out everyone in sight
Now I don't know if this is necessarily a criticism because I know that higher quality local food costs more and generally tastes better than chain-owned processed cafe food
No matter if you want broiled fish or fried seafood the taste is awesome and the price is good
This is a great place to get a good slice of pizza
I will be back again as it's good food and the prices are just right
So to summarize authentic affordable and delicious Mexican food
Loved the fried chicken so flavorful and not dry at all
We ordered a grilled chicken quesadilla pretty tasty
If you like Ribs Chicken Wings or even Pull Pork sandwhiches whatever you like its ALL excellent
They have really good deserts beef brisket and cat fish as well
There is a lot of seafood and fish offerings as well as a good sized salad and desert bar
The potato pancake dish was amazing as well
There's a robust vegetarian menu featuring Quorn brand mock-meat which has been delicious each time I've tried it
I've had the followingMachaca- Melt in your mouth soft- perfect flavor quality beefBeans- PerfectRice - Very GoodGreen Corn Tamale- My mouth just seriously watered thinking about itChicken Taco- Oh MyBeef Taco - Oh Oh MyChorizo Con Huevos- Dang- GoodCheese Tortilla - Dios Mio
The pizza was ok-good really not the style I like so if I were you reading the review I'd take that wiht a grain of salt
Number one food recommendation hands down - the CARNE ASADA FUNDIDO
It was by far one of the most personable dining experience with outstanding food quality and creativity
The atmosphere - 10 Food - 8Service 7Price - 4I think they are a bit pricey for what you get and wished they offered discounts on food  during their AMAZING Happy Hour and not only the drinks
Excellent sound trackIt is a  fine steak house wannabe that did not deliver on many important food fronts
You may find a sushi restaurant out in Scottsdale with a better sushi selection and slightly better sushi quality
Food-Clam and fettuccine-far too salty-Tomato sauce- tastes like canned-Gnocchi-mushy no texture-Bolognese-no flavorBottom line-Rude arrogant owner-Blandover-priced food-Never returning
Before it appeared on Food Network although expensive this place was quite good
My fiance and I would go and eat up $60-$70 worth of sushi and we would be getting the check and heading to In and Out
It was a fun environment and the food is delicious
I had the teriyaki chicken sandwich with fries so good
We went for our anniversary and the food and service were excellent
the last one we ordered is a crispy chicken with special rub only that week they have they are excellent
It's not that the food is bad because it really is tasty
I loved it because it was closer to where I live but now I have to drive further away to get good korean food
Food wise their happy hour menu is good and decently priced
pizza is good spaghetti and meatballs rock the kids world salads are presentable and edible
The chicken Katsu is pretty darn good too
those name change CHINA CITY BUFFET  almost all the  food is good every night they have crab leg they have 4 item ice cream mon - thurs $ 1099   week end $ 1299 for dinner
Also please note that the food has been less than good on the last couple of visits stale bread incorrect order long wait etc
All of the curries noodle dishes and soups are without a doubt mouth-watering and worth any superficial hardship you may incur with the previously touched on service
Try to stock a mini frig in a nicer hotel with snack foods
This small taco shop that is family owned is just the right kind of place to go for lunch for some fast very good Mexican food
The coolest part was they let me take a beer from the wall and enjoy it with the wonderful pizza
Then I was told that the food was not bad but good
Beef should have a fair amount of time on salt to bring out flavor and slower cooking to keep the meat tender juicy and flavorful
Seriously if you are trying to save money and still want to eat good fresh and easy food then this your place
Not that I have tons of experience in Mediteranian food but it was good
Last night both the Moroccan Gazpacho which wass amazing 2 weeks ago and the hummus with chicken were so drenched in lemon juice I had to add sugar to make it edible couldn't track down a server and I DID make it taste better by doing that
We always get great service and the food quality is always constantly good
You have to like hotter food to come here as they are the few that offer Hatch chili
OK so now to the foodI had the Chicken Tikka Masala and my friend had the Chicken Pot Pie - both were delicious
Plus I appreciated that their pastys are a good size and that it is not a dough-overwhelmed dish meaning the crust is perfectly thinly sized and not like a calzone
Anyhow the meal we had of sushi salad and a BLT sandwich was absolutely delicious the crowd very much like our group-- hungover and hungry
This is where we go to celebrate and to enjoy a night out with amazing food and great service
So we asked for a menu and sat down at the closest table to see what we might like to try the stuff crab shrimp as an appetizer looked fantastic the couple next us had just received so we decided to try it and a ceasar salad with grilled chicken
This is where it gets good Danny- the gentleman next to us  offers of the last shrimp from their order and says don't worry we ordered THREE pizzas- we will share them with you just order something else to try with that we ordered a meatball sub
Thanks to Danny we had the cheese pizza- AMAZINGthe vegitarean- ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS and the white pie-YUM YUM as for the ceasar it was a 3 out of 5 the dressing needs some work but the grilled chicken was really great and the meatball sub was just average
Pizza is pretty good its new york style and they have a full pasta menu
I've been missing my favorite Chicago deli and have been craving some good Jew food and I finally found it
The beef was tender flavorful and not dry and the kishke was slicedbrowned and skinless
It was wonderful and salty and full of flavor and I have enough left for a sandwich tomorrow morning Overall this is the closes to a real Jewish Deli I've been to here in AZ - and I will for sure be back and try the corned beef/pastrami and potato pancakes next time
Ok service was not good --- when we got the bill the pizza and wings were charged separate -- not right -- it was a together order per the menu
Never again --- and the food was fair --- not a good place to return to -- ASU take it away -- its all yours -----
It's obvious Armandos is cooking with their oil way too hot and the food ends up smelly with black specs inside and out
Average in Quality Food at best and prices that are $1
Overall pretty solid dish chicken wasn't too greasy it was cutlet and not breaded pilaf was pretty good and the spinach was delicious
My fellow diners had the pomegranate chicken which was like a salad but messier and apricot salmon which was pretty good not too heavy on apricot flavor
Overall a pretty good place - the only gripe I have is that I know two chicken cutlets rice and spinach costs about $7 to buy and they charge $17
Overall I'd say FEZ is a good place it just seems a little scatterbrain in presentation full of ideas and great food on paper and just a little overpriced
We had a big party and they tried their best to accommodate us as quickly as possible- Menu with wings and pasta and sandwiches a lot more to offer than just pizza - Fun retro decor and music classic style ads were on the front of the menu- Dirty monkey classic rum fruit cocktail that was quite deliciousMidlights- Sangria just ok not so much fruity flavor- Pizza cookie half done to give it that gooey almost cookie dough-like texture but I prefer it a bit more crispyLowlights- Only certain pizzas can be thin or Chicago style and the menu isn't so clear on that so it's a bit confusingEnjoyed this yelp find and would eat here again or another location since I found out it's a chain
Some delicious dishes at this place but very uneven
the food is pretty good and way less than you'd expect for such a hip fancy dig
Their food is good I have also ordered the Fruiti Del Mar which was a really great dish
The beer is cold the food is hot and the service is warm and friendly
I'm a big guy with a big appetite and I didn't even have a desire to finish my meal it was just not a good dish
Trendy is not always good when it comes to sushi
I like this place for a cheap tasty bowl of Pho and some spring rolls that always are fresh and not skimpy on the ingredients
Do I always get good food at great prices in a place I feel comfortable wearing track pants and a bandana at
I had been there last year My husband and I stayed for over an hour and the flavorful food came out to us hot and quickly
So overall good food ok price and ok service
Again the food wasn't bad but not as good as I was expecting for the price
The food is good between quality fast-food and a trendy restaurant the prices are more than reasonable and the service was great
W made sure the food was delicious and our server Jake was friendly and very accommodating all the way around
Price to quality of the food ratio is excellent Don't expect to die of food joy but you will come away happy and your wallet will still have some money in it
Other than that the ambiance is good and my fish was awesome
Italian beef is apparently pretty popular in north Scottsdale - there are three Chicago-style beef places within 2 miles of my work - this one Luke's and Taste of Chicago all three with good Italian beef and other Chicago classics
The shaved beef is excellent very flavorful and seasoned perfectly
I would definitely recommend getting your sandwich dipped the entire sandwich including bread gets dipped in the meat juice to infuse the bread with flavor otherwise the bread does tend to be slightly dry and hard - not bad but just not as good as when it's dipped
I'm interested in trying some of the other menu items like the hot dogs chicken and burgers but with Italian beef this good it's hard to pick something different
Not sure the name of the bartender at Wildfish but her appletinis are DELICIOUS
FEZ is still the go-to place for good food good atmosphere and good people
All of the stuff on the revolving sushi bar was wonderful
The decor is beautiful the food is always good
I usually feel that food trumps service and as long as the place is nice and the food is good I can deal
The food was good as always entrees - 2 taco platters one Del Mar salad and a Ahi tuna burger and if we didn't have cocktails for that one time is that a reason to be rude and disappear
Don't write me off as a simplistic food reviewer but CostCo pizza is really really good
Didn't get to try much food but the crab dip appetizer one night really hit the spot
I haven't had Pizza Hut in a long time; but I expected the quality to be consistent with my past experience
Anyways the veggies and topping were good quality my only complaint is that the crust was too doughy; neither the pan pizza or the hand tossed were cooked long enough; which did lead to my disappointment
It was early enough in the evening that they were able to deliver a tasty hunk of meat that was as requested
I only go here ALL the time for cheap delicious down-home Mexican food cheap produce and Spanish rice like Grandma used to make
Good food -- weird and/or poor service
The food was good and I believe everyone got what they ordered so that's two stars instead of one
While the presentation was beautiful the flavors were a bit too extreme - however the roasted beets were a nice touch but the salsa did not fit with the dish
good little mill ave pizzeria with lots of action to watch if you're not feeling particularly discrimantory about really great pizza
On this day it seemed like a good day for a Louisiana roast beef po-boy
We've been to Johnny's and to Pakway's several times in New Orleans and they both serve these amazing hot roast beef po-boys dripping in sauce mixture of beef au jus and mayo topped lightly with a little lettuce a few tomatoes and pickles all wrapped up in a very crunchy baguette role
What we did find was an amazing shrimp po-boy and some excellent fried catfish topped with crawfish u00e9touffu00e9e
The broth is tasty and not too salty or oily and the Beef is super tender
The food was very basic and it was hard for me to find things that I really enjoyed
I would say its a good place to go if you are looking for home cooked type foods but don't want to cook yourself
Just keep in mind that you won't find food that is overly tasty if at all here
Pho Van was very quick to seat us the staff was amazing in taking our order and explaining the various dishes and the food came out lighting fast
Oooohh the good food we find in the ghettooooo
It usual takes a while for our orders to get ready because there is usually so many of us but no one's food has ever been cold
Foodie Agape thats true love ya know Even if you decide a particular flavor is not for you you will sit in awe and adoration at the fact that they dared to go where no ice cream shop has ever gone before
Great atmosphere and tasty food but I hope you're not in a hurry
The New York strip was nothing less than amazing BUT I don't think the atmosphere/service matched the price of the food
The Mixed Market Greens salad Big-Ass Burger Kettle of Green Chili Pork the Fish Tacos and the Chicken and Pepper-Jack Flatbread pizza is beyond wonderful
Food is pretty good and they have a full bar as well
They are all equally excellent in service and food
Such a great concept plentiful and good food priced right and very friendly staff
And it wasn't just the food that made this experience memorable and wonderful
The catfish po' boy was as good as it's going to get outside of NOLA - we'll definitely be back
The food we ordered was very tasty; no complaints
I've read some of the other reviews before we went & was rather taken back by customers indicating the food was ok or the service was not good
We had no problem & plan on going back once more to make sure & if we get the service we did this evening & the quality of the food we had this evening we will bring back our friends to enjoy the atmosphere
ordered puttanesca pasta and bbq chx pizza both absolutely delicious and fresh
I was impressed not only with the taste of the food but with the presentation as well
The bowls were yummy we both loved the sauce & the chicken was delicious
No also because it has a nice wine selection full bar tasty if simple food solid veg options and that chilled out Phoenix bar in a house vibe
I've had the following dishes and highly recommend any and all of themA2 - Goi Cuon Thit Tom - Spring rolls - the kind that are not fried - I get them with shrimp / no pork and they are delicious and light
M4 - Yakisoba mi xao - a tasty yakisoba noodle dish with veggies and your choice of meatT2 - Bombay Veggies - Wok stir-fried tofu and veggies with curry coconut sauceB3 - Stir-fried mixed veggies - just a side order but perfect to fill your veggie minimum for the day
The crust on the pizza at Mamma Mia's was also delicious
Looked up good sushi in Gilbert and this popped up fist
We have been to all the Big name sushi place around town and find them expensive and lacking in the fresh tasty department
It has gotten more expensive and the quality of pizza has gone down
The food is good the atmosphere matches the cuisine and best of all they take reservations
Mostly friendly servers one refused to give me an open unreserved table bring delicious food with a Southwestern flavor or tasty salads with fresh ingredients
Sometimes one of the owners I think he's the son of the owner can be pretty moody and rude but if you can deal with that it's worth it for the food
The Corner Bakery gives good value for the money and I really believe they are more generous with the meat on their sandwiches
Both the veal and chicken parm dinners were very good
Although we didn't get dessert it looked delicious
**NICE VIEWS AND HIGH-QUALITY FOOD FOR A SUNDAY BRUNCH BUFFET**3
The buffet had a good variety of foods
The food was fresh and high quality but the overall experience was so-so
We ordered 2 noodle dishes one with a flat noodle shrimp broccoli and beef and very good
I'm anxious to try the other dishes to see if there are some that are with more spice and flavor
I've lived in Mexico City and the flavors here are the closest I've found in Phoenix to the food I would eat there
I could have used that extra big piece of chicken too because my last of the giant three tortillas had nothing to put into it after the tasty first piece didn't last long
There were very few if any nearby sushi options worth trying ie Ten
Boyfriend likes the fish katsu which reminds me of nicer fish sticks and I had the pork katsu which was not bad but not amazing
Next time I may have to try the cream cheese filled wontons since they look more like a dessert instead of an appetizer
Great flavor but not too much to overpower the fish
Tuna nigiri was great and the two orders of yellowtail nigiri we had were split - first one was great second order wasn't as tasty different fish I guess
The appetizer ordered was the Summer Rolls which house a large hunk of spicy sausage in it the sauce to dip it in was really sweet and didn't cling to the roll well I think I'd rather have had hoisin sauce with it
The broth by the way was fabulous didn't overpower the meats but added enough flavor to them much like a fondue broth while still more than delicious enough to slurp the rest of the way through once all the solid bits were gone
The reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is even after showing we've been around the block with Vietnamese food we were constantly being given instructions on what was good and what newcomers to Vietnamese cuisine should try
This place is wonderful the food is great and the service was top notch
First off all of their mexican food is grossly overpriced and their delivery takes FOREVER but their burgers were good and they delivered to our work so we still ordered
Good food but to busy of a location for this senorita
The fish was light and the flavors were magical
On his the quality of the chicken was super good and to ME the buffalo sauce/flavoring on the sandwich was great
No more will I buy my baked goods or luncheon meats at the grocery store
Overall good meal the dessert was memorable and I want to go back just for that Salted Caramel Pudding
I don't even know what the hell I had because it was soooo dang good that I ate it all and went into a food-itis coma instantly
When the owner has a passion for the food he serves it's gotta be good
I live an hour away from this place and I make it one of my top choices to go for good sushi and japanese cuisine
So far I have enjoyed the Bacon Egg and Gouda served on a ciabatta roll and the Sausage Egg and Cheddar served on a whole wheat english muffin
Since my husband's from SoCal and I'm a born and bred Austinite we both grew up eating delicious Mexican food
which includes an appetizer meal and dessert
Maybe it was the hype maybe the wait in the cold rain or maybe it was just the food
I loved the atmosphere it was upscale yet down to earth and the food was amazing
The chicken is so good and flavorful
I mean essentially it's just melted fat the cheese was melted perfectly and the jerk chicken brought the heat without sacrificing flavor
The service here is good and they've got an AWESOME home-made meatball sandwich that kicks the %$% out of anything you'll find at one of the bigger chain sandwich shops such as Subway
Italian Beef is decent more like so-so but the hot dogs and fries are worth the trip alone
Good prices especially for Scottsdale and food that fills you up and tastes much like Chicago
The veggies and glass noodles are delicious and the chicken is always tender
Having just moved apartments and being too lazy to take my dishes out of a box which was stacked under 6 more boxes hey I'm tired I decided to head out for the the late afternoon/evening to explore the 'hood and end with a good bite to eat
I'm now sitting hoping the dish is going to be worth all this waiting and extraneous trouble
The ambiance in this place leaves much to be desired but I wasn't going to complain if the food was good
Well the food and service definitely weren't good
The kik mesir wat red lentils was the only good dish so if you go I would recommend it
If you are looking for Ethiopian food I highly recommend Cafe Lalibela for prompt and attentive service excellent food and a friendly atmosphere
The food is tasty but the portions are TINY
Bottom line good food but tiny portions and expensive
And I had a bite of my friends poblano cream chicken enchiladas -- the sauce was delicious but the chicken was bland
I only gv Kampai 2 stars bc the food is good
The chicken is thin almost shaved strips and they absorb all the yummy pesto goodness
Once you get past the wait for the table then you wait a little more for your server then your food and when it is all said and done my dinner has stretched out to 1 1/2 -3 hours depending on how many of us and sometimes there is not enough goodness on a plate that can make up for that amount of time for pizza
Fresh local food transformed into the most delicious meals by an amazing chef
If you are looking for the most romantic setting or the best Phoenix food or amazing service or some combo of the above please check out this restaurant
Well I have never been disappointed by the food and I've tried just about everything on their menu but always end up back at the Chicken and Hummus appetizer
If you're looking for Affliction T-shirts and overly tan women in short skirts Monkeypants is definitely not the bar for you but if you want to share postgame laughs with your softball team while eating food that's not very good for you you can't do much better than the Pants
The fish here is just as good as Lee Lee though and it's nice to get the packaged smoked eel and the seaweed salad
If you get there at the right time of the day when they open when everything is fresh and the beef hasent been sitting in hot water all day you get a good beef sandwichas long as you add the peppers for taste
Overall if you want to stop at a hot dog joynt and have to dictate exactly how to prepare your food then Al's is the place for you
Al's is simply not consistent and I hate spending good money on bad food
It is like an upscale LA restaurant without the snobbery and with much more delicious food
The meat-eating bf thoroughly enjoyed the porkchops which appeared tender and juicy
The food was amazing the customer service was great and the prices were modest
The food an Aegean Stuffed Burger with fries was good
I've eaten here six times in the past year and can say that the quality of food and service has been consistent each time
The spicy beef vermicelli is very good if you aren't in the mood for Pho
Also the garden spring rolls are worth getting if only for the peanut dipping sauce that accompanies them
Since a lunch sashimi combo would've cost me $18 $3-6 higher than most other sushi places for lunch I opted for an Atkins roll $9; pretty good; never had a roll sans rice before and a $10 lunch combo with yellowtail sashimi fine and some Japanese dumplings which came fried yuck
The chicken fingers & grilled cheese were not as good way too greasy
Why they torture Chicagoans with images of yummy food tasty drinks and ice cream desserts that we would have to travel for hours upon hours to get I know not
It wasn't traditional Mexican food but I really enjoyed it since I'm not really into sweating while I eat from hot and spicy food
Her tacos were not very good the meat was WAAAY underseasoned and just not very good
All in all nice place with pretty good service and pretty good food
The tandoori chicken was juicy and the fried appetizers were crispy
The pasty was delicious overall but the meat was a bit salty
We went home with tons of leftovers because none of us thought the food was any good
The bottom line was I found the food and service good but nothing above ordinary for Mexican/Southwestern fare
ORIGINAL REVIEW - October 17 2006It's a damn shame that food this good comes with service that bad
The food at this Pita Jungle location is amazing but it comes with some conditions
The food is good enough that we continue to go there about once a week despite the terrible service
Some dishes to try include Lavosh Pizza both the regular one and the glazed chicken variety; Red Pepper hummus appetizer; grilled chicken breast salad the dressing is soooo good
I came here on a recommendation of a friend from NYC that this was quite possibly one of the best pizza places in the United States
quality staff was very friendly and lastly - probably the best pizza i have ever had in my life
I had a couple of meals there and the food was good
Nothing impressed us - food or service
The ambience and decor are very relaxing and not over-done  -which could mean the focus is on the customer service and quality of the food
The chicken was tender juicy seasoned and over-all tasty
Overall I thought the food was flavorful and tasty and it's not pretentious -  beats a lot of the other chain greek places
The sushi was good but the atmosphere and missing bar stopped me from giving it 4 stars
But in terms of sushi quality it was good
The stir fry eggplant dish is wonderful as well
This restaurant is quite a ways for me to drive 50 miles round trip but it is well worth it considering the exquisite food the low key atmosphere and delightful wait staff
The first time I got a chicken crepe dish and although it was very good it was not what I expected
The food is always awesome hot and filling
I always get the sandwiches but the one time I got the meat plate it was good as well
Every course was delicious including the bread and dessert was quite a pleasant experience
My dish was a good size and the Goulash was really good lots of gravy
13 oz NY Strip with an Heirloom Tomato Salad of Shaft Blue Cheese Garlic Chips Arugula Radish Sprouts and Anna Potatoes - Meat was real tender and flavorful
Pumpkin seeds provided little flavor and the meat need more flavor/salt
Ordered the Chipotle pasta thing and the lemon pasta dish very fresh and very tasty
The food is very well seasoned the heat tempered to your taste with individual flavor elements like toasted garlic and spices distinct without being overly assertive
Frankly I expected it to be good but not my style as I prefer lighter healthier food for the most part NOT a meat & potatoes person
Ordered the Chicken Tika Masala pasty since I was in the international mood & Yelpers said it was good
The Chicken was moist and chunky the tikka masala sauce was spiced but not hot really savory flavor
It would be much easier to just shop at one grocery store but this Whole Foods makes that second stop completely worth the effort
The chicken tacos were excellent as well as the grilled corn
In reality everything on the menu looked amazing - fresh ingredients inventive dishes and always healthy
I also go their chicken tortilla soup and it was AMAZING
Out of kindness I am giving this place a 2 star just for the good crust--and it is really good crust--but their idea of pizza is lots of tomato sauce
Sure butter and olive oil make food taste good but it's nice to eat this and know that healthy meals can be made incredible tasty without the added cooking fat
We finished the meal with a sampling of their mini indulgences desserts which are served in a shot glass
I had a beef vegetable soup to start; the broth was so flavorful and robust and the veggies were crisp
I also had the baked potato bar a steaming hot buttered spud accompanied with braised beef spareribs smokey and slightly sweet
The food was very delicious and we  are planning on going back and trying other dishes
Shrimp Tempera Roll was delicious as well
The egg flower soup had a generous portion of chicken in it making it very much like another order of food and not just an appetizer
The meat has less flavor and tastes really of char
I'm used to going to scary places in interesting neighborhoods for good food but this place is pretty scary even for someone used to hanging out next to K-Mo Mo
If the food was good I'd totally brave it but between looking out for my car and being sad that my bun was ice cold I mean I know it is supposed to be room temperature but this was close to ice cold and barely cooked through
There is a lot offered in terms of both hot and cold sandwiches plus many other dishes mac n' cheese chicken salad etc
I am a regular at Green I really like the food just stay away from the bowls pretty flavorless
Great people awesome atmosphere and tasty drinks and food
Thai Hot is different than Mexican Food or Indian Food hot
Some of the rolls include rainbow roll caterpillar roll fried jalapeu00f1o roll a boring California roll two other deep fried delicious looking rolls and a few other maki rolls
Their sauce that goes on the chicken is pretty good
The price is decent and you get a good amount of food
Phoenix there better be some good food involved
Also the pizzas are really good if you like more down to earth eating
It's two slices of the most amazing sourdough bread that's been toasted to perfection with a succulent grilled chicken breast under lettuce tomato and mustard
I agree that Juans is good but its not the best Mexican food I have ever had
Typical hotel breakfast buffet in terms of food quality and price
My own obsessive choice is Chilaquiles Verdes - heavenly green chile sauce poured over free-range perfectly roasted chicken topped with delicious shredded cheese and free-range eggs sunnyside up - a breakfast they serve all day and night
HC isn't on par with some of those places but it's darn good and it's the best Cuban food I've found in Phoenix
The decor is also amazing - so unique and eclectic it's got a really fun ambience - complete with dining trolley in the center of the room
The food wasn't stellar but at $10 for a good-sized helping it was decent
Sushi looked amazing but the rice on their rolls was a bit hard
I actually thought the food was good the sub roll was excellent had a bit of a crisp crust which is how I prefer Italian bread
The BBQ is cooked slow and low-it has 3 levels of  flavor from the beginning bite on the bark  that dry rub spice crust to the smoke ring just below the bark and finally into the tender fall off the bone meat
if you like hot-I mean really hot hot sauce-make sure and have some of the Extreme Hot African Ghost Pepper BBQ sauce-and have a telero roll on hand to help soak up the heat
The dessert made of crushed ice coconut and red beans is tasty especially on a hot day
The ribs were meaty and tender with an excellent BBQ sauce
Thnakfully they had some yummy food and good music for the grand opening so still trying to give them the benefit of the doubt here
We were seated decided on the caprese appetizer and the pistachio pizza
After wrestling with the appetizer for about 3 minutes our pizza was brought to us and it was COVERED in rosemary
writing a review for a burger and hot dog joint when she freely admits that she has never liked meat and her parents even paid her to eat burgers as a child
Food wise it was generally good but somewhat overpriced for the portion size and food temperature could have been hotter - hot food HOT - chilled foods COLD is the oldest rule in restaurants
On the menu it's stated a guest described it as being so good they wanted to take their clothes off and roll in it
Another dish I highly recommend is their Stuffed Pork Rib Chop which is gorged with Shropshire blue cheese then grill-seared and oven-finished and served with ancho bread pudding apple jus raisin/fig compote and pan-grilled vegetables
The food was what I expected and was very tasty and flavourful
I had the Tenderloin encased on Parmesan crusted mashed potatoes it was a lot of potatoes and little bit of meat but the Julian vegetables surrounding the mound-o-potatoes were amazing
and no it's not because they have amazing food or anything
Great seats good food a couple rounds of cocktails and most importantly NO CRYING BABIES
all the time it took and hassle from the kitchen about fish and chips resulted in a $13 plate of food that was worth about $4
We ordered the calamari order of hot wings and a stuffed pizza
first if you are a regular at Oregano's you know that stuffed pizza take a long time but generally they are worth it
The buffalo chicken pizza is so tasty and they will give you extra buffalo sauce and ranch all you have to do is ask
The Beef Broccoli was good and flavorful but not means exceptional
Compared to other buffet fast food Chinese places Yum Yum falls short in the number of menu items and quality of their food
I'd rather spend that time running back and forth between Pane and the Parlor feeding all of the hungry patrons waiting to get in Pane the Parlor's delicious pizza and pitchers of draft beer
Very good pizza for the price much cheaper than a Cibo or Pane pizza and of comparable quality minus the wait and snobby staff
Phoenix has some amazing pizza in it's valley and can totally play with the big pizza boys of Chicago and New York
Love the customer service the produce is always fresh and a terrific deal and the choice of Gluten Free foods is amazing
The meat department is good as well and everything is very fresh
I know that buffets in general are hard to rate becuase of the lacking food quality but I've had some great chinese buffets in my day
I wouldn't pay $5 for this buffet so the $13 a person is unresonable for the quality of food
Will someone please tell where I can find good chinese food in this city
I hate to write a review like this the food was really good the service was really bad
In closing I have to say the food was really good the service was really bad
I want to give it 2 stars but I really thought the food tasted good
I usually get the chicken pho which is very good
I first experienced Tarbell's back in 2005 and wanted to come back this year to see if it maintained its high quality of food and service
The food quality isn't consistent and on two out of five occasions my order was incorrect
Each time I've been here I was with 2 or more people and we had a good time despite the food debacles
Waiting for my food I noticed there were multiple flies in the restaraunt which is not a good sign
I tried to eat the meat with a fork- there was almost no BBQ sauce and NO flavor
I grew up eating carob being dragged to health food stores to buy dried fruit that my mom would try to convince me was as tasty as candy and granola bars
These sandwiches are large filled with meat and cheese tasty as hell and Firehouse provides a huge assortment of hot sauces to include on it
Friendly bartenders and I really enjoyed the cajun fish sandwich as well
Also tried the grilled salmon and Cajun chicken sandwich which were both excellent choices
A friend and I decided to try this place after all the good reviews we read and it was awesome food
Our food came in a timely manner and was very good
The food was good but wasn't over the top good
The coconut flan with caramel for dessert was very good
The food was good but wasn't over the top good
The coconut flan with caramel for dessert was very good
-  A couple of dishes missed the mark  the grilled cheese pannini SOUNDS sooo good cheddar gouda and jack cheese winds up being an overwhelming big fat clot of cheese I couldn't choke it all down
I tried a recommended dumpling appetizer $8 which was 5 giant steamed dumplings with onions and meat minced inside very interesting but good
Outstanding value quality ingredients I judge the quality of a restaurant a lot by the quality of the meat they put in things like sandwiches
This isn't a romantic date night spot but if you are looking for something out of the ordinary with quality food I think you could do a LOT worse than Golden Valley
Casey came back around to check us and he was clearly pleased that we enjoyed the food
Great food meets wonderful service with the added charm of a tremendous venue
None the less it is still really good food
And the food was good too but it missed that special something that Don J
Forget about that though because the food is good enough to make up for that little mishap
Yeah i was surprised how quickly the tab could add up but having been here several times in the morning for coffee before work the quality of the food and friendliness of the staff makes it worth it
Plenty of beer choices and lots of options for food that are quite good
I work nearby so I also pick up the yummy yummy spring berry salad with tuna or delicious pine crusted chicken
- The outside seating is sort of a bummer with the sun depending on the hour and where you sit BUT I did enjoy that it was enclosed with wood slats so you aren't looking at the strip mall parking lot- The food itself wasn't amazing but it was good and filling
Maybe it was an off day but I thought the food today was not very good at all
Overall the flavor was off putting and I like Cajun food it was greasy and the whole thing fell apart while trying to eat it
There are many other appealing dishes on the menu; it's difficult to taste them as the pizza is so good
It was a flavor explosion of beer battered fish crunchy cabbage guac and two sauces mixed together
My brother really enjoys the food so I'm sure I will be back again and I hope the soup and Pad See Ew are both amazing on the next visit
I would recommend the place to anyone who has some time to spare for a long breakfast since there could be a little wait to get your food they are usually really busy but friendly service
It is just as one would think of when you would want some good food made from scratch daily with some of that quintessential homemade flavor and love
We also had the Seafood Tum yum soup and it came out like a hot pot but It wasn't that good like I had expected it to be better for $13
I went in with a friend the other day to face the ghoulish population inside but instead found a mix of middle-aged locals and college kids and good Mexican breakfast food with a nice amount of spice
The ground beef is of average to above average quality and they will cook your fries extra toasty if you want them to
Gotta love some good food and drinks after an exhausting workout
We looked over the menu and decided on the calamari appetizer spinach salad and the sausage pizza
The food is of course the same quality as the other Vig and you can always count on getting a yummy if not slightly overpriced dish
I like the chicken tacos better than the shrimp but they were both excellent
Then I had the short ribs the meat was tender but lacked flavor and the sauce was oaky too
It is difficult find non-American restaurants in Scottsdale where the food hasn't been Americanized losing its flavor and spice along the way i
I recommend this place because the food is so good but bring your patience for the parking and slow service
The food was good and it was pretty unique
The mahi fish tacos were good decent amount of fish on each taco
For the quality of food you get here I think this place is overpriced
If you're looking for sushi I'd suggest elsewhere but if you want a swanky time nice teppanyaki good drink specials and eye candy aplenty both male & female this is a great place to stop by
In terms of Middle Eastern food on Apache I prefer both Haji Baba and Tasty Kabob
The concessions had a good variety of choices but still expensive ballpark food
The place certainly uses quality ingredients to make its food
I had the fish tacos and was not impressed
Without the lime and the sauce and salsa which are all served on the side it offered no flavor to the dish
The meat was tasty and tender the bun was buttery and soft and everything came together beautifully
Not really a fried chicken fan but it was delicious
Both dishes were amazing although the pork chop was the best
I probably would have still given it 2 or 3 stars but I haven't gone back despite the fact I live around the corner since there is so much amazing food in CenPho
The Chicken Sonomo Stew I got was flavorless and had the consistency of snot
Overall the food was good and prices were reasonable for lunch
Lately though the quality of the food as gone way down
Before I went vegetarian I used to always get the chicken waldorf salad and it was always so good
Since I've become vegetarian I settled on the hummus appetizer grilled vegetable salad and the wild mushroom pizza
They have the coolest Bloody Mary Bar with all the accompaniments from  fresh grated horseradish horseradish sauce  pickled everything  onions different hot sauces
Our server Jesse was gregarious and cordial and helped set the experience off to a wonderful start explaining the tapas dishes and deserts with enthusiasm and excellent knowledge
beef tongue - if you've never tried it yasu is a good place to start
The other rolls were good but none really stood out to me
Plenty of everything noodles meat herbs sauce jalapenos etc and oh so tasty
With good food and drink an attempt at atmosphere and some leadership this may become a cool and convenient spot for west siders
Food - Our group of seven ordered seven total rolls and three appetizers
All are unique in flavor but contain extremely fresh fish
The food was very good and the service was exceptional
I spent over $60 but the beer and food was worth it
What I got was some truely excellent tasting food
The Swedish Meatballs are always a solid choice--not stellar but pretty tasty
With that said Cibo still gets 4 stars from me because of the adorable converted house it occupies the decent service and pretty good pizzas
I also enjoy their crepes for dessert and appetizers
The food was so good that it completely made up for those things
So we had to get dessert as it was my 'birthday' and Derek recommended the pumpkin bread pudding
This thing was one of the most delicious desserts I have had and definitely the best bread pudding
Who ever was their mixologist did a wonderful job; food and beer goes hand and hand very well
The chicken was also a bit dry and overall the sandwich just wasn't very flavorful
I go there once a week and have not been disappointed and I highly recommend Rouge Chocolate Stout while waiting on your pizza
Ok so on the day I did eat here the food was good but frankly food I've had at other Rudy's location was better
Most of the table enjoyed the red meat - and I consistently heard raves - especially from those who were eating the prime rib
I prefer the chicken gyro but the beef one is good too
The seasoning on the meat is amazing and the Tzatziki just makes it even better
Although I haven't tried their sushi's I expect it to be pretty fresh and good
The food was quite good and the wait staff very attentive
and there were only 3 items available; the traditional lobster roll the hot buttered lobster roll and the lobster salad
The carrot cake was as good as it gets but the best part about this dish were the accompanying carrot-ginger sorbet and cream cheese ice cream- so delicious
Green Burger goodTuscan Chicken Sandwich good large portionRed Velvet Cupcake The cupcake itself was just ok the icing was incredible but it was a tad overpriced at $4
Here's a useful bit of information for my fellow Chicagoans 5 & Diner serves Vienna pure beef hot dogs
Well it was worth every penny to be instructed by the chef learn about the ingredients see hands-on demonstrations of techniques use their huge kitchen and utensils without having to wash the dishes meet new people who share a love of cooking and then to finally sit down and taste everything for dinner with a glass of wine
If you are into Thai food then I would recommend trying Tasty Thai it is similar to Thai Basil in most respects
I know many people will say best malts ever good food but I will venture to say they are wrapped up in the nostalgia
Alternate food recommendation would be the Jack in the Box a half mile north
The foodLiving up to the picture was a good looking handmade tortilla tightly wrapped
There was so much meat that should it be any good buying one of these burritos to take home to use as an ingredient would be feasible
Pizza is one of the few things in life that even when it is bad it is good
The timing is off the food quality is poor
Kids menu was dirt cheap fries and 3 pieces of chicken strips or rather crispy chunks  was actully tasty
the food was good except for just ONE thing
Prices are good portions are generous and food is the best
We ordered caprese for appetizer and couple of pizzas
The price for the quality of food seemed exorbitant
The pizza is pretty good NY style pizza
We started eating the pizza and when the wings finally came they were COLD like they came out of the refrigerator
It's too bad that bad service detracts so much from good food
I ordered a sausage and beef combo with hot giardiniera and some fries
The beef was also tasty and definitely seemed like it had been marinating in its juices for a couple hours
I really like my hot sandwiches piping hot especially when that sandwich is an Italian beef hybrid
Padre's is another one of those restaurants that consistently produces good quality food and good drinks
The food I did get the onion soup and it was good
The menu has a nice selection of rolls and other dishes and they're good just not
Mostly your normal bar food but pretty tasty
Their $5 roll specials are amazing bang for the buck too
EVERYTHING we tried was PREPARED TO PERFECTION SEASONED WONDERFULLY and each dish was UNIQUE and INTERESTING and mostly unlike dishes I've tried at other places
I had the Leek dish before so I knew it would be good but the Beet yes beet Falafels were MIND BLOWING CRAZY GOOD with the surprise dips
I think if you THINK you don't like fish you would like fish it you had it as well prepared and as fresh as what I had here it really was that good
A well flavored broth with seafood such as calamari fish clams scallops and the wonderful thick Udon noddles
The good news is that the food is still delicious
Can't believe their quality of food since they are located in a high class neighborhood
Good mexican food with reasonable prices large portions and with a nice ambiance
The food is straightforward and good not amazing but not disappointing
Z'Tejas is not a place I would go out of my way for in terms of the straight-up quality of the food
It was excellent had 3 Pork tacos chicken burrito no beans 1 cheese crisp and 1 brownie for $13
They have an extensive menu of Irish food and the service has always been good for me
Prices were good the service was great they offered to fresh cook me just mushrooms and peppers with no onions and the food was out fairly quickly
I also enjoy the crab wontons chicken lettuce wraps dandan noodle bowl orange chicken and pad thai if its a good day
The food is delicious and you get your money's worth not just in the quality but in the quantity too
I had the fried chicken strips and I thought that they were overdone but they still had a good flavor
We got good recommendations on the dishes that they serve and we were even thanked when we were ready to leave
The most often ordered dish on our table is the spicy chicken with bones you might think it's crazy for the first time because almost half of the plate is cover with red chili but that's why it tastes so good
I can't live without a good dose of meat in me each week
For my boyfriend and I we ordered-  Pho Special- Lemongrass Chili Chicken- Spring RollsIt was all sooooooooo good
Excellent experience food and service we will be returning A LOT
We started with the Plato Tipico which is a fried appetizer sampler and includes a chicken tamale two beef  & papa empanadas two papusas and  yucca fries
The pizza was cold and I ended up with 24 wings
A bit absurd when the pizza and wings are cold and unsatisfying
Wiser the second time I went I ignored my waiter's advice to order another dish that seemed to be also a prime candidate for cheese drowning and went for the fish tacos which were quite good and served with a heaping portion of rice and beans
We ordered California Rolls and found them small dry and not flavorful
The teriyaki chicken bowls which we were expecting based on the reviews here to be delicious were only
The meat was chewy there was some gristle thrown in for good measure and in general it was a big disappointment
Of course I do take partial responsibility for not noticing it until it was to late and the food was good
My friend had a noodle dish that was very tasty too
The food was surprisingly good I had sushi and the curry noodle thing my friend Jen had looked awesome
Or maybe I just love simple and delicious food
Grab a few good friends who are fellow foodies and visit Lola
Well it's not the best Chinese food around but it is good/decent/fair
Food is really tasty and hot when it's supposed to be
Food  Hob Nobs has a good variety of items on their menu
I went for lunch and enjoyed the chicken salad while my date said her turkey sandwich was delicious
Good coffee good service and good food
had breakfast there this morning w/wife after picking up sister/bro inlaw had the salmon breakfast pizza I asked if it was served on a pizza crust waitress said it was it is actually agrilled  pita bread it was good but they might want to tell the staff difference between pita and pizza wife had huveos rancheros ordered eggs soft poached got eggs medium plus poached bro/sis inlaw had joes special looked good and they said it was tasty service was decient ombience was comfortable
I decided to go with room service one night as I was preparing for my presentation the next day and the food came quickly and was excellent
25 for two flavors in a small cup bigger than the normal cup size tho you get at frozen food stands but I have to say that this is THE BEST gelato I've ever had
When I first came here I thought the food was really good
The rolls kept coming out soggy and cold and these were the tempura ones
When I asked them why the fried roll was ice cold he said  it must have come out of the fridge last WTFWhy would it be in the fridge
Great location super cut atmosphere food looks good
That is not good business sense making your customers pay for food they have not even taken a bite of and are unsatisfied with
But the spider roll already cold delayed by 20m was the real bonus
And while their food was ok/good; I came here for New Orleans fare not the same stuff I could get anywhere in town which was why I was disappointed
I understand the food needs to be somewhat bland because they are serving so many people; but on the other hand I would have been much more impressed if they took the bold step to prepare and serve the food more like they do in New Orleans that is what people are expecting or at least that was what I was expecting
My dish was light flavorful and was perfect alongside my mimosa
They're big and meaty cooked to our specifications of crispy and with a really good spicy/vinegary sauce
All of their food looks good and some stuff is pretty unique
HAHAAll in all this is a good place to watch a game with your group of friends on one of the many TVs in a warm atmosphere thank you dark wood decor and eat some good bar food
I was not prepared for how delicious my food was going to be
Chances are they would sell more alcohol appetizers and desserts if they put forth a little effort
Quality service is one of the key things that makes me decide where to eat but I have to say that the food at Tomo's is worth the service shortfalls
I didn't waste too much space other than the sushi and that is what I recommend if you want to get a bang for your buck
As much as the sushi was excellent the service is a hit or miss depending on the mood of the servers
The chicken salad was good but everything seemed pricey for the quality
It was accompanied with a horseradish cream sauce that was just amazing
Kept their distance for privacy but kept drinks filled order was as ordered and food was hot
The food was very delicious and some of the dishes unique
Now I actually like Fez and Ticoz because they both have good food so I was expecting the same here
I really enjoyed all the dishes we tried and found all to be quite flavorful
The Mongolian Beef Chow Mein and Chop Suey were really good
Although each magnificent My favorite Pizza's are  Sonny BoyTomato Sauce Fresh Mozzarella Salami Gaeta Olives   Rosa   Red Onion Parmigiano Reggiano Rosemary AZ PistachiosI'm a regular here and the service and quality is always the same MAESTRO WORK
last night they offered $1 tootsie roll shots
sometime after the third shot my conversation with the bartender went something like thisme um can i get another shot but not that tootsie roll thingy
or maybe it was just all of those tootsie roll shots
The dish was good but both of us agreed that it wasn't what we expected
The stewed beef cold dish was alright also
the green beans  the ahi salad the pulled pork sandwich a lil' too saucy for my tastes but good nonetheless the cheeseburger the beef filet and the shrimp tacos shrimp was very fresh the side of white rice was kinda weird
9I definitely recommend to anyone who's looking for good + fresh food around 3-6pm
I don't think I would go anytime other than happy/half hour though as the food isn't good enough to  validate $16 for three shrimp tacos $12 for a caesar salad or $19 for a thin filet
The calamari is excellent as are the pasta dishes
Food was excellent but service and cleanliness was not
They also brought us blueberry muffin/cake before our food came and it was delicious too
took LEANNE S's advice and decided not to wait 4 hours literally we showed a little after 5 pm and the hostess told us not before 9 pm at the PHOENIX pizza hot spot
The service was excellent and the food was good too
Four Peaks is an excellent brewery nice brewers excellent beer good food but some of the servers suck
Quality moz and flavor packed toms kick this dish way up with the best of the best
I got it with the chicken and while that adds to the filling quotient it's basically the same low-quality dark meat that is in the Yoshi's teriyaki bowls
If you like a super spicy dish on a cold day go for the spicy seafood soup JamBong
The pizza is just really good the staff is friendly and it is such a deal
Okay having had a Swedish Grandmother i have had Swedish delicacies my entire life and was passed down some amazing recipes
I highly recommend that you eat inside or get your food to-go
He offers pulled pork chicken smoky links and i think brisket too kept warm and smokey with a real smoker fired with glowing hot red mesquite wood
We ordered chicken panang medium hot spicy tuna sushi and Totti'es egg rolls
The egg rolls were fresh and most tasty wrapped in the lettuce with a sprig of mint
I was so impressed to finally find a bakery that understands that red food coloring is an unnecessary ingredient-- hence their brown velvet cupcake
The grilled veggies were good the french fries are seasoned well and the chicken sandwich is tasty
We had a large pizza - pretty good toppings - I don't think the mushrooms were fresh though and the sauce was a little too sweet for my taste
The service was very friendly and we also had a dessert - Apple Spendata sp very good
I just dined here recently after not visiting for a year I live down the street from it and the food tastes just as delicious and divine as ever
The portions are huge so me and 2 friends shared an appetizer salad and pizza and left extremely full and happy
I highly recommend the following dishes Appetizer - Bruschette Miste An assortment of Bruscheette
Every dessert on their menu is really good but this is by far the best dessert I have ever had
The food is very good the drinks are excellent one can sit in or out at the bar or in a chair or on a couch high table or low whatever you want is the name of the game here
The pizza had nearly no flavor and was quite oily
The food's pretty good when they have time to get it right too
Everyone that i was with loved the food and our waiter was excellent
I guess the best thing I can say is that this place from the sounds of it seems very authentic the food is good and the server was cool
I liked it better in the burrito than in the taco maybe because you get more flavor from a big bite of just the meat
But what really sets Kai apart from the rest of the wonderful foodie destinations in the city is the extraordinary service
So when you think of lunch in a gas station what comes to my mind are shriveled up hot dogs on rollers thin dry hamburgers under a heat lamp or maybe a microwave burrito not at Tom's Thumb Gas Station
Coupled with their tasty food [specifically the bruschetta]; it made for the perfect afternoon
Take out was every Friday night in our family and pizza was always hot and tasty
The pizza won't blow your socks off but it's good
For dessert we had to sample what the place seems to be named for the White Chocolate Brownie and it was indeed amazing
the food is obviously good because there was quite a wait on a sunday morning
Over the past 12 months or so we have seen the quality of the food and service level both drop to unacceptable levels
Food was good but dumbed down; the scents of exotic spices you smell when you walk in to JotC clearly are not in the food
A few things worth tryingApps don't skip the apps here the chief does a great job creating great sample dishes
I would definitely recommend this place for some good Texan food
The tiny quarter sized piece of meat was oh-so-good but they were full of fat and bones so it was about $12  for 5 bites of lamb and a plate of bones
Our food was made correctly and everything was very tasty
So it's a good place for lunch or to grab a quick slice if pizza
My personal favorite here is the Italian gold wings the honey mustard BBQ sauce is so delicious that I almost always order these as the main dish
We also love the meatball sandwich and if you like chicken caesar salads you have to try theirs it is topped with shaved chicken that has such great flavor its definitely better than your typical grilled chicken most restaurants have
The GOOD The food is typically and consistently good
pricing is in any ones budget for the quality of food and ambiance
I ordered my meal pad kee mau not my normal but I was in the mood for those thick rice noodles Thai hot and it was hot but still not as hot as they make it for me at Swaddee so that remains my go-to for truly hot Thai food
Their flavors though are excellent and they really do a good job with their food
The ingredients all tasted pretty fresh and the blend of flavors was spot on in my dish and my husband's basil leaf chicken
5I've been to this location quite a few times and have always had the same service and quality of food that I've come to expect
I had the PF Chang's Green Tea which was delicious a bowl of hot and sour soup and the spicy chicken entree with brown rice
com/archives/2009/12/i-finally-go-to-pizzeria-bianco-phoenix-arizona-az-amazing-pizza
This place was pretty awesome in terms of ambiance good vibes cool live music fun app's a great and savory meatloaf and an awesome dessert called Monkey-bread
I love having a delicious slice of cheese pizza and a pear gorgonzola salad yummy
Service was great food came out quick was fairly tasty sodas refilled quick we were at the bar duh
Wouldn't recommend the Barbecue Chicken Quesadilla
The Tilted Kilt has good food not great but really it's the atmosphere you're coming for
Sorry it doesn't work that way - I could buy happiness in the form of a tender waffle and tasty smothered chicken but only my belly felt appreciably fuller not my teeny heart
closer to $5 a mealThe food is not bad but in a city that has so much quality food to choose from why settle for  mehh /  if you don't have to
I enjoyed the dish except for the fact that it was a tad salty and it had a lot of black pepper in it personal taste is one thing but when you're chewing into black pepper
I couldn't even enjoy the flavor of the guanciale in the dish because of the pepper in the sauce
Our appetizer finally made it as the dessert course of our dining experience but that's not it folks
By the time I was about 5 bites into my dish it was cold
The Inn is very close to the Phoenix Canal and we enjoyed a stroll along the canal one morning
She tried her best to get good meat off of it but it was scarce
I've spent the past year on the hunt for good chinese food near my house
She thanked us sheepishly every time we said that our food did in fact taste good
Maybe a little overpriced but I certainly can't complain about the quality and freshness of the salad and sushi
My husband also ordered a chicken udon stir fry plate which was huge and the sauce they used was amazing
Bluburger is pretty great our waiter explained the process they use choose your meat bread toppings sides all that stuff then a few minutes later you have a delicious burger in front of you
Kristen had some kobe beef burger that was also amazing The regular fries and sweet potato fries were both very tasty and we had some great service
The Good I've been here several times over the last 12 years of living in Phoenix and one thing I have to say is this restaurant is very consistent with their food
So off I went to Bark Avenue to hunt down another food that would be good for my giant breed
She even took the time to walk around to the different foods she recommended and fed her Bernese mountain dogs
Needless to say I was very impressed and will be back very soon to purchase a bag of whatever food my baby likes best
Ye are entering into a land where meat is king veggies are flavorless and hummus is bland and overbearing
I suppose you could do a make-your-own veggie sandwich but they're not all created equal and I would have to venture that anything without meat at this place just isn't going to be tasty
You know I probably don't eat at the Yard House enough because every time I go I have nothing but good things to say about their food and staff
The food is amazing the people intriguing and the scenery incomparable
Saturday I was thinking of belly dancing  food and good company
All in all a lovely dish as a good introduction to greek food
It was meaty hearty  tomato flavor that tasted as if your greek mama slaved over it all day
And I worked in the restaurant industry for four years so I understand the struggles and I try not to be super-picky about my food and its quality
Also had Sechuan Shrimp a spicy dish containg many medium sized shrimp flavorful mildly spicy both served with rice
Its a good place to go before a moviesplit a pizza and when you get over to the theater you don't blow money on snacks
The Anaheim was actually pretty good but the Chicken Apple sausage was straight from the freezer section of your grocery store yuck
As for the food it was different and some of it was very good
Eggplant Canneloni--outstanding dish with a lot of good flavors
Snapper Mini-Tacos--Also very good--good fish spicy and very tasty
Other places do not give you as big a bowl nor a wax paper sheet to help push the food in place in the bowl; I was impressed with this simple courtesy
What a blessing to get good food at a reasonable price
I was very worried I would not able to find good sushi; since well
amazing Mexican food and happy hour
The pizza is excellent and when I go with my fiance we also always get their pizza cookie for dessert which is so good
The one thing I always forget is that crab legs take so much time to open and eat that the meat gets cold but
The horseradish was real and HOT and a great compliment
Several of the dishes incorporated southwest flavors which is a huge plus for me too
I've eaten here twice and the food has been excellent both times
I had the Cantonese style chow mein it was very goodSpring rolls were cooked perfectly
Overall the pizza was good pushing towards great
Then again I do not feel any food is worth that wait
Next was some good Kinilaw which is a spicy raw fish dish similar to Cevichu00e9
I also enjoyed some tapa think re-hydrated beef jerky two kinds of rice & more
I had the Chicken Shawerma sandwich and it was very very tasty
The cranberry chicken salad made into a sandwich was DELICIOUS
The food was very good and the service was great
PROSGood foodQuickGood ServiceReasonable PricesCONSIf you do not go to ASU hard to find parking
The meat was tasty as well and steaming hot
Their food is good certainly better than your average Denny's faire and the service was very good
Anyone that gave this place bad reviews obviously is missing some taste buds and probably thinks the food at TGIFridays is good
not only is the food delicious but it has a great atmosphere
We enjoyed the cookie dough tiramisu for dessert
Shrimp appetizer was zesty unless you got an undiluted shmeer of horseradish sauce which over shadowed the shrimp themselves which were actually quite plump and juicy
The pizza came out with a perfectly crisped crust evenly distributed slices or meatball and ricotta and was delicious
I also love any Italian restaurant that doesn't have the words meatball spaghetti and marinara on it; all these words are wonderfully absentI had the pappardelle mari e monti which was a spinach pasta served with scallops and a porcini tomato sauce
We will definitely be coming back to enjoy their brick oven pizzas which looked excellent and their chocolate souffle
A ton of healthy actually healthy not fake healthy like many 'organic' food restaurants creative options that are extremely tasty
A little expensive not too bad but worth it if you want tasty healthy food that is a little special but not so rich that you fill sick afterwards
healthy fresh food can be expensive even if you cook your selfI've enjoyed everything I've tried but I especially recommendEdamame Dumplings like edamame ravioli with truffle oil; so delightful and lightTurkey Bolognese filling entree if your hungry for brown rice pastaCrudites Perfectly al dente veggies Salads Liked all of the ones I've tried
As of late we order take out from Sala every 2 weeks and are consistently blown away by how good the food tastes
Sometimes a 4 yields a dish that is only slightly spicy and other times a 4 is off the charts too hot
In terms of food I would really only give this place a 3 star rating because I didn't find it to be particularly wonderful
they have a good selection of bbq'd/grilled meats and seafood
they also have a very good dessert selection which includes an ice cream bar and a fruit bar
The pizza was so tasty and I am now slightly regretting letting the boyfriend take the leftover half with him to work today
All in all a very pleasant experience with attentive service great presentation and delightfully tasty food
Though there are many amazing dishes here my favorite is the pulled pork sandwich
I had planned on eating lunch there but did not order any food in part because I did not want to give them the satisfaction in part because their food really isn't that good anyway and in part because my stomach got quite upset after they picked the fight with me
Their chicken is good with next to no chewy bits
It is a little more expensive then most fast food joints but the quality is way better
If it wasn't for the fact that the pizza is good and a hell of a deal at 5 bucks and not to mention the closest Howie's to work I'd never go back
The Lion King roll on the other hand was quite good but like most of their rolls run about $14 which is pretty expensive for 8 pieces of fish
The food was good but pricey and the service left something to be desired
Fresh lettuce bean sprouts peanuts noodles chicken and a few other goodies are all in a bowl with a light sauce to mix it all together
Only difference is that these followers prefer FOOD to food like substance see Mcribwich episode of Simpsons; it was voted the #1 meat flavored sandwich Not at lee's
Great hotel with a superb bar and restaurant Sushi Roku but our stay was heavily tarnished by our experience of the pool
Cheap good food that can soak up some of the alcohol
The prices are great- very affordable for good Middle Eastern food
Try the shawarma kafta stuffed grape leaves and their Lebanese pizza- it's all really good
So often when you see these huge gorgeous spaces obviously funded by a good deal of investor money it's all business driven and the organization has lost some focus on the food
The meat was tasty though and the thing that put it over the top was the awesome bun
Super flavorful - absolutely made the dish
We also enjoyed the butterfish tataki with white asparagus and yuzu
Enjoyed the sweet corn tempura with sea salt braised short ribs with daikon agedashi tofu & hamachi serrano chili roll
And I also have seen some wonderful looking sushi come out as well so we have to come back and go that route
The meat and cheese pasty and the chicken pot pie pasty were especially tasty
The food itself was very good there are tons of  pasties to choose from it took me a while to remember it is pronounced pass-tee and not pace-tee
The protein pancakes are their signature dish and although I'm not sure I believe the low et carbs they describe on the menu they are still really tasty and very unique
My mom had the bananas foster french toast which was almost dessert-like but delicious
You know the food is good - there wouldn't be lines out the door everyday if it wasn't
However no matter how good your food is or how popular your restaurant is customer service is still important
Tonight I had the Hatch Chicken Especial which is extraordinarily spicy it's the spiciest dish they make and really damned tasty
It was a little over-priced and the service logistics are still being worked out but the food was good
The pho noodle soup was very good beef or chicken pho is $9 a bowl
The food is good the Kiltlifter is cold and tasty and the atmosphere reminds me of some of the stuff that the McMenamin Bros do with old buildings in the Northwest
At the end of the showroom is a cafeteria swedish coffee is great I love the LOX and they usually have some good sweets
Their food is pretty good and they have some unique options
The macacha beef chimi is really good although it often has more onions than beef in it
The beef was actually pretty good but again
The food came out quickly and was very hot
The chicken fingers tasted really good and I love that he serves waffle fries
The food so far has always been good enough for late night eating
Next up came an order of pork dumplings which are served either steamed or fried steamed in our case these were simply beautiful and quite tasty as well alongside a small dish of traditional soy based dipping sauce
A large steaming bowl of fat egg noodles covered in a dark sauce with lots of ground chicken dubbed 'Woo's noodles' arrived next to my delight the Hipster and I dug in after the appropriate photographs had been taken of course
This dish was quite tasty with the right balance of crunch and softness spice and sweetness
Our final entru00e9e was Kung Pao shrimp and I'm sad to say that though it was good this was my least favorite dish so far
A quick conversation with Chef Andrew Nam revealed that the peppers used in the dish were not as hot as he would have liked and that a new purveyor was being sought
I think they have kicked it up a notch food and beverage-wise because everything has become more delicious
I had the yellow curry chicken and while it was good I wished for heat from the curry
She made recommendations and knew how the food was cooked when asked
We only ordered popcorn which wasn't particularly hot nor was it very buttery although that's healthier I suppose so I can't really comment on the quality of the food
However the dining room alone does not make up for the fact that they're food isn't as flavorful as Lalibela and the service can be hit or miss
This place won't spring to mind first when I recommend pizza in Phoenix but the good service and decent variety will assure that I probably come back again
The desserts were mouthwatering deliciousness
The menu is mostly lunch type items salad sandwiches burgers with a few breakfast options but the food was surprisingly good and very reasonably priced
My normal concerns with such eateries--will the food be maintained at a proper food-safe temperature is this seafood fresh how long has the sushi been sitting out will I be able to make it home before my intestines rupture--dissipated because Hoa knows good Asian cuisine
00 for a peace of dry old chicken and bitter flat diet rc cola good corn on the cob and halfway decent cowbro beans
Casual atmosphere quality food friendly staff decently speedy service
I don't know why people think that just because a sandwich place slices your meat for you that it automatically makes it more fresh and delicious
they're both food if you're hungry but they are lower grade sandwiches for the same price as really delicious ones
There was this little sandwich shop just around the corner from my office that had the most amazing chicken and sausage gumbo plus a number of fine sandwiches
The gumbo is perfect every time and the Shrimp Po'Boy was excellent with the horseradish sauce
Seriously the food I had here was great and every other drink is good but every sip of the carrot juice felt tasted like my body was rejecting a stomach transplant
This is just one of many reasons I love their 100% beef goodness
The DC Ranch location is beautiful what a great place to sit outside with a delicious pizza and a cold beer
bad food i actually got indigestion later that night and it didn't even TASTE good if i'm getting a sour stomach i at least want it to be well worth it bad prices $150
Some people in Scottsdale don't mind paying top dollar for Burger King quality food
But these are the types of places we love - family-owned unique and *hopefully* amazing food and service
We overlooked the menu and had done so online already and decided to go with the Aglio Oglio appetizer a Margherita Pizza and a Vegetarian Pizza
Pizza was good but we added garlic which we were charged 1
HA food was excellent and priced very well
I have eaten there twice and here is what I enjoyedMusamun Chicken Nice pieces of white meat chicken--and a LOT of tasty curry broth
The food is delicious and the variety is huge
I highly recommend the Spicy Asiago Chicken Pasty
Perfect place for a date or to suck down some good food and beer with your buddies
It was a work day so we didn't get to sample any of their wine list but the food was delicious
The sushi is really good the drinks are to but the ambiance is paramount
PB & J Looked really good sauce was good meat really dry
They were pretty bad  soggy average flavor meat was really fatty
I was not impressed with the complimentary table bread served with the entree and I did experience what seemed to be food-borne illness a few hours after dining at Petite Maison
So it took a while to get our food but this time I had a better experiences very friendly services good food good conversation
Just be careful that if you are going to order hot on your meal it could be really hot sometimes because one of my friends got a yellow curry she love spicy food so she ordered spicy hot on her meal it was a little spicier than she expected but she still enjoy eating her meal and i guess everything was just fine
The wings were kind of small and didn't have a ton of meat but the flavor was good and the drink was made well
The pizza was pretty good but I don't think I would name it the best
It's a thin crust pizza and was good for thin crust
Comfortable atmosphere good service and good pizza
first of all their bbq chicken pizza is delicious
As it worked out it was acceptable for a couple of reasons; it was a good piece of meat to begin with and because I had not yet finished my salad it got to sit a bit before I cut it open
They did insist on my taking a dessert to go and I got the creme brulee cheesecake which I used for a delicious lunch the next day
There was a bit of a wait which is fine because the fish is fried fresh and served hades hot
The food is good but not overwhelmingly so
Then server forget the beer till food arrivedthen forget the hatch side for a while leaving me  an under fired meal for most of it yeah I like it going cold
It's food has been consistently good and since I am a heat junkie it's the nearest New Mex place to my work an obvious choice
The soy chicken could be tastier but the dish was pretty good nonetheless
The food arrives about 10-15 minutes after you order it but that is worth the wait because they cook your meal from scratch and it is so delicious
It is a little more money than the burgers but worth it and you can pick either fried chicken or grilled
But good food is not fast food do not forget this
it takes me so long to finish with you but alas your food is good and the amount of homeless people surrounding your establishment is amazingly 0
An excellent complement to the chicken waffle and MnC
Food-Table-side guac best and freshest-tasting guac ever; little guac man actually pushes a little cart full of ingredients to you and makes the guac by your table-side-Street corn good liked the option of having the corn shaved in a bowl instead of on a cob so I didn't look like I'm from Sparta eating-Chorizo porchetta decent but not the best pork shoulder I've had wasn't as tender as I'd like tasted more gamey than I'm used to-Green chili duck confit I didn't try this but feedback from my dining partner was thumbs up-Pumpkin bread pudding with ice cream and pomegranate pieces I approve as a dessert connoisseur-Espresso churros interesting but was just okay; didn't like the milkshake you're supposed to dip the churros in hate alcoholic taste in my dessert stuff; churro sticks looked like poo on a plateService-Our waiter memorized his menu spiel but didn't seem too genuinely enthusiastic about anything was very fatigued or stoned
I had the Kung Pao with mock chicken; it was spiced very nicely and the chicken tasted quite good
I had the Coco Loco Tsoynami for dessert and it was *amazing
I won't repeat what everyone said food was delicious service excellent
I moved here from Atlanta where all of the thai restaurants seemed authentic but it took awhile for me to find good consistent thai food here
Some of my other favorites include Paradise Bakery a terrific Apple Store with excellent customer service and Christopher's Fermier Brasserie with its wonderful French food and variety of fine wines by the glass
The wine flights and the food that followed were amazing
While the food was tasty aside from the fact that it was cold by the time it was served to us the service was EXTREMELY slow and lackluster they were fairly busy but not enough to warrant the slow service
On a good note the sushi was cheap but for a place also owned and this is what I've heard by stingray sushi
The food itself was very flavorful albeit not hot enough for me but that's why I keep Sriracha packets in my desk drawer anyway and there was plenty of it
Sometimes there is an indirect correlation - the less comfy the restaurant the better the food - when it comes to good Chinese and/or Mexican
The food is beyond high-caliber with excellent plating and great seasonal rotations of a variety of proteins and greens
That said the food wasn't bad at all in fact it was quite good
The food however was disappointing as the Brats were good but not great
95--our two drinks plus hot tea was only $2 and our three year old ate for free--or maybe I should say he played with his food for free
Overall the food was decently good better than Pei-Wei Panda Express and those chain restaurants
Cashew chicken was excellent vegetables not overooked and limp but firm and crispy
Teriyaki chicken was also good lots of meat chicken tender not too much sugary flavor
Yummy fresh and healthy food is always worth a little extra
This place by far has the WORST quality sushi I've ever endured I don't care how cheap their drinks are this place blows
The service and food should be good if you are there on a Monday night when the place is empty as on a Friday night when there is a line out the door
Fogo de Chao not only delivers the same great food time after time they have EXCELLENT customer service
If you want to have a dumpy location with nowhere to sit and a decent concept the food better be damn good
Sure it's not as clean and shiny as the Safeway but last I saw Safeway doesn't have bags of rolls for a buck or the same delicious array of imported Mexican snack foods
With friendly service good food and reasonable prices I would recommend this restaurant to anybody
The chicken was good not great really could use better spices or more of them at least
I think the Louisiana chicken had a little more flavoring and the popeyes definitely had more
Our waiter described the shrimp dish as being on a bed of sauteed spinach - I'm not sure what his definition of bed of spinach was because I really had to look to find it - maybe one bite worth
But there were a fair number of shrimp and the dish was flavorful and just the right amount so I didn't leave feeling stuffed
All in all a cute quaint place with good not great or memorable food
The food is good the price is right for sure and the service is prompt
Fresh from the 808 I was in search of some quality and cheap mexican food
This rollercoaster of flavor costs $27
had the regular items you get at an indian buffet the tandori chicken curry chicken but i skipped over to the goat the tikki chicken was good and they also had the cheese version for the vegans and other vegan items as well
The chicken was so tasty the shredded beef had good flavor and the cheese enchilada was made using Mexican cheese queso fresco I think and it was sooo good
Appetizers I've always liked their spring rolls so I'd say yes order that
The BF really liked this dish and I thought the flavors were good and that the dressing was an interesting blend of ingredients
Frankly the Sauteed Mushrooms side dish at Durant's is better because those mushrooms are well-season and not enveloped in a sauce that masks the nuances of their individual flavors
A piece of quality meat does not need to be overwhelmed with spice
The meat was fork-tender and made even more delicious when dipped into the tangy sauce
The chicken is still top quality but not the best ever anymore hey something has too suffer when your expanding
It's still clearly worthy of a visit by tourist and local but if your in a real good fried chicken place in the South you will wait 25 minutes for fresh chicken
First off lemme just say that this review reflects neither on the quality of the food fresh or the service excellent
Contrary to other reviewers Guy Fieri is not the savant of Flavortown the Food Network makes him out to be
just to sample this mythically delicious dish
Indeed he was not steered wrong- it was an absolutely delicious combination of tender and moist chicken mixed with seasonings and topped with cream cheese and melted cheddar
That being said I will review this strictly on the quality of food since we received some deep discounts due to being VIP guests
The quality of the fish was excellent
The key to getting good sushi is to trust in the chef and ask them what is fresh and what they would suggest omakase style
The kim bap roll was highly recommended and the quality was definitely memorable better than most Korean-mom kim bop rolls I've had in my life
Some tasty mochi desserts a few bottle of sake and all in all it was a very enjoyable night for my compadres and I
Fresh produce and tasty meat- the produce on my sandwich was delicious and crisp
The meat was flavorful and as I mentioned there was a lot of it
The shredded Green Beef was a little dry with simple Mexican flavors
we really enjoyed the smoked chicken flatbread and catfish tacos on the HH menu as well
This food is down right amazing and truthfully I have no good way of describing it you will just have to give it a try for yourself
They serve quality food here have speedy services and the prices are pretty easy on the wallet
Tofu can be subbed into all of their dishes so it is an excellent vegetarian restaurants
FOODThe chips with three salsas appetizer was ok but kind of pointless
The food is good but I have to say I usually fill up on a couple of drinks and wind up forgetting about the food
I thought was food was very good and it was also presented beautifully
Good food a bit limited breakfast selection their on line menu had more options but we had been waiting so long to just get our drink order we didn't waste more time asking questions
This place has very good food and they take pride in the fact that most of it is not only organic but local
My husband who got the prawns was disappointed at the size of his portion felt that he didn't get enough food but enjoyed the meal nonetheless
If someone else invites me to go yes but I probably won't be hurrying back despite the food being very good
We stayed at the Pointe Hilton over the July 4th weekend are were very impressed with the amazing pool facilities and poolside food service
I couldn't believe almost 20 minutes waiting for a table then another 30 to get cold food  Very disappointing
They restaurant is friendly and kind desserts are good and the bread is always hot and garlickly
The food is 5 star quality; however I have been coming here for 25 years and the decor has not changed - it is getting a bit tired looking
Anyhow the food is always delicious and on the healthier side as long as you stay away from the cookie that comes with the sandwich
The hostess rolled an outdoor heater over close enough to the table to take the rare chill out of the air but not so close to be too hot
You hear about the most amazing pizza ever
The peppers onions chicken pico and sour cream were already all together in the skillet which was different but still good
I am not a fan of coffee shops for dining experiences since they are small and too similar to fast food places for me so I tend not to go to places that have good food like Acacia Cafe when I want to dine in
This place is a small shop with some tables and some patio areas and the food is spectacular and I would recommend you pick some up or dine in if on the go
The flavors of this dish completely satisfied my craving for a Mediterranean style lunch
The food was fresh the flavors original and everything was delicious
Very good guac nicely warmed tortillas but it was hard to find much chicken amidst the mound of peppers and onions and the sauce it was cooked in was overwhelming
I think it's really cool to have really good food locally owned at good prices
The food is excellent and the atmosphere fun and accepting
It's too much food to eat in one sitting but It's so worth trying your favorite items
Let me repeat that MY LIFE CHANGED TODAYThis pizza despite it being abnormal in every way possible was the most delicious culinary specimen I have put in my mouth in MONTHS
In an out of the way for some but perfectly convenient to our hotel location San Diego is a great little spot for some Mexican seafood in Guadalupe
The flavor was very good and there was plenty of seafood shrimp calamares caracol etc
My wife and I celebrated our seventh wedding anniversary with the SWB's Wine Me Dine Me experience and we were thrilled with the service quality of the food dishes and the inter-activeness with the staff
I especially enjoyed the presentation and explanation of each dish; was interesting to hear their concept and thought beyond each dish
There are a couple of Chilean wines that I highly recommend as well as any dessert that they offer
The food specials are good and you can never go wrong with fresh brew
Stop by a restaurant like Green or Pita Jungle Two Hippies and take note - of their dishware as well as the quality of their food
If you are in the area I would recommend going to True Food and asking to be sat in Jacob's section
The chicken had a really tasty almost hash like spaetzle under it that I really enjoyed
The chicken itself was good but it came with maybe half of a chicken breast and then the leg and thigh
The white meat was good but there wasn't enough of it
This was in my opinion the most flavorful dish we had
All the Barro's locations across the valley have amazing pizza
Food was good service was fine but there was only one other customer besides us
Pizza was a Kosmik Karma which was a vegetarian pizza and was tasty enough but was a completely average pizza
I assume it's authentic Italian food but I've been to Italy technically a couple of times and I never experienced anything this good there except for a $6 scoop of double dark chocolate ice cream in some famous Roman square
I don't have fried chicken often but Lolo's chicken was cooked well crispy on the outside with a lot of flavor
i mean yeah generally food is cheaper out here but the servings are good to share as the tables are already set with red plates white durable and clothlike quality i might add napkins and silverware
The food is so delicious and reasonably priced
Mine was very tasty the fish was cooked appropriately the accompaniments were good but once again I just wasn't BLOWN away
Aside from the meaty goodness of the sandwiches
There happy hour boasts a decent list of cheap appetizers so we ordered the shrimp and veggie tempura crab puffs and beef satay with three Thai teas
If you like The Farm at South Mountain you'll love this place -- less attitude more attentive service and the same great quality food
The food was served late cold and with hard bagels
It was a good size portion and came with caramelized onions chicken fennel and arugula
The service was friendly but I did feel as if our server was repeating things directly from the menu like a robot and he couldn't really make a good suggestion on what to try for food or wine
I don't like going somewhere that has expensive dishes and then being coerced into ordering an appetizer and dessert just so I can leave feeling satisfied
I liked the organic high-end feel to the place and the busyness of the line cooks who looked more like they should be cooking at a fancy steakhouse and the presentations of the menus and food make you feel like you're really paying for quality here
Dirty glasses on the table that were fresh from the dish washer water that tasted of day old coffee clean coffee cups with wet stains in the bottom seated at a dirty table dirty flatware flys everywhere cold food and crappy service
We got the hummus as an appetizer of course with chicken
I did try the spicy chicken and it had a nice flavor to it
Good service too but to be honest I like the food so much this is one place I would still go back even if the service wasn't good
My grilled halloumi cheese sandwich was definitely a frou frou version of the classic dish it was good but it was a bit disappointing only because I didn't know  this type of cheese doesn't melt and I was totally in the mood for some cheesy cheesiness
My favorite rolls are The Damn Good the name does not lie The Tootsie The Vegas and the Philly
95 All the food was pretty good and arrived timely although my pan-fried dumplings were steamed
The other dishes were modest in size and good for individuals versus community sharing
The service was great the food was delicious and the mini-french rolls with butter were delectable
I have tried a couple of the breakfast items as well - the chicken minis little chicken nuggets served in a slightly sweet mini bun and the chicken biscuit sandwich are both good as are the hash browns quarter-sized tater tots - yum
I was going to bring an out of town guest next week if we enjoyed the food but will definitely go to the High End Italian place
Salad looked good and was - big pieces of chicken and egg - but
Service always prompt and friendly food always fresh tasty and well portioned
The food was amazing and the portions were a nice size
Just wish the food looked as good when it comes out of the kitchen as it does in Surprise
The chicken was great the rice was better cooked than usual the veggies were fresh and the sauce was unique but delicious
You could order cow dung and bird feathers on pizza and they would make it taste moist and delicious that's how good they are
Radish cakes were tasty but of particular note were the chive dumplings
The food was amazing the server was attentive without being annoying and the beer was perfect
For dessert the Cookies N' Cream Pizookie is quite good so you might want to save room for that be sure to share it with 1 or 2 more people ~ it's rich and should feed at least 2
Otherwise not worth the risk of shoddy service empty glasses and cold food
Two hours five beers an appetizer and two pizza's later we ended up with a bill for $50 plus tip
The drinks with each course were recommended as is if they were created in unison with each dish
I wanted to call my mom while I was eating to tell her that I finally found an authentic and good Chinese dish in Phoenix but she was already in bed for the night
My fiancu00e9 had the Orange Chicken with fried rice and he enjoyed it
I tasted some and although Orange Chicken is a Chinese-American dish I have to admit it was tasty nonetheless
The quality of the ingredients was good the chicken looks and tastes like chicken and the texture is of chicken
Serving delicious food for very low prices this is the place for a quick and tasty lunch
I love the kreplach's in chicken soup and the corned beef is really good
Carin had the chef salad and the chicken noodle soup and she thought it was really good as well
I'm sure the desserts are good too but after the cheesecake in NYC the cheesecakes and other deserts at Goldman just don't look the same
The hotel offers a great spa with it's own fitness center and pool played the Faldo Golf course which was top notch ate at Meritage Steakhouse Vista Lounge sushi Ristorante Tuscany and Roy's
Haven't been back here in years but the food is still great quality
When it is not extremely crowded more on that later the lounge area is an excellent choice to have a few drinks smoke on their patio and I have heard the food is pretty good too
For our entree we shared a fried chicken dish--very good and actually not too heavy
The sliders are my favorite both chicken and beef and i'd also recommend kettle chips the spinach artichoke dip or the nachos
The food is delicious- i'm getting to the point where i've tried almost everything on the menu
The time we went for dinner the food was good but it took a long time and didn't come out all at once
I can't get over how good their food is
Both were on point and the presentation heres is amazing the food looked elegant and well thought out
They give some good bread to start you off but then they used the same bread for the bruschetta in the salmon dish
The Chicken Rice soup they serve before the meal was also very good
Everyone's right -- there's not much of an ambience at this 2/3-grocer 1/3-restaurant nestled away in a stripmall but what Haji-Baba lacks in ambience it more that compensates for in fresh delicious authentic Middle Eastern food
The food is always tasty and service is great
My favorite is the Red Curry red pepper bamboo shoots carrots green bean basil in coconut milk base soup with Chicken I have at least ordered 5 out of 6 times I was here it's that good
I had the beef taco and the carnitas taco both super greasy meat with less than impressive flavors
The food is OK not good but not bad I'm from Southern California so my standards for Mexican food are very high and sadly the food here doesn't cut it enough for that fifth starBut the place is so cool that I would bring anyone here despite the fact that I could have better food elsewhere
The bbq chicken salad you created was delicious and I especially loved the fun drink bar which let me make my own Italian soda
I think sometimes we have bad experiences and that's probably what happened to the two reviewers that hated the place because I've been referring sushi lovers to Sakana for a decade and no one has ever said they weren't impressed
You will be waiting forever for your food and it will be cold
We waited for over 45 minutes for our COLD food to arrive only after we asked the bartender where our food was
We sent the food back as it was cold so it wasn't comped and we only had 3 beers between the two of us the last two were just poured and left undranken
Prices are high it's a sea food restaurant but the food is worth it
Wildfish is a place I've wanted to try for quite a while and thanks to an excellent Restaurant Week menu I finally did
It's not something that would take me away from a regular sushi bar but certainly a perfect appetizer
The peanut butter cookie that came with it was tasty but did not compliment the dish any further
It seems like half of their menu is on special during happy hour all for a very good price as well which is nice because the food here is a bit pricey
The rest of your menu is your standard pizzas burgers sandwiches and so forth with a few notable exceptions  jerk chicken with shrimp stack and the mac & cheese are wonderful
Generally we only order pizza from mom and pop joints as they are better quality taste and seriously the chains are just terrible but this price was right
90 minutes later we get the pizza nasty and cold
Kincaid's makes the dining experience worth every penny with their food and drink both being top-notch
I decided to zero in on the brown chicken stew which is actually not a stew at all but however you want to describe it it was damn tasty
But the brown chicken stew was just so good that it left me wanting just a *notch* more
I've settled on several good dishes and the place is always crowded and lively these days I was new to the area back in July 2009 when I first visited - I guess I should be amazed that they were even still open at 9pm at that time of the year
Several of the dishes are really enjoyable - the bacon / prawn dish is good and the steamed fish with ginger is outstanding
The food was good seaweed salad baked scallop roll but the service was terrible
The food once  you finally get it has always been tasty
The chocolate fondue desserts are very good and they offer a decent selection of fruits and such for it
The pasta was lacking in flavor and the $3 upcharge for what looked like less than an ounce of chicken was absolutely not worth it
The salad was good the service was prompt but the value and quality of the food
I would definitely visit when I want some good ol' meat and potatoes for breakfast
A nice lesiurely stroll watching the koi fish swim in the pond for a good 45 minutes
We shared the eggplant rollatini for an appetizer
The meatballs were huge and flavorful clearly made mostly of meat not filler
I got the pho ga and the chicken was actually good everywhere else I've had it the chicken is really sinewy and not so good and the noodles were fine
2nd we all had a caesar salad and then I ordered the cilantro chicken that came with some amazing parmesan mashed potatoes and tasty sautu00e9ed squash
The chicken was flavorful plentiful and moist
Cute cozy little bistro that serves up delicious and sizable portions of Italian dishes
Terrible food--even the hot dogs are fried cuz that's the one cooking pot they've got going
The chicken and potato hash is decent but it used to be much better back when it was the savory sage chicken and potato hash and had how do you say actual flavor
So you may want to hit up the smothered burrito or jerk chicken salad instead both of which are delicious
I'd recommend the Cast Iron Skillet Dumplings that are like crispy round Asian pot stickers that come out sizzlin' in sweet chile sauce or the Tortilla Soup which is done really really well here with avocado and lots of chunky chicken
Noble Beast carries the best pet food available along with high quality toys bedding carriers and treats
What they've managed to do at Fox Sports Grill in terms of an amazingly epic  transformation is to completely destroy the menu drop the quality of the food tremendously and yet somehow RAISE the prices
While the service and food were delicious I thought that the price was a bit extravagant for the portion sizes
We figured dining on soul food would be a great precursor to the amazing music of Fats Waller
Our friends who are regulars recommended spouses sharing the Soul Food Platter
- Chocolate Cake with Fudge Fleur De Sel Caramel & Buttercream Frosting Amazing sounding description but one of the worst desserts I've ever had
So so dry and lacking the richness or flavor of a chocolate dessert
I know that my review of Mylynn will fall onto deaf ears with the owner but I can't recommend this place as good Vietnamese food and let my country's cuisine reputation be tarnished
The chicken tenders were tender but had no flavor
The best part of the meal was the sauce but I really wasn't expecting to have to drown the chicken tenders in sauce to give them flavor
The vegetables on my pita were so crunchy and delicious the feta was smooth and yummy the pita was super soft and the chicken was perfect too
They even came around and offered us a free piece of the most delicious lemon tart for dessert
Hop on the town trolley as it loops through the area while you keep an eye out for the wonderful panini sandwich shop and the one-of-a-kind glass beads
I also enjoyed the crispy hot polenta and caramelized banana side dishes
Gina B was correct - maybe negative stars ----- I ate there once with my wife years ago ------ she didn't remember it ---- we drove by tonight ---- and I said why not ---- The waitress we had was really good from Guatemala ------- The food was average at best and probably less then average ----- it was not crowded for Friday evening - and it seemed it has a regular crowd ----- My wife had the fish ---- special ---- she commented way to heavy on the potatoes or fries ------ and my patty melt looked like it was just thrown together and the onions - way overdone ----- and dammit or darn it ---- I order a root beer and it comes in a can ---- come on Linda ---- and then the bill ---- Fish special - patty melt ----- two sodas ----- 28
For an entree my friend & I split the Fungi pizza which was amazingly savory oh so good
I had a truly wonderful chicken Madiera my hubby had meat loaf which is always a tell for a good place my uncle had fried haddock which was crunchy and not at all greasy and my aunt also had the chicken Madiera which was fork-tender
Food and margaritas were all amazing but  when the front of the house doesn't seem to care if I'm there I won't be back
We had an abundance of fresh flavorful and delicious food
There is something about a bite comprised of fried chicken buttered and syruped waffle with a dash of the Louisana hot sauce
It is old fashioned style meatloaf and was flavorful and moist
Not the cleanest or nicest place but that's cool with me I'm used to going to crappy run down spots in Chicago that have amazing food
Chris is amazing and I'm honored to say that I have eaten his food
But for polite well behaved ones who understand and recognize what good food is
A lovely experience at a charming place with amazing food cooked by a talented man
Usually food at that price point can be pretentious and bland but our meal was amazing
I thought the food was good but not great
I am not a huge doughy pizza or hot dog fan
Every dish is addictive flavorful saucy and filling
The upsides are the cold beer Dos Equis & Negro Modelo on draft - can't argue with that and the extensive menu that includes a pretty delicious salsa trio and some tasty fish tacos as an appetizer
As far as the food went it was very good
She said she ordered her hummus for an appetizer and the pesto pizza for lunch
A pleasant Oasis of quality affordable Mexican cuisine smack-dab in the middle of fast-food hell I found The Blue Adobe to be a refreshing break from the seemingly endless array of franchise-clones that plague every corner of the greater Mesa area
Our server there were only two for the entire restaurant messed up the order but nonetheless I felt the food was lacking overall flavor- basic things like Salt and Pepper
I would recommend the Bun Bo Hue Pho Dac Biet and the beef with rice I forget how to say it name
Then chicken piccata the worst chicken I've ever had eggplant parm I happen to hate eggplant but co-workers loved it gnocci AMAZING-the best I've ever had
I love a good meatball but holy mackeral these meatballs were out of this world
From your small intimate yet eclectic setting to your amazing menu featuring Arizona grown foods and wines how my heart will long until my next visit
It is not the strong invasive flavor of Mexican food but a mellow Cuban taste
They seemed to have a lot of employees working here for such a small place but that's a good thing because the place was very clean and they brought our food to us
The rouladen was perfect the beef was fall-apart tender and the filling was accented with the bacon and delicious
The food is always fresh hot and delicious and the restaurant is very clean
I like the layout the space the decor and the vibe was good up until about 845pm and then the restaurant was DEAD but for the price the food was just okay and the burgers were WAY too salty
Everything is good from the bread to the meatballs to the side salad
Expect to wait a 1/2 or more for your food to arrive though it will not be done quickly but it will be worth the wait
The desserts are also delicious not to mention it contains a market with a surplus of Italian ingredients to make your own meal at home
The ambiance and atmosphere are wonderful the service was super friendly and really really helpful and the food was DIVINE
They were all excellent although they deep fry their shrimp tempura roll and I prefer mine to be not fried it was STILL fantastic
satisfying and rewarding entrees that delighted us both with the flavors and with the quality of the food and the preparation
The food is good but pricy when you take your first bite every taste bud will be stimulated and you just want to take another bite to get that same rush
Their beef with shrimp dish #41 is amazing
I have also tried a noodle dish of theirs with meat and veggies and it was good as well
Grimaldi's pizza is fresh crispy and melt-in-your-mouth delicious
They cook the pizzas in a wood oven and they will get spots of char black on them but even those are delicious
radishes blue cheese egg cucumbers  and I'm sure i'm forgetting something else but it is GOOD
Some others at the table had pizzas and the corn one especially was quite good
The curried chicken salad was delicious as was the buttermilk chicken salad
I don't know how good the ribs were but I got the pulled pork and mac n' cheese my favorite BBQ dish and it was probably some of the best I've ever had
This place gets an easy four stars for being a good spot to catch bands grab some decent but appropriately greasy bar food and enjoy an always decent drink selection
*SPICY TUNA ROLL - For 1/2 off worth your while to add this to the menu
My chicken was extremely juicy and full of flavor to the point where i just couldn't stop eating it
Most gryo/hotdog joints have great food but are filthy inside ie
Good happy hour specials too- lots of munches for 3 dollar which include taquitos fried pizza rolls and fried zucchini
Finally we enjoyed some beef chow fun with XO sauce
For such wonderful food served in such generous portions our bill was $31 for two people
Moved to the area recently as was looking for a local spot to frequent with tvs drink specials and good food
I will say that I have enjoyed Switch for 4 years with its food being consistent and their Sangria - some of the best
In fact if it weren't for the quality and actual taste of the food I would give this place 2
Sipping my water while watching a small boy barely make a dent in his enormous pile of eggs my first course of the meal at Liberty would arrive hot from the pastry case in the form of the largest Cinnamon Roll I've eaten to date - a squared off yeasty pastry nearly filling the 12 by 12plate and inundating what I can only imagine to be a 6 foot diameter with the smells of butter cinnamon and sugar
Large yet impressively light with wispy dough sandwiching layers of cinnamon and butter and the entirely lacquered in a thin sugar shell the Cinnamon Roll wowed in flavor as much as it did in size and without being the belly buster of Cinnabon was a perfect size to share as an appetizer - or if you're feeling truly ravenous gluttonous to enjoy on your own
With the cinnamon roll easily dispatched of and now wishing I'd have gotten coffee but not wanting to withstand the 10+ deep line my second dish would arrive approximately fifteen minutes on the heels of the cinnamon roll and given all its hype I truly expected the Griddled Bread Pudding to be mind blowing but alas it was merely very good
Overall a very nice spot and a place I'd definitely return to for the baked goods as well as to try the pancakes plus perhaps the griddled bread pudding with a side of fruit as a starter and one of those incredible looking Sticky Buns or scones as dessert
They have a lot of wonderful dishes from region around Hong Kong and they prepare the standards so everyone is happy
We had a House special noodle pan fried XO Fish spicy Pork and Tofu Hot pot Beef and Chinese Broccoli plus Hot and Sour Soup
We usually save the Unagi a cooked eel with a sweet teriyaki like sauce for last it's like a sushi dessert like the cherry on top the wonderful last bite to end your meal this was not the case
That poor rice embarrassingly flaunted around in its undercooked flavorless garb passed off and billed as sushi rice
- Yucatan Chicken Tortilla Soup A little too salty but I still love the flavor
The food was extremely tasty a little on the salty side  but it probably was the pruiscuitto
I have to remind myself sometimes that I don't live by the ocean anymore and very few restaurants here in the valley provide good quality seafood dishes along the lines of the paella
Besides the soup we ordered the House Special Lo Mein Sizzling Hot Plate Beef Szechuan Green Beans and Yui Shan Eggplant
The Sizzling Hot Plate Beef arrived first
Interestingly enough the beef was on a regular plate not sizzling which the waitress then dumped on to a hot plate sizzled maybe just a bit
And to address to accusations of cats being used to supplement the meats as my buddy once pointed out If this is what cat tastes like it's all good
Good but not amazing traditional arizona  mexican food
the food is good and relatively inexpensive and the select apps are half off during normal HH times
I ordered the chicken salad and although I would've liked some corn or tomato salsa without onions the rest of the options were tasty; especially the guac
Again I highly recommend one of the table grill options where you get chorizo a couple quesadillas seasoned beef and a poblano pepper stuffed with cheese
He loved the flavor that the white raisins brought to the dish
Good food does not consist of drowning the dish with cheese and grease
Sanctuary is a great place to stay--awesome views delicious food friendly staff--exquisite service overall
BCB also offers a good list of other breakfast food sandwiches and a decent variety of coffees
For authentic delicious food this is the place to be
I really enjoyed the fish ceviche while my husband did not as he does not usually like fish ceviche
Costs were good and I enjoyed the atmosphere but the food was overall just okay
The Pros**Great stadium seating**Reclining chairs**DIY butter station for popcorn with many seasonings**Online ticketing and ticket kiosks so you don't have to wait in line**$5 movies for show times before noon**Early show times for the early bird really early like 845 amThe Cons**Parking is hit or miss**When movies are almost out of the theater they play them in these tiny theaters upstairs and if you get a bad seat your screwed**Typical teenage workforce**Every once in a while they won't get a popular movie that is out and I have to go somewhere elseAll in all it's a great theater and there is a lot of good food and drinks in the Westgate area so it's good one stop shopping
only because the steak plate it came in was off the shelf-cold and there was no sizzle at all when they served the dish
Their sizzling fish belly bangus fish is EXCELLENT
Their sizzling BISTEK beef slices with onions were GOOD
Anyway we had to order $25 worth of food with our certificate which was rather difficult to do because their menu is so reasonably priced
F - Lobster Roll - This was baked and just absolutely amazing it's rare to have warm sushi and this definitely his the spotA - Hawaiian Crunch - Q - Sarenda Roll - I can't remember A and Q but one was spicy tuna and the other salmon
The food doesn't even match up the quality of food normally found at OPH
The dining area's usually crowded with other hotel patrons so I usually brought food to my room
Pretty good sushi bar with tempura veggies various sushi rolls and a platter of sushi accessories such as pineapple salmon salad
A Sunday afternoon gave us a chaotic Cafe Bink but excellent food
Thank goodness the chef wasn't pulled into waiting tables too because the food was excellent excellent excellent
Cool space excellent servers but the food was not good
People are always super opinionated myself included about where to go for the best Mexican food and in the past I have been disappointed in most of the recommendations I have received
I have had giant food portion for $10 at sit down restaurants with amazing ambience
The food was so good I made everyone go back the next day
I had been talking up how hot Los Dos is to the newcomers and warning them about how spicy certain dishes are the Adovada ribs in particular and nothing was hot
Well the salsa was pretty warm and actually quite tasty but all of our dishes were not spicy at all
Plus it pains me to see the correlation between the prices of the items here the quality of food/ambiance offered & the ratings on yelp
We ordered 5 maki rolls to start2 from their 'signature' menu firecracker roll and the madi gras rollI love spicy food of all kinds - the firecracker roll was just HEAT no FLAVOR big upset
The madi gras roll was plain and flavorless
We got the followingLas Vegas roll - ok the sushi to rice ratio was about 20/80 not impressed at all
My recommendations for great sushi Blue Wasabi Sakana and The Sushi Room
I'm Middle Eastern and know good Middle Eastern food
I love good Arabic food but it is often hard to find in Arizona
It's quaint romantic and the food is generally excellent though we tend to order the same things every time - truffle pomme frites with 3 dipping sauces including house made ketchup frisee salad oysters and any of their souffles
THe Pizza here is so good and the restuarant smells so good as well
The dishes I have tried are all very tasty
Impressed with the thin crust style pizza
I really don't have more to add except it was amazing pizza
We both ordered some spring rolls I had the traditional she had tempura fried shrimp in hers two different sauces but we both preferred the traditional peanut sauceI had a vietnamese sandwich that was delicious pulled pork veggies LOTS of cilantro per my request on a big baguette My friend had a singapore salad that was ENORMO and yummy
But ultimately it's about the food and I can't recommend it
Beer selection was limited and a little pricey but who can say no to an ice cold beer with a platter of food
The last time I reviewed LGO I wasn't thrilled with my food though I was happy with the portion the size and the quality
Although there was a good crowd in the restaurant and they didn't mind the noise level but noise level was too high and distracting for us which the food was not able to overcome
Our office decided to celebrate Cinco De Mayo with some good mexican food
Very tasty meat was moist and the breading a little on the sweet side
There were only six pieces but after sharing a piece or two and eating the amazing green beans this was plenty of food
Overall the food was delicious fresh and thoughtfully prepared
The quality of the food is ABSOLUTELY worth the wait
The best way to describe Marketside is if you were to cram the Walmart food section and the Wholefoods quality and organic cool factor  in a space the size of Walgreens
Steady stream of caffeine great bacon and good ol' comfort breakfast foods
I highly recommend the mesquite chicken perfect for sharing with the mashed potato bar and creamed corn as sides
He also made sure he had correct directions in order to ensure my food didn't get cold while he was searching for my home
The fried egg rolls are as delicious as they get wrapped in lettuce and dipped in fish sauce
The barbecue pork sandwich 75 is also tasty but does have some fatty meat in it
Having been used to exquisite and thoughtful service as well as wonderfully prepared and presented food we were not prepared for an evening of disappointment
The food was great the service is good the people watching is killer
Everyone likes pizza even when it's cold the next day
The dish did taste good but I am not a fan of corn tortillas and that's all they have here
I thought the food was good - my spicy tuna was delicious
You must know what you are getting--I don't have to tell you the pizza breadsticks chicken strips pretty good in terms of getting what you pay for
Some poor chump is going to waste $40 on a pizza and some $5 BevMo wine thinking he's dining on something amazing
BJ's Menu is expansive the food is consistently good and the servers are always friendly
Also ordered the Pumpkin Bread Pudding for dessert and almost punched the bartender it was so good
My steak was cooked perfectly and my husband's chicken dish was really good too
His dessert was pretty amazing too
It was a great experience and the food was worth remembering even a year later
We were not served the amazing bread with garlic butter and leeks - just rolls
Just really excellent service cocktails and amazingly good food
The only reason to go to this or any Whole Foods - and the 5 star review - is for their delicious MARY'S AIR COOLED CHICKEN in the butcher department and HONEYMOON SWEETS at their bakery
Food The breakfast yogurt and granola was awesome but what really rocked my world was the cold curry chicken salad sandwich I ate for lunch
Food is perhaps a bit more expensive than other coffee shops but it was pretty darn good
AND the important part they provided free appetizers three chafing dishes full
We also ordered Tutti-Frutti-Frito Fish crispy salmon w/ mango and apple shreds and lime vinaigrette and Tamarind Delight Shrimp crispy shrimp w/ veggies served w/ a subtle tamarind sauce which were also excellent
The salad was tasty but the soup could have used some chicken or noodles it was boring as is
Our goal was to try a few different appetizers and that turned out to be more than enough food for two
We've had their pizza before and we both think it's really tasty - good crust
So while I wouldn't say it's the most remarkable place in town it's a great dependable place to get flavorful food
I got the hummus which was pretty good and the lunch special which consisted of a beef gyro and Greek salad
it was decent but I wasn't floored with the quality of food
The price was perfect though a good deal for the amount of food they pile on the plate
The passion fruit tea is tasty the waitresses are really friendly and the atmosphere isn't completely terrible its just the food that was the Debby downer kind of like this snore-fest of a review
I had the pizza with pepperoni and onion which was tasty
Not your typical pizza/wine bar menu turns out to be a good thing
We ended up ordering the thicker pizza which was pretty good
Good food and good prices you just can't beat it
The rice was slightly dry and not very flavorful and wasn't my favorite but it was a nice addition to the jerk chicken which had some decent spice to it actually probably a little more than the curry from what I remember
I think this place is much better quality food then most sushi places and its a lot cheaper
If you are looking for a good time with some great food this is your place
I am a huge fan of there Chinese Chicken Salad the dressing is very spicy but really good
So she got some sushi for wonderful prices two rolls for 5$
The food they were cooking smelled good and the lettuce cups were really yummy so I would come back
For appetizers we got the asparagus duck confit and the cured meats plate
rrWe didn't stay for dessert because my friends were getting tired but they were impressed that restaurants like this existed here
Bit pricey but well within what I expected to pay for the environment and food quality
$2 domestics and $3 imports including KirinThai Basil has notoriously good veggies in their dishes excellent curries and noodle dishes
A good place to introduce newbies to Thai food and a place that will continually draw you back on weekday nights for hearty healthy tasty thai foods
Their thin crust pizza is very good but the caprese is exceptional so it's hard to venture from it
I make a pretty good GFCF pizza but Z's made me weak in the knees
No cardboard crusts no imitation cheese flavor - this was genuine pizza for the digestively-challenged
The food sounds so interesting and flavorful
Then we tried the Mushroom dish and it was really good
The third dish was the Tiger Shrimp with grits I think The shrimp were good but they used Pace Picante Sauce with the grits and it was disgusting
The fourth dish we tried was the Spare Ribs and these were really good I would recommend these as well
Yes the name is quite cheesy but if you can get past that you'll find some seriously good Greek food
The pita bread is sooo tasty and fluffy and just amazing and the gyro meat is fantastic
The decor is very nice and the food is actually really good
Although the food was good sadly we will not return
My only issue was there is no kids menu not that what I ordered for my child was not delicious it was just way too much food
It was cold and windy and kinda sucked but the food is yummy so we were mostly pacified
So it's safe to say If there's good Sushi in town it's been in my mouth
I'm from southern California where the sushi is plentiful and the quality is world-class
So I guess it shouldn't be too surprising that the food at Taberna really is fresh innovative and delicious
The dish sounds intense but all of the flavors actually worked really well together and the scallops were cooked just right
Anyway the food was good but they bring way too many plates one for your dressing one for your sandwich one for your salad and an extra one for a tasty little muffin
If they want four stars they should whittle away the pretention serve up the good food and dispense with the magenta booths
Once you successfully maneuver past all the drunks wandering around in the middle of the street on Van Buren you arrive here to find a good selection of 56 food items not counting sauces & dressings & for me after paying the friendly lady up front it was on to the Hot & Sour Soup
This place is just west of the Phoenix/Laveen border which prior to this place opening recently was an area whose dessert offerings were limited to Cold Stone and what you can get at fast-food places
not ''authentic'' mexican food by any standard but it was always a chickeny cheesy gooey flavor bonanza that I enjoyed thoroughly
basically a chimi  That watery chicken had no flavor at all
basically a very tasty shell with very tasy Fundido sauce filled with chicken textured nothingness
Either way it's pricey but you get a good bit of food
There food is good too  now I have only eaten there once so I can only comment on the food I had the Pulled Pork Sandwich
Overall Good Food Great Atmosphere and I will go back
- The pricing matches the quality of the food & drinks
We got our food and it was delicious since my meal didn't come with the fried okra it was an add on it came out way before our meal along with the bread and both was eaten way before the main meal but they were hot and I didn't want them to cool off so we ate
The chorizo already brought a good flavor to the dish but the chef also added sea salt to the spinach which was overkill
I can see why this sushi bar constantly makes the top 3 places to get amazing sushi
I've been there once on a date and not only was the sushi AMAZING but my boyfriend got a filet which melted in your mouth
Our California Roll was great and the edamame was tasty
The weren't too far off at this place as everything was tasty but for the price i expect a little better quality of food service and ambiance
My anticipation for good Italian food was on the rise but then the entrees showed up
The sweet potato pineapple and cilantro on pork would have been good if it was heated up before being served as would have the corn and bean relish on the chicken
Bread meat spreads and cheese selections too - I haven't tried all of them but they all look delicious5
I wish the chicken was actually grilledThe bread and the pungent mustard are my absolute favorite items here and their fresh OJ is pretty good for a morning snack
I give great customer service and when I'm paying pretty high prices for food and drinks I expect pretty good service
Basically I'd rather go to a regular bowling ally during Cosmic Bowling where I can listen to better music get a pitcher of beer and some good food for half the price
The Red Rock buffet never has anything sensational but there's usually one or two things on the buffet line that are quite good like lamb or roast beef round
The chicken meat was composed of average sized cuts of mediocre quality somewhat fatty bland chicken - very much akin to what you get at any reasonable supermarket deli for $5 for 8 pieces these days
I had tried the Spicy Salami & Sausage with San Marzano Sauce fresh Mozzarella herbs and spiced oil previously which was great amazing crust super delish toppings but we decided to try a different pizza this time
Of course bacon on anything is a sure hit but it was a nice compliment to the goat cheese and leeks I would definitely recommend trying this for a nice change from your traditional pizza
The service was excellent and we all ordered the lunch sushi special
;PI also had the yellowtail/scallion roll which was fresh and delicious as well
The food here is amazing as you would expect from a chef as expertly trained and experienced as this guy
You can get an Italian cold cuts meatball Philly and several more
The broth was just right and you get a good amount of noodles and meat
I can never get enough of having good spicy food
Their sugar cane chicken appetizer is fantastic
Worth happy hour visit for drinks but not worth going for the food
I had to do the beef on weck and hot wings comparison and my dining companion followed along
The beef on weck was served in a timely manner and it looked pretty good
I don't really expect really good Korean food in the Peoria/Glendale area so this place actually went past my expectations
I have nothing bad to say about the sampler except that there is not that much meat included and that the samgyupsal is kinda flavorless except for the ample amount of pork fatty goodness
My daughter didn't think her chicken Guedo burro was that good and my son wanted to get a refill on his drink which he figured was not allowed so he didn't ask
Despite my loud showy protests I couldn't help digging my spoon into the gourmet s'mores dish with its caramelized marshmallow and chocolate covered bacon the creme brulee standard but good and my favorite the sweet potato pie
I'm no expert in Scottsdale culture but I have a feeling that this little hotspot in a strip mall may be a major player in the local cuisine - its fresh classic dishes and friendly service are definite crowd pleasers
The food is good but for the most part it's location near the Harkins Theater make it a disaster to find parking or to consider going to as a restaurant
I really love Malee's and the food is always good
We get our food sometimes it verges on good and more often than not just uninspired
I've tried a bunch of their food and it is always good with HUGE portion sizes I have never been home without a to-go box
The tandoori chicken legs n' thighs while tasty are a bit dry
Plus really good all you can eat fish on Friday for ten bucks
One thing I absolutely loved was the horseradish mashed potatoes- they were amazing
The food tasted amazing- I am glad because they are kind of pricey but no complaints on the price because it was worth it
He enjoyed it but I'm not sure if as much as I did my dish
I really enjoyed the entree but having my food wrong the first time and the bad customer service ruined the experience
Olive and Ivy is a trendy Scottsdale spot with tasty food loud music and good service
The beer was really really cold which is a huge plus for me the food whatever it was was delicious and the service was excellent
I would suggest going there if you can for good spirits good times and good food
The atmosphere expressly stating share food share drinks Sangria by the pitcher share words laughs and good times
Cooked and spiced to perfection the chicken is moist and flavorful
The jerk marinade explodes on your palate but doesn't overwhelm the natural flavor of the meat
The soft earthy flavors and textures balance the pop and flare of the potent and juicy chicken
Cons  ~ low quality meat used in the tortas no chips and salsa potato chips only and no alcohol
I would not waste your time here because the food is not even good and the margaritas are only okay
However as good as the food is there is much not to like as well
When it is so hot in the summer and kids only want to sit inside and play video games that is the time to enroll them in Chrissy's summer program
I won't run through all the dishes but in brief all of their food with the exception of one fish course and one dessert lacked flavor
I thank Posh for their excellent service but if the food continues to let diners down making it right with great service will be no substitute for not disappointing in the first place
We chose to go with the Date menu which allows you to taste an appetizer 2 salads 2 main courses and a dessert all for a little under $30 per person
The portions were real size and we thought we might need to take some of this fabulous food home but then decided to finish this deliciousness there
The meat had decent flavor but was tougher than I expected and overall very disappointing
The rest of the table seemed to enjoy their food which is good
The food was amazing minus Frois Gross which is just not for me
It is a little pricey but the food experience and service is worth it
I have recently moved to Phoenix area and was on the search for some good Asian food
The food is very fresh tasting and you can order it to your preference mild hot or very hot
I couldn't find much to like about my chicken tacos- they were ok but the meat didn't have much flavor there was no cheese and they were pretty stingy with the guacamole and pico
Had a beef dog with spicy chipotle-mayo and mango salsa to keep the flavors singled out a bit
I was a mark for their food the first time I ate there with my kiddos based on a recommendation to try it
I was in beef heaven initially because although the burgers were a tad pricey in comparison to the other big fast food joints the kids meals were very affordable & pretty good sized to boot & the taste of the fresh food combined with the energetic ambience had me hook line & belly
Anyway we finally ordered and I got the fried chicken and the BF got the short ribs which he was really excited for and we got the green chili mac and cheese due to the good reviews of it
but nothing on the dessert menu looked very good and honestly we were scared to get a dessert after the food being so lackluster
There's lots of good stuff to talk about but the food was so out-of-this-world let's focus on that
Alas there was no room for any of the many interesting and tasty-sounding desserts
- so we get it already - the pizza is good
Food We ordered spring rolls chicken pho cold noodles and the infamous #55 spare ribs that many people raved about via quick tips at the time
It wouldn't have been so bad if the spare ribs were amazing but what came back was a few lumps of meat on bone that was submerged in black pepper
Cost to worth it rating 3Highlights- Beers ~113 on draft pints yards and half yards 2 pints worth available - Lemonade specialty vodka cocktail with a sprig of mint that was perfectly refreshing and not too sweet- Sweet potato fries thin and crispy with a drizzle of syrup- Spicy chicken sandwich blackened and on a flatbread roll which was thin yet dense and grilled- Jerk wings sauce was a wee bit spicy yet sweet- Patio tables and couches with misters- Bathroom from the hub 5 urinals and shelf to park your beer glass which he thought was awesomeLowlights- OC chain so not really getting the AZ experience
Food wasn't bad but it was no where close to good
Overall the food was very good quality and tasty
The staff is usually pretty friendly and the food good
The chicken monacco sandwich is also very good and unique
The food was nothing short of delicious and the decor is well crazy
The omelets are a little greasy but the food is otherwise excellent and they serve beer early which always comes in handy
Also the chicken/egg white/avocado/cheddar is very very good too
I have gotten a good Turkey Club then a week later gotten a soggy Turkey Club but I feel like you have to have some forgiveness for real food that isn't all pre-packaged
I have never had a relationship with a redhead go smoothly and Wendy is not an exceptionShe's never really been good to me although she's occasionally surprised me with something fun and spicy like a deep fried spicy chicken sandwich that will set your mouth on fireBut in the end she's always been a bit of a disappointment
Not to worry still got pretty good food here
The atmosphere is always lively and it is usually busy when I go which is fine for the delicious food I usually get
However the last few visits I have wanted nothing more than a bread bowl with some basic soup chicken noodle tomato cheddar and broccoli etc but out of the four soups of the day nothing sounded remotely good to me
This place is fantastic the food is delicious and the atmosphere makes it all work
For my entree I ordered the Ropa Vieja which was made up of the most perfectly tender beef and tasty rice with beans
A couple of cheeses veg's and meats were really fun to share and made for good first date food
but after everything else we had its not a wonder whyOur server was amazing as well she provided us with food ideas and always made sure our drinks were filled
It completely overpowered the flavor of the meat
The food is generally good to very good but a little inconsistent
Items on the Hot & Spicy Style menu is hot and tasty but can be very oily I scooped out almost a small rice bow of pure oil from 2 dishes ordered
Seafood items I tried sauteed shrimp and salt & pepper calamari are good with just the right amount of spicy and crunch
We split an artichoke dip appetizer each got our own salads and entrees and split dessert
Overall food was very good and the value was excellent with this special
My cousin had the meatloaf which looked amazing
Because the FOOD WAS NOT WORTH THE PRICE we paid
I don't mind paying a lot for good  food but we left RENEGADE CANTEEN feeling like we had been ripped off EVEN THOUGH THE ATMOSPHERE WAS GOOD AND THE SERVICE WAS GOOD it just didn't make up for the lack of flavor in the food
Either you get crappy service and good food or crappy food and good service
Missing out on great service instant refills perfectly cooked deliciously spiced food and a solid place to eat
It's not like any other Machaca Burrito I've ever had -- this one does not come with eggs nor is it dry -- the meat is more the consistency of pot roast stewed in it's own juices w/ onions and it is so tender juicy and bursting with flavor
The quality of service and food were reflective of a five-star restaurant without mirroring the small portions and high prices
I also highly recommend the Thai Chicken Pasta which I usually get almost every time
I love that they cut their meats and cheeses fresh and it always smells AMAZING inside the store
factorlike i said good food and great service
might i highly recommend the spring rolls
The desserts are not large in fact the entire serving comes in a shot glass
I have to say that all of the food was perfectly prepared and delicious
The coffee was standard coffee shop variety not bad and my cup was never empty   Sure beats the less than stellar hotel food or overpriced IHOP food I'm used to when travelling
We got there in time for happy hour and enjoyed $5 appetizers and discounted rolls
The flavors are so good it really doesn't matter to me whether a dish is vegetarian or not all are equally satisfying
We started with a appetizer the nachos with chicken and our waitress was prompt and polite
My wife ordered a chicken Cesar wrap and she enjoyed everything
The food is a good view point of what bar fare SHOULD taste like / be
Be sure to stop by and try it out if your a Goodyear visitor or local it's quite the nice escape from your frozen food Fridays / Chili's
Have always been pleased with the quality of the pizza here in particular the crust
The pasta and the pizza muffins look worth the visit
it was definitely bizarro world because the food was delicious
the calamari was perfectly dusted in a light coating not your usual 6 dunkers as in thick coating that covers the lack of seafood we ordered a sampling of most of the appetizers but no entrees
The wife and I split four smaller dishes sides and appetizers because we wanted to eat more than just a couple things and not have to roll ourselves out of the restaurant and food come at the game
If by adventurous you mean loves delicious unique inventive desserts then she was 100% right
Good food this place is very authentic and good prices I am never upset
HOWEVER the insides of the egg roll were quite tasty
Pad Thai I've never had much Thai food and I enjoyed this quite a bit
Flaming Kabob serves excellent food from a family owned local restaurant
Since I'm a big fan of new American food good drinks and stylish atmosphere I thought Bloom and I would be a match made in heaven
I'm big on flavor which sounds obvious but a lot of the dishes that were supposed to feature flavorful influences from Asian and European cuisines were unexpectedly bland
The forbidden rice that came with the dish saved the dish for me as it featured the Asian flavors that I was expecting
Never a good thing in my humble opinion especially when the dish is an appetizer costing $13
Now that I think about it all the dishes that I enjoyed that night have some things in common they are simple and not overly fusion-y
*The two seafood appetizers Lobster/Crab Puffs and the Sesame Shrimp - the first is rich and really satisfying with a light drink and the shrimp are very fresh and flavorful with an Asian kick
Our dining partners got yellow chicken curry and tom yum soup which looked amazing as well
My entree was definitely enough for me to return but everyone else's food looked so good too I might have to try something new next time
I have only had the chicken tacos and they are pretty good
Meat is tender and tasty and in a light tomato broth which I like despite the fact I am a chicken taco purest and like the chicken to be plain old shredded chicken usually
They serve food late night and have some good choices
We haven't tried everything on the menu yet howeverFried Chicken 10Chicken Fried Steak 10 gravy was wonderfulCatfish 10Mixed greens 10Rice & gravy 8 sometimes not as hot as it should beGreen beans & Taters 10Black eyed peas 8Corn bread 10Mac & Cheese 3 sorry
Little Chicago Pizza is phenomenal and they offer a wide array of delicious Chicago-style offerings like red hot Vienna dogs Italian beefs and of course well done authentic Chicago-style THIN CRUST pizza
Chicago pizza places the good ones anyway can churn out of some the best thin crust pizzas ever
Chicago-style pizza embodies its own attributes and a reviewer should review the pizza not in the general sense of pizza but in the sense of if this a good Chicago-style pizza
People grew up with different tastes for things and therefore develop bias so the best and most fair assessment for a pizza place is to judge it on it's tier quality and style
LCP is top tier great quality and very well done Chicago-style pizza
It's a good change-of-pace from the other fast food chains
Pizzeria Bianco was decent pizza but by no means worth navigating the tremendous crowds
That being said I would rather go to Cibo and wait 0 to 20 minutes for equally delicious pizza
Killer creative dishes executed deliciously and priced better than one would expect
the carrot juice was great always love a place that offers ginger beer and the brown chicken stew was sooooo good
One thing I don't recommend is the plantain and avocado spring rolls
Food - I appreciated the variety of the menu from appetizers to signature rolls there was a lot to choose from
Salmon Nigiri - Good portion size tasted very fresh       Dam Jumper - A little on the small size a nice change-up of having the roll wrapped in salmon the least favorite of the three rolls we ordered       Tropic Thunder - Very very good
Sweet and spicy the pineapple salsa was an interesting and delicious addition nice large-sized roll        Philadelphia - Your typical Philly roll good size very fresh tastingPrice - As mentioned before martini prices were very steep
It fills the veggies and pizzas with a wonderful charred & woodsy flavor
My other dining mates had  the Shepards Pie which was delicious and the grilled fish tacos which were also exceptional
The price was right ambiance was good food was good too
Heck if you're a good restaurant wouldn't you want to welcome your customers who if you win them with good service and good food will come back or are you happily satisfied with the customers and your fans that you're not interested in winning a few more
Overall the food was very good but the service had me wishing it was better and it did affect my overall dining experience
Its about wonderful food generous portions and one of the nicest proprietors I've ever had the fortune to meet
Tasty flavorful and Yum are descriptions of their food
I like the Ginger Soy Beef Veggie Hot Pot Kung Pao Chicken and so on and so on
The food is very good but not super spicy how I like it
I would recommend this spot for the great food and the improvements in service
Service was good food was very good and pricing acceptable
It's a good place to go for a fast lunch but don't expect quality food
The sweet dish was ok the french toast didn't have a lot of flavor but the berries were fresh and the bacon was extra crispy yum
The savory dish was very good and had a nice taste
The main dishes followed in good time
If I had ever dreamed about being a food photographer I'd probably start my portfolio here
My first thoughts when I heard about the concept of these stores was fresh pre-made healthy quality foods at decent prices
Not only is their hummus good but few places that I have been to create chicken that is as flavorful so it's hard to pass that up when I go to Pita Jungle
I got the Chicken Biryani Number 41 and wren brought the food out was impressed with the portion until I found only 4 small pieces of chicken in the mix the rest was veggies and rice
My better half was a little upset paid $9 for only 4 chicken fingers but they were tasty nonetheless
On Thursday I tasted Food Samples by1130 AZ Center - Chicken Alfredo=tasty chicken cooked to perfectionVitamin T City Scape/coming soon - Steak taco with guacamole and a delicious salsaPhoenix Convention Center Duh- Delicious steak cubes med rare thank you=thanks for the 3 cubes chef
one with their salsa and 2 plain  plus a delicious mini shrimp cocktail served in the most darling carved out little bamboo cupsCooperstown Behind US Airways Arena on Jackson - Spicy chicken Alfredo which was very tasty and cooked to perfectionHooters AZ Center - Mediocre hot wings served in a sweet spicy sauceSam's Cafe AZ Center - Big & delicious crab cake served with crispy carrots and a delicious sauce plus the chef gave me several White Chocolate tamales YUMMY
Which in my opinion was a rather big faux pas; because one little taste of delicious food isn't enough
The food is absolutely delicious and doesn't feel wet with grease or overly salty I didn't say it wasn't I just said it didn't feel that way
Finally a pizza place that delivers to our home AND has good pizza wings & drum roll please RANCH
Will defitnitely be back the food is really good and so far the service has always been great too
The sushi was delicious and fresh tasting
I recommend trying one of their rolls wrapped in cucumber with raw fish-very refreshing
Not a big fan of the raw stuff but have tried some of their specialty baked rolls and they are delicious
Excellent fast Mexican food from a clean friendly restaurant
Both were pretty good but the portions are huge so neither of us were even able to finish even half of our food
I was there today for lunch and had the shredded chicken and a couple of hotlinks
There were several kids in our group this totally could have been a disaster anywhere else but at Grimaldi's it was great service and excellent food as always
I was in heaven while eating it and I tried my cousin's chicken katsu and it was wonderful
I love eating here - it's slightly better than bar food and totally delicious
We ordered appetizers and various rolls and nigiri pieces
Anyhow like I said the sushi was good
If you want some great food and drinks on a current economy budget the daily 5-7 happy hr may be a good choice for you
I'd recommend this place more for the bar and piano setting not the food
The servers are friendly and definitely make you feel at home which makes up for the lack of quality in the food
The waiter recommended vegetarian options for me when I mentioned I don't eat meat
My date really enjoyed the halibut he ordered which was healthy enough to allow him to go for dessert
The food was delicious no doubt but it tasted even better surrounded by warm cheerful fires and the rich deep hues of the dining room
I'm usually not the one to go out of my box when it comes to foods but everything looked sooooo delicious that I tried them all and LOVED them all
But when I'm not eating a dish worth every bite of it's cheesy deep fried 3000 calories a fajita barrito is a nice choice
The vegetable beef soup was hearty and flavorful
The food was perfect the appetizers/salads/desserts just as good
Occasionally the food is a bit cold when it comes out
Appetizers are the only food items I've had there as they are half off during the first happy hour
I was offered a DELICIOUS chicken bacon bleu cheese amuse
The dishes had pretty good flavor some flavors did not pop as much as I would have liked but overall the selection and quality won me over
Great food good wine and a wonderful staff
I say all of this as the flavor is already so good in the Chicken Fajita's and likewise Carnita's that we would absolutly modifiy our next visit to save a few thousand calories
In short great food quality servce and food
I really liked the salmon slightly sweet with fresh asparagus a delight dish with mild flavor
My wife had the special strawberry salad and I had the greek salad with gyro meat and both were excellent
We also had 3 other people in our party and their food looked equally amazing
By the time our food was served my mother in-laws hot beef was COLD
Since they had a large group of women and a Red Hat society that seemed to get their food in good timing maybe the cooks walked out mid-shift
My husband wouldn't let me make a stink but after a wait that long with a hot dish being served cold there should have been an offer at comping a meal or taking a certain percentage off
Salsa was good shredded beef chimi I had was below average and over-fried
This location rocks - excellent food excellent staff
The Pork and Chicken BBQ sandwich were pretty good except that it is very very soggy the bread literally was mush kinda gross for the bread- but good meats
I highly recommend the California to both beginners and experienced Mexican food eaters alike
The fish was dry -- a big hazard for fish -- but good
Full review with pictures is in my blog highlight dishes are belowWith the kitchen moving surprisingly quickly despite or perhaps because of the late hour it would be perhaps fifteen minutes before our first course of the evening would arrive and although something I'd not have traditionally ordered the Almejas Al Vapor would prove to be well worth its best in the valley designation
It is a decently priced good food new hangout that I'll keep in my rotation
* Jerk Chicken = very good* Pollo Diablo = spicy and awesome and my stomach is going to hate me later* Jade Red Chicken = excellent* Pork Fried Rice = very good* Red Salsa Stuff = excellent* Refried Beans = standard* Snickerdoodle Cookie = awesome
I had their chicken rice a non-greasy dish that comes with flavored rice and steamed chicken topped with fried onions or garlic
Fish tacos were tasty - but the best part about them was the dipping sauce
3 stars for the yummy shrimp appetizer and the decent fish tacos
The food was incredibly tasty - crispy in all the right ways and was spicy enough to make me cry tears of joy
I went with a few friends and sampled the chilaquiles tomal de queso con rajas fish taco tostada de nopales a caramel filled churro you read that right the most amazing apple fritter I've ever had that I'm pretty sure la virgen is responsible for and that ridiculous hot chocolate** with masa in it like there aren't enough simple carbs in Mexican hot chocolate
We consistently receive top-notch service and great quality food
Those fish and chips would be worth a trip through security even if I didn't have a flight to catch
Tender juicy meat and a mixture of wonderfully different yet familiar flavors
Their grilled chicken salad is so amazing
The Vietnamese Ice coffee while good and flavorful was not as good as it is in real Vietnamese restaurants and really doesn't belong on the menu of a Sushi restaurant
The food quality was good and everything seemed to be fresh which is super important
Don't get me wrong it was good but barley any meat spinach mushroom or even eggs
The food was presented in a colorful manner and it was simply delicious
The Adana and Grilled Chicken was tender and flavorful
Dunking the pita bread into the hummus garlic spread with the meat was sooooo good
The food was good but I could get a much more special dining experience for the same price
Ray's Pizza is a good go-to spot to grab a slice or a full pie
After you pick your slices they go in the pizza ovens for a quick reheat- and the slices come out and taste amazing
The food was great- worth a four or even a five star review
I hadn't had a good shepherd's pie since ditching meat many years ago so it was great to have a well made veggie version
If and when I return I'll definitely try some of the other meatless pockets of deliciousness
I highly recommend the Italian Stallion pizza which has pepperoni salami and sausage
The meats are high quality and the brick oven really brings out their flavors
The cannoli is a nice traditional dessert with flavors of cream cheese cinnamon nuts and chocolate
I do recommend going especially for people who like brick oven pizza and a casual adult environment
I have ha d a steak it was good the california chicken sandwich was ok it would be better if it had bacon on it
we tried to wait but realized we were running out of time and ultimately had to end up driving to a place we didnt know how to get to and missed our reservations and took our cold food home
I've tried hard to like the food but it just isn't that good and its overpriced
My wife had a kobe beef burger - the meat was tasty but it comes with mozzarella cheese which has the interesting effect of completely masking the taste of the meat
But chicken wings are like **x as they say - even when they're bad they're still pretty good
The pizza here wasn't stellar but it was tasty
I ordered the Cajun Chicken Lavosh which was tasty and very large even for a half
Plus they taste so wonderful and fresh that I think a chicken laid 'em that morning
The atmosphere is very relaxing the service was great and the food was really really good
I had the two item combo with carne adobada which was delicious a shredded beef taco
the shredded beef was delicious but the shell just fell apart and I had to eat it with a fork
The food was cooked well enough and tasted fresh though the rosemary potatoes were cold and not very good both times I went
I think the valet thing does fix the lack of parking problem and the food is so good it really is not that big of a deal
If you are ever in the general vicinity of Windsor I suggest you give it a shot great staff great food and great overall restaurant
After inquiring about menu items and possible allergens I settled on the beef kabobs $8 during happy hour and the table bread basket white and flatbread which both contained allergens- I only had the nerve to try the white which was good with the pesto butter
As a result of actual culinary school trained chefs/cooks showing up at places like BSA the quality of food is quite good
Have been a couple of times now and have been impressed with the sushi
I ordered a tasty portabello and spinach sandwich on a nice wheat roll with rosemary mayo
The food is a little pricey but it was very good
Not only did the food taste wonderful but the chefs have excellent presentation of their dishes
The desserts were delicious but my all time favorite dessert was the tiramisu
The food is delicious and very reasonably priced
The dishes were delicious the food was served piping hot where appropriate and the servers were upbeat and attentive
This is the kind of place to go when you want food but not really caring how good it COULD be
I have to say I DO like their food and the service is always pretty good
had no clue where to get good food and fast
Go for the pretzels and cheese excellent drinking food
My mom and I went to Noca during restaurant week this gave us the opportunity to try an appetizer entree and dessert - and of course share our choices with each other
we are bluntly told we can't take in our Cold Stone waffle cone ice creams because of a new outside food and drink policy but these three small children can run and cry and scream throughout the entire movie
This is a great dish to share or order in the appetizer size
~the service was really good i had no idea what to order and the clerk suggested a sandwhich that i was already leaning towards grilled ham on rye he suggested several other dishes and explained why he liked them the other dudes who worked here were all smiles and quite genial they made you feel right at home
The pork adobada looked really good and the beef tenderloin with crab hollandaise got rave reviews the last diner ordered a salad so no credit either way
Let's start with the positive the chicken fried steak and it's seasoned gravy was very good
The food is amazing here-- much better than other Desi restaurants around the Valley
They're full of meat cheese and veggies and their dressing is delicious
Also tried their Cajun Fish tacos and they were overstuffed deliciousness
A friend suggested Sakana as being a perfectly good sushi restaurant in the area
Then we had the yellowtail sashimi - a true test of a good sushi restaurant - and it was absolutely fabulous
The chili was very common and could have come from a can doubt it was 'homemade'  the Reuben was good as was the turkey sandwich but all in all will not go back too many restaurants with better food and better prices
The food was hot and for a Denny's it was good
Eating on the property and going to Rawhide old western town brought back to life; very fun but clearly a tourist trap were nice the food was good but rather expensive
If you want quality food that won't make you feel like crap afterwards then this is the place for you
We got egg rolls sweet and sour chicken and wonton soup all of which were very good
I picked it up at the counter and went on my way home for some delicious food that stood up to microwave reheating the next day for lunch
The quality of food at this restaurant warrants much higher prices than what they charge
The food was good the service was okay the ladies are a bit older so smiling is not part of their service
at least as good as you're gonna get if you're looking for a pizzeria style slice- not fancy schmancy or thin crust or some other non NYC authentic corner pizza
The first time I thought the food was good
I agree with other reviewers who recommend having your server explain the daily dishes
If I want cheap good mexican food I guess I'll stick with 'Bertos because this place is a disaster
The food and staff were great I tried numerous sandwiches and salads now and depending on what you are looking for its all good
My only issue no real kids menu the pizza was a bit large for one kid otherwise I would recommend it to anyone
The food is good and they have some great beers on tap
Everything from beginning to end was perfect - service ambience seating and selection and amount of food was incredible along with a very good wine selection
One of the appeals of good Indian food is their use of various spices and flavors
Our food finally arrived after another 15mins presentations were nice my friend's steak dish was pretty good meat was pretty tender
Rude inattentive staff confusing lay out ridiculously priced drinks and good food if they aren't out of it
Lo-Lo's has amazing fried Chicken the same as Mrs
Basically it was the wankery silliness that Scottsdale gets blamed for which is unfortunate because the food is soooooo good
Imagine a dish that is basically a chinese lo mein noodle with a flavor profile similar to mexican spanish rice and there's also a chinese chicken dish with indian spices
plenty of activity huge drinks and food that all seems like it's an appetizer
I bought $72 worth of food meat mostly from the discount section and with that coupon and a couple others I only paid $32
but I have to admit all the contents of the roll were tasty and I liked their eel sauce consistency and proportions sometimes it can be over slathered and/or runny drenching the rice till it's rendered un-sticky and difficult to handle
The Agedashi Tofu is piping hot and tasty with the katsuobushi fish flakes that move in dramatic ways as the heat rises from the tofu
Not sure if it was supposed to be that way but it was an unpleasant surprise from an otherwise tasty dish
Overall the food was good but not great as some dishes probably still need some work
Not impressed with the dry jambalaya crab cakes and sea food gumbo  If I'm in the area I might try again but not a place I would go out the way for
Soft bread roll and a tasty turkey sandwich
Don't get me wrong I enjoy a good dessert coffee once in awhile
If you want real good Chinese foods and restaurant services go somewhere else
I guess I will never know how good their foods now
We aren't talking that terrible crap Subway serves either this is quality meat and produce
The rolls are delicious and many are quite unique with a great balance of rice fish and filling
I would kill for a nice slice of tasty fresh raw fish
So if you want good coffee and hate having flavor in your food or money in your wallet
My husband and I split a vegeterian pizza and it was very delicious
Other than that I very much enjoyed the pizza and look forward to ordering from there again
The pizza a really good and perfect take out
If I had to be critical I'd say it can be a tad greasy but its good pizza
In the dining room the Italian food is really good
The Chicken parm is perfect and all the dishes are quality with generous portions
The only minor picky foody issue was the Nectarine Crustada for dessert was luke warm at best would have liked a nice hot dish to melt that delicious ice cream
POLLO ALLA CACCIATORA Boneless breast of Chicken rubbed with lemon salt & pepper sautu00e9ed until golden then combined with pitted oil cured olives seasoned tomatoes sliced onion minced garlic fresh thyme sage basil & white wine OPINION Flavorful if you like olives
This was delicious But you only receive   of a chicken breast
FARFALLE ALLA VODKA Bowtie pasta chopped shallots Marinara sauce Vodka cream Fresh Basil & shaved Asiago cheese OPINION Rarely do I not finish the food on my plate; this was just not good
I wanted a delicious dessert; this was a dry yellow cake with multiple layers
No the food was not good enough and the price was too high
I had the Mussels Portugal and they were good tasting and generous but there was so much sauce and they provide no utensils to get the mussels and remove the meat you have to literally stick your whole hand in a bowl of tomato sauce
The pizza my son ordered looked real good and he enjoyed it but about 15% of it was burned from the wood fire
The menu was expensive which made me think that it was a fancy place but it turns out that the food was expensive because it was a restaurant inside a hotel
I shared the honey chicken sandwich with a friend and it was quite good
Good thing we only purchased our prescription food for our cats there because I can't fathom taking my cats or dogs to a place like this for medical reasons where customer service is at the bottom of their list
Yes it is in a bad area but that hasn't ever deterred me from telling everyone I know that if they want really good real Mexican food at a great price to head down there
They explained how the dishes were made and even offered us recipes for the kalamata aioli that we so enjoyed
the chicken and shrimp ~$30 a-ok soft shell crab appetizer ~$12 yum
Summary Delicious New York style super thin crust pizza at a decent price
Cheese quality is a huge determining factor when assessing good pizza; their cheese is amazingly fresh and delicious
You could tell the beef was pretty good quality and to my surprise there was more than enough of it for my tastes
The beef had no discernible flavor on it's own
The chicken came out nice and hot with just the right amount of crispyness that's not from too much batter or coating but from the right amount of frying
The chicken tikka tandoori was wonderful and a huge portion--all 3 of us ate from my plate
They actually layer the meat/cheese throughout which is so nice compared to most placed that just dump the flavor on top leaving you with nothing once you peel away the layer of 3 inch thick crap
Good flavorful food but personally I didn't like it
I prefer burgers with some meat to them the Freddy's burgers while taste good are just flat pancaked pieces of meat
The food itself was pretty good but the portions were generally quite small
We shared the bruschetta  appetizer which was my favorite dish from the night
My boyfriend's bbq chicken pizza was better but very small & the chicken was tossed onto the pizza after it was done baking so none of the chicken actually stuck to the pizza and lacked the flavors that would normally come from the combination of sauce and cheese
I got tonight's Korean dinner from their pre-cooked refrigerated food section; a quick re-heat at home was all the prep I needed to do for the delicious but inexpensive feast I had tonight
The atmosphere is great the food is wonderful
It doesn't get much better than eating delicious fish and chips sipping on a pint of brew in warm weather with friends
I came to their opening/Christmas party and got to taste a lot of their food then which was amazing
Food tasted good chili was temperature hot and chicken on top of salad was warm just as I like chicken on top of a cold salad
Their personal pizzas are available with thin or thick crust but both are excellent and priced right starting at around 5 bucks
For dessert both the good old cannoli and the apple serenata with vanilla bean gelato are very good ways to end a great meal
The sushi was very expensive but it was good
Food can be a lil pricey if you are on a budget but tastes pretty damn good
It is a good place to bring parents and your relatives from the midwest -- it's a nice local place with a neighborhood feel but the food is non-threatening
Thank you Sens for the delicious food wonderful service and treating me like a guest
It was tasty although the Chicken lacked any kind of roasted qualities it almost looked poached
The colors layout and style all seemed to be a good representation of a fast food restaurant in some of the Asian cities
Some of the main dishes I enjoyed today were the cheesy cauliflower flavorful beef roast with au jus very tasty breaded Talapia & the Salisbury Steak
There were also quite a few good desserts on hand including good soft-serve ice cream
Also the seafood tower; it had some pretty excellent items  like the jumbo shrimp and the king crab leg but it was extremely light on the lobster and the lump crab salad was bland and subpar
Excellent Mexico City cuisine a departure from the northern Mexican food more Phoenicians are accustomed to
This gives all dishes a unique and flavorful taste that is much different than your average stew it all together flavors
If chicken is your thing I'd recommend the Chilaquiles Suizos
Good place great drink selection small food menu reason for 4 stars wonderful service
Again the food was quite good it was a bit loud cramped and the air was a bit stagnant
It was a brussels sprouts dish and it could have used a bit more flavor/seasoning
The food was definitely tasty for the most part and fresh
Food looked good but lacked spice/flavor
If you like authentic food warm service and spicy tasty salsa then grab a table and tell your taste buds to buckle up
Food is great here and the price point is very good for the value and amount of food you get
The food was pretty good overall except for over seasoned french fries
I recommend the Margherita with prosciutto but not the pizza with fennel sausage
There was barely any cheese in there I was hoping for a cheesy chicken gooey delicious explosion in my mouth
Overall our waitress was really nice the DJ spun upstairs which added to the fun and the food was good spicy
UPDATE Went back a second time and while the food was again very good the staff was not as nice
Sure we hit Scottsdale for glam downtown for urban cool and Barrio or Richardsons for nuevo mexican - but for a fun evening with friends plus good comfort food you can't beat Texaz
It was wet mushy and the only flavor was red food dye
The food is always good no matter what Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to but I just wanted to comment on the bar staff and their extraordinary friendly and knowledgeable service they offer
Pretty good for fast food and decent price for airport food
The Sushi rolls were decent the appetizers we ordered were way too greasy and arrived after our food was already finished
My boyfriend had a chimichanga with shredded beef which was pretty good and I tried the enchiladas with mole sauce
Plus there were tons of dishes at the counter that I couldn't recognize - always a good sign of authenticity
Hurry in to try this amazingly yummy dish as they may be changing the menu soon
The food at Fu Fu Cuisine was wonderful
In short the food at Fu Fu was AMAZING
BUT~if you want delicious food in a cozy and warm atmosphere where you can hear the stranger next to you chew away then this is definitely the restaurant for you
What i CAN say is that the food was delicious and the atmosphere was quite romantic
It's really unhealthy but this is some good comfort food
Those SNL guys should have said Fried Chicken + waffles = crazy delicious
I was impressed that you could order a $48 pasta dish
My sister really enjoyed her papaya salad and thai soup and my parents liked the cashew chicken - the sauce had a great flavor
When it first opened this place was awesomeHentai playing in the bar area and good spicy tuna rolls which were my favorite at the time
Over time the restaurant went downhill the quality of the fish was lowered and overall it seemed too overpriced for what you got
Now the place has increased the quality of fish they have fresh chopped wasabi available on request and a great selection of cold Sake
Most of the us there were 10 were very happy with the food and the service was very good
I'm a huge fan of fish and everything you get is delicious
Food was good with our mandarin salad and veggie patty burger
One day I was watching an middle aged cook and it genuinely looked like he enjoyed making the food
They also have awesome spring rolls but they aren't quite as good as they were when they were China Gate
It came to our table bubbling hot and served with a dish of vanilla ice cream on the side
The breading is very crisp and the fish flakes apart and is quite tasty with a generous dose of salt and lemon
It's also just a buck or two more than you might expect to pay for a fish n chips lunch but it tastes fresh and good and I'm alright with that
But the chicken was very good and fairly spicy contrary to other reviews I read on here
maybe the chicken was just really good today
My egg rolls came out before the Pho and they were quite delicious
I have no idea what was in them but they were full of flavor and meaty goodness
Emma recommended the Padres pizza which is not on the menu
I have yet to try their food but it looks to be a simple and tasty menu which includes pub favorites like burgers nachos and burritos
I had the Moroccan chicken which was good
Good food but nothing to drive 20 miles for
it was nice but next time I think I will order a roll as I sampled some of the New Zealand roll and it was delicious
The service may not always be as good as it could be slow sulrly even at times but the excellent food and reasonable prices make it forgiveable
Two of us with wine and one dessert was $75 so a good value as well
The meat is delicious the taco is tasty and it's a perfect way to indulge in the goodness of Los Taquitos without feeling like I need a nap right after breakfast
Prices are reasonable for the high quality food here
to set the tone for our visit we met our friends in the bar and be gain ordering apps flat bread w/chicken cheese and some other goodies sweet potato fries
However for the most bland white washed white bread place on the planet it is good pizza
As for which pizza to order there is only one that is truly good
It is the correct blend of flavors that mix in your mouth dance on your taste buds and allow you to say that this pizza is alright
Great service great food but definitely over priced- over $10 appetizers and over $10 desserts- it's prohibitive to eat anything other than the entrees but wanted to try everything anyways
It was amazing and then a really good family friend is from Ethiopia and he has just introduced me to even more fabulous food
The stuffed pizza is also amazing but it takes a while to make
Would recommend to anyone for any type of food - they have it all
The food however  wasn't as good as have had at the other locations
I love the crusts but had to throw away a good 1/3 or so of the pizza
Lunch began with just-baked hot rolls with a dipping sauce
I'd recommend the baked stuffed pasta shells with chicken to the most dedicated lover of Italian cuisine
The commercials make it look like a high end burger joint and make the food look mmmmmm so good
The food was really good and the smashfires were a great addition to our burgers
This had guacamole tomatoes jalapenos habenero cheese and a spicy chipotle sauce all on an all beef hot dog
The food is as good as any other Buca's I have been to
I guess I shouldnt have expected better since it is a tourist trap but cmon the food should at least taste good
The conference sponsors provided both breakfast and lunch for the attendees - and I have to admit that the food was very good
The food is always fresh and absolutely wonderful
We also had a groupon deal 10 bucks we paid for 20 bucks worth of food
The servers need a bit more training in addition to some quality control on the food
I absolutely LOVED my chicken adobo - it had so much flavor that I found myself sucking on the chicken fat just to get more of that flavoring
I think it was the stark flavor difference between the chicken and the Laing that made my nostrils pick up something in the Laing that just did not appeal to me
plus the other dish my friend got was also super tasty
These were good but I still preferred the ormal size egg rolls
The soup base is pretty good plenty of noodles and cooked to the right texture and the shredded chicken not fatty so excellent
honestly if you want good quality sushi for about the same price go down to JK Bowl on Bell and 7th St
All of our dishes were flavorful and imaginative from the leek/mozzarella appetizer to my fish entree to my BF's jadori chicken
The pho is great with all white meat chicken and I kick it up a notch with the hot sauce and hoisen which are already on the table
But they have a FULL menu of pizzas salads and appetizers that are gluten free
I have tried gluten free pizzas almost everywhere you can find them and they are always too dry too thin too soggy or completely different flavor than what pizza crust should taste like
Picazzo's gluten free pizza is delicious the crust is pretty thick and has a good texture not like a big saltine cracker as most places tend to be
The spaghetti is good with homemade meatballs and the sauce
Believe you me this pizza was worth waiting for
I apologize for the terrible photos of the pizza I've included here
The food has been consistently delicious and the service has been wonderful
Mainly the Natu-joint liquid to be placed over food high quality glucosamine that got my dog walking again
The food was very good It was a month or so back so I forgot what I ordered but it was on the customers favorites section  It's no longer there
Green should be synonymous with Tasty since all their foods are very good
I don't care if they are Vegetarian or Vegan tasty is still tasty meat or no meat
Good quality vegetarian foods are not cheap and Green is pretty reasonable with their offering
When the food came out I was impressed by the presentation
To start my gf found it in her gullet to order the hearts of palm/carrot/various rabbit food appetizer which was heavily drowned in vinegar
My entree was the poached chicken with shrimp and rice which tasted well and good on the first try but went up to 11 on the re-heat the next day
Overall a very good dish that I recommend and would order again
In conclusion the food was good service nice but I won't stray from the menu and I'll go in knowing that the waiter will probably try to up-sell me
Quite surprisingly but in a pleasant way this joint had some pretty darn good sushi
Ordered the carna asada steak and my friend ordered the shredded beef chimi both were really good
Beyond the quality of the food I must say how much I also liked the charming owners
Tofu was not crisp was a strange shade of dark brown had a terrible wet/mushy/sponge like texture and the sauce in the dish was completely flavorless
The smell coming off this dish was somewhere between dirty dishwater and abandoned stairwell - funny that something with no flavor would generate such an aroma
BBQ pork was an experience that we do not wish to repeat the meat quality was incredibly poor
Pad Thai had unusually large noodles eggs had strange color really didn't have that Thai flavor shrimp were ok but by the time the dish was halfway done they were soggy
The cheese and charcuterie plate is a fabulous idea being able to pick what you want and the food was all amazing
The presnetation of the food was also good
For dessert we shared the tres leches with strawberry salsa which was so fresh and flavorful
Started off with some appetizers; pesto & sun dried tomato risotto marinated chicken breast Mac n cheese
It was Tasty though but unless you are a 5'7 105 lbs super model this dish will not satisfy your hunger
We had the Margherita pizza which was just cheese olive oil basil tomatoes and a TON of garlic it was very good
Nice crust with a crisp crackle and the pizza had a ton of flavor
5 hours each had really really tasty food Jamburritos and Tom's BBQ but even both of those were out of some of the items we wanted before we got to the front of the line
A few highlight dishesBrioche Cinnamon Doughnuts with Bacon Butter  piping hot and minimally greasy they were peerless particularly when smeared with the umami-savory flavors of hickory smoked bacon
The service is friendly the food items priced par for the course for Korean food moderate not inexpensive and the food quality is good
And their lunch specials are a good and relatively inexpensive way to get  fast food Korean style
The beef is ground on site so i enjoyed a medium rare burger
The crust of the pizza was a perfect flavor
I got the Margarita pizza and it was a little soggy in the middle but I think they might use canned tomatoes but the tomatoes were still really good
I know the meat is special and grass fed with no hormones or whatever but it's not worth paying x2 as much for
There were the traditional concessions offering peanuts nachos and hot dogs although I looked around the field and saw plenty of specialty food and beverage options from Crust to Salty Senorita & more
Thank goodness we ate using a Deal Chicken offer
FIRST - let me premise the quality of their food is not at question nor the pricing for their food
The flavor of the salad was really good and the ingredients were fresh however the spice on the chicken made it very very spicy
I just don't like my food so hot that my eyes start to water and I can't stop sniffling from my nose running
Everything looked way to good to give up on this place after only one spicy chicken incident
Once you find it you'll get to enjoy some of the best authentic bagels in the valley and some pretty good food that won't break the bank
I could hardly distinguish between the orange chicken and spicy chicken sauces but the chicken itself was good
After returning from my tour in Iraq i sometimes have a nitch for good Iraqi food
All that said the ribeye was pretty good but the meat might already have been chopped and placed on the grill because despite what the cook said I never heard him chopping up my meat on the grill and the sandwich was ready way to quick
One of my friends had recommended it as being a little better than most border food places
The margarita was weak and wouldn't recommend that but the food and service here are actually pretty good
The food was OK but not really worth the wait
but service is friendly food is pretty good
They have an amazing Hummus appetizer and they have a great selection of pizza's
The 'big rig' pasta was okay the sauce was spicy and was different I could go for the past again just not sure if the pizza is worth a second try
We had a table of 5 and I think everyone enjoyed their food and would come back again
In fact their corned beef hash is my gold-standard for judgment with poached eggs and a little Tabasco there are very few comparable meals as far as deliciousness goes
The cashier gave recommendations for pizzas and salads
They could easily get away with higher prices because the quality of food is that amazing
I got the Stir Fry and it was a bowl of hot fresh veggies and your choice of meat
My husband ordered another recommended dish baked stuffed lobster
The sandwich I only had a bite of it was good thick bread and lots and lots of meat and cheese
It appears that Reubens no longer appear on the menu but the food is as good as I remember the coffee is as weak and they are all still open 24 hours
I have no idea if this is the actual one I went to but they're all about the same thing--cheap good food
I've had a few good times at Rula Bula and the food was usually pretty good
Did I mentioned that the chicken tenders with honey mustard are an excellent choice as well
I love the Skeptical Chymist because it consistently delivers on the quality of food drinks entertainment and service
The El Pastor meat was actually good I enjoyed that but the rice and beans were really bland
Plantain Avocado spring rolls are good as well
It's a place you can sit and talk and enjoy good food and drinks for a few hours which we did
Meat was tender and juicy sauce was GLUTEN-FREE and super tasty
She never asked to refill our water and no one came around to ask if the food was any good
My service was fast & very friendly even though it was the lunch rush & both my Pastrami & Chicken Club Salad were delicious
My drink was good but I was very disappointed in the pizza
tried their chicken quesadilla and it was very tasty
The most amazing thing about what she has done with the Gardener's Kitchen is that the frozen food tastes exactly like her fresh made meals and they take no longer than an hour to prepare
Anyone who lives in the greater phoenix area would be well advised to stock up on some meals from the Gardener's Kitchen for those nights you want foodie quality food without any fuss
The food here is absolutely delicious and it is cheap cheap cheap
We decided to stop by this place because we felt like continuing our sushi quest yesterday it was close and it has good reviews
Also masked the tuna flavor but it was a seared dish so it wasn't as bad
Atmosphere aside the food is very good
The food is amazing the service is great and the atmosphere is clean and inviting
It's fairly unassuming but a real gem if you're looking for good Chinese food
It isn't that the food that I ordered was not good but it wasn't very creative
Make sure you upgrade to the chicken fried rice its well worth the $3 extra
This last time we went it was the chicken and steak for two and it was tasty
I recommend the tacos I personally had the swordfish tacos homemade guacamole and make sure to try the ceviche
- Cocktails huge menu list of fun mixology and tropical items - Bread big hat-shaped hunk of soft and warm yeasty goodness - Desserts the tray always looks enticing especially the pina colada cake but I usually don't have room
I find it odd that this restaurant serves both italian and japanese food Maybe if they focused on one type of food the flavor and presentation would improve
Food I would say is good it just seems like the typical big box franchise Italian restaurant that looses that special touch you find in the mom and pop type of places
In sum the food wasn't bad but it wasn't as flavorful as I would expect my Caribbean cuisine to be and those not really authentic
It's greasy in that clean and delicious pizza dive joint manner
The sandwiches and pizzas are both good for lunch on the go
Their service and their food is excellent
My family and I have always enjoyed going to this NYPD and the food is very good but  I will definately be looking for a new family oriented pizza place
Even without a Groupon the food and drinks are worth it
The service as always is good but the food leaves much to be desired
It was late morning on a weekday not crowded excellent service and the food was great
We chatted with the owner/chef nice guy and very committed to great customer service and quality food
I'm surprised how how good the pizza is here in Arizona
Very tasty and definitely some of the best pizza I've had in the valley
The prices are average the service was so-so but the food was excellent
It's not fancy and it's not pretty but the food and pricing are good
Yeah I'm no twig by far and I like food actually I love good food
Good onions on the salsa bar but better food in NV
The prepackaged meat is another issue as well as the lack of sacks to full with bulk goods but that's not TJ's market so I can't really legitimately complain on those fronts
i believe I saidIt's almost like the food does not reveal it's own flavor it's as if the cooks disguises them in oil and wine and it destroys the dish
Delicious savory meatballs smothered in cheese and marinara over veggies and pasta
I went there today with some coworkers for lunch for the all you can eat fish special that they have on Friday's and it was very much worth it
The all you can eat fish fry is worth it if you like fish
Overall $20 a person including tip with strong drinks good food and extras to take home we were satisfied
Me and my girlfriend both ordered the chicken schnitzel cordon bleu and enjoyed every bit of it
I had the chicken pot pie pasty and I will never have another pot pie again it was that good
The major plus was that when you ordered and received your food which by the way was friendly service with a smile and not a lengthy wait it actually tasted as good as it smelled
The only thing I would mention is that personally I prefer a more savory or herby flavor in my pizza sauce and their is very sweet
I thought my food while very tasty was poorly portioned
No wait quick/good/friendly service good food and lots of good beer
My sushi was good you cant really expect too much out of Tuna and California Rolls other then they just be fresh
The food was good - they definitely know how to cook meat
The ham was a little on the drier side but the cheese wrapped with the sausage and the beef was really good
I again had the Light Chicken Fried Steak Breakfast it is funny that they call it light because the only light part is that it comes with one egg and a half order of the hashbrowns but it makes you feel good when ordering
They are known for their Chicken Fried Steak here and for good reason it is delicious
She said that the hollandaise was really good which can make or break the overall dish
DishesTom Ka with shrimp  Thicker than any in recent memory but the flavors were all correct just not quite a delicate and balanced as the very best I've had
Seafood Pad Cha - Mmmm this was really good
Imagine a really cool gastro pub with high quality and deliciously savory food items surrounded in plaid patterns retro-chic male heavy influenced art design and a kick-ass patio area
If you're in the mood for a really incredible place to hang out have a few drinks indulge in some delicious food and really just enjoy a laid back dining experience then the Windsor should be at the top of your must try list
I would say I was impressed with the food
We of course enjoyed the mimosa and bellini but $5 each is a bit high considering they're $3 @ at other places and Cafe Boa down the block offers unlimited mimosas for a fixed fee with food
I always order the Chicken Picado Pita and it is always so delicious
It is one of those affordable quality food gems that you shouldn't miss out on
As I have said in previous reviews I don't give fast food places great ratings because the food isn't great quality and the service is poor as there is no waiter service
They use a great bread for the roll and it comes out literally burning hot so wait 2 or 3 minutes before you dig in and have plenty of napkins
They also do a variety of vegi and mock meat stir fries that I've had at their other location and though I've not had them their vegi burgers look amazing
Bottom line give it a try and the other thing the boneless mock chicken buffalo wings good stuff
As a side note the owners of Windsor opened up a pizza place that is pretty good
I was disappointed in my main entree as it was overpriced for the quality of food that I was served
Plenty of food for the money but not served the usual way in silver covered containers but on open platters which is also a cause of food getting cold
I had been hoping for some good authentic Chinese food as I have never found many here in Phoenix
The food is fantastic good service good atmosphere it's perfect
I'm more of a meat and potatoes kind of guy and I even crave the vegetables here they are so fresh and tasty
They have good food a nice but small patio and a good location
It's a grilled chicken sandwich on a deliciously soft pretzel bun
They've got good food free wi-fi and a good location
This place is a little on the expensive side but all of us enjoyed our food and it is worth it for the ambiance
I can eat it as my meal as long as they provide me as much of their tasty bread as I need to sop the dish dry of all the yummy garlic sauce it contains
pretty tasty but my fave is the soupier Salvadorean take on the chicken tamale
The beef BBQ was excellent as well as the noodles in the bun dish and the veggies
The egg rolls were a bit disappointing - sort of mushy on the inside and while the chicken was tender it had a very generic soy sauce flavoring and not the usual vietnamese lemon grass type of flavoring that I am used to
Every roll I've tried is good and there is some type of noodle/tofu/mushroom/broccoli dish that I REALLY like
The food and cocktail menu looks great and I thoroughly enjoyed my freezing cold glass of Schramsberg Blanc de Blanc at a very reasonable $9 a glass
as the menu is not much different and the food is of the same poor quality---it comes out within 5-10 minutes of ordering and tastes as if food was cooked hours earlier and was just reheated in the microwave it probably was
You won't see me wax rhapsodic over the flavor and lightness of the perfectly crusty and delectable fried chicken
The food here is excellent and the menu is very large
The dish of red beans and rice was very good but a little too salty
To top it off the Okonomiyaki - a savory seafood filled pancake think of it sort of as a Japanese version of a quesadilla - filled with octopus shrimp and fresh fish was worth 4 times its bargain price of $8
Nobuo accompanies the great food with a good wine selection a one-of-a-kind Japanese beer selection running the range from lager to oyster stout including a great IPA and a good sake selection
The Panini was delicious just the right amount of meat vs bread
I rarely like restaurant gravy never meaty enough for my taste and this gravy was really good
My friend enjoyed the parm-crusted chicken paired with house-made gnocchi
I had the horseradish crusted tilapia and it was tasty   Didn't care so much for the fried crab stuffed portabella thing on the side but overall at $14 the entree was a steal
The food was excellent and so was the wine selection
They also brought out complimentary hot cocoa from the chef champagne to toast with and a special dessert that had CONGRATULATONS
No matter what Rubio's I go to I always get Mexifood so good that I can hardly believe that it's fast food at all
The food at this Rubio's location was as good at always and the service made it that much better
The service was wonderful the food absolutely amazing
I had never had the brunch before but the brunch was amazing and a lot more food then I was actually expecting
First off it was a huge chicken breast with a wonderful crunchy coating
I usually set my bar on the quality of food based on the chips and salsa
The food and drinks were a little slow getting to the table but they were worth the wait
We had quite the sampling of sushi appetizers and sake
I was really wanting to pig out on some sushi rolls but after seeing those we just ordered teriyaki chicken which I have to say was good
Nothing good  to say for the sushi and thats sad when the word sushi is in the name of the restaurant
Do yourself a favor get a sandwich down the street at sack's better food better bread and better quality meats for sure and service with a smile
Everything we ordered from the Christmas menu was delicious but a few stand-outs are the crab cake appetizer and the beef tenderloin and pasta carbonara main dishes
The chicken salad and provolone sandwich was outstanding and the hot peppers gave it a great kick
This place has a lot going for it in terms of atmosphere and the food is like other Sam Fox restaurants consistent and pretty good
This is not an amazing dining experience and the food isn't anything special but it's a relaxing restaurant
In sum the food is pretty good and the atmosphere makes this place an appealing restaurant to return to however the sub-standard service hit-or-miss drinks/chips can taint an otherwise good experience
As for the food well it's pretty darn good
I've had their pizza and the ravioli and both have been tasty
I like their starters such as the fresh mozz and tomato dish and on the cheap check out the pita crisp its a cheesy mini-pizza/quesadilla circle of goodness
This PJ is def yuppie compared to Tempe but I guess everyone deserves cheapish delicious mediterranean food
The green chile pork is damn good the salmon is great and I normally am not a fish-eater all of the sides I've had have been ridiculously good
The dish we all loved was their Grilled Street Corn with a delicious aioli sauce
My friend got a southwest sandwich which has chicken and peppers which was also really good
In addition to delicious breads rolls cookies and other sweets they make great sandwiches for lunch
The chicken salad was a bit iffy but the club is tasty
I have no doubt that Bobby Q's has amazing barbecue but what it does not have is good seafood
While I don't claim to have had ALL the sushi in the world I know what good sushi and what good sushi service is
I don't have a lot to say beyond what has already been said so I'll briefly share a few things my dinner companion and I made note ofThe Good- Great looking spot in the esplanade right off the ground-level parking behind the escalators- Comfortable seating we sat at a two-top- Nice dim lighting- Excellent food
Habanero's is good fresh food at a reasonable price
Mad kudos for--Cholula on the table--Really good foodA big boo for--15 min wait after ordering
But the food is always good their bread is one of my favorites
I didn't find either particularly tasty and the food was very heavy
they gave me lettuce instead of cole slawfeedback for the chicken sandwich was pretty good but spicy
I cant remember the names of the rolls we had you can thank that Traditional Manhattan I ordered but I thought they were good not THE best but def not THE worst
The 1 good thing I'd like to say is my buffalo chicken spring rolls were very tasty
I am a beer snob and if you ask for a sample they will give it to you without concern they are in the business of quality beer and the food is great too
The big difference though between this place and Macaroni Grill is the fact that the food is actually really good at Bobby Qs
However it's affordable and just good home-style food
Good food pretty decent price for the new age fast food market fast food that isn't a burger
Anyway the food is good but they really need to get a better handle on their service
I liked this place because of its simplicity and of course because the food was pretty good
They also have an assortment of baked goods and desserts which looked delicious
I'm not a huge meat eater but my first bite of that tasty juicy scrumptious burger triggered me to attack the rest cave man carnivore style
they have 1/2 off appetizers from 3-6pm so we ordered the meat balls and stuffed peppers
The food is always there- and it's surprisingly good Pub fare but what this place sells most successfully is soulful ambience a down-to-earth yet diverse  crowd interesting live music a gorgeous patio and a cool-as-hell waitstaff
My friend enjoyed his eel sushi but I did not sample that
The place is often crowded - so I believe many patrons just don't know what good Japanese food should taste like
We ordered the white pizza the hot potato which scared me too many starches and the Hawaiian
The flatbread pizzas were excellent as were the cheese plates
The food is tasty plentiful and affordable
The pizza was huge and delicious though and I was pleasantly surprised to see that instead of little strips of green bell pepper they finely diced the peppers so you get pepper in every bite
The meat sauce was flavorful and had a bright tomato and fennel taste
The corn on the pizza tasted really sweet and delicious and it was the perfect counter to the goat cheese
Home-cooking style place cozy chicken noodle soup; pulled pork sandies were delish with the sweet hot peppers too and sides of mac-n-cheese for the sandies was enough for my 2 kids; also their milk shakes are one of the most generous in terms of ice-cream ever
My husband and I just moved to Phoenix and have been looking for a good place to eat Indian food and we finally found it
The sauce for the lamb korma and chicken curry was thick and ooooh so tasty
We then ordered the bone marrow appetizer and a meat and cheese plate
It just tasted like a little piece of beef fat spread on really good toast
Greasy as it applies to pizza is directly tied to quality of cheese and meats used in its preparation; high quality mozzarella will exude it's delicious juices after baking
While ordering delivery pizza is a good substitute in a pinch dining in is certainly preferred
Not because they've been the only restaurant on the corner but because their food is darn good besting the likes of Marco's pizza Cheezburger-Cheezburger Garcia's Carino's Italian food etc
My meal was $13 so very reasonably priced for the quality of food I got
They offer some large full size desserts and they offer little dessert shots
This will be our regular pizza joint for the area- we were both impressed and will order many more Brooklyn pizzas from NYPD
The buffet is very hit or miss; you have to use your instincts to navigate the dangerous line of mediocre salad items and cringe-worthy side dishes to find the really good stuff
The lines would be out the door but the food is worth the wait
We got amazing service and wonderfully flavorful food
The food here is so flavorful - not too spicy at all just the right amount
The food is consistently quite good affordable and fresh
The service and food were great and our guests enjoyed the dim sum adventure a first for many of them
My fiancu00e9e and I decided we wanted to try it out after reading several reviews that actually had to deal with their sushi we decided that it was worth a shot
Good prices doesn't always mean good food
Now anybody that knows Sushi should know that is a pretty good freakin' price for the amount of food
The number of rolls/cost ratio was amazing at this place
The lack of expenditure on cash does not always mean good food and in some cases has the direct opposite affiliation
All in all the only complaint I had with the rolls we purchased is that the Philadelphia rolls had a tad bit too much cream cheese in them but none the less still pretty good
What pleased me the most is after going to several sushi places my future wife has had a heck of a time finding a good Spicy Tuna roll
Midwest meats make the patties for the delicious butter burgers
The pizza was good sauce was a bit salty but I liked it
The food1 House Special Chicken tasty but dry and dull
I do like it if you like old school chinee food however they need to add more flavor to their dishes
This is THE place in town to get quality FAST Mexican food
It had carrots that were slightly sweet and peas that popped in your mouth releasing glorious green goo to mix with the hot beef and such on its way down to your belly
The food is creative delicious and simply amazing
Other than that amazing food I plan on eating there again
I was so enamored by my dessert that I probably didn't pay close enough attention to all of the other wonderful things Churn has to offer
I love a place that has excellent food impeccable service and is in no way snooty
The Chorizo Porchetta was really flavorful and the meat was so tender you could eat it with a spoon
If you like fish tacos try the salmon taco lots of flavor
Overall good food okay service okay prices
The broth was full of flavor and the meat was a generous portion and on my order of Pho Tai it actually was rare as it was served to me unlike many other Pho places where it is already cooking in the broth and far from rare upon arrival to me
I recommend it because the food is good and filling and besides how many other Russian-Uzbeki joints have you seen around town
the atmosphere is nice and quiet the food takes awhile and it's a little pricier than standard mexican fare - but it's all worth it the dollars and the wait
Now that I know how delicious the food is the wait time won't seem so bad anymore
We've been to Palatte twice for breakfast/brunch on our stay in Phoenix and while I give Palatte major props for superbly quirky/tasteful decor and friendly service their breakfast food is only 80% good
As an omnivore with a meatatarian streak Green is allll kinds of super amazing
The braised ribs were delicious tender and the meat completely fell apart in your mouth unfortunately this is what my coworker had ordered
If you see one of the comedians at 8pm it will be a dinner show and the food is actually pretty good
After dinner and a drink at the restaurant in the hotel see my review for Gallo Blanco we took a stroll around the pool lobby and rooftop bar area
At the moment produce bulk wild caught fish dry food goods are fresh and low priced
The approx three pound beef tenderloins are very good and cost approx $6
The flavors are so extremely varying from one dish to another that you sit there and debate about whether any of them could actually be good
I was a little dubious about how the food was going to be but I went with the scheme anyway and opted for the spicy Singapore noodles with chicken which the owner assured me was very good
The next dish that is probably the best one on the menu and they know it is their LOS MEJORES DE LA CASA which is 2 small perfectly cooked bacon wrapped beef tenderloin medallions and 2 shrimp with bacon cheese and jalapenos mmmmm so so so Good
PositivesService was goodMashed potatoes and jalapeno corn were very goodTostadas were fresh tastingPortions were large - prices are okayNot so positives not really bad enough to be negativesThe side room not the main dining room was extremely noisyThe chili rellenos sounded great but the seafood taste was lost beans and the crust was a little heavy
Margarita was OK tasted like a regular mix with no fresh lime juice flavorOverall I think that the barrio cafe does a much better seafood relleno and margarita but this is probably one of the best options I know of in this neighborhood
The chicken was good - not as good as I've had but it was juicy so can't beat that
the food was good the service was good the atmosphere on a warm spring afternoon was delightful and it was splendid little spot to let the dishes and the glasses pile up
They have pretty good bands and decent food
All the food was delicious but at the end of the night we spent almost $60 for two and still left hungry
It was too hot to sit outside but we did stroll around the grounds of the Hermosa Inn a bit and everything looked gorgeous
So many positives I was really looking forward to trying this place always hoping for a good sushi buffet but always having been disappointed
Margs were decent and the sushi rolls I had were tasty
The shrimp and pork summer rolls and accompanying peanut sauce were fresh and tasty
The pho is wonderful- great broth pretty good meat
I was wishing I got a vegetarian one but I tried my partner's chicken on her club nachos and the chicken was good
Which is sad because the food is pretty good
It seemed as though they weren't selling a lot a gyros based on the slight crispiness on the edges of the meat but it is tasty plenty of tatziki sauce and crispy fires
Don't get me wrong it wasn't bad in any way it just wasn't as good as other sushi I've had
My fiance and I ordered three rolls between the two of us and we felt that it was mostly rice not enough fish and not enough flavor
Also have tried the egg rolls which are very good and the b/f who is a short rib enthusiast says this place has the best ones he has yet to come across
Very good-  larger sandwich easily shared with lots of good meats and really good bread
The food was a buffet and was actually quite good
She even suggested to try their kitchen food instead of sushi so we did and I got the seafood tofu hotpot & boyfriend got the curry chicken
The seafood hotpot on the other hand was actually pretty good with lots of flavor
Our server gave us some great recommendations - I had the cast iron petite chicken with biscuit stuffing $16 and DH had the wood fire mussels $16
The food was really good I had the tuna fajitas YUM
The fried chicken was good but not up to southern standards
When a restaurant relies on salt and mayonnaise as the staple flavor profile the food is well boring i
The presentation of all the dishes is fine it is the utter lack of flavor that was so disappointing
The tasty corned beef was lean and thinly sliced and piled high
The lean corned beef is probably healthier than the marbled kind but that is what you can get in LA and New York and it is sooo good
The quality of the food was less than mediocre for high prices
As a matter of fact I would recommend that people stay clear of Lon's and their poor service and mediocre quality of food
My sandwich brisket was very tasty albeit a little plain just meat and bread
I can't blame though because the place was busy and I who doesn't want a new place to be successful when the food and atmosphere are good
Chicken breast and waffle were delicious and I definitely had a sugar high from the 2 gallons of Koolaid that were served to me
It was really close to my gate good food good drinks
When I come here not only is the food wonderful I feel like I am a part of something
The pancakes were not served hot with the other food items and they seemed to have settled and were somewhat chewy and elastic
Well when I left the SF Bay area a while back the thing I dreaded leaving most was all the amazing privately-owned restaurants and hidden ma-n-pa joints that serve up delicious authentic food
Republic Ramen soothed my fear a lil though since they dish out a pretty tasty bowl of ramen
For this type of sushi place the prices were reasonable and pretty good
Their oven baked sandwiches are good though that is mostly second hand information- I personally have only tried the Chicken Parmesan sandwich which is excellent
Their pizza is very good with a tasty sauce and delicious crest with the right amount of snap
food was good but the people and uncomfortableness of it will keep me from coming back
The chicken is dry and tasteless on the menu it said SPICY however it is not spicy or flavorful at all
The crab puffs were decent but not enough to make up for the 15 dollars worth of wasted food
The food is good prices could be better but overall a good Mexican food experience and I will return
This is a good compromise when you are going with someone who isn't wild about sushi
They do only offer 4 rolls during the Happy Kalifornia Tootsie Philadelphia and Spicy Tuna but all four are fresh and delicious
This place is good for dinner and the AYCE Sushi on Saturdays but for a first timer I would really recommend the Happy Hour over anything else
The food is good and the prices aren't bad plus Sunday night kids eat free
But the only good thing I've ordered here was the Pizza Margherita - tough to screw that up - pretty much a glorified Italian cheese crisp
It was just enough to satisfy a dessert craving without making you feel like crap if you'd decided to order dessert after a deliciously filling meal
Besides food cleaning supplies and dog biscuits flowers crafts and books round out the goods there but the market's main thrust is food
The food was great service was good and it was fun to people watch
I had the Fried Chicken Biscuit sliders with Honey Jalapeno Mayo and it was freakin amazing & filling
I've had the Eggplant Parmesan rolls or something like that Pasta Greek and of course the Chicken pasta with pesto/alfredo sauce which were all flavorful and delicious
not sure if it was on purpose so I won't knock any stars off for that cause the food was delicious
Got the chicken goat cheese bacon apple pesto foccacia and would def recommend it
The menu selection is plentiful with a nice variety of hot dishes and sushi
All of the sushi was tip top fish was fresh and tasty
Which to me when a place is there for so long and the food and the Shrimp and Chips Which i have to say is the best thing to get here goes along way showing that they are a good restruant with a huge customer base
My favorite food items here are as follows Armenian pizza feta cheese and olive appetizer hummus spanakopita vegetable musaka falafel and the vegetarian combo which is hummus falafel feta babaghajoouj sarma and more
They have dessert too although it isn't fantastic it's still pretty tasty
Fridays to try some of the food featured on that Food Network show but during games they have a limited menu that excludes a lot of the good stuff including most if not all of the Food network recipes
On the plus side the food we got was good
The first time the food was tasty but not spicy and I had to spice it up a bit to match my taste
Second after seeing the Food Network Diners Dives Drive-ins special about the restaurant I now have seen what makes the food taste so good
And as far as the food goes sure it isn't high end or amazing but what they do is done well
Everything has been said about the food  its super tasty
The lunch food is pretty good; remember not gourmet
The food was no where near worth the HIGH price
Don't get me wrong the food is good but not worth the price tag
You can get just as good food a lot of other places for a lot cheaper
Overall the food was pretty good and authentic here
The service was great and the food was very delicious
and if you've never had their pizza before I highly recommend itI could go on and on about growing up in Illinois and eating all the authentic Chicago pizza's
If you're not in the mood for pizza I can also recommend the spaghetti calzone which my wife will order from time to time I recommend ordering this with meatballs
Aurelios started out in AZ by a relative of the Aurelio family and eventually the family owned franchised took off the aurelios name but continued to deliver the same high quality pizza under their own name Spinato
the pizza is not verbatim to Aurelios in IL but it's damn close damn tasty and good enough to inspire childhood nostalgia and a drive from surprise to 16th st and Bell
I visited upon a friends recommendation because I am vegan and love Mediterranean food
Each dish had great rich flavors coming from quality ingredients
That way you can pig out on the breakfast items just before they switch them out for the lunch choices increasing the overall food selection from excellent to terrific
A few of the extra good foodies this time were*  The Smoky Cheese Potato Bake
The food is always amazing and anyone who dines here needs to ask about the forbidden rice
I asked the server for her recommendation and she said the Aussie fish was her FAVORITE
For dessert we decided to split a creme brulee which amazingly was ALSO our server's FAVORITE
Dishes run in the $12 range and our appetizer was $8
My friend ordered the cashew chicken with white rice and we shared a satay chicken appetizer
It was only meant to be a small side dish to compliment the appetizer but I loved it
Both of our entrees were delicious and it was so good I didn't even save room for dessert
Check out their website for nutritional info on each item the beef gyro in this case had about 1800 mg of sodium but it was worth it
The owner asked me specifically if the food was good because as he put it to my partner I always ask the woman if the food is good because they would know better about good quality food
I'm sure there will be some who think the food is a bit pricey but it's all of high quality and in my estimation well worth the money
I'm really really biased because I love Vietnamese food and this place is just as good as it gets when you're talking Vietnamese but regardless of all that it really is just damn good cuisine that you can't beat for the price you pay
I have tried many other dishes here too and I don't remember anyone to be not good
The location is pretty central to Phoenix and it's a good resource when looking for that odd bottle of wine you won't find in Safeway's or Fry's Food Store
Very authentic and all delicious freshly prepared food
So it was with a not insignificant amount of dismay that I watched over the years as Buca's quality declined its food became less interesting its service nonexistent and the atmosphere was ultimately no longer able to make up for its shortcomings
The entrees fared well also generous portions of delicious food with uniformly intense flavor
The coffee's good the food is delicious and offers a wide variety of items from breakfast and sandwiches to crepes and salads
The appetizers are great my fave is the hellfire chips the salads are great too and big and the chicken sandwhichs come with a whole chicken breast - big enough to order w/o a bun and still leave with a full stomach
I thought to myself there's no way it could it be as good as the sushi I just had in Japan for the last 2 weeks
The food here is always good we mostly have kisras when we come however I thought I would venture out and try something new
How can you not like having an ice cold beer and hearing my favorite song to roller skate to as a kid- Another Bites The Dust by Queen
Eggs hashbrowns and the corned beef were okay the gravy on the biscuits was fine too but the biscuit was tasty and darn near perfect
The service was great and the food was pretty good
It ain't the cheapest food around nor the most authentic but damned if it isn't good
Gallo Blanco had it all awesome food amazing staff and chill atmosphere
The food was pretty good but it's not somewhere I would go to enjoy if I wasn't a guest there
Comparing the price with the food quality and uniqueness I'm not sure if I would return here
Overall I have had good experiences and the food is yummy as well
The fish changes as does the market and they have been pretty good
Dear True Food executive chefSpices and flavor are organic too
The pizza seemed a bit soggy by time it arrived with our meals the mushrooms were good but the cheese had congealed
So trying not to be rude but KNOWING that that 10 min old 5 minutes sitting in a bag food was going to be COLD
I'm sorry but I don't go out to get cold food
Uummmmmmmmmmm I think that should have been the point where she had them remake the food so it would be hot or something
I am a paying customer that doesn't like to pay for cold food be charged extra for something that I didn't order call to talk to a manager and be told that there is no manager call and complain to not one but TWO different locations and be told by TWO different locations that a manager will call me back and have TWO different locations NOT CALL ME BACK
And the One Shot Dessert display for the sweet tooth
There just aren't that many good places for vegans in Phoenix-- especially for good old fashioned American food
Our friend got the sausage dish and said it wasn't very flavorful despite the menu's description
pleasant conversation with convivial company good food and drink in an interesting setting
It was great to get to know Jim and Audrey better and I'm glad we had some time to chat as dinner was served really wonderful food
And we really enjoyed the food at Tandoori Times
We ordered our food and after everyone else got served and ate their food we were still waiting for a good 45 minutes later for ours
Pizza was served on some kind of a big 9 inch cracker with dried out cold chicken on it and the potato skins were cold too but tasted like the ones you'd get in your grade school cafeteria
So I'd go again for the nice chairs seating and ambiance but I'd stop at a local watering hole first to have a few drinks and good hot food
The pasta was cooked perfectly the sauce was absolutely delicious the bread crumbs weren't just gimmicky they really added some depth to the dish
It was $20 which for an ordinary pasta/seafood dish would have been too much in my book but this had the flavor I would expect to find in a high end place so the $20 price tag seemed just fine maybe a bargain
The restaurant was really thoughtful that they personalized our dessert for our birthday girlWonderful SERVICE
Other than the delicious food and birthday cake I love the service that Marcellino Ristoante had
Their waiter was really professional when introducing the food and recommending the wine
The Sushi is delicious and plentiful especially during his lunch specials
Each time I've been to Sapna the food has been excellent
We have also had the Calcutta egg roll which is worth a try but not sure I would get it again and the pork tacos which were just delicious
Really the service isn't much to complain about as the food is so good I can kind of overlook the service
And mock meat is tasty though probably not necessarily healthy
We were so impressed with our lunch that we ordered a couple of cookies for dessert and that was when we remembered the reason we could never be entirely vegan
The tacos both chicken and beef are just amazing the crispy shell and the flavor of the meat is just heavenly
Fresh quality meats and cheeses on fresh ciabatta bread
Great experience AWESOME food and excellent wines left me happy without spending a fortune
About 5 minutes after ordering I received my pizza and man was I Happy it was very crisp and have a very good flavor and consistency
We go for the AWESOME food - the Mint Chicken is my favorite although the Crispy Noodle Cake is pretty good too
and then the stealing of his wifes mildly spiced food and more and more sips of cold water
and for THAT besides the yummy delicious food and GREAT service Yuphas deserves 5 stars
And while AZ should boast some excellent Mexican food as well Glendale in particular is lacking in yummy Mexican shacks with names that end in -Berto's
I'd like to give this place more than 3 stars because the food is pretty good but the uncleanliness of the restaurant prevents me from doing so
George credits the positive reviews as a blessing from God but I would say the true blessing he has received is his unbelievable talent making delicious down home soul food and his easy going pleasant character
We got to talking about other specialties of the house and before I knew it I had also tried a sample of some fantastic fried Catfish excellent chopped Beef BBQ Willie's specialty and some unbelievably tasty collard greens something I've never had before but will order next time with some fried okra
This pizza is just as good as Pizzeria Bianco on its best day more consistent and have never had a long wait
We also tried a fish taco today Fridays only and that was amazing as well
[I lie I enjoyed the trolly they had set up to take patrons back and forth last year between Turf and Seamus for St Patties]
Food was good but I have to tell you what would bring me back was the atmosphere
It included 1 appetizer 2 salads 2 entrees and a dessert to share for $58
The AZ rolls were a pretty tasty appetizer even though I had to pick the corn out of it
We split the White Chocolate Brownie for dessert and it was pretty good but we were so full we didn't finish
Not sure how everyone elses food was but from viewing it i was less than impressed
I haven't yet to expand on different food items I've only had sliders wings cheese fries shakes and hot dogs
The food is good and it's such a unique place
At work I developed a mad sangria craving after assigning a photographer to shoot some Tapas restaurants in NYC then I stumbled upon a review of one of Iruna's signature tapas dishes
Everyone found a dish they enjoyed and like
My sandwich was stuffed with lots of meat and flavor
The concept is hilarious and the food is really good
How can a place that smells so good have food that tastes so bad
The food was overpriced but the restaurant smelled good and lets face it
The hot wing pizza I had was overly greasy and rich
I got the large mixed plate with lumpia very good bar-b-que pork delicious grilled chicken comes on the bone a bit of a shock but probably adds flavor and then a scoop of rice and a large dab of green papaya salad or someone noted it was pickled ginger salad wow that was good
I talked with the owner and said he had opened the truck because he could never find good Filipino food either and the truck has only been open a few weeks
Loved the food loved the friendly service and especially loved the salsa bar with delicious fresh salsa
Dinner consists of the Peanut Chicken which isn't exactly as spicy as I would like it but still pretty good
I've heard it is also a Kosher certified restaurant so you know you're getting quality food
Cute upscale cafe but the food didn't seem worth the price
Quantity is one thing but I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the food was really good too
The braised short rib enchiladas were good and the fish tacos were even better
My California Chicken Burger was delicious
The food is much better quality than any other breakfast restaurant in North Scottsdale
Brussel Sprouts were good Fries were greasy Classic Pizza -- well was classic and the Hummus was good minus the rock bread we ate it with
Overall the dim sum we had was pretty good but some things were slipping -- the black/bean spareribs pai quat was lacking in taste and the ribs were rather boney and lacking in meat
Portions are ginormous and the food was really tasty
I've heard the sandwiches are good but if you plan to get pizza prepare yourself for some char
We ordered four rolls - three off the wonderfully priced happy hour menu - and I chose a cherry blossom roll off the regular menu because I couldn't resist the fresh combination of three meats
My boyfriend was so impressed by the tempura roll - I want to say it was the Vegas - that he became giddy and proposed with a dollar-store ring right then and there
Food and drinks are good here and even more so during happy hour
Pizza has been consistently hot not soggy and not disgusting
My wife thought the fish was good but I cant say that she would rave number one but I am not sure anyone else has one that is better
There are quite a few other places in PHX that don't let you walk away hungry serve excellent fresh sushi and have a personable staff
I can tell this is going to be a fruitful relationship filled with beautifully unhealthy yet DELICIOUS food and gallons of beer
I got some delicious nachos off of the happy hour menu to start followed by a great choice of a pepperoni Indy pizza
Hubby said the combined flavors of the beef with the garlic blue cheese and balsamic onions were superb
There are so many good sushi places in the valley
There are a few sushi places in town that are better quality and better prices
The steak and chicken were really good the shrimp taco was good too but I'm partial to the Baja Fresh shrimp taco-that one is my favorite
It's quick if we need it to be the food is always delicious and the service is always spot on
The roquefort salad was my fave--lots of tasty treasures in it--but the chicken cordon bleu $23 was uninspired and a little overcooked
The food was absolutely delightful and our server and the sommelier were very good too
I don't eat beef or pork so I can only eat chicken turkey or vegetarian hotdogs
Delish even for being slightly fishy and a nice spicy flavor with the mango salsa relish stuff
I really enjoyed the Chicken Bacon and Swiss
Besides fresh meats they carry dog treats alcohol cheese curds and many other staples needed for a delicious meal
The house rolls were half off appetizers were half off and the drinks were half off as well
The Geisha A Go Go roll was delicious wrapped in their Geisha Green soy paper with a jalapeno sauce
It's a good place for food and the environment is really awesome
PizzaVegetariana red pizza - good but really felt like they skimped on the veggies
This was a different pizza than I've ever had before but it was very tasty and flavorful
For about $90 after tip we got 2 appetizers 2 sides two entrees up to $35 each two drinks and two desserts
The horseradish sauce was creamy and delicious
For food we ordered the portobello mushroom burger nice and fresh the   spring rolls again fresh and tasty ahi cups looked impressive & a good sized portion arrived but I didn't try any because raw fish makes me sad lastly the sweet potato tots make me want to nom nom nom all night long
I could live my life on Greek food so when the Daphne's in this spot closed down I was sad not because the food was good but it was walking distance from my home and open late
Things must have changed here in the last few years because I remember ordering from here in high school and the food was good
The service we had was attentive and the food was good
The food remained high quality but good food can only make up for a poor dining experience for so long
If good food is what you are looking for look no further
The food is amazing-- for something spicy check out Chicken Del Sol or jalapeno cilantro hummus
It's served cold with a vinaigrette dressing and hot grilled chicken- absolutely delicious
perfect place to just chat with friends etc because trust me you'll be there for a good amount of time waiting for you food
Our server was attentive the food was good
A minor inconvenience but hey the food service and ambiance all were very good
Went with some friends who recommended the food
Your friend is a great host-- friendly and engaging the setting is warm and welcoming-- an outdoor patio with trellises and a secret-nook feeling and the food is divine-- full of flavor but never overpowering the main ingredients
The fish was wonderful and the steak had the best flavor and cooked just right
When the food arrived it was not worth the wait
The food is traditional Mexican restaurant fare but good
Their shredded beef tacos and cheese enchiladas are excellent
The first time I ate at the restaurant I was really impressed with the taste and freshness of their food
I enjoyed eating their Ca Kho To which is catfish in a vietnamese caramel sauce on hotpot
I've heard good reviews on the meat versions from friends
I was recommend to the turkey meatloaf with sweet potato walnut mash
The food is good the atmosphere is even better
I have always been impressed that the sushi chefs are Asian I'm sorry but I always have found irony in how other ethnicity's cook and prepare another ethnicity's food
The fish does not taste like that terrible fishy flavor that makes you wonder if it's fresh or if you'll end up sick the next day it has the flavor of the fish you are meant to be eating
Only a handful of times out of the dozen that I have been there have I ever been disappointed in the flavor texture or presentation of the roll
Other sources some being people that I have converted to Sakana Groupies tell me that the soft-shell crab roll is amazing
Order some rolls snag some hot green tea or some chilled cranberry sake and appreciate some really great sushi rolls
I like to order the carmelized cauliflower which is one of the side dishes as an appetizer
The quality of the food makes up for all the foolios with ironic tattoos
Again the food quality makes up for any minor issues
The Good the service the ambiance the drink menu great looking people the bathrooms the bread the desserts are yummo
Not so good the amount of ice they put in the drinks some of the food is not so great  example
As another reviewer said the southern end of Tempe lacks really good and reasonably priced dining and we didn't want to add another one to the likes of Marcellos chicken killers and such places
On a lark we both ordered their chicken enchiladas - goodness even most gringo places can't hurt that - but they did
The food was ok but definitely not worth the hype and price
So if you are downtown and want a great steak skip Kincaid's and go to Durant's where they have servers wandering around always refilling your glass with Evian water for FREE and the food is insanely delicious
I'll admit that all their food options while good scream out I'm a menu item from a giant chain brewery and lack that little something that makes it unique to your area
Good service inviting atmosphere super clean appearance and most of all freshly prepared food that is attractive and delicious
The taco was also nice and crispy and the beef had great flavor
It tasted great but it came out blister-hot and just wouldn't cool down in the cast-iron dish
BAKED ZITI Another great dish but beware that it can be very hot to the touch comes in a cast-iron dish and stays very warm
If you want to buy local grass-fed good quality meats you have found the place to do so
I think my fiance was a little sticker-shocked since we are accustomed to paying normal grocery store prices for normal low quality meat
I am impressed with the giant menu and so many food options available
Now I won't say that this place is authentic mexican food but hey it's good food
Ordered tuna but it could have been chicken cause it sure didn't have any flavor
Lucille's prices their BBQ on the same level of a Wood Ranch so I was expecting high quality meat sides and everything else
They were warm and pretty darn tasty for airport food
3 Ahi tacos were inedible with an ancho chile and pepper flavor that was overbearing to the point of a burnt taste - we actually didn't even eat three pieces of the tuna each taco has maybe eight sushi sized slices of tuna on it
4 The signature dish of beef rib enchiladas was probably the biggest let down - like the guacamole just plain and bland in flavor
I actually found most of the food to be bland and flavorless apart from the Pad Thai which was just too darn sweet
The fried spring roll appetizer was perfect but it took quite a while for the staff to take our entree order
The bread before dinner was very good the gnocchi pesto was good my father got a seafood pasta that was excellent and I believe I got a piccatta that was solid
Best chili dogs on the planet -- amazing meaty dogs toasted buttered bread bun gloriously greasy chili
Even the marinara chicken sandwich is delicious
My mother had the Mediterranean Salad and a Friend had the Lasagna and both said their dishes were good
There was not a single dish that I enjoyed
They have a small but quality selection of wines beers cheeses prepared foods and a variety of other items
lol j/k When I added them to the top of my sushi rolls it was delicious though
Specifically ASK for fresh and hot chicken
A recent sweet discovery which was thankfully recommended by a server is the pizza cookie
My fiancee and I have gotten pizza from this location a couple of times and every time it's hot and Delicious
I would highly recommend trying ricotta cheese and eggplant on your pizza
The appetizer was dried out chicken and for the main course I asked the server what the signature dish was and she steered me to the pork shoulder
--dishes that could look good did look good I'm giving a pass for my gravy-covered eggs and hash -- it LOOKED gross but tasted great--great Sunday breakfast spot--right in the middle of antique shop nirvana
12 wings medium flavor one large margherita pizza with garlic on 1/2
I have never tasted cheese this cheesy or this good on my pizza
I am happy and sad to say that this was my first time eating at an Iron chef's restaurant that because I enjoy good food and I thought I'd have been to one sooner than now
I wouldn't say the food is amazing but I thought the sandwich and fries I had hit the spot and were reasonably priced
Carnitas burrito was very good but I would have liked something more than a ton of carnitas guacamole and pico de gallo like beans rice cheese---just because it ended up being a ton of meat
so obviously i over-ordered which i guess was a good thing because i got a solid sampling of food
My dessert was delicious and I had it with some yummy coffee
I'm a fan of pizza but this place has some serious quality control issues
We ordered two appetizers when we placed our drink order and then placed our food order when our drinks came out
I had to tear a good inch off the top and the fish filet inside didn't even reach the ends of the tacos
I could barely taste the cheese the meat was dry plus the burrito wrap bread was the most flavorful thing in the burrito believe it or not
Foods wonderful and great concept but they could hire a few more people to keep up with the service
Happy Hour PricingEdamame $3Coconut Chicken Skewers $5Kobe Sliders $8Crispy Chicken Spring Rolls $8Boneless Chicken Wings $6Ravenswood Vinter's Blend Zinfandel $7All of the food is delicious
Great food excellent drinks and the bar is where it's at
My mother loves chinese food and for our Chinese dinner out together that's where we go and order the same thing every time because it never disappointsWe start with the seafood soup which contains shrimp crab scallops and is absolutely delicious
The setting is casual there is a TV on the back walland the space is cozy and the important thing is the food is good
Overall the food was really good and the service was good as well
All of the dishes I tried 7-8 were nice and flavorful
but he also really enjoyed the food and experience here
The food selections for the buffet range from pretty good such as the curried mixed vegetables to pretty bland such as the ground lamb dish
I had the profiteroles for dessert and wow they were amazing
Both the appetizers and the food took forever to come out and when they did were tasteless and awful
I had the spinach and sun dried tomato pizza and enjoyed the cheese/sauce/toppings ratio
This place off 7th Ave north of Van Buren is my favorite Mexican food place for lunch since its the closest one to Downtown Phx that offers some delicious Mexican treats
The prices are great for the quantity and quality of the food breakfast
It's 2am and you are sitting in a cold hard booth staring at photos on breakfast foods on your placemat
We tried a bunch of their specialty rolls and thought all of them were good
This place is true authentic flavorful Mexican food and the prices were ridiculously inexpensive
First thing the food is fantastic - everyone was more than ecstatic about everything from the appetizers to the dessert
I noticed they had a kids menu and some of my favorite desserts as well hot apple pie and carrot cake
The food presentation is wonderful and the wine is fantastic
--asado of the chicken asado preserves delightful juicyness of the meat troughout each delectable crispy bite--green rice topped with wonderful limed greens--New York steak was not filet mignon but hard to find fault with the flavor packed in those grilled veggies
I want to write a great review but I don't wanna use the words superb or excellent when describing the food and I don't wanna say the service was friendly since all of these are overdone
So let me give this a shot Upon walking inside I'm greeted with The Saints Go Marching In playing in the background and the aroma of some great food being served
One dozen cold boiled shrimp whatever cold boiled means served with cocktail sauce mixed with fresh horseradish
A wonderful blend of linguine crawfish sausage mushrooms and jumbo shrimp mixed in with a creamy yet spicy marinara sauce
I was in town with a buddy of mine from college and I had recommended grabbing some sushi for dinner
Their selection of specialty rolls was quite impressive I recommend the Alaska Arizona and Sunset rolls and they did well to keep the classics well made as well
So overall I had a very positive experience with Fresh Wasabi and recommend it to anyone who loves some quality sushi at an extremely reasonable price
It comes with the delicious Jasmine Rice a spring roll and a small cup of soup to start
I highly recommend their filet Mignon and any of their side dishes
The food has always been so good been during lunch dinner and late hours
The dark and spicy notes of the Ranch House Red played right into the depth and flavors of the meat
My wife's orange chicken arrived and was cold tasted like fish and was chewy
The Mongolian beef was chewy and poor quality
And as it turns out their food items are rather tasty as well
Maybe some people on Yelp were wrong and the food is just that good that people will wait awhile
Someday I will write a review that is all twitter handles and #HashtagsAnyway we had a great dinner here service was very good and I enjoyed my food
For dinner here I was disappointed that it didn't include the delicious spring rolls but the portions were huge
My wife's beef curry was medium and was a little bland for me but she thought my spicy was too hot
All three times I have been impressed with the food
It did what an appetizer should do though and we got excited for the next foods to come
Fortunately other patrons came in and we got to see presentations of the the saganaki appetizer baked kasseri cheese flamed with brandy and the seafood entree's which I must return to try
Food actually used to be good not any longer
When my friend comes to visit me we LOVE going to Happy Hour because we can get good food at a cheap price
The crab Rangoon was good and the eggroll was good
Dim Sum is expensive and insanely busy a lot of the food comes out cold but is delicious
I'm pretty picky about chicken especially fast food chicken and theirs was actually pretty good
The food was sophisticated the service was good and the price was so reasonable
Seriously $75 per person for so much food at a place with amazing ambiance and an awesome view is quite the bargain
An appetizer of choice a main entree of choice and dessert
Choices can range from prime new york steak to lamb chops to a wonderfully cooked piece of fish
I had the Pho Taii - rice noodles with tender beef - and it was absolutely amazing
You know the Pho is good when you know there are no more noodles or beef yet you keep fishing the bottom of your bowl with chopsticks and spoon
They have all the main mall stores and there's at least one store for everything area The food court's pretty good too just don't stay there more than your meal because there's just way too many middle and high school kids hanging around
They're slinging fabulous grilled chicken with warm corn tortillas thick crispy freshly fried tortilla chips and super tasty pinto beans
and I had the fruit and chicken shwarma salad so good
There is a legitimate reason my stomach sang a satisfied song after my lunch at the Counter The food is good
The food was good but nothing spectacular
Don't get me wrong the restaurant was comfortable the food was good  and the beer was fresh
I immediately noticed the tasty dishes in the glass refrigerator at the counter and most importantly the rows of desserts tempting my taste buds
The food is consistently good the portions are big and there's something  on the menu to please everybody even my picky nephews
I have never been impressed with Peruvian food but this place was excellent
My dining partner's dish with beef was also quite tasty - the beef was well marinated and so tender
The quality of the food is on par with IHOP or Denny's
Over Easy wants to be a little different so they have some creative menu choices and everything looks very good on the menu but it's just not good quality homemade tasting food
The server artfully crisscrossed maple syrup and Cholula hot sauce in a small plate for the fried chicken and waffle which made me feel like they're just trying too hard to be different; especially when the burnt out food runner called me 'Roscoe' when he brought my food over
The waffle and biscuits and gravy had a processed look and taste to them while the chicken was saturated in grease not in the good way either and we didn't really feel good after the meal just kind of meh
The beef was lukewarm the toppings cold and wasn't very flavorful
We spend the next 20 minutes talking about the very good pizza in an set up that hucks the bucks from those who wait
Even though we enjoyed the pizza we won't be going back
As far as the rest goes bomb service solid sides & starters tasty desserts comprehensive wine list and great wine offerings by the glass if you like to jump from wine to wine during your meal
The food is really good- the customer relations stink
We've been many times and always enjoyed the food but the loud dance music which is played even at lunch time is clearly for the enjoyment of the employees
The food was mediocre at best it was not what I would consider very good Japanese fare but considering we were at an outside event it was fine
The food was good all we got was chips and fried ice cream but both were yummy as usual
Love this place and love that I live close and can get drive thru good that isn't fast food
Yes the decor isn't 5 stars but seriously if you're more worried about mood lighting and soft cushions you can go to Pappadeaux's and get charged an arm and a leg for lower quality food
They looked like H&M and Urban Outfitters threw up all over them but if that's the gimmick I'm ok with it since the food was so amazing
Pizza Meatball was delicious great crust consistency and just the right amount of sauce to cheese to meatball ratio
I'm generally not a fan of thick burgers but these are perfectly prepared and made with sirloin and beef combination that is really well flavored
The staff are friendly fun and helpful the beer is good and the food is delicious
It's the perfect mix of location good food and fun quirky atmosphere that really makes it a local gem
My date had the pepperoni pizza minus the sausage which he enjoyed immensely but how can you mess up crust cheese and pepperoni
it's definitely a rock n' roll bar that does an amazing hip hop night
I also had fish and chips and that too was excellent
The fish was lightly breaded and perfectly crispy and delicious
I really enjoyed my fish tacos as I always do but TBone wasn't in love with the enchilada that came with his lunch- the sauce was pretty bland- not normal for Mexican fare
Once I finally got the avocado rolls they were really good but I was so annoyed that I could barely enjoy them
The location is good my sushi was good and reasonably priced and the decor is pretty cool so I am going to give them three stars but the service was so terribly slow I feel like being served by a sloth would have been more efficient
Looking at the menu i noticed that its part of the Serrano's Franchise which is a good local Mexican food restaurant
The brainchild of Duc Liao and his wife Noelle based on their time in Paris as a photographer and model respectively the space had originally appeared on my radar based on the recommendation of a friend and had only increased its status in my mind by advertising one of my favorite desserts - the Paris Brest - on their website
Beginning first with the frosting seemingly a small puff of sour cream cheese actually tunneling down into the body of the cake it was quite good but where this cake truly stood out was its density - the sort of moist sponginess that made the cake seem almost undercooked as a bit of red dripped onto my hand but in reality a veritable cloud of loaded with chocolate and vanilla tones that permeated the palate in perfect balance with the frosting
My boyfriend had the Fried Chicken and it was glazed with a delicious and sweet honey spread and was a very large meal
The only complaint I had was the patio seating wasn't very good for eating - great for drinks and socializing but we were posed in a constant hunch the entire time as we sucked down our food
I had been here many years ago and I remembered the food to be quite tasty
OK this is some very good Mexican food
I was really impressed with the overall quality of the food and will totally be back on a Saturday as I don't live close by but if I did I would be there once a week for sure
If only most other little Mexican food places were this good think what a better World this could be
The staff patrolling around in golf carts were more than helpful and were almost immediately recommending camp sites to us
Great tasting all around but I was unimpressed with the quantity of meat on the sandwiches
The beans were cold but the food was good otherwise
A very cool neighborhood hang out for those who appreciate reasonably priced really fine wines and beers and tasty food fare and easy listening live music
This foodie highly recommends the mexican hot chocolate or strawberries and cream paletas depending on the season
I'm not sure why a restaurant owner would shoo away a guest especially a guest who said the food was good he was just not understanding of the hype
The quality of food was pedestrian nothing ground breaking or causing everyone at the table to say Oooooh
I cannot wait to go back and try more of their delicious food
The chicken burrito was also amazing in its simplicity
Their service was very good their drinks were good  and the pizza took like 10 minutes to come out
Let's just say the food was wonderful the Sliders were must as Adam said juicy the bread was nice and sweet and the gravy added a nice touch
but that didn't take away from the overall pizzaee goodness much
It was such a relief to find a pizza place in Phoenix that resembles a good old fashioned NY pizza parlor
The pasta had nice texture and the chicken was juicy with nice grilled flavor
My husband and I don't eat red meat so I can't speak on that but everything I got was excellent
I have also tried the Garlic chicken which is good but I prefer the spicy basil
My ONLY complaint about these burgers is the meat itself needs more flavor
Great atmosphere great service and high-quality Italian food are enough for me any day
I'm not a Sushi aficionado so I can't distinguish good yellowtail from whale blubber
And stuffed with every imaginable sort of deliciousness from breaded beef  sausages and ham to fried egg cheese avocado and a delectable spicy chipotle mayo sauce
The rice side dish is very tasty with corn and lots of butter --shades of latin risotto
The rest was rather blah and I walked away about $30 lighter with tip and still craving good sushi
People who know good sushi realize that ambiance is not something one expects of such places where the older the head chef and the deeper the hole in the wall the better the food
For those members of any prospective dining parties not interested in seafood I suggest the pork katsu which despite coming from a sushi restaurant is simply delicious consisting of smaller chop-stick friendly cutlets of tender lightly breaded pork rather than an enormous sliced steak
Not a whole lot of flavor out of lettuce meat tomatoes and bread but at least you know everything that is in it
This place has good food and huge portions
The food is good but nothing on the menu seems to be too memorable
95 the Paccatelli al Ragu a bolognese pasta dish I believe the Scaloppine al Gorganzola a veal dish that he enjoyed but serving size was not as big as he'd wished for
Dolmades I ate out of frustration but they weren't good at all being some meat-type thing for all I know they could have been made of dog food with some lemon sauce
But if Saint Haralambros has a festival like they did last year with such excellent and superior food and such beautiful artistry in the jewelry as they did in 2010 I will be there
or if nothing else you are an embarrassment to some of us in the Greek community for your lousy food and ridiculously high prices for bad quality food no entertainment at noon and cheaply made trinkets you were trying to sell
Later the next week  I had to add this because I am so astounded at all the non-Greeks who write reviews here about how wonderful the food is at this fest
This resort definitely exceeded my expectations - the staff is AMAZING friendly accommodating etc the food was delicious the resort is beautiful and the rooms were also clean and well-maintained
I always get Thai hot as I love spicy food and they never disappoint
I recommend the signature dish Thai Basil as well as their Pad Thai and Red Curry
Any one of the dessert items which I treat like a drink the drinks are soooo refreshing during our hot summers
The service was very good and so were the prices but the food wasn't very good at all
I am someone that orders almost everything on the menu when trying out a new place and the majority of unique dishes were dissapointing specifically lacking in flavor execution texture and occassional messy plating I could be swayed if the prices were a little better but for what they charge I wouldn't be afraid to send something back or shy away from this place all together
Beer selection is a little on the weak side but the food is pretty good
but I was goodThe new pizza menu at Jac's offers new and interesting artisan options including the well done Margherita and a Bela Dela Meat something or other that was wonderful
-We had two pizza's and ended up taking home almost  1/2 of each pizzaA great value at under $80 US money for four of us including multiple cocktails two big pizza's and two appetizersFinally while the du00e9cor hasn't changed the atmosphere has
As an entru00e9e I recommend the Beef Teriyaki
As someone who struggles with the demons of greasy and heavy fast food this menu has several light flavorful vibrant and healthy options
The tacos are great and so are the tortas the meat gets simmered for hours and the veggies are always cold and crisp

The food was good but I think that a little warning of if you want extras be prepared to pay extra $$$
It wasn't rocking my proverbial world but it was good decent food
Never had Vietnamese food before but I really enjoyed it
I also HIGHLY recommend their fresh veggie spring rolls with a peanut dipping sauce I liked these so much I came back 2 days later and order 2 to go one for dinner and one for lunch then we had some pork pattie and pickled papaya over some noodles it was amazing and very light on the stomach not to be confused with hunger I was not hungry still but I wasn't Hometown Buffet stuffed either
For dessert I had something that sounded truly disgusting but was WONDERFUL
I wasn't completely thrilled with the experience but the food was okay not great - good-ish factoring in amount and quality for the price
are filled with such nu-American classics as Pesto Chicken and mushrooms steak and potatoes and even the good ole' fashioned PB&J
In an age where many restaurants are opting for smaller menus where quality is the main focus Maizie's is able to offer up a HUGE menu while still maintaining the quality and freshness in their food
This is a great lunch spot that we'll be sure come back for the variety and the good food
If the food wasn't so good this review would have been a 1-star
Inexpensive delicious Italian food in a small and personable restaurant
After we ask what the deal is the server informs us that now they are down to just pizza paninis 2 pasta dishes and a few appetizers
The food is pretty tasty and you'll find the normal bar fare here think burgers and fries and they are often having cheap drink specials that never fail to bring a smile to my face
But overall the atmosphere and the quality of the food make it worth every visit
Flavors were fine but would probably try a different dessert on another visit
The food was tasty but I'll pass on this one next time
For the amount of food we got I thought it was good
Went here the other day for lunch - sushi rolls are larger than other places I've been to and they taste pretty good too
I rated it high becuase I think overall its a good place and the food isnt that half bad
Now Italians especially Italian aristocrats are absolute food snobs which is great they don't settle for anything less than the best freshest seasonal quality food because that is simply the food culture in that gorgeous country
Unfortunately my pen wouldn't write & I'm not any good at memorizing the names of Indian dishes but there were 20 main items & everything was delicious
The interior passed my expectations  I was comfortable enough I found my own entertainment  magazines books and my phone food wasn't a problem because both my flights were under four hours and the leg room problem was solved by a few visits to the washroom to stretch out my legsI am giving US Airways 4 stars because they got me home safely the staff was friendly pilots were excellent and communicated with the flyers frequently which calmed my anxiety both my flights were on time I was happy I didn't have to pay 1500 for an American Airline ticket and spent 400 instead and had an overall satisfactory experience
I walked in and told the lady that me and another family that were on their way were looking for a place to eat and wanted to know why i should eat here just giving her a hard time i asked if the service was good the place was clean and if the food was good and what mexico city cuisine meant
The food was very good my wife and i split the fajitas and normally you get a huge plate full of onions and peppers with a few strips of meat but it was just the opposite here we got  a plate full of steak and chicken and just the right amount of onions and peppers
Their regular chicken sammiches are off the hook their slaw is perfect with the right amount of creaminess and their waffle fries are different but delicious
The food is a bit overpriced but its better quality and tastes a lot fresher and lighter than other fast food chains
I have recommended this restaurant to so many people and I don't think anyone has ever been disappointed with the food
Fish was amazing  with a little tapenade on top but the fingerling potatoes were essentially home fries
Really enjoyed the spicey shrimp tacos & the traditional beef
More importantly the food is very good - much better than an average sports bar
I have enjoyed most of my meals at The Vig on 40th st and the food has always been great but the last two times I visited Uptown I was disappointed
I would've come back here and given the food another shot if the service was better but now this will remain solely a drinking establishment for me in the future
Not sure the type of sauce was used on the meat but it was very good but the plate was definitely good for two people no way good I finish it on my own
If you want pretty authentic tasty and delicious mexican food esp carne asada then def give the place a try with an open mind
11/02/10Had an amazing happy hour complete w/ dessert here today
Everything was perfect the setting the patio amazing & attentive servers speedy bartenders absolutly fantastic food
Wonderful options for building your own pizza or if you're a little more adventurous they have their own creations that are fantastic as well
They did a good job of cooking the meat to order particularly our prime rib orders but the seasoning is a little blah it leaves a weird aftertaste that I can't quite put my finger on
Pro The food was actually pretty good - they stir fry everything for you and it reminded me of Jade Palace in Atlanta - back when it was good
Shredded Beef Enchiladas Really good
However the food is so good that these complaints will not keep me from returning to Gallo Blanco whenever I am back in Phoenix
Well not exactly but Green helps - unfortunately not all Vegan food is as creative or tasty
The Spicy Po'Boy sandwich was my 1st and 2nd meal at Green and still a favorite all the burgers are good pizza is decent bowls all taste similar but are all great
Go to Green Carnivore or Herbivore or anything in between for the good food/atmosphere
They really seem to put a lot of care into the quality of the food
The food was very good considering that they were not primarily a restaurant
At around 2am when Haney's shut down we had an overwhelming craving for crap pizza its better than our normal Jack in Box at 3am run that usually ends up with someone puking in the drive thru line because the smell of the taco sauce is so amazing
Both the pho and the spring rolls were equally as tasty
So good that it almost comes close to the amazing pizza dough in NY
I thought the chicken breast was a bit tough but it was quite tasty
The pizza was one of the most delicious I've had
For the price you get a lot of amazing food
I don't know what the hell I was expecting when the dish is called half roasted chicken but it was a TON of delicious roasted chicken
So good in fact that throughout the course of our meal I continually brainstormed dishes that could be made better with the addition of cornbread
I thought of cornbread shepherd's pie cornbread chicken pot pie and cornbread bread bowls but instead of cheese on the inside delicious butter
This is where the beautiful people converge on a Friday night to eat some amazing food and drink wine
The service was excellent with refills never taking too long and food coming out faster than expected both of which are huge pluses
The bill wasn't bad at all for the amount of food you got it was under $8 per plate definitely worth it
But if you want delicious quality food for a reasonable price look no further than Mi Patio
Overall if you are looking for both quality AND quantity Mexican food- Give Mi Patio a try
I ordered the black bean burger - not a 1950s dish to be sure but tasty and substantial
Service was good food was good atmosphere was cool
I wish there was a little more meat but the flavor was great fries were great and it was worth stopping
The atmosphere and service were nothing special but the food was good
It was a huge amount of food and had a really nice flavor
The food is good but could use an update I agree with other reviewers
I've had most things on their menu the fish burritos are really good if you eat them right away while the fish is still crisp and as for everything else it's all good but my heart belongs to Filibertos
Until I try their other dishes they'll get 4 stars because the memories made me happy the service was good and the food wasn't half bad
+3 stars because it's the only feed/tack store for horses I've seen in Tempe and does carry some good brands of food with great nutritional content
The food was good with room for improvement
It's soft and sweet and too good to be true it's also probably really bad for your cholesterol as well so there's a downside to really really good food
We also ordered the chicken dish recommended by the waitress
I think next time I would try a pork dish I've been told it's delicious
No big deal I just wished that he would have explained it was a separate appetizer plate since we had so much food
The pizza was really tasty a great combo of sweet caramelized onions and peppers
What's comical is that we came here with gift certificates we got from the manager of the Desert Ridge location after our food came out cold after a 45-minute wait
Good selection of menu options and I ended-up ordering the Chicken Scallopini which was excellent
3 if you think that the food here is worth waiting for
Take a pass on this place truly not worth it they specialize in bad food and bad excuses and not much else
I wouldn't classify Thai Pan as an authentic traditional-style Thai restaurant - the food is a bit lighter and not too spicy - but the flavors are definitely Thai and well done
The people alone are worth it to stop by and the food was so fresh and good you're missing out if you don't give it  a try
Well I mean its either this that has a lil' roller coaster or CrackerJacks Fiddlesticks Amazing Jakes or
He explained to us of how precise and meticulous his cooking methods are in order to produce the most tender flavorful bites of meat you could ever eat
Plus I was there at 11am when they first opened and when I told the waitress I had 30mins to eat for lunch they got me in and out within that time and the food was good
Thumbs down and unfortunate for a place with such beautiful decor and quality of food
You usually get these as a side with every Mexican dish so they better be good
The dish also comes served with delicious beans & potatoes
If you like eating delicious food with friends continuously for hours come here
Go with a group of friends get there early enough to get a table & stuff yourself with delicious food
They blew it off as oh well when food arrived I was not impressed with what they had to offer
Besides the fact that our food was delicious everything is organic 'except the coke products'
I really love this place their food is sooo good
Their food is good and you get great value for your dollar
Our food arrived prior to our drinks and my omelet was REALLY cold - like I mean the broccoli was still slightly frozen - too bad considering it's their house specialty - the hashbrowns were also undercooked and the cream cheese glob was just overkill on the omelet
This is the kind of amazing food you eat out of a box on your favorite couch watching Archer South Park Tosh
The Dawgfather Challenge is really a ridiculous amount of food but the quality matches the quantity
I recommend it to anyone looking for a mountain of food
The hot dogs are great quality meat and the preparation is top notch
I also really enjoy the Autostrada Panini as it is truly the most flavorful meat sandwich ever invented
I had my doubts about the Irish/Mexican dish but it was actually pretty good
Both of the burgers we ordered beef medium rare were very good but the portion to price ratio is off
The cuts of meat looked huge and everyone I was with really enjoyed them
First off it's pretty expensive for pizza but it's worth it
Their food is still good but the portions have decreased
Positives food is delicious and servers were very friendly
Whole Foods cold salad bar has two types of quinoa and two types of kale
But all in all I highly recommend Villa Peru to anyone who wants to enjoy delicious traditional Peruvian food
Again the tiramisu was incredible - the liquer flowing as your fork went through the dessert which was flavorful not too sweet and coated the mouth
Overall the service was great food was excellent
The food was alright and definitely not worth the price
Someplace you can get hot food drinks and listen to jazz music while sitting there pretending you're in a completely different city
Five of us two appetizers two bottles of wine five pizzas came out to around 50 dollars a person including the tip
The meat is great quality and the rare beef is always brought out freshly placed in the bowl so that it doesn't get over-cooked
They also have shakes onion rings a bunch of other appetizer type foods and a very simple combo structure for each type of burger
This burger joint is fancier than most but prices match the experience you will have and quality of food you will get
The drinks were blegh and my buffalo chicken sandwich was made with sliced deli-style chicken meat with indistinct flavors from all the elements of the sandwich
But more than that the sushi is simply amazing my unagi plate presentation was crazy served on a sizzling plate it defiantly had the whole restaurant staring
It was simple rotisserie chicken - good flavor but not what it claimed to me
I've tried six dishes here every one has been excellent
I think Thai Spices offers a good value for some great food and drink and I can't wait to come back
The food was good though with reasonable portions but I was expecting more
Overall the food is good and if you feel like 21 dollars for tacos is reasonable then go for it because they are tasty but I thought it was a little bit of a jip
The burger had no flavor to it - just tasted like ordinary ground beef with seasoned salt
and some beer with food that goes good with beer
Went there back in 2005 after reading the reviews on Citysearch before I left and couldn't pass up good Mexican food even being from LA
We sat outside and it took a while to get the food but it was worth
The service again was great and the food was tasty
Bombero's has an uber chill atmosphere that I really enjoy and the food is really good
I had the honey glazed chicken lavosh pizza and it was amazing
There are a few minuses but the food was so good that none of this would bug enough to not come back
Luci's is a good neighborhood spot to buy your health foods drop in for a coffee or fresh made baked good or pick up some beer or frozen meat on the way home
It's highly Americanized and yes I've had Chinese food in China but I've also enjoyed great American Chinese food here to the point of regrettable blandness and it is SO VERY EXPENSIVE you may find your credit score taking a ding after eating a plate of wok charred beef listed as one of the saltiest foods in America
The BF took me here for dinner to challenge my notions of good sushi and expand my sashimi horizons
Excellent across the board; food service ambiance and cleanliness
All of the food was freshly made tasty and super satisfying
I dunno what it is about good sushi but when you have it you know it and it leaves you with a near sexual afterglow
We ate like kings for about $60 we did order a LOT of food that night but it was worth every penny and I would go back here again in a heartbeat
Their seafood bake is so juicy and the sauce is excellent
Their food prices are a bit pricey for me but considering how impressed by my drink I am I think it will definitely be worth $8 for a sandwich
+++'sDecent food bottled beer on ice friendly service good cooks fresh and filled condiment buffet fun to squirt your own ketchup and mustard from the buffet area free refills outdoor patio not too busy for weekday lunch time- - -'sChintzy du00e9cor no eye candy a tad overpriced for what you get yellow circus awnings drab atmosphere no wifiIn sum if you are in the mood for a hamburger a quick bite to eat and are in the vicinity of a Fuddruckers this place delivers
It seems reasonably fresh; there is a sushi chef working behind the line though of course the quality is not as good as a dedicated sushi restaurant
The hot food is slightly better than typical buffet food nothing stands out but nothing is so bad that it bears mentioning
the husband ordered the chile relleno and it was really good as well filled with meat and cheese
Tell her there's a Farmer's Market that sells delicious and fresh food
Hottie and my favorite Foodie Bear and what an adventure it was
Overall good food and good price we'll be back
One of the things I love about this place is that they serve spicy food with a huge depth of flavor something that is very hard to accomplish
For desserts they ordered the Green Tea Cheesecake which came garnished with some pink sauce that tasted like some kind of childhood bubblegum flavored medicine and dessert wontons
All in all we had a great time and enjoyed the food drinks and service quite nicely
I overheard another patron say they were good for Philipino food beginners
The food here has consistently been very good and the wait staff is very nice and cheerful
The food was excellent so I know I will be back soon to eat here again
As our food came I had to take a call and when I finally returned to the table my eggs and pancakes were cold
The food at Someburros is on par with any good Mexican restaurant in the Valley but it is fast and inexpensive
THE GOOD I want to give Zips a top rating because their food is awesome
and that is too bad because their food is really good
6 The food is good and I greatly enjoy eating it at the time but later on in the wee hours of the night it doesn't want to stay down inside of me
You do have to be careful though if you don't pay attention you may find yourself with some chicken on your plate which can take up valuable gastric real estate better used on a good cut of beef or their leg of lamb my personal favorite
It's a good place to go if you want to try something different and have a craving for Mexican food
The food they carry is unwaveringly good the coffee they serve never disappoints and they have one of the best florist shops in town
The food was delicious we got the vegetarian tamales and the service was great
I ordered the chicken soup which was delicious albeit sort of cold
But I will definitely go back as the food is so darn good
The food is amazing the servers are attentive and super knowledgable
I'm on a quest to try good meat markets and sausage places around the Valley so I finally stopped by Schreiner's
I am Asian from Hawaii and know good fresh sushi
Other than that the food is always decent for the price and my personal recommendation is the sirloin kebob
I do have to say that I am not a fan of spicy food whatsoever but the chile paprika and cojita sauce was done so tastefully that I extremely enjoyed it
Ordered the 5 course tasting menu  plus there are a lot of bite-size bonus dishes some of them are pretty good
I was introduced to this place by some co-workers who are very familiar with what good REAL Mexican food is
they have delicious chicken and biscuits and gravy
i just knw when i want a good satisfying breakfast i want comfort food and i am not worried qbout calories lol
i just can't get over how delicious these pizzas are - the crispy wood-fired crust and the cheesiest of cheeses - cooked to perfect
I had three different kinds of chinese food none of which tasted very good
Anyway about the food* Smashwedge Salad - my wife and I shared this and it was very good
Very odd though in a good way for a fast food place
I asked him if he recommended the vegetable or da Greek pizza
He told me da Greek pizza was new and all fresh and to give it a shot
I chose the pizza with their signature sauce instead of the olive oil option and it was one of the most delicious pizzas I have ever had
Coming from Chicago where good pizza is abundant I can say I've had my fair share of good pizza
so I have a high bar for what I'd consider excellent---an excellent pizza is da Greek pizza at Spinatos in Phoenix
This place has grasped the concept of the slow food dining experience but not in a good way
For old town Scottsdale the prices are what you would expect overpriced for what you get The food was nonetheless tasty when it did arrive
Good fire brick pizza is my favorite food right behind ribs and NoRTH is the best in Phoenix
Let me put it another wayI ate at Ocean Club ordering their seafood tower as an appetizer
The food is on par with restaurant quality & the menu exceeds bar food expectations
Probably not then again I don't think Pizzeria Bianco is all that authentic plus Cibo has a great outdoor space and the pizza is very good
A nice variety of dim sum and they also have good bbq meats
The food was exceptionally good- very nice selection of fresh soups a carving station with good quality prime-rib a made-to order pasta bar and more
Finding good bar food is like searching for the Holy Grail
In a world of extra greasy food good bar food usually falls under that category when it really doesn't have to
In my never ending search and self destructive search for good bar food I have stumbled upon the British Open in Scottsdale Arizona
Definitely not the best sushi I've had in town but the drinks are good cucumber mojito
For good sushi I will stick with Yasu or Sakana
It's unfortunate we won't be able to experience this hip chic high-end bar which had excellent service GR8 food and fantastic drinks
The cabbage rolls are a little different than what we grew up with but were still quite tasty and were very satisfying
The bakery case is filled with delicious cookies pastries and rolls
I was here last week and had the original beef and wow was that good so i figured let me try them again
Overall this is a great place to get a quick bite to eat and enjoy some good ol' fashion diner food
The egg rolls were a little small chewy and not much flavor not much good flavor anyway
Apps which I was told was going to be bruschetta took awhile to come out [around 545p actually and AFTER the comp table bread and JUST BEFORE I received my ribeye steak salad entree $13 which for the most part looked good the meat slices didn't look that particularly attractive and more importantly tasted good as well
]  The delivered app was actually a rectangular slice of the Semolina crust Margherita which had a really nice crunch and flavor for a red-sauced pizza
the muted colors and wood tables with spot lighting really enhanced the feeling that gives hot pot its entertainment appeal the food is the show
I will give the place anohter shot becuase the food was good and I know that sometimes people only work as hard as they have to
Food is pretty good too I love shoestring fries so when I want to splurge i'll order something with the fries or steal some from whoever is with me
I've had other dishes here which have been pretty good but the prices keep me from coming back to eat unless I get a gift card for this place
The swordfish was delicious but didn't come with much else
The chicken pasta was good but too simple for the price
Our food came out quickly and it was quite tasty
When the food did come out it was very good
Very messy but  the beef itself was very tasty
So the food - surprisingly delicious and generous portions and just a bit more reasonably priced than a comparable L
Overall it was a good time and the food was pretty good
They have some good dishes but be warned they tend to be very random with their spicy dishes
The chicken was not fresh there was very little flavor and the kicker
It included an appetizer trio 2 entrees 2 desserts and a choice of mojito or sangria
The food here is amazing yes the customer service is not the best
If they are delivering hot fresh food then of course interrupt me but
But the last order I had it seemed that the dish was lacking flavor and barely fried it was almost white rice
For dessert we had the Bread Pudding which was decadent and amazing
All in all it was a nice dinner good food great service but not super dee duper
really not my thing All the fish was fresh and tasty
fried krab covered with globs of sugary sauce is NOT sushi whatever anyone saysIt's bittersweet that I have finally found a delicious sushi place that I can always go to for a fantastic meal when I am moving out of the state for college next week
Good service waiter knowledgable of vegan items on their menu great food
Food quality seemed good but menu items I tried were fairly bland and not very interesting though I do find this holds true at many hawaiian restaurants
The staff is extremely friendly and recommended great stuff  3 of us got the chicken burro and loved it
Food is okay but not worth the lengthy wait on weekends
Then I look at the menu and can't decide of course which to order because - in peering over to the next table - I can see that all of the food looks pretty good
Suki could tell by my friend's facial expressions that Greek spices were not to his liking; she recommended the Cairo Special as an entree - Egyptian Chicken and Mediterranean Beef combination
And so I sat down and ordered the spring rolls the pho tai beef broth with noodles and medium-rare thinly-cut beef slices and some hot tea
The spring rolls came with the requisite fish sauce and tasted pretty good but it was the bowl of pho which was the main attraction
Besides the food being good and authentic
I would've chalked it up to oven not being hot enough for the first dishes but this seems to be a recurrent problem
they char the skin on the chicken just perfect so there's no layer of fat and it's just all crispy skin goodness with a juicy marinated to the bone goodness when it comes to the meat
i could have eaten about another 1/4 let's be honest another 1/2 chicken easilySunnyD made good on his chicken and ate the whole thing too
It's so good that if SunnyD were to ever ask me to drive out to Tempe from OC to just dine on that chicken again i would gas up and hit the road
Well don't so quickly dismiss the other absolutely AMAZING dishes served here
That means flavor and the flavor of the beef is outstanding
They also have a salsa / topping bar with items like shredded cabbage limes radishes pickled onions avocado salsa a hot salsa and another salsa I didn't try
America's is eh Tacos Atoyac is awesome but I've never been wild about their carne asada and many other places simply can't match the flavor of the meat here and really isn't that what it's all about
First and foremost the food Perhaps it's not authentic Mexican maybe I missed the part that the restaurant makes this promise but whatever cuisine it is it's delicious
Was pleasantly surprised that they brought out some tasty chicken soup almost as soon as I sat down in the style of a Korean restaurant
I ended up ordering the Pad Ba Mee noodles and fried egg with chicken and it was good
The delicious Guac-a-Tony avocado dip Italian style served with thin crispy pizza crust was almost enough of a meal for the three of us
a day or so beforehand so as to have a fair shot at finishing my food
Food- The Vig features a very unique and tasty menu
Some of my favorite appetizers are the Five Spice Edamame 16th Street Tacos Smoked Salmon Crabmeat and Artichoke Dip The Not So Nachos and the Seoul Sliders
It's flavored ground meat w/ a hunk of cheese in it
But looking at the other plates with mexican food it looked good and smelled wonderful
As far as specifics I've had the chicken/ribs combo which is a ton of food; the shrimp cargot which is a garlic-butter-cheese lovers dream; and the chicken tenders dinner which has delicious breading
They have the perfect ratio of meat to noodle and they have a really good sauce as well
The noodles were great but the meat was not so good
I got there at a good time because a line formed after I got my food
Chompie's has really good food and a huge menu
While a bit pricey for lunch $60 for three people the quality of the food is well worth it
Being vegetarian it isn't always easy to find quality meat-substitutes especially in a sports bar and chicken restaurant but BWW has a tasty selection served with a smile
Thanks BWW for always assuring a great experience with a super staff and excellent food
If your palate longs for breakfast food made with Love and flavor support Local Arizona small business and try Kiss the Cook
A a cold Rogue and switch it up between the Greek w/chicken or the Carne Adovada
However the food the bacon the sausage the pancakes were all delicious
Now while I can't promise amazing service or no wait I can tell you your food will be worth both
Oh and the food is pretty good too especially for being so inexpensive
but I feel the need to highlight this place because a the pickins are slim for reviews of stuff on the west side outside the Westgate or Arrowhead areas; b I'm not really reviewing the quality of the food; and c it must be noted that Sonic is open until midnight also rare for this area apparently
Cut to the drive-thru where I order their version of a Blizzard switching up the fast food references that can even be chocolate-flavored
And the quality wasn't great - also there were several dishes that were supposed to be warm and were luke warm at best
The Good * Good prices and friendly service* Great flavors - Had the ham and cheese panini and it was awesomeThe Not So Good* Little slow took a good fifteen minutes to get food* Not all that child friendly
Not anti-kid but not a lot of options for kidsAll in all a good place and good food though
As it was my pick for lunch I felt a little sheepish that it was such a mess but at least the food once we finally got it was tasty
The food was very good and the breakfast menu had everything you could want and even better they serve it 24/7
I've tried their enchiladas and they weren't that good so I would stick with the American foods
Right now it seems a bit sketchy at night but worth the risk for some decent food
Now to be fair they've got a variety of breakfast foods like the amazing-looking challah french toast that have no foreseeable possibility of exiting the kitchen drowning in refined rapeseed juice
I can't quite recommend the food as it wasn't available
Today I went for the hot dog while my partner ordered the Italian Beef
I've eaten several things from here I would recommend going with chicken or the pork instead of the beef
Course was in good shape and greens rolled true
The food is good and there is always plenty of it
We fed 35 people for less than $300 and everyone really enjoyed the food
Georgeann G and I enjoyed the Singapore Noodles angel hair shrimp and pork in a curry sauce and the Yum Gai spicy minced beef served cool over a salad of vegetables
Both dishes were amazing and the special hot sauce our server suggested was a great compliment to the already vibrant flavors
We had only vegetarian items but I hear their meats arevexcellent as well
This might be a star to high but honestly when you can find good Chinese food that can deliver on a consistent basis
The food is always hot even when we get it delivered
Other places Ive gone has horrible food and it was almost cold
The authentic delicious Greek food is an added value
I must deduct one star for the pizza-by-the-slice which reminded me of the frozen pizza you buy at Costco on account of the completely flavorless dry-ish crust
Pretty good but we're still looking for that GREAT fish and chips place in the Valley
The corn fritters were other worldly totally killer I really enjoyed the tofu and the veggie rolls
I ordered the fish & chips because well I heard they were amazing
The fries were pretty plain but the fish was good
The food is tasty enough and it's a fun spot
They were still moderately busy on a Thursday evening but that won't last if their food quality doesn't improve over what my wife and I were served
in a delicious beef soup that wasn't salty as some other places tend to focus on
Then fishing around in there found all of those wonderful rice noodles
Amazing how two tables behind us got food from the same waitress
which implies tip is not included and we get to choose the tip amount and nowhere mentions automatic gratuity 18% gratuity 18% of $140 even though we ordered $100 worth of food at the most was automatically added to our check
I picked the lemon cake as dessert and again it was tasty but I didn't feel compelled to finish it
I WILL however tell you which my favorites were the savory prosciutto and olive platter crispy tempura fried brussell sprouts incredible pan-seared scallops delicious braised short rib and the heavenly red velvet bread pudding dessert and I don't even like bread pudding
Both are excellent in terms of food and service
Nice ambience good food quality friendly service
We had pizzas and were impressed with interesting recipes and proper portioning of ingredients
Still the ambiance the service the lack of a line the satisfaction of two teens the single rose with thorns and good food made this an overall delightful night out
Anyway back to the food The lunch choices are very good
Had I not been so worried about finding another bug in my food I probably would have thoroughly enjoyed the steak because it actually tasted really good but after the salad my meal was ruined
I don't think it had enough flavor it was missing a hint of spice and more generous pieces of chicken
For appetizers we had crab cakes shrimp cocktail spinach salad chicken liver pate and cheese popovers
The decor is contemporary and comfortable and the service was as good as the food
As always the food was good old American food
I would certainly recommend it for the food but otherwise you might be better off elsewhere
Don't get me wrong the food is quite good
The food here is authentic not spicy in general - mostly cantonese style but very good
Mongolian beef is great salt and pepper shrimp or pork choops are very good
Our server came by after a few minutes but he was a little stand-offish and didn't really have any recommendations
It seems to be a nice place to hang out and eat some good food with a nice glass of wine
Service & food quality are the same as the other Yardhouse locations in the valley but this location is a little less rowdy which I consider a plus
I had been recommended to their pizza so I ordered the Tuscan pie
Chef Holly wowed me with the delicious food at the UYE YAP at Ticoz a week ago
The service is good and food is even better
Yes good food is appreciated by the island folks
I have on occasion order other foods and yeah it is all good
Let me just say when it comes to meats cheese and household goods Fry's is pretty good
The food is so freaking delicious and fresh
Even so getting shot is definitely worth the risk for some of their delicious food
I love the traditional food of the place my succulent shrimp cocktail  oysters  with hottest horseradish know to man  thick meaty prime rib and a lovely lemon drop cocktail that begs me to keep sipping away
The prices are great and the food is excellent
Bottom line Conveniently next to the convention center but food is not worth the hefty prices
Our core orders areSausage Pizza hold onion add roasted red peppersGrilled Chicken Pasta AKA chicken AlfredoHollywood Cobb SaladDemi breakfast with the bacon pancake and a well done turkey maple sausageCapresse Sandwich grilled in oven best when tomatoes are from AgritopiaMinestrone SoupFar East SaladThe burgerNow there is a subculture at Liberty Market that is worth notingThe E-61 bar is a separate but conjoined experience and the Baristas are able to create outstanding beverages that are like nothing I have found in AZ
Likes really fresh ingredients they picks herbs from their own garden for your pizza great atmosphere we had a good server- My pizza came out wrong and he was amazing about making up for it
Dislikes serious lack of cheese on the pizzas- I'm a cheese lover though I tried the pesto pizza and the BBQ pizza and both really lacked flavor in the sauces
The chicken was sort of dry and not so tasty
The beef one could have been more flavorful but was OK
The tiny taco was tasty but the fish was over cooked $7
Our group choose a variety from the large number of menu choices and without exception everyone was happy with their selections which included the farm burger with cheese and grilled onions the Thai chicken salad the Ahi tuna sandwich rare with wasabi mayo excellent rosemary dill panko onion rings farm milk shades that day offered in Agritopia Medjool date pumpkin as well as the more traditional flavors and for Izabel our granddaughter corn dog bites
the prices were good $5 for a roll $3 for seaweed salad/calamari/edamame
I would not necessarily go back for the food specifically or recommend it but if you just want to hang out and drink it's a nice little place
I'm not especially a hot dog gal but Don Guido's offers something else to Sunnyslope too Italian Beef sandwiches
This was my lunch today a delicious Italian beef sandwich paired with garlic fries
MMMM the cashew chicken and MaPoTOFU soooooooo good My opinion is mostly based on veggies and rice quality so It is a tie
She made great recommendations and she totally took good care of us - making sure our food was good and that our drinks stayed full
Short Leash RiteWay catering Truckin' Good Food Torched Goodness The Tamale shop
The spicy-salted spareribs and 5-spice chicken wings are good for appetizers too
Food was good had the street taco fight which consists of 6 tacos and an order of guac
however my wife was dissapointed in the Waldorf chicken salad which honestly tasted like cheap hot dogs
tacos were good - salty beans seemed to be placed in a dish as an afterthought
The food was amazing and the drinks were delicious
We asked about beef patties a favorite of ours in Jamaica but they said they couldn't get the quality of beef they would like yet
Jose our waiter was super helpful very knowledgeable of the food and helped us select some quality dishes
Either way it was good - the perfect amount of sauce to complement the lobster meat
The last appetizer I had was the Crispy Spicy Ahi Sushi Roll with Ginger Wasabi and I could have eaten this all day long
I prefer beef and chicken over fish during every day of the week but since the ahi sushi roll was so good I decided to get a little fishy
Yeah I know penalizing them for not healthy is probably silly as you know when going to let's say a fast food joint you are not eating so good
That being said the food at Defalco's is very high quality - almost as if you are in Italy and am not comparing it to fast food
I have tried many things on the menu such as Eggplant Parmigiana Chicken Parmigiana and Cheese steak and three of those are worth a shot
really good food altho the orgasmatron went off only for the tiramisu
For dinner I had the seared ahi appetizer - I know done everywhere but I really just felt like a small portion of nice fish
Its a filling dish and well worth the 5 bucks
I can't speak to any of the dishes on the regular menu but if you decide to try the Summer Menu I highly recommend the date and mozzarella appetizer
And I can only imagine how crazy good the chicken mac 'n' cheese is but it seemed a little too indulgent for such a big meal
If you are looking for good food avoid Majerle's If you want to watch sports and drink this is a good place to beAnd it's nice that they turn music on during commercialsI really don't understand how Majerle's food is as bad as it is
The happy hour specials are good minus the food
Majerle's Good scenery & bad food or Zipp's No scenery & good food
The food is very good and portions are more than ample so you can easily split something or just have a lunch for yourself the next day
I LOVED the salad the spring rolls were also very good
Chicken enchiladas in mole sauce - quite good
The food was good and they had some sushi rolls that looked pretty interesting
Unlike a previous reviewer I've had nothing but good experiences at Church's Chicken here in Mesa
Oh and I went to Popeyes a few weeks ago expecting to get a good fried chicken and it was so horribly salty I couldn't eat it
Fabulous flavorful food with a great balance of heat spice and complex flavors
I ordered off menu their Szechwan cucumbers which were fresh crisp slightly salty with a great hot oil and many red chilies tucked into the dish
I added a little of the table chili sauce to compliment the heat already in the dish and it was a great appetizer
and it was delivered bubbling hot with lovely slices of cooked beef and vegetables in a wonderful stock with a chili oil and pepper flavor that was perfectly balanced
This is a spicy dish without a doubt but the warning is unwarranted as it allows the great flavors to come through and when combined with the generous portion of rice served it is a perfect meal
I'll give this Good Egg 3 stars for standard breakfast food
The only thing that would have made this dish better would have been an ice-cold beer
The strips of chicken breast had a great smoky flavor and were so tender you could cut them with a fork
The pork belly pastrami was awesome even though my friends complained the appetizer dish was too small
Overall 5 stars because I had a really good time and all the food that I tried were good
Very good food coffee and service and delightful when the weather is nice and the front doors to the street are open
Our typical order includes the soup or the equally impressive tempura shrimp apetizer which are huge and soooo tasty the cashew chicken dinner and the House Special Lo Mein which includes beef shrimp and vegetables with wonderful noodles
The food is pretty good but not up to the ambiance or service
The menu is extensive and heavy on the seafood which is awesome since it is delicious
The filet mignon oscar was good but a little light on the crab meat that is on top of the steak
Food arived quick my burger while tasty wasn't worth 11 bucks I had the blu burger which is the angus half pounder with bacon and grilled onions and cheese
The atmosphere is always awesome the Bellini's are fabulous must have drinks and the food is wonderful
and if your a pasta lover try the big rig with angel hair and chicken its a spicy alfredo sauce dish of yummy goodness that just makes me happy every time I eat it
On the first trip I tried the BBQ chicken and the crunchy chicken both very good
Love the variety and quality of food offered here
Everything is good but I love all the lentil dishes the cauliflower floret crunch and the Ethiopian coffee with Orange coffee cake is AMAZING
My wife and I shared some crispy egg rolls as our appetizer for our main course she got the chicken fried rice and I got the shaken beef
I can't believe how tender the beef was and the onions to black pepper ratio was amazing
Do get a beverege as the food can be very hot if you like that way-AND I DO
But what I found in a restaurant where the food is good the help is friendly and it definitely has a personality
First the food is good  I have eaten there twice with a friend and both times our food was cooked to our specifications was tasty and was served quickly
The food is well portioned and the coffee was pretty darn good
There's nothing better than good pizza and Z sure does deliver
-Takeaway Cool for a good beer afterwork if you want a great brewery with BOMB food go to Four Peaks or San Tan
Fresh crisp corn tortillas doubled around wonderfully seasoned meats topped with cilantro red onions and salsa
I never thought I would prefer IHOP but the food is hot and the service is better
What is white and black that sits on a dining table which adds flavor to the food
They could've brought out the flavor of the fish if it was seasoned before it was battered
If you're a Bianco fan I'd say give it a go - maybe you'll get a better table a less awkward server and food worth going back for; it just didn't happen on our visit
We have delicious food and you must WORK to get it
The service was as good as usual and we got good food at good prices
Z Tejas has some amazing food and drink options to suit any palate
From apps try their tableside guacamole or chili pork verde to steaks and seafood grilled miso salmon is amazing to specialties santa fe smoked chicken enchiladas mmmmmmmm
Who wants to give their money to a corporation for mediocre food when you can give it to someone's Nana and Pop for a delicious tastes-like-homemade meal of much higher quality
If you can handle a little spice I recommend the STST roll shrimp tempura spicy tuna
The deli has a good selection of meats and cheeses sliced to order and the service in the deli was very friendly Christine
the food is asian-fusion  i usually hate when restaurants throw fusion into any description it's such an overused trendy word but i don't mind because it's so good and during happy hour their tasty and elegantly served creations are so affordable
The calzones and pizza rolls are enormous and full of warm goodness
With girls that cute and pizza that good Otto better watch out
We had for entree the fish and chips and although the batter was quite good the fish didn't have a lot of flavor we had to add a bit of lime to improve it
and let me tell you it is a FULL FIVE STARS for service quality of food fare location environment inside and out
He then had the chicken salad sandwich which he said was very good
chicken was really good but i have tasted it before nothing special
but anyways the staff is great and friendly the food is OK nothing special but the price is AMAZING if you are looking for good food for cheap this would be for you because for 5 adults and two children it only came up to $40 and that is really good
I finally made it to Pizzeria Bianco last weekend and it was pretty much what I was expecting lots of hype over pizza that is fairly good but definitely not the best pizza in the country
Overall like I said before good pizza but definitely not the best in the country
They don't take reservations anymore and they don't do takeout although I did order a pizza to go and with there always being a huge wait I think he's got a good business going where you eat and drink while waiting at his other place next store Bar Bianco
While I enjoyed the food I've been there now and done that and probably don't really need to go back any time soon
Their gluten-free pizza crust is very good
They sell some quality dog food at decent prices
The first 4 times I came here the food was amazing
When the chicken Parmesan came out it looked good but that was not the case
It's completely worth supporting this place - if you've read my other revues you know I am a fan of supporting local food and this place does a good job of providing that
Usually their coffee is yummy their pastries are always delicious a man who I believe was the owner was very nice and the tunisian salad chicken added was mouth watering and that's a salad
I did not try the dessert but someone at our table did order a chocolate type of dessert it looked pretty but definitely NOT worth it
Great location very good food excellent service and a upbeat atmosphere
Foie Gras Duo with Roasted Bing Cherries and Almond Streusel  While I generally eschew the restaurant week menu it was the non-RW appetizer that would prove to be the biggest failure of the meal and perhaps the biggest food failure I've had since moving to the valley - simply stated this was a piece of foie that should have never made it to the kitchen let alone to the table
Moving on to the second half of the duo a creamy terrine beneath cherry gel was presented and paired with buttery brioche it was nearly good enough to save the plate - but not quite particularly as Christina's response to our complaint was simply taking the dish off of our bill rather than suggesting the chef take a second try with a better piece of foie gras and more attention to detail
Whole Fried Chicken for Two with Truffled Mac & Cheese  Yes it is $58 for chicken but compared to the $200 Bresse at Savoy or the $78 version at The Nomad I guess you could call this brined battered and duck fat fried version a bargain if it was nearly as good as the others
Featuring a plump hen with breading so dainty that it approximated the thickness of skin the bird was carved tableside and laid on a bed of truffled macaroni and cheese plus baby carrots before being topped with crispy onion rings and with each of the accoutrements quite delicious none were as good as the chicken itself - dense moist full of flavor and complimented by rather than being overwhelmed by the seasoned breading
Bite for bite the most delicious and complicated of the evening's three desserts this was just another exam  how Chef Mina understands the powerful effect of American comfort food
The pasty the signature dish is pretty much a gourmet Hot Pocket which is made from scratch
The food and drinks are good but not worth the trouble of our tag-team effort
We ordered our food and it didn't take long before it was delivered to our table - I got the all american burger with garlic rosemary fries - pretty good stuff
Sorry to be so critical but I like it to be clean where I eat - good food and drinks - I'll go back next time I'm in the neighborhood
There's no signs of Ikea or strappy sandals around only flip flops good food & tastey drinks
The only thing I've had is appetizers and there was this cream cheese and chicken dip served with a huge bowl of tortilla chips for 5 bucks that is to die for
The dinner rolls are good but the banana bread was incredible
They have a great selection of wine $5 on HH the service is always great and the food is tasty
They do a great job with fish and wonderful grilled veggies and aromatic sides
I found Barro's and got the XL Pizza with 1/2 sausage and 1/2 tomatoes and 2 Doz wings Honey Hot
THEN came the DELIGHT~ the pizza was delicious
Honey yes - but not actually sweet since the Hot part of it gave me this phenomenally enjoyable kick in the pants after I swallowed each meaty juicy bite
Me and my friend shared two appetizers the fish tacos and the quesadilla and an order of onion rings and were happily stuffed and it only cost us $10 each
The food arrived right on the plate - no injera to soak up the saucy goodness
But while the presentation didn't seem all that authentic the food was delicious
The food is amazing and I'll definitely be back but man I have to ding them a star for giving me a fork
It had this delicious onion jam type stuff with some crackers cashews some meat of sorts and a really good cheese with dill on it
The sauce on the waffles was good it was a honey butter or something and the chicken was moist but together it was a disappointment
This was very good I loved the earthy flavor that the basil brought to the dessert and the strawberries were flavorful and tasted fresh
We had the shrimp spring rolls minus the pork and they were very good -- comparable with other pho joints in the Valley
Really really good food that we are still talking about a day later
We have never once had a bad experience here and the food is always amazing
The service is always very quick and the pizza tastes amazingly fresh
For food we ordered the edamame for our appetizer and the Veggie Pesto Pizza for dinner
Extremely good value here - great menu I had the Smart Chicken which was out of this world yummy
The Smart Chicken had a wonderful smokiness that permeated with a sweet corn risotto below smoked onion & shitake mushroom hash & truffle oil
The Chef is apparently from the renowned Cowboy Ciao but I have to say that the food quality and inventiveness here to me surpass Ciao as I always found Ciao trying too hard for the Southwesty experience which to me felt contrived with too much schtick
This is a foodies paradise and I suggest you get here soon before it becomes the hot ticket that it is surely destined to be
We were iffy about trying seafood in the desert but it turned out to be very good
I think this place takes advantage of people nothing special and not worth the money for the poor quality of food
They offer an array of high quality pet food and even refrigerators full of raw food
Great evening of good food and unique margaritas
Meat is moist and everything has good flavor
Think of it as a pizza joint touched by the hippie spirit with a giant mushroom mascot and colorful music-inspired artwork covering the walls -- good vibes all around to complement the vegan-friendly menu
Despite not being completely thrilled with the food I ordered there were lots of drool-worthy items on the extensive menu that I'll be trying out soon
I'm not really sure I get the whole Mexican-Sandwich Fusion concept but I thought the food was pretty good nonetheless
they tasted great lots of cheese and chicken and were especially good with a little guac smeared on top
The bill was something less than $20 and we easily found a booth hankered down and sipped on delicious tea while we waited for our food
The food was great-eggs perfectly done pancakes delicious albeit a little more dense than I am used to with ricotta cakes but really good
Admittedly I have limited experience with New Mexican food but usually I find the meat to be over-seasoned and the chili to be too hot for my taste
Both the beef and the chicken were flavorful but not overly seasoned
I actually said to someone after lunch coming here makes me angry to have grown up eating white bread and hotdish
Above all I don't think the quality of the food justified the price
I was looking for a place to grab some good food and a couple beers before a concert so I checked out Yelp and it did not lead me astray
Most importantly their food was excellent
I'll have to save that one under Knowing about good food - FAIL
Pros - Nice rooms super friendly staff except the man in the gift shop who was strange and kind of rude food was excellent in the restaurant Starbucks onsite and of course the outdoor hot tubs
My daughter ordered the chicken tenders which were delicious we always share a bite just to compare
Companion had good comments about the Lobster Bisque especially the fact that there was more than one piece of lobster in the dish
Companion had the Delmonico Steak rib steak for those not in the know and usually considered one of the most flavorful cuts of beef served medium rare
I found the food to be quite tasty and much of it spicy which I like
The variety of beer on tap the good appetizers the young lady offering free samples of cheese pizza and
The pizzas were good but not the best in the universe as had been described
The everything pizza with a thin crust was good
The chicago-style deep dish with sausage and pepperoni was good--but it was not anywhere near the caliber of a Giordano's or a Chicago Fire Pizza Folsom CA
Our food comes out cold and I asked for extra ranch for the wings
The wings are good my kids love the mozzarella sticks and pizza
I have only had the dishes with clams or shrimp but all were equally excellent
The meat was well cooked vegetables were fresh and there was a good variety
Conclusion If you want amazing Korean food and friendly customer service please just go to Chodang
Food quality is the same as the other locations and bears little resemblance to authentic Chicago pizza and Italian fare
The food is a little greasy mostly cooked in butter or animal fats so it's best to have a hot cup of tea after the meal to break up the fat
I really wanted Chicken & Waffles for breakfast and the Clarendon Hotel I was staying at used to have this item on their menu
Since I had the craving for Chicken & Waffles the nice staff at the hotel recommended Lolo's Chicken & Waffles
I was not disappointed the food was amazing the service was attentive and friendly
So I recently ordered delivery of which I found they do not deliver south of Curry so Score 1 since my friend lives at Miller and McKellips the invisible border of Scottsdale/Tempe menu items are moderately priced and the third best thing about LCP Little Chicago Pizza is the food it's pretty good
Salads Cobb Salad was huge covered in delicious meat and vegetables and ended up being two meals
I will say though that most Sonic food makes me feel super sick afterwards a small price I am willing to pay for such culinary deliciousness though this bought didn't make me feel all sorts of yuck afterward
However we sat at the bar and thoroughly enjoyed the bartender and his suggestions and knowledge about the food the good margaritas and the live entertainment - a solo guitar player last night
We ordered the roasted jalapeno rellenos appetizer great the pollo fundido good but the chicken was a little dry the lamb barbacoa very good the plato burro with pork and fundido great and the chocolate tamale for desert very good
They also have good cinnamon rolls and muffins
The food was very good - standout courses being a grilled white asparagus wrapped in prosciutto and a very good spinach dip with strong hints of truffle
The food was good the service was okay but the experience was slightly hurt by the silverwear and glass problem
They have stiff competition but if their deli sandwich is as good as the Italian Beef I know Mama's will win by a mile
Yes it is a chain but in my experience it is predictably good Mexican food
Gotta tell you I'm not amazingly impressed with the food
Anywho I went to Moira last night with some expectations mainly a place for good sushi to satisfy my sushi craving this week enjoy a martini or two and to have an amazing experience well amazing has only happened once and that was FEZ
The hamachi sashimi was good but who serves sashimi without wasabi and sushi without wasabi and ginger
I think the first time I must have really been a good day for them--or perhaps it was the 2 drinks I had This time we had a gluten free pizza and a salad
Hard to find and especially hard to find a GOOD GF pizza
The only good part of the meal was the chicken on the salad
Its a Bosian place and I am told the food is very good
He was attentive stopped by to fill our drinks often checked to make sure our food was good brought things out all at the same time and was pleasant to deal with
We started with the cheese plate and it was as before good although probably could use some more bread with it as there are a ton of meats and cheeses and 4 small pieces of bread
Bolero's is in a beautiful location and now we can say the service & food are worth a visit
Awesome spot for good reasonable and tasty sushi
The dessert was a little large but very delicious
The pizza was good though there were many spots the cheese didn't cover
I decided on the Blackened Salmon Sandwich per the waiters recommendation and the fact that he told me that they fly in fresh seafood daily
see pics Even though I don't eat red meat I could see how juicy and flavorful her burger was
A little pricey I still don't mind because of the meat quality
My dessert was good it was like a dessert playground
The pasta was also not super impressive just nice good quality food
The place caters to families the food is always good they have a full bar and this one also has an acceptable tap beer selection
The only reason I went here is because Charles Barkley recommended it and if CB knows anything it's unhealthy food
As a downtowner there are far too many amazing pizza joints to choose from for me to even consider wasting my money at Humble Pie ever again
FOOD As for appetizers they were out of the teppanyaki green beans we wanted to try
The Rest of the StoryThe burgers were not juicy as advertised and therefore not as flavorful as some other fast food franchise hamburgers
Nothing to amazing on the menu the food is good overall but nothing I can remember really stood out
There aren't a lot of vegan dessert choices around the valley and this is a good one
It was okay but not worth the price of the food and atmosphere
They have a system where you order at the counter and pay there and your food is brought to whatever table you're sitting at which is good for me because I hate when servers ask me every five minutes if my food tastes okay or if I want a refill
The menu is huge the TV's are on with sports action the drinks were cold service is adequate and the food is too
It was a pepperoni pizza and most of the toppings  were slid off - but it was good
As for the food the wine the event and the company - excellent all the way around
I can't rave about the food but I can tell you it's consistently good but not great
I thought the food was remarkable too - especially the scrambled eggs which were perfectly done little bit soft and the meatball was hint of wonderful cheese in it - Parmigiano-Reggiano or something similar
In past visits we've also had the meatballs the rancher sandwich and some of the pizzas which were all excellent
It's a good restaurant with great food if you like interesting sometimes spicy different food well made
The menu is varied and the variety goes from Afghan food to Indian / Pakistani food to good old American grub
thin but not too thin slices of tender pieces of meat with good cole slaw and dressing
The corned beef wasn't as good though; too dry for my liking
I enjoyed the ma-po the most out of those three dishes - it had a thick and flavorful sauce that had me wanting more
the food was good and i liked the variety
The chicken was extremely moist and tender with a great flavor to it
My company has hosted the annual Christmas luncheon at Georges two years in a row now and there is a good reason why The food is ALWAYS spot on and the service is always above and beyond
The drinks were good Southern Peach gets a thumbs up from me and like everyone said the fish and chips are YUMMO
I'm not really sure what would make PJ a 5-star for me other than all around improvement on the flavor of the food
I think they try too hard to make different and unique rolls that it ruins the flavor of it
There was a good variety of dishes available for the low price of $5
I ordered the Sesame Chicken and it tasted good except
The staff is friendly service was fast and the food was piping hot
I'm giving 4 stars because the food was delicious and priced very well
I recommend Moto Happy Hour to friends all the time for sushi on a budget - the California Spicy Tuna and Spicy Yellowtail rolls are all half-price and you can grab a 20oz beer for $3
So then Chef Brian stops by our table asks us about our food we explain how thankful we are to have found such a spot and the food is yummy good great portions and he invites us to Mabel's on Main-rewrite he drives us to to Mabel's on Main
The atmosphere is always great the service is generally quick and the food is amazing
Other than that the Las Vegas Roll and the Tootsy Maki are both absolutely delicious
Overall good service food atmosphere and price
Yellowtail taste good but the sushi looking was not that appetizingOysters were way too big and over pricedService was decent and attentive
This is my second visit to Yen Sushi and I was impressed
I was stuffed by the 3rd roll but very carefully made it through the delicious ice cream
Very reasonable for all that we ate and the excellent quality and care that was put into our dishes
The food was wonderful I had a 41 wife was like a 38 or something and son got a 14
prices were good but the food was outstanding
We ordered Vietnamese Eggs Rolls and a Thai Lettuce wraps which is very good
The husband tried the tonkotsu ramen with beef which he enjoyed
Though my food experience was not the best my husband enjoyed his and I'd like to  come back if we're ever on that side of town again to try the tonkotsu or the udon
The pig was good big and hearty lots of food here and the side dish was really good too probably don't wanna know they origin of the seafood in the jambalaya but it tasted fresh
All in all the food was made with quality ingredients and was good albeit a bit plain
perfectly cooked perfectly seasoned 6th dessert - one was a ved velvet whoopie pie the other was a carrot style cakeEach course showed up without us placing a single order - just what the chef sent out - and each was wonderful
Mine was decent though I ordered a cheese enchilada and they gave me chicken and never came back to ask how our food was  BUT I also ordered a green corn tamale AND a beef taco Leave me alone I worked all day and was hungry as all hell Those were both way super tasty
In summary Ocean Club has a great atmosphere amazing food and outstanding service
very tasty Catfish Oscar and a twist on the normal Garden Salad
Oh and yeah the pizza was really good too
I would prefer to pay a few bucks more to get a fine-crafted  quality dish in smaller portions
Overall the food was good but not worth the expensive prices and inability to be special
The two pasta dishes had no real sauce or flavor and the prices are ridiculous
I recommend against ordering the Las Vegas roll - it has way too much cream cheese and sauce on it
Other than that go to Benihana for a quick sushi dinner that is decent quality and price for sushi but no atmosphere - don't say i didn't warn you
The burgers are really good the fish and chips are darn good for the valley and so are their soups
Whether I'm hungry for a salad or a plate of fresh wings to accompany my craft beer the food is really good
Of course they have typical bar food or comfort food as I call it but the quality and taste surpass what I've had elsewhere
You can get a burger and fries or a gyro with hand-carved meat---and dozens of other delicious options
If it is the goal of TDM to produce the most bland tasting Mexican food on the planet they are doing a pretty good job
i'm really glad i didn't marvel too long at the lovely 90 degree angles of my lunch because that pizza is ridiculously tasty
I love how the building is in retro condition the music is fabulous drinks are tasty and potent and the pizzas are really good
the pizza is really good light fresh flavorful3
The menu needs improvement and the food is inconsistent and overpriced considering the generally low quality of it
I didn't think the food was amazingly special worth a long drive but it was a decent romantic place with yes plenty of Asians and downtowners visiting
Our server was extremely friendly  not sure if it was the Sekong By Night Nazi And the food was fresh and very tasty
We had the Spring Rolls as appetizer and boy those are yummy
Both dishes again were fresh and very tasty
Not only is it not decent Japanese food it's just not good period
The menu is tiny it's diner food but the food quality is very very high
I ordered the sample platter and it was filled with things I didn't know and I was not pleased especially when my friend's pizza looked so good
The chicken was cooked perfect pita was soft and delicious and the salad was exactly what I had been craving with it's balance of dressing feta cheese onions and Greek olives
I really liked that idea since it gave me a good idea of their flavors and their heat since they said some dishes were spicy
The jerk chicken had great flavor I added their hot sauce to it which made it even better -- it's by the soda machine and the jerk chicken fried rice wasn't skimping on the chicken
*The food is very delicious and the women that work here are uncontrollably adorable always
I imagine if I were from the East Coast or like Idaho or something I really would write my friends and family regularly to brag about the amazing Mexican food in AZ just sayin'
The quality of the food is not on par with Matts Big Breakfast but the preparation is and everything fits well together
I've had their rice noodle dishes and those are filling and tasty if not particularly gourmet
On the flip side the food is awesome portions are good size atmosphere is nice it is a night place but good during the day also
The food is different than it used to be it was good & certain things were special including fresh papaya & the broiled chicken
The food is consistently good not great but not mediocre
The turkey club sandwich is excellent so is the chicken salad sandwich
The meat is great quality the tomatoes are sliced thin the staff is friendly and it may not specifically be on the menu anylonger but you can get pepperoni on your cheesesteak if you so desire and no one is going to make faces at you for asking
Turkish Kitchen is one of my top 3 favorite restaurants in the East Valley ; They serve genuine Turkish food - and I LOVE Turkish food ; When you walk in they give you still oven-hot pita/naan bread with delicious dipping sauce
I always order chicken kebap dinner and Turkish KItchen special appetizer which I use as a second delicious dipping sauce with the refillable bread
I recommend this place to everyone you don't have to be adventurous to try it - Turkish food is safe meaning healthy and delicious
Appetizer fish tacos were fresh clean and light
ther food quality is good service is good and all around good place with their new pricing and menu options
2 perfectly good pieces of fish were ruined
The crust was really good quality but I was somehow underwhelmed with the pizzas as a whole especially with all the hype surrounding this place
He made an excellent wine recommendation and helped us choose the apps for our seafood tower
He made great recommendations and basically was able to create this dish as we wanted it
Wine and food aside I can usually overlook shotty service if the atmosphere and food is good enough
Ive been here twice already and the food pricing and portions are tasty bargain and large
The orange chicken was good and the breading wasn't too crispy which is a plus
I thought all beef broccoli was the same but this meat was so flavorful and seasoned amazingly
I recommend trying both the vegan combo and the pita sandwich with chicken or falafel
We sat at the sushi bar and had the following- yellowfin tuna-shrimp -California roll-New Zealand roll-sake SangriaOverall it was a fun and tasty experience
I'm not saying it's authentic sushi I honestly have no idea but it sure was good and fresh
However I was QUITE impressed with the veggie pizza
I have a closer one in Gilbert & am hoping the food is consistently good across all their locations
The BJ does a real nice job with sausage gravy and as you know there isn't any food that gravy can't improveThe Beautiful Carin had an egg white vegetarian omelet that she really enjoyed and we split a side of ham ham is a vegetable right
Servers and hosts everywhere ready to suit any needs whether it's refreshing your wine glass chasing down a particular meat for you or preparing an amazing desert to surprise you for your anniversary thanks again Thomas these guys do it all
The food is always so good and even when I ask the kitchen for the naked cheeseburger they make it pretty
I think the best part of his dish was the delicious crisp peas
But to me going to Gil's for New Mexican food is akin to going to Idaho for good Mexican food
The pizzas were slightly burned at the edges but the burn actually enhanced the flavor of the mixture of vegetables on the pizza
The food is always very fresh and delicious
And by the time we're out of there it costs no more than eating in the food court but the experience and quality of the food are miles beyond
likegood meat and potatoes food like bangers and mash and englsih beers on tap like bass and such
Decided to give the much-raved about Sushi on Shea a shot
Our food was good I had the cheese ravioli the kids had some spaghetti and my husband had the chicken Marsala
The food was good enough to not lose any stars because of it
The taste in the egg roll has some flavor i dont know what it was but it was brownish inside like some kind of sauce was mixed in the filling
so on the one hand i would go back there in a heartbeat quick service good food and for the most part decent prices kate would list it on a top ten places to avoid list
As a part-Chinese who grew up near a big Chinatown I wanted a restaurant that had authentic good food like I could find at home
My favorites are the Mongolian beef and the Beef with snow peas but I've tried many of their other dishes and all of them were just as good
I'd choose good food over the frills any day
I'll preface this by saying that this review is based solely on the food and not the ambiance or service as we ordered take-out but based on the poor quality awful food that we had I wouldn't care to venture back to find out if they've made any improvements
I go to more upscale restaurants for a nice relaxed meal with delicious food and that is exactly what we got
The rolls are on point along with the appetizers
This isn't like hot sauce over a dish this is the real deal
The sushi here is kinda eh but it fills you up and chances are that if you're eating there you're not looking for top quality sushi
The appetizer sampler is on par for bar food and a pretty good deal for the price
At the time we were there they were photographing a table set with desserts
Imagine my surprise when we were asked if we'd like to have the desserts that had just been photographed courtesy of Aiello's
The food is amazing very fresh and worth the wait
The wedge salad was delicious the pizza also delicious
The pizza is always warm delicious and most importantly safe
Phoenix isn't known for good sushi but still
As far as food goes it was actually pretty good
The food here basically consists of burgers hot dogs fries and soda
We had the Vietnamese Spring Rolls for appetizers
My guess is though that like most patrons of this place they've never experienced Vietnamese food before or at least quality Vietnamese food
My usual problem with tapa's places - the cost adds up quick as you order dishes and it rarely feels like its worth the cost
Walk towards the exit there are meats overthere and behind me were hotplates with bacon potatoes blintzes and sausage links
The Kabobs were a selection of meat shrimp and veggies one of the veggies I had no idea what it was although good I wasn't thrilled with the dipping sauces though
The server was good and told us that the food was known more for flavor than for tongue burning spice
The food is fairly priced and is very good
The saag ghosht was superb just really an excellent lamb dish
and please remember not an excuse-just a fact English are not known for their delicious food they in fact have the most unlusted after cuisine
I would have rather had Totino's pizza rolls than the nasty appetizer combo we shared
-Manila Clams Linguine a tad on the buttery side but I didn't mind-Spinach Ricotta Ravioli-Veal Parisienne I'm not usually a veal person but I enjoyed this breaded preparation-Grilled Asparagus you can never eat enough veggies-Potato-Hazelnut Truffle SouffleAnd finally we shared a dessert plate but I think I ate the majority of the lemon dessert that was served with fresh strawberries
The cocktails are delicious and the food is quite tasty
Not the most amazing food I've had but it's good and the ambiance adds to the experience
We had like some slimy lunch meat limoncello two stale hot dog buns and a 4 year old box of macadamia nuts we got on vacation while in Hawaii
I've had pizza in Italy Rome Tuscany Umbria etc and love it there; I'm always disappointed by the pizza here in the US and have only found a few places in the entire country that do what I consider to be a good crust; 'Sauce' manage to get it right
The burrito had moist flavorful chunks of chicken that tasted incredible
I think of this place as having good but not exciting or overly spectacular food
I always have enough food leftover for a good filling lunch and sometimes dinner the following day
If you haven't been to Totts I would highly recommend the following dishes
I want my food to taste good and be reasonably priced and if it just so happens that the food also tastes exactly like your great aunt Carmelito made lo those many years ago in Oaxaca the more's the better
When this sort of thing happens to me I inevitably demand that the food be so delicious that it overshadows everything else
The food is fantastic and the beer list is suprisingly delicious as well with breweries such as Dogfish Head
The Jerk Chicken had no flavor no heat at all and if you had Jerk Chicken you know it should be spicy
The quality of the food here is definitely not on par with the other locations I have been to
The Buffalo Chicken sandwich I had was very good
When presented at the table you and your guests will be blown away at the quality of the seafood and rightly so as it is brought in fresh daily
Other then that the food did not have much flavor
Good for people who don't like spicy foods
Tried Red Curry Chicken Hot and it was no joke
since i had photo evidence it existed thanks to all the yelpers who already know about this place i ordered the beef with chinese broccoli and the beef chow fun with gravy
let me say it was real tough driving all the way back to north phoenix with all that food making my car's insides smell all delicious
the noodles were excellent the beef cooked expertly and the sauteed baby bok choi also delicious
even those these two dishes are similar they both had distinct flavors that made me very happy
and why aren't there any amazingly great chinese food places in north phoenix
I searched hi and lo and had only been able to make good on the very lo with regards to good Chinese food in the Valley
Having passed my non doughy and not yellow test  yup people some places give you frozen dumplings versus fresh and yellow Spanish Rice in a Chinese restaurant I was able to look into the quality of their other food items
They have a signature flavor to their dishes
Brought my friend who have not had good Indian food there
However all in all this is a real nice place for some tasty food
They are a great addition to the Scottsdale scene chill good beer great food and great bartenders
The flavor additions to each food enhanced rather than detracted [from] the inherent flavor of the food
Food BreakdownCeviche Platter Absolutely delicious
The people that I invited that had never been to AB before were expecting more of a variety in brunch items since I'd told them that they had great brunch but their concerns were quelled with a few bloody Marys and some good if not diverse food
We went on to have an amazing meal; great food that I was impressed by
We left confused; having enjoyed the food but been treated terribly by her
They had a good selection of ice cream desserts and the staff was very friendly
Apparently it changes regularly and top quality cured meats and cheeses are selected by Chef Peter DeRuvo
Good food - at least the price and surroundings didn't have me questioning my choice of sushi in the desert
The food is always good but the service needs improvement
They have broasted  chicken that is moist crispy and tasty and I would give them 3 1/2 stars for food
I had the chicken quisadillas they were spicy and delicious
But if you think about it  her prices are pretty good for the amount of lobster you get in a roll i
Ive never been a fan of Teakwoods food but they usually have good drinks specials
And the selection was pretty good given that they could have even made do with less pizza's out there
Food is excellent and service was impeccable
I went with a party of 7 and everyone else's dishes looked very good and there were definitely no complaints from anyone
Others at our table ordered the wraps and the pizzas all of which were excellent
One of the Best Ribs  A Must try for any BBQ Fans  This location will offer the same quality food the original  Phoenix location started for stacy as the restaurant opens its second location
The food is ridiculously unhealthy but SO GOOD
chicken egg sprouts and other good-tasting things
I love Thai food and this place has the goods they even have different levels of how hot with spice your entree can be served
The barbecue chicken was flavorless and oddly textured
I am sad it's such a far drive from home the prices and quality of food are phenomenal
We stayed we ordered Hot Thai Soup House chicken House seafood lemonade soda and Thai tea with cream
The rice was a very small portion the seafood was inedible because the garlic sauce was like mucus and tasted off not worth $16 for sure
The service was excellent the food was excellent and I loved the cozy feel
as a bonus the food is really good too
The wood oven imparted a wonderful richness to the already rich dishes we ordered
The chef made great wine recommendations to accompany our dishes
I generally avoid cold roast beef sandwiches because the meat is either way to rare and grosses me out or way too thick fatty and chewy but the promise of blue cheese drew me in and I'm so glad
50 and opted for the roast beef and blue cheese which has delicious sweet and sour caramelized red onions and peppery arugula to elevate the flavors from packing a punch to round house kick
It's kind of a small place but the ambience is great and the food was really good
The food was average not bad but not amazing either
The drink really was the only thing that was a little high priced the pizza and appetizers were VERY reasonable- low even
I went against the owner's recommendation of the Lemon dessert and I'm glad I did
I only got to try one seafood taco from one place and it tasted good but it was definitely a skimpy taco and not worth a ticket
Good concept but the frying made the tortilla hard and chewy and the meat just didn't taste good
Our server mentioned that normally for an anniversary they will usually give a complimentary dessert but seeing as it was the early afternoon and we had just finished breakfast we were instead presented with two delicious chocolate covered strawberries on a decorated plated at the end of our meal
My friend's chicken wrap looked pretty good
Now comes one of the parts that I absolutely hate about eating out other than rude service or incredibly awful food-- is that the two groups that came in and got sat after us actually got their appetizers drinks and meals before we even got our appetizers
The food was really good but this restaurant hit one of my pet peeves
The food was delicious though pricey it's what we expected and the service was impeccable
A note about spicy food  As Thai restaurants go this one is on the hotter end
Though I typically order my food Thai Hot at other restaurants I typically stick to Very Hot here because it's sooo hot
Now that I've got the good stuff out of the way I thought the food was bland and overpriced
The meat was tender and juicy but had no flavor *at all*
I did enjoy the small kale salad on the side of the plate and the fresh corn tortillas were amazing but the main part of the dish was pretty boring for how much I paid for it
With that out of the way my future wife and I couldn't have enjoyed the food any more
Food so delicious you melt into your booth
i do not care about the stretchy cheese not being real thing i just want pizza with awesome flavor
The two times I have been here the food was very good
Because of the beautiful space delicious food and helpful staff I am happy to give Olive and Ivy 5 stars
The food is what you dream of having if a friend took you to a chef's house in the Italian countryside and said We're gonna eat what his family eats when they get together and cook simple fresh amazing real food
I wasn't sure if this was a trick question or not because was she considering our pizza an appetizer
I can personally testify that the Chicken Parmesan are good
The servers were very attentive the food was fresh and very good
The chicken salad was amazing -- big chunks of chicken and tasted wonderful
The service is a bit slowbut the food & prices are well worth the wait
The food isn't oh-my-gawd amazing but it's good
The steaks are consistent with just the right amount of fat and good flavors if you order them medium the ribs fall off the bone and melt in your mouth just like they should and the chicken tastes like chicken if you didn't come to a steakhouse for steak
Everyone was raving about the food  I ordered a calzone I wasn't blown away by it it was very good tho
There are actual chunks of pumpkin in the dish which add an amazing textural element
Food was original very well prepared and extremely delicious
Each time I've dined there dishes other than sushi were quite tasty however their sushi really could use some work
The food HH appetizers was okay but not transcendent
For my main dish I had the Musaman short ribs and they were sooooooooo good
The meat is well-marinated especially the carne asada and the dozen-plus salsas are each different by tasty and made to perfection
Both selections were very good - the fish had a great taste - nicely crisp on the outside tender and juicy on the inside
Good food good beer and the server was excellent
The rolls themselves were pretty good nothing spectacular but definitely worth the price keep in mind this is the happy hour menu only some of their other rolls looked more appealing but weren't on happy hour
It's edible and gets the job done but it's not very good food
I had the taco salad the chicken was wonderfully spicy but the salad could have had more variety in it
A place that has good microbrew beer and lots of good non-bar food options
I enjoyed their food because of its simple decadence--sandwiches with no-frills sauces grilled vegetables with a tangy sauce that doesn't over power and their waffle fries that make you curse Atkins until his dead oh wait he IS dead
On the contrary this Subway of Pizza is staffed by congenial and hip 20-30 somethings who are eager to please by heaping  tons of fresh and flavorful ingredients  onto your individual personalized pizza
We showed up around 830pm grabbed a table and started sampling - First we tried the butter lettuce salad with golden beets then the lollipop chicken and finally the fillet bites with horseradish sauce amazing
Good food good service good price shitty location
Unfortunately as good as it was it's still Mexican food
I received a lot more recommendation for mexican food that I am going to try
I expected the food to be way better but got the trio and the guac was tasteless had to put lots of salt on it and salsa but the queso that came with it was really good the salsa was just ok
I was shocked by the service and quality of the food in all the best ways
There's a menu left in your room at all times so you can order their food as roomservice and here are all the things I tried-The Cowboy Club Amazing variation of a club sandwich that I will have to make at home because it's probably one of the best i've ever had
-the 1/2 order Macho Taco done with the breaded fish fillet unless you can eat a horse I don't recommend doing a full order these things are huge but they are so insanely good you have to try at least one
-Scottsdalian chicken salad Massive but absolutely delicious
Cheese Stuffed Tortellini is worth every calorie and the savory veggie pizza is a veggie lovers dream come true
During lunch rush seating took place within five minutes then the food came out steaming hot and ready within twenty minutes
I enjoyed the food and overall service so YELP I recommend this place
This used to be a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant but it closed down years ago and now it is very tasty Mexican restaurant with big portions
The food was decent - we just had salads & appetizers
I've been eating greasy floppy cheese pizzas and lean-ish hot wings at #1 Brothers on Cactus and 75th Avenue for years
This place has SERIOUSLY good food even if their business accounting practices are a little shady
They have some very unique rolls that have interesting flavors
The portions are fair the prices even fairer and the food all excellent
I highly recommend the brizzas breakfast pizzas
We didn't order any food but all of the events were catered through the hotel so I'll review that too
Unfortunately no indication of any improvement in the food quality
They had a good selection of food that's step above your average bar food
Good beer good food good friends and good eye candy
We're from the south--so we love fried foods and these pickle chips are almost as good as back home
It beats pizza burgers and your usual fare for flavor and healthfulness to be sure
He really enjoyed his - particularly the butterfish and the sauce on that one
The service was good the food was hot and tasty the cocktails they have on their menu were very unique and we tried a couple as well
Topped off with the killer hot fudge or caramel it's a dessert worth craving
Lunch sushi combo was just about as good as any other sushi I have had in Phoenix
Grey Goose Martini's - $6Well's - $3Nice House Wine Options I believe $4 or $5Bartender was very pleasant and attentive recommended a pizza dish that was not even on the menu and it was absolutely fabulous for $12 and fed both of us with 2 extra slices leftover
I love love love their Chicken Walnut sandwiches they are so delicious
So the sushi was Ok the pieces were very small but somewhat tasty
I don't know how many good restaurants are out this way but it's a nice one to try if you're craving some Mediterranean food
Just the right amount of moisture to the rice flavor and tenderness of the beef
The dining room is a tad bit claustrophobic but the food is worth the minor discomfort
The Fennel Orange Salad is almost as good as the Brussel Sprout Salad at Chelsea's but hands down my favorite dish at LGO is the Padre which is no longer on the regular menu but they're still more than happy to make it for you; a pizza with arugula fig point reyes blue and prosciutto di san daniele
Sign up for their email club -you will get a coupon for a free appetizer OR sushi roll up to $10 - great deal
The food choices are unique and flavorful and the staff friendly and accommodating
Without commenting at length about the amazing vibe created by the subtle DJ spinning in the upper-deck or the stunning visual asthetics provided by the funhouse of mirrors on your way to the bathroom lol lets get to the food
The bbq sauce was great the quality of the burger was great and the sushi was pretty okay
He gave the story about how they had purchased these the night before from a great meat provider I didn't know Lee Lee Market was known for high quality meats and they had been slow cooking ever since
The chicken was flavorful and moist but the bread tasted like plain straight flour
Good cut of meat and cooked to a medium / medium well
Well after all that good food the waitress came around with dessert suggestions
You could make an argument for steaks of that quality at that price but certainly not for the dessert
Wear whatever and stroll on in you'll still be the hottest thing in there
Do the chicken stir fry with peanut dipping sauce do the Thai tea with cream watch out cause its sweet I personally love the yellow curry with carrots and potatoes and I do hot but its pretty much super spicy so careful
Very nice experience not too pricey and if your one of the those lucky people who don't work 9-5's M-F do their lunch special you get hot tea a cup of soup a lunch meal which comes with rice a fried spring roll and crunchy wontons
Full disclosure I want to give Crescent Ballroom 5 stars but feel it very presumptuous of me considering I've only been once and I didn't have any of the food although it looked delicious
At first taste the beefy grilled flavors came bursting through only to meld with the gooey Oaxacan cheese
But the food is nothing to write home about -- Los Mesquites down the street is much better -- and far too expensive for quality that is comparable to what you can get at Filiberto's at 2 AM for 1/4 the price
For dessert we split a caramel-lava cake which was delicious
Also getting any fishing/hunting licenses here is a good thing because the people here are more knowledgeable then your typical Walmart Sports department worker
But the meat and vegetables dipped in the broth was definitely enough for flavor
The presentation/dishes were very nice but the food quality just isn't there
My quick summary  Great food good prices but lacking in service
Good cheap Mexican food always sounds good to me
Italian food is always the hardest place for me to find something to eat that's actually tasty I'm gluten intolerant yikes
Whatever that sauce was it was just perfect and the fish and mussels were really fresh and flavorful
I have to say I have never used less tartar sauce before I enjoyed the batter and the fish without covering up the flavor with the tartar sauce however the cocktail sauce was great with the jumbo shrimp
The food was all tasty and there was lots to choose from
The quality of the meat was pretty good but you can get better steaks at City Hall J&G or BLT for about the same price
The food is good and breakfast comes out quickly
Impressed as most places screw up cooking such small pieces of meat
Wish I had room for an appetizer or dessert
Everything was as we ordered it and food was stove hot
To all the haters out there this is good food
The meat and the seafood were in good size and cooked well so kudos for that
Basically all of their fish is fantastic but I do have to say for such a quality place why do they have farm raised Salmon on the menu
High quality ingredients innovative idea select your own sushi affordable and easy
For dessert we had the Coffee and Donuts - crispy mini churros with some homemade coffee ice cream VERY good there was also a miniature mug with cocoa/coffee
I still hold true to my review about their Italian Beef but their Hot dogs
TRUE Chicago Vienna Beef Hotdogs with all the fixin's
I wasnt particularly looking forward to the dinner- for you see- hot pizza and hot Phoenix weather would just be too hellish for anyone to undergo- but suprisingly- the calm evening desert wind- added some 'enticement
Sushi Roku is the best kept secret for quality sushi at amazing prices
A hot bar with foods around the world featuring must-have easts such as vindaloo chicken
I prefer Medium rare to rare for high quality beef and the servers are more than willing to find you steaks that are cooked to your liking
Customer service ambiance and dessert were all pretty good earning this sweet historic gem 3 stars
I read lots of reviews that the food was excellent and the service was lacking
Excellent food just too pricy for a strip mall restaurant next to a supermarket
one week I'm in love with amazing peaches and tiny little plums like the ones I picked off the tree when I was little $30 balsamic vinegar that was worth it homemade jam yummy $6 a loaf bread as it should be for $6 a loaf nice lavender soap and eggs right out of the chickens little butt cheeks
We got there at the odd hour of 230pm but still got served with good food
I had requested crispy both sides fried noodles with chicken and vegetables only the vegetarian version is listed on the menu which was delicious
The chicken with salted fish fried rice and beef onion and pepper rice noodles with black bean sauce was also very good
The only dish that I would not recommend is the sauteed choy sum which was par-boiled too long and a bit too soft for my liking
The flavors in this dish are incredible
I asked why once and was told that the french fries keep the fish hot while you eat it
Seriously it's a subway and the food is consistent and good and all that but I was a little short on time and I don't remember the last time I've been in a Subway with only two workers during dinnertime
I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place for Italian food
Anyway their beer selection is good and the food is tasty
We also ordered their fried fish which was delicious I love whole fish
Favorite beet Oatmeal StoutFavorite appetizer Spicey Thai Hummus and beef nachos
They have a simple selection of good quality foods
Their sushi rolls are meh but their teriyaki ribs are falling off the bone finger lickin' good
The steaks the shrimp fajitas the chinese selections the artisan cheeses the pizza & pasta the fish & chips the salads the smoked salmon the soups and even the sugar free cheesecake are all very good
It was pretty pricey $70 per person for early dinner $85 for late dinner but the food was very good and the service was excellent
Definitely a recommend for an easy/quick lunch without eating fast food
We were looking for a good sushi happy hour in Phoenix and decided to try Sushi Roku - it did not disappoint
We started with the Sushi Roku vodka drink special a Kirin and a cold sake
pizza=really good perfect combo of thin& crispy with chewy
However they put focus on something I thinking pizza places have forgotten crust with FLAVOR
Wow--I got convinced by a fellow customer to try their bloody Mary with stout it was sunday after all for dessert and that was quite good
The only thing that was good were the chicken strips
I went back to a 2nd visit 2 weeks ago for a team lunch and found both the service and food were very good
Everyone in the team 6 of us like their dishes and had a good time at Kona Grill
The alfredo sauce was really good and the pizza was surprisingly good as well considering it hardly had any cheese on it
If you have never been here before then there are a few things you must know -Expect bar quality food
So now eating there dozens of times I can say the food each time is totally delicious - like criminally delicious
The food tastes so good likely because its very true to Southern BBQ cuisine is juiced with lots of that saturated fat stuff
Peanut Butter Chocolate Bacon Brittle for Dessertand Blue Cheese Bread Pudding Pork Chops main course are just two of the insanely good things I ate the Cowboy tonight
The way I test good Cajun joints is by getting my favorite dish Crawfish Etouffee and this place has it RIGHT
Not only is the pizza wonderful but well I'm a big salad person
Just grab some freshly made tortillas tortilla chips Spanish rice and some fish or shrimp ceviche and you're good to go
The gravy on the chicken fried steak didnt have any flavor and kind of the samething with the hashbrowns
Ordered a pasta dish with sausage and it was cooked well and the sauce was pretty good
The second thing I wasn't impressed w/was the beef/meatballs
Overall the food was really good and I would def go back and I do highly recommend this place to friends and family
The beers were nice a cold and well you can't be in an Irish pub and not try the Fish and Chips
I've only tried their sushi so far and it's pretty good
The rolls aren't the tightests and most of the time the rice falls off but the spicy tuna and the california rolls had good flavor
This was my first experience with raw vegan food and I must say it was very good
The food came promptly and what ensued next was sheer enjoyment of a delicious meal of food
The 2x4 jenga the gold fish races the midget bar the little women who runs it is actually a really hot little person the wheel of drinks the plunger all amazing
We were just awestruck over the flavors of these dishes the cozy environment and the amazing friendliness of the restaurant
My friend and I ordered lunch for ourselves beef pho and the beef noodle soup which was really good
Service was quick and attentive food was delicious and reasonably priced
If you are in/around Chandler and looking for some yummy Vietnamese food I would definitely recommend this place
I would recommend Liberty Market to ANYONE looking for great food and great people
First They use all organic beefy goodness and don't skimp when it comes to portions
Yellow Leek Bean Sprout Fish -- almost all sprout over leek tasty but extremely oily
Preserved salted fish is used sparingly to flavor the remaining ingredients
All around this this hole in the wall is delicious and really opened me up to some authentic Mexican food I'd never had an opportunity to try before
While this was tasty it was almost like a dessert and I preferred the corn bread without the molasses
Also all the meat is served dry so you really get the flavor of the bbq without the crutch of a sea of sauce
The food is great and very flavorful and the couple of times I've been here everything I've had has been good
The chips and salsa that they serve might be too spicy for some people but in my experience they're more spicy than most of the dishes so don't worry if you think they're too hot
The margarita was ok and the food was good but nothing to write home about
For this visit I tried their dynamite scallop roll and salmon roll with asparagus inside and it was so delicious makes me craving for more
We left the so called Ice Cream shop/Goodwill disappointed and a little angry that we had spent so much over $100 on food and ice cream for the family
The food was also pretty good we had wings burgers nachos and chili
All of it was pretty good better than typical bar food
The hubby and  I   tried  pork chicken and beef tacos which were all fresh and tasty
I would definitely definitely DEFINITELY recommend this food for take out catering and a really cozy quick lunch but it's not a place for a leisurely relaxing meal
Chase's Diner looks good from the outside but once you are inside the food tells a different tale
Now I'm not one of those sodium nuts who salt their food before they have even tasted it but the food here is pretty much without flavor and I thought it was pretty much impossible to mess up breakfast
You know the food will be good when you first bite into the salad and the salad is outstanding
The appetizers we ordered were chicken meatballs and the grilled cheese sandwich
The grilled chicken or ham breakfast burrito are fantastic and worth getting at any time of the day - which they are open for you
Their pulled chicked brisket ribs and beef ribs are delicious and came with 3 sides
The food is average to less than average quality
They were good but the chicken was a bit dry
Others said the seafood enchiladas were delicious but I didn't taste them
They do like to highlight their lamb dishes and say that they are on special but they are pretty much always being served and they are all crazy good
Pizzas are good size & enough for two if you're not starving
I was very excited to try this place - a good sushi place downtown would have been great
Let them recommend their favorite dishes to you
Try an appetizer maybe whatever is on special; Edamame is great of you are new to this kind of food
The 360 degree mister was a nice touch and quite refreshing on a hot day but I don't know if I would go as far as agreeing with our hostess that the patio is climate controlledFirst up from the Haus a stone hearth pretzel I have been drooling over on Facebook for the past week
Juicy flavorful and possessed of the perfect meaty texture the traditional spicy brat is a winner
Let me get this straight Curry thinks it's a good idea to combine a 1/4lb pork sausage patty with a 1/4lb ground beef patty topped with caramelized onions bound with something called Hush Hush sauce
I've eaten breakfast here a few times and always thought the food and service were good
Pro'sPizza had a great bubbly crustIngredients were freshService was goodGreat wine selection tons of affordable botles Con'sThe menu has no pizza suggestions margarita meat lover whatever just cheese and then you choose your toppings and pay for each
However our order of the mixed seafood ceviche and the carne asada quesadilla were wonderful
Our friends said their food was excellent but the service was slow and in an almost dead restaurant that is unacceptable
Now I work near downtown Chandler and now I get the opportunity to return and I must say the quality of food is still there and very good
Fresh local ingredients good food and some nice cocktails
Smokey grilled ribeye with a slightly spicy salsa and two over easy eggs on a delicious griddled telera roll
The food was good as far as overly-oily typical Indian fare goes
Oh my goodness there must have been equal parts oil and vegetables in the cauliflower dish
**So it was a solid 3-star experience given that it met my expectations of very oily very tasty average Indian food
this bacon however was meaty and flavorful and I made sure none was left behind
Their cheese pizza was pretty good - the fresh basil is a nice touch
While the food was tasty I thought the prices were a titch high - especially since you're not getting regular table service
The flavor was perfect - the meat flavor comes through the not too sweet not too tart smoky sauce
Hubs thoroughly enjoyed his pork and beef as well
They had given us the pizza for freeso  I decided to give them a second shot
But I thought it was still quite tasty and was happy knowing that I could enjoy a healthy version of one of my favorite Indian dishes
Being originally from New Orleans I noticed a NOLA flavor with Monday Red Beans and Rice/Wednesday Gumbo and several Cajun-style dishes
but some of the vegan foods are super tasty not to mention good for you
you might be surprised how good vegan food can be
This tavern has pretty good bar grub and hangover food with the novelty of throwing your peanut shells on the floor
The pizzas are great and the cheesecakes which change often are oh so worth the bloated ate way too much feeling afterwards
Their fries taste like they are cooked in beef fat - they are so good I couldn't stop eating mine and any that were left over by anyone else
The filet was not good meat and the lobster was dry
For that kinda money I expect good service and good food
Anyone that thinks this place has good sushi has never really experienced what good sushi is like
We ordered chicken quesadilla & crab cake appetizer
A lunch time menu had a good selection of food for about $4
The egg roll was good as was the sweet and sour sauce
The service is really what makes the experience a 5-star along with the amazing food
the mozerella sticks came out warm on the outside cold in the middle when we very nicely told the server this he looked at us like we were lying and if we weren't pulling his leg seemed confused as to what he was supposed to do about it and the sliders were the driest meat and oldest buns ever
We had the Carmel Chicken which was pretty amazing for a quick Asian place
Chang's but this is the same quality food for half the price
They also carry a lot of high quality fun doggy toys collars and foods in the front at fair prices but they never mention or push any of these things on you
The food was good but nothing extra special
To my amazement he recommended another restaurant down the street for them to go to where they might like the food better
When it arrived the beef was cold and I only ate two bites as a result
This wasn't Oh I don't feel so good food poisoning
Both my Husband and I ordered a soup for appetizer he liked his minestrone I ordered the other choice described as egg drop chicken soup with spinach and parmigana
The pesto sauce was good the gnocchi were a little doughy under cooked I got the two Huge Famous Meatballs and Spaghetti
The meatballs were tasteless Joe's Mom's recipe but obviously she was not a good cook these did not taste like my Mamma used to cook
I had heard of this delicious pork dish from watching travel shows and was excited to see they sold it here
The meat was very tender and full of flavor And fat
all I could taste was vinegar and citrus no fish flavor came though
Also tried the Fideua' which was salty drippy and fishy not good at all
It has been at least a year or so since I have had a meatball sub but theirs looked SO good
While the food was good it lacked in flavor
I mean at least filet mignon quality meat
Cheaper and tasty alternatives Two Hippies Pizza Shack and America's Taco Shop both not too far away
The slices were good size but smaller than typical New York pizza with a thicker and softer crust
I went in search of spices a must for any good Pizza joint and found only red pepper and parmesan
Terry's fries were wonderful and the chili was surprisingly spot on for the real meat deal
While I found the chicken to be overly salty something Terry mentioned to me before ordering the cucumber dipping sauce was good enough to drink
This is a finger-lickin' tasty dish which you have to eat with your fingers unless you have amazing chopstick skills
This is by far the spiciest and most flavorful dish I've had here so far
Once again all the meat was fresh hot & tasted great
Overall I thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance the food and not having to valet the car on Central Avenue
My 12 year old daughter said that the food tastes like the air smells when you go camping she was referring to that delicious smokey flavor
People who were seated after I was are being served tasty looking pizzas and I got nothin'
I went in on a whim out shopping saw sign & fish sounded good
The fish tacos were a great choice they were delicious & even though I was really hungry I couldn't finish them
00 = This was very good I have never in my life ever ever ever ordered fish tacos since I hate fish
If that doesn't tell you how good the food is I don't know what will
First up we get a very tasty soup and egg roll
One thing we made the mistake of is choosing too many dishes with broccoli in it but other than that every dish coming out tasted amazing
The beef itself in the burger wasn't that flavorful and was a little overcooked
Breaded chicken fried steak ham hot dog egg on a nice tasting Bolillo
The shoestring french fries my husband had were delicious and  I felt like we were getting the quality of food we were paying for
Tasty kabob is a family owned restaurant though and the quality and taste of the food completely represents that
The decorations music and food all flowed together wonderfully
We had the chicken kabob and steak kabob and the meat was REALLY tender and flavorful
You would think that living in Seattle I would have found some good sushi
I guess I did but if I really wanted *good* sushi I had to drive three hours to Vancouver
The sushi is delicious and there are all sorts of varieties of rolls
Don't get me wrong it's pretty good corned beef
You always know service is going to be good and there's no gambling with the food
I also recommend the tempura'd jalapeno roll
Hummus selection is very good and tasty falafel are flavorful but not too oily and entrees are displayed well for what is really a fast food place
The staff is amazing and the food is 5 star
I ordered the Healthy Eater plate which had two delicious chicken options as well as two vegetable options- I had the lentil and mushroom vegetables
So if you're into Indian food and have never tried Ethiopian I'd give Blue Nile a shot
The kooky yet wholesome collection of stores mix of intentional and unintentional nostalgic decor genuinely friendly store owners and time-is-not-of-the-essence attitude of the patrons throw me back to my feel-good childhood going to pizza parlors and mom and pop stores in Moon Valley
Thank god we finally found a good sushi place in Phoenix
It's like everything that is good about Jalapeno Poppers and everything that is good about a good roll all mixed up into one
While the Calamari Tempura and the Soft Shell Crab Rolls were good - they always are - the Rattlesnake was the best
My family and I thought the food was good enough service was up to par atmosphere wasn't bad although really you're gonna cheap out on A/C during the summer
Everything was great EXCEPT the quality of the food in relation to the price
This is a great place to go for people who like to overpay for food that's just good 'nuff
Portions were small and the quality of food was not what I would expect from an Iron chef
I travel about 90% of the time with my job and Houston's consistently has good food clean restaurants and great service I don't understand why all restaurants don't follow their service mantra
Looks like they source their food well and do their best to produce some tasty dishes
I was really impressed with SanTan's food and beer
On the prowl for some good food Lucky Boy caught my eye ordered a burger and fries
I went there with 4 friends and we ordered a pizza an appetizer then each ordered burgers
The food is what I've always liked about Pita Jungle Mediterranean style with creative diversions a lot of healthy fare hummus baba ganoush all that good stuff
they were AMAZING flavorful meaty wings that seemed to be cooked perfectly
I guess I can't be objective when I live in Cali and not AZ but for the quality and quantity of food you get I think the price is ridiculously reasonable
Hot dogs Pizza and of course my favorite the garlic fries
which is a mustCafu00e9 ZuZu was the so cute food was good we ate there for breakfast
seemed to be a good combo of food and included some Tottie Rolls which I wanted to try
combined to make quite a tasty bite of food
I have tried a number of the burgers and chicken sandwiches all are very good and it's especially nice with all the items you can add or change in an order
If you like food trying new flavor combinations and generally enjoying yourself make a reservation
Lots of marginally good food at OKAY prices
I am a fan of great pizza and the two times I have been here I have not experienced good pizza
Sickness aside the quality of pizza and appetizers at Cibo is far superior to that of Pizzeria Bianco
Regardless most of the food is pretty good
Good Fish and chips- not overly greasy and the tartar has huge chunks of pickle
The food is very good the beer is even better and the atmosphere is super-cool
I very rarely eat fast food but I was craving some crunchy chicken goodness with a biscuit and slaw
i had a roast beef wrap with green chili's on it was delicious and i had chicken breast sandwich on sour dough with green chili's
Good for that time when all you really want is breakfast food at midnight and a milkshake
When asked about the unusually high amount of cracked mussels in a dish ~1/3 the server she responded that the chef probably just stirred too hard which he corrected and pegged the poor quality to their supplier
Not only was the customer service exceptional but their food was very good as well
We upgraded our dish to the combo so we ordered fries option we chose which were really good too and had unlimited refills with any drink at the fountain
Again delicious food and really great and friendly customer service
But that's what I love about Costco I really don't mind going knowing I'll spend my money on high quality items and food
Their food court is cheap and tasty too
The Tuna Fresh Spring Roll was decent and the mango dipping sauce was good too
A little more would have made a more balanced roll worth the $4
If the place has 5 hostesses that are about 16-20 years old there's a good chance the food isn't good
I had beef chop suey that had very little flavor and my brothers both had chicken chow mein that had almost no noodles in them
Tonight I had a Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA and a winter brew that was delicious okay okay
The pizza's are a pretty good size for one hungry person or to share if you have two not so hungry people
I got the pistachio pizza and it was pretty good
This place is super close to my house but I always over look it because I am just not impressed with the food and sometimes the service
The food is basic Indian and is good not great - tandoori chicken palak pannear etc
The Kung Poa chicken was also good and had a proper level of spice
The meat is quality don't get me wrong but you can wonder less than a block away to City Hall and get a way better tasting cut
However the lack of flavor in the meat and the complete botch-up they call New England Style chowder will make me look elsewhere next time I'm looking for a steak/seafood house
The food was mostly good though I could not say that it is any better than what was offered in China Star the previous incarnation of this place
I was also anticipating a good variety of sushi but again the sushi items were no greater in variety than in a regular buffet and most of them had cream cheese in it - sacrilege for those who like properly made sushi
The food does seem to have gotten a little less flavorful over the past couple years - it's still good just more subtle
I've eaten here twice the first time the food was interesting and flavorful though I think they sometimes try to be a bit too clever with the menu
The food was prepared quickly which was good as I was on my way to work and in a time crunch
The chicken chimichanga I ordered was fairly tasty but a bit on the bland side
My sushi lunch special though all the requisite pieces looked requisitely raw was underflavored less than absolutely fresh fish
The food was good nothing out of this world but good
There's only one Chris Bianco and he can't make the pizza any faster without compromising quality - crusty complex dough and generous tasty toppings
Make sure to get an extra pizza - tastes just as good the next day - 5 min in a 500 degree oven
Aside from the incredible symphony of flavors that they are able to create in their rolls this family owned and operated business has one of the best deserts out there
I am not much of a sushi fan usually but I thought this place was pretty good
Both items the fish taco and hot dog were decent
Nice atmosphere and delicious food - but a bit pricey for what you get
Everything was great - really good flavor but once again would expect more food for the price - especially compared to other middle eastern places around the valley
Same thing was true with the lamb dish - lamb had great flavor and was really tender but only got a single kabob and rice
Needless to say I was impressed with my food
The bowl is also good enough for 2 if you order enough sushi/appetizers
I had never had chicken posole before usually always pork but this was really good
Overall such an amazing dinner one of my favorite meals I have ate in Phoenix and I can't wait to go back to try more of their amazing food
The seafood gumbo was very good as was the chicken and sausage gumbo
Next I had whatever the toro special of the day was which was freaking exquisite and Robert and I split a catepilar roll also quite good
I definitely enjoyed the eggs not being cooked too hard and the meat was a great addition
We decided to share a cinnamon roll; they are simply amazing
While I won't say the food is better than Matt's probably the best breakfast I have ever had I prefer Scramble almost every time with no wait and simply amazing choices all over the menu
I would HIGHLY recommend leaving resort and going to Mastro City Hall 1/2 mile down Camelback for some AMAZING steakhouse food
I completely understand ordering good food and expecting to wait for it but this was OUTRAGEOUS
Skip the soy sauce please--the fish is so fresh and flavorful drowning it in soy would be a terrible waste
Dessert is just as nice usually you finish with smooth ice cream flavors and fresh fruit
So after about 3 hours of hype we decided to venture to this Little place which turns into a club after 10 pm I can say the chicken tacos on corn tortillas are amazing the chicken tacos on the flour tortillas were easily forgotten
With regard to the spiciness of the food the medium-hot range fits me but my co-workers are always looking for the hottest and most spicy Thai food
I took the burrito to go and I really enjoyed it I thought it was gonna be like Filberto's quality but it wasn't it wasn't gourmet either just a good meat filled burrito
I definitely recommend the Pasta Fries Stuffed Medjool Dates Baby Lettuce Salad and Chicken & Waffles
The pizza was also very good although a bit greasy
The whole pizza had a lot of flavor and I liked how the pepperoni came with basil on it
Always good to have hot sake with my sushi
Bottom line Don't go with large groups unless you have cash sushi is ok but the green tea ice cream is worth the trip
Maybe it's just my misunderstanding of fine dining but I thought that really good food was always served in small portionsbecause of the high quality ingredients which in turn are high price ingredients but tasted really really AWESOME
On the upside I got a Sausage and mushroom pizza that was pretty good but not amazing
This is one of the top five pizza topping combos and SHOULD be totally delicious every time
Their food and drinks are not only really beautiful and unusual they are so amazingly delicious
As for the food I am a little bit jaded when it comes to Chinese food being from NY and SF but the dishes I have tried so far are good
Usually I feel like I'm going to choke on a piece of sushi because it is so large and I don't really enjoy the flavors as much as I would if the pieces were manageable
The food here is always fresh and tasty while others can have a general theme of bland
I call this fancy and expensive fast food because you can be eating high quality meat within minutes of sitting down
I tried the artichoke dip for appetizer the salmon as my entree and the souffle as my dessert
The pizza salads and dessert are all fantastic they have a pretty good beer selection and the wait at dinner is never more than about an hour
We figure we will grab a hot dog or slice of pizza at Costco but apparently Costco food court is the place to be on a Friday night the line was crazy town long
The bbq chicken pizza has so many great flavors on it
She got the Western Scrambler which was a good amount of food but she said she had better items on the menu
Good old fashioned and legit Mexican food
An all over good go to spot for satisfying your craving for good homstyle Mexican food
I heard this place was really good so I drove 20 minutes from the hotel to get some food
Food was just coming out when I got there which was good timing
Beer was way too expensive service was slow even for sitting at the bar the fish fell apart fries were cold and lumpy  were not CHIPS NO FULLERS
The chicken was crisp and delicious and the waffles were soft buttery and flavorful
The food is very delicious but it's also extremely rich and I don't think I can handle eating it more than once every couple of months
Pei Wei is a good stand by for quick asian foods
My hubby had Caramel Chicken & it was very unusual  but good
The service was very good and the food was delicious
Our waitress answered all our questions and was very helpful to explain all the dishes and gave great recommendations
Its common knowledge that there are excessive waits here at Oregano's and I assumed that is due to the high quality pizza coming from the kitchen
But most importantly the food is fresh well prepared and very tasty
What I got was a flavorless chicken salad with so so guac on the side
The pizza was good but not on the level of the dessert
The variety was good the fish wasn't its freshest fish and who puts mayo on their sushi
My favorite dish so far The cilantro chicken salad I subsitute steak for chicken and ask for an extra little side of their amazing dressing
This place was so good the food was great the service was awesome and I really liked the whole set up of the place too
Absolutely delicious I have never had a better roll
I don't mind small portions if the food is really good but this place just didn't have it
Full disclosure I was born in Germany so I know good German food
The food was hot and delicious with generous toppings
Next if you order an appetizer do not expect to get it prior to your main dish
The GOOD Truly the food is fantastic
The first time we came here I had the noodles with beef and lemon and my hubby had their stir fried chicken noodle dish both were tasty
The noodle soup dishes come out steaming hot with a heaping helping of flavorful broth the seasoned meat of your choice and veggies
Part of a dining EXPERIENCE is not just the food but the service and atmosphere and while the food is wonderful; their service is just very poor and lacking
Service was wonderful as was the atmosphere but I found the food lacking
They have a garlic cheese bread that is so delicious it makes my eyes roll to the back of my head
Can someone please tell me where to get a good Italian pizza in Scottsdale
They have a few new menu items including a pasta bar with different sauces which were all pretty good my boyfriend especially liked the spicy Alfredo sauce at the fresh seafood bar they will make some delicious shrimp to go with it
They don't bring you baskets of their delicious bread anymore but it's all self-serve so it's almost better you can grab a fresh warm roll as you want one
I get weary of reading reviews taking shots at restaurants for not serving real Chinese food
The chicken is perfectly fried tasty and juicy
If I were a guest on the show Best thing I ever ate - fried chicken this would be the place I recommend
The food was good the service was excellent and the atmosphere was pleasant for such a busy place
It is twice as expensive as pizza hut or papa johns although it is more than twice as delicious
The food was actually pretty good and reasonably priced
Second for those on a diet---Beefarito salad is sooooooo good
It's not the most amazing pizza I've ever had but it's far from the worst too
then here's some more you should knowThe pizza is damn good the service is damn good and the prices are fair
The Pollo Asado grilled chicken burrito is one of the highest quality burritos in town
Over time they grew popular and expanded eventually moving into a larger spot in the same complex and updating the decor to something more suiting their food quality
The lunch specials are a good price at $8 - you get a lot of good quality and good tasking food
Overall this is an above average Thai place where the selection is very good the food is high quality and you cannot go wrong with anything you order
-Vegan Deli items like -Vegan Sheperds Pie Amazing -Vegan Margherita Tofu Lasagna Ridiculously Good -Endless Salad Bar Creations Love the stuffed Grape leaves -Vegan Soups -Vegan Pizzas -Vegan Made to order Sandwiches Love that Olive Spread -Vegan Sushi Avocado Cucumber Rolls better than most restaurants -Beautiful Organic Produce Local Choices too -Organic Almond Milk -Hemp Seeds in Bulk -Mrs
The appetizers beef tataki scallops were unique and very well prepared and the tempura was lightly battered -- probably how it always should be done
I gave this restaurant 5 stars for the quality of the food the fast and friendly service as well as price
The food is good everytime I go which is always during dinner time and on the weekend
The pho is wonderful with great flavors plenty of aromatics and good meat
Tonight Chili's dropped the ball on their food quality and customer service
The staff was superb in meeting our needs the food was delicious the ambiance was beautiful especially overlooking the pool area of the resort and my young niece & nephews were well taken care of
My Husband had the corned beef which was very tender and good but he hardly ate the other things it came with so not really worth the price
We had the donuts for dessert which were good but overwhelming with how many you got
For the price we paid close to $100 I thought the food wasn't worth it
The fish and chips were very good and I opted to have them with sweet potato chips which were freshly made and delicious
The meats on the sub were good with the perfect amount of dressing so the bread didn't get all mushy
Quick highlights that I think might be helpful- lots of majors to choose from- lots of professors to choose from-lots of classes to choose from- lots of clubs and organizations- pretty great residence halls-descent food breakfast at Manzy mmm good
I went with 2 coworkers last time and we split a Chicago pizza excellent and less than $7 each with tip
The pizza has an amazing taste to the sauce that can only be experienced and that will hopefully one day be recognized as the sauce all pizza should use
Keep in mind this place has a huge menu so don't think there only as good as pizza and wings
I've had both the coffee and the food here-- both weren't worth talking about and left no impressions
There's a BIG Sushi boat lots & lots of tasty meat & seafood dishes of all different kinds excellent Mongolian BBQ & so on; an awesome array of food
The food here is pretty fantastic and the margaritas are tasty if a bit overpriced
The guac is great the tortilla soup is hearty filling and tasty and the shrimp dish is amazing
i must say that the prices are good the food looked and tasted good after it finally arrived just don't expect to have a server you'll have to bring in your own condiments and fetch your own coffee
Overall the food ranged from tasty to surprisingly good and we all offered up tastes of our meals
Had appetizers the Chicken Lettuce Wraps and they were better than PF Changs and the serving size was generous
The best part was the quality of the dishes though
Very tasty meals and I enjoyed the orange chicken
Nonetheless the service and the food quality both mean I will certainly be back again
Great service fresh and delicious seafood
Their Broiled Chicken Salad is also good if if you're looking for something a little more simple
I frequently order these but have also had their Lavosh Pizza which is tasty too
Palatte has great food and excellent atmosphere
Not as pretentious as Fez more welcoming down to earth and the food's pretty darn good makes for a great place to hang out with friends and chat
Now that we know Taco Felix serves good food for good prices we won't hesitate to come back during one of those unusual times - to get a chorizo/egg burrito on the way to an early morning flight to grab a mid-afternoon snack when most other places are closed or to fill our stomachs late one night after a few drinks
A pinto bean dish and creamed corn came with the ribs very tasty
Anyways my wife had this Korean Pork or Beef  Appetizer that was ample enough to be an entree
We ended up with Rigatoni chicken that I had to come back for with a second visit and we also ordered the manchego sandwich recommended by our waiter
Anyways the faux meat in this dish was fine -- nothing to write home about but it was good
In Minnesota there is one king of hot dish a
I really felt like a burger and everything in that food court is kinda gross so I decided to give it a shot
The food is good the drinks are reasonably priced and the service is amazing
you just get very basic albeit good German food and a small German alcohol selection
I didn't try the food but it all looked tasty
Like others have said it's not a place to go if you're really hungry but it's great if you're fine noshing on ambitious and creative appetizers such as duck confit tostadas or beef carpaccio with garlic aioli and fried capers
John the food here isn't good as that one restaurant on Mill
The hummus was excellent and garlicky and the tan-tan chicken sandwich was a big hit among others at my table
The food is amazing everything is properly prepared with flavor texture and presentation in mind
The crispy shrimp and okra was so delicious and I rarely go for the fried dishes
Had to find the perfect place for a birthday dinner and the requirements where An ethnic place that has good vegetarian/seafood options that they had never been to before
For simple stylish food and contemporary vibe Iruu00f1a is as good as it gets
I had the following1st Course     Piquillo Rellenos--chilled piquillo peppers filled with lump crabmeat salad The sweetness of the peppers was unusual and the crabmeat salad was pretty good too I cleaned the plate
I love that it has it's own sensibility and it's not fancy it's just solid good food
The service was excellent and the food very good although maybe not the best choice for the night before Thanksgiving
I would go back just for the friendly staff and crowd with the good food and solid drinks as a bonus
So even though there's absolutely no smoke in their meats even though the dominant flavor in the ribs is ridiclously un-yummy amounts of black pepper I have to say it's great
The food The chips and and curry appetizer was quite tasty the curry sauce should be thicker to coat the chips more and it could add some spice but I thought it was a very novel item
The food itself tasted good but there was NOWHERE near enough to satisfy any person in just one serving
If you want insanely overpriced appetizers masquerading as real food you'll like this place
Pretty cheap beer decent pizza and some good happy hour specials
My boyfriend and I split a sampler appetizer and it was enough food to feed us both for dinner
Theres a Mc Donalds down the street and you get the same quality of food for less than $20 for 6 people
No matter what location visit you will receive delicious food made with quality ingredients
My latest creation is chicken fajita veggies pico de gallo corn salsa with a tiny bit of cheese hot red chili salsa and dressing on the side
That would have been OK if the food was amazing but everything came overcooked
Portions are large food is really good and authentic and the prices are cheap
I'd recommend trying their chicken with garlic sauce or sesame chicken
Elmer's Tacos joint has good Mexican food but does not come close to being the best around the area
There are some other worthy Mexican food places to try when in Chandler but Elmers is worth it if looking for a quick Mexi-food fix
We ordered the fried tofu appetizer which is a ridiculous amount of food
We also had the crab rangoon which was like dessert it was so sweet and good
i think adding ricotta cheese would make it even better like it did for one of the red pizzas we tried as cibo's ricotta has a pleasant nutty flavor
i can't count the places where i've added ricotta to a pizza and it had absolutely no flavor whatsoever but not at cibo
This place was fantastic when i have been there in the past and the food is still good love the mini tacos and the avocado bowl is well worth it for your chips and dinner side but the service this time was sooooooooooo bad that it made it all seem not worth repeating
Although it's categorized as Pizza I actually find they serve some amazing things besides pizza in which you could leave pizza entirely off the menu so if I may add to the other 80 reviews
I'd love to give this place a four just for the amazing burger meat they had but too many side problems takes it down a couple pegs
This is my little Korean food oasis that saves me from driving 45 minutes to the Mesa area for good Korean groceries
Ambiance excellent food a great selection of fine liquor
Off the appetizer list I have tried- the Guaca-Tony = fresh guac and pizza bread with WAY too much parm on them also expect a 20 min wait- the calamari = actually pretty decent reminds me of mozzarella sticks though- the garlic bread = wish the bread didn't come out of a plastic bag- sweet potato fries = ok- waffle fries = okSandwiches- italian sausage sandwich = spicy sausage buy the jr size since the full size is too much cheese looks fake and is not good if you have to reheat it the next day- meatball sandwich = standard no wow factorPizza = if you have about 90 minutes to wait the pizza is pretty good
Bellini's = good strong mango/peach margaritaPazookie= skip the food and just order one of these
I frequent many amazing organic and slow food restaurants in the Phoenix and Scottsdale areas and I was excited to go out of my box to try something new
I had their chicken sandwich and a mocha from their highly recommended coffee shop and neither really wowed me
Lately a group of people on Twitter that I call The Foodie Faithful have been going on and on about Goodytwos Toffee so I thought I'd drop in and have a look/taste
Loitering and thumbing through porn and graphic novels at Waldenbooks ooing and ahhing over Forever 21 plaid bras inhaling deeply the cinnabons and giant cookie pizzas that say I HEART U and singing along to Hole in Hot Topic
I'm not a big chain restaurant type of gal but this place is top notch not only in service but as well as quality of food
Again I cannot express the 5 star quality of food this place serves
If the food was above average and the service was good this would be a fun time
Anyway the food was good and the service would good also
They use shredded beef that is so juicy and flavorful
The flavor was bold the chicken was tender and with the injera was awesome
We started with the chicken nacho appetizer to share and it wasn't my favorite
My boyfriend got the carne asada dish that also sounded tasty
The pretzel roll was soft and slightly chewy the cranberry chutney bursting with flavor and the coleslaw was tangy and really brought the whole thing together
I tried my boyfriend's carne asada dish and I liked it there was too much tomato in my opinion and it gave it a steak and spaghetti type of flavor
The resturaunts on site were pretty good BOURBON STEAK- was really good even for me who doesn't eat meat there were a lot of choices the sides are great the mac and cheese yum
The quality was good the salad dressing was great and they didn't skimp on the pizza toppings
They were a little pricey almost $20 per 16 pizza but it was worth it I think
If you want tasty food perfect indoor or outdoor atmosphere or a place to socialize this is the place
If you are downtown and want a place with good prices but amazing food
Otherwise the meat had a nice smoke flavor that was not overpowering
Another plus is going to the W pool deck to hang out and schmooze post sakeThe food was expensive and good
It was right off the special menu and very tasty but not an eye roller
cookie cutter sushi; good and satisfying but not memorable
The food was amazing and we even ordered dessert which was unreal
The restaurant has a good variety of popular dishes from different Asian cuisines
The wait time from when I ordered and when I got the food made me think I was going to get some tasty piping hot food fiesta but no
I can't seem to stop gushing about this place because the food is amazing
The appetizer food that looked good on line sucked
If you want cheap entertainment go there but don't expect good drinks or food - just good old fashioned people watching
Unfortunately the corned beef is at best a good goyashe corned beef not Kosher or Kosher style
so I knew they were going to ruin our food so badly that I am sitting here typing this instead of eating the delicious panang curry but it is so Damn hot that i cant even eat it and can barely stand even the underlying flavor
On the first visit we ordered the Grande pizza their supreme and it was quite tasty
I was less impressed the second time around as they skimped on the meat
The food is excellent and watching them make the noodles fresh on the spot is an extra treat
I agree with kkdat with allot of her recommendations by the way the beef tongue was great I was impressed with the attention to detail
Everyone would rave about how delicious the food is but I never checked it out because of the crazy parking situation
The other people I was with enjoyed their food and we actually did really love the yummy cinnamon roll we all shared it's what they're famous for
Not the best desserts I have ever had but definitely very tasty
Doesn't make it in my top 5 of pizza in the valley but tasty nonetheless
Its places like this that make me miss Uncle Sam's where you can get good pizza and $4 premium pitchers
Unlike Sam's Club Whole Foods gives samples that actually taste delicious and almost make you grab for seconds when instead you just grab an actual wrapped portion of the product darn had to buy some sometime
I was so happy to get to try it and even happy with the amazing food and service we had
If the food is any bit as good as the app's which all the people at the table and all the reviews say is true then I can't wait to visit for a nice meal
Good service fantastic huge food and reasonable cold beer and margs
The vegetarian pizza that I ordered  was medium sized and a very good value with a variety of fresh toppings
Well they were really good and freshly-fried I was shocked considering the kitchen was closing in 30 minutesI ordered their famous orange chicken
The Tempura was quite good but the problem was that it was brought out first and by the time I received my food she had finished hers
The Dragon roll was good but could have been much larger
All in all even though this is not the best Chipotle location it has top quality Chipotle food friendly employees and a pleasant atmosphere
The yellow curry with chicken is very good the panang curry with beef was so good the masaman curry is like Thai beef stew
I ordered the Chicken Big Blue Burrito which was delicious
Sure its a bit pricey at $50 per person but considering the quality of the meat is top notch and the huge all you can eat selection it's well worth it every once in a while
The group of 8 I was with was not impressed by the sushi served at this place
The sushi didn't seem to be as fresh or the fish as high of quality as other places
I wasn't impressed with what I had-some beef item and some sesame chicken
Their compulsory valet is a mess but a mess worth their pizza
I would highly recommend their Salsiccia pizza which is a heavenly combination of house made sausage radicchio and sage
The theater would be exceptional if the food was more tasty
The 4th time I went the chicken enchiladas I had were so incredibly good I felt that it made up for the previous times
Everything I got was good I wasn't blown away probably the best food item was the onion rings which definitely appeared to be something made onsite
Good service especially in Old Town beergaritas drinks and food's ok
Before we knew it the check came without the waiter even asking us if we enjoyed our meal or if we were finished how about dessert and coffee
79 plus tax and is about the same quality as freezer pizzas
The the fries and onion straws were good but not as exciting as the very good prime meat and are part of the reason this wasn't a five star review
But at this point the two waiters on got slammed and I counted our waiter running around with at least seven tables   some were outside on the patio  He had help but wasn't able to ask us how are meals were  although they were great  We wanted to order dessert since the meals were very good and Grant did make the trip to clear our plates and give dessert menus
I think the menu is slightly dated and the dessert we tried was good but is not on the level of the really great meals
2 We ordered some sushi rolls and 5 complete meals she told us we have 5 appetizers and asked if we want salad or Edamame we said 3 salad's and 2 Edamame's and they were served as ordered no problem here
5 The food is plain actually after all of the above happening I didn't care about the food anymore even it was 5-star quality
My dining partner and I tried the mac and cheese so rich and tasty baby arugula salad best salad I've ever had wild boar short ribs very tender buttermilk fried chicken and banana cream pie
While the prices are steeper than your average date night destination the food also far exceeds in quality and taste
Similar look bake goods on display on the way in muffins instead of pies and a couple of items on menu same as Coco's Sam Adams Beer Batter Fish n Chips
My wife got some kinda pasta dish they forgot the shrimp and brought out later it was not good
They have hot food items for sale off to the right of the registers such as steamed pork buns which are $1
They have a decent selection of fish - I get ahi tuna steaks here and they're quite good
Delicious sandwiches - especially the number 7 Best of Everything and finally the pizza - it's really good - not Grimaldi's good but the dough is just thick enough chewy and the sauce is just enough not too dry and not too much the toppings are always good
I've never had a bad meal - if you excuse the pizza delivery that was two hours late and ice-cold
Fresh ingredients hot and tasty food decent service
If you are looking for AMAZING food and wonderful service go to George & Son's
Ever since I've left the area I've been searching for a restaurant that will satisfy my cravings for savory Asian food like Salt & Pepper Shrimp Shrimp with Honey Glazed Walnuts Special Chicken/Shrimp Sizzling Rice soup Hot and Sour Soup Spicy Pork General Yang's Chicken Chow Mein Lemon Chicken Orange Beef Crab Puffs House fried rice and the list goes on and on
The food court is all down one end which is good
The food was very good with a ecletic variety and a tasting menu choice
I had a very good beet salad and the beef was excellently prepared with great flavor
I surprised my brother with some suicide wing's I dont eat meat but I did try the sauce and ate some w my pizza it was HOT
They said they were very good meaty and not too vinegary
The food is always good and usually too much for one person to finish
We had amazing wine and we decided to go with the Big Night Out which is a LOT of food and it takes a good 2 hours to eat your whole meal but it is so fun sitting close to that special someone while having a unique dining experience
DEAR GOD if the food is anywhere near half as good as it smelled
I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for some awesome pizza
My husband loved all of his food tomato soup hanger steak with fries apple tart and even shared the french fries that came with his steak with me the fries were salty and delicious
That translates to over-cooked DRY chewy beef  The good news is that they don't use Pink Slime boy am I relieved after reading that on their menu
I JUST had lunch there today and REALLY enjoyed the food
The good pizza I had here well it was great so I'd give it 3 stars
Beyond the attractive decor and nice food-presentation I wasn't all that impressed by True Food
On the positive side the edamame dumplings with daikon radish and white truffle oil were extremely tasty and my Ginger Margarita was excellent
Even worse my chicken sausage pizza was slightly burnt on the bottom and tasted bland and uninspired -- the sausage was finely ground and lacked much flavor and the fennel was invisible
The chicken was tasty pasta salad was okay at best
My only real problem is that parking is limited but you can park down the streets which at times can get to be far away but if you can't walk a block or two for good food and beer then you suck anyways
Overall just a great place to sit and chill and have some good food and great beer
Pizza is ok I guess if you dig cold pizza
Their specials are well rounded for the fish lovers just in case someone doesn't want a big slab of moo and their appetizers are good enough to have just as the meal
The appetizer the imperial rolls was absolutely delicious and I will definitely be ordering it again in the future without a doubt
Having had mongolian beef at many an Asian restaurant in the last few years I've been all over the spectrum from authentic and delicious to Americanized and bland and was pleasantly surprised to find the soy version at Fresh Mint surpassed many of the better real beef versions I'd had
The food was excellent the atmosphere was quaint and unique and at least for lunch the price was right
Honestly for me personally the chicken and waffles were average *ducks and covers*  The waffles had little flavor and the chicken was meh
I am too used to excellent sushi at fair prices as well as happy hour menus with all the favorites
We proceeded to order a couple appetizers and a handful of rolls
None of which were memorable in any positive light The avocado roll was insipid with a strange clash of textures and flavors
built your own pizza is a good way to go  always FRESH incredigents  great pizza crust and for those FISH LOVERS note   they use FRESH ANCHOVY  which DOES NOT TASTE SALTY like the can ANCHOVY  which gives the NON FISH  taste    but all in all a good clean place for a afternoon lunch service was VERY GOOD
They have red and green chili beef tacos among many others sweet fry bread dusted with sugar and other optional goodies blue corn mush with cedar ash mutton stew and more
The red chili beef was good although the dash of hot sauce definitely helped give it a needed kick
Small and cozy although not much ambiance it offers friendly service good food and relatively cheap prices
Everyone seemed to enjoy their food and we took leftovers home which were just as delicious
The food is good but not the best sushi I've ever had
The rice was moist and delicious and reminded me a lot of the rice I grew up eating with Puerto-Rican dishes
But that is no fault to Padres as the dish was very good
fast easy fresh -tasting at least and delicious enough food to last you for a couple future meals
The gourmet pizza with house made mozzarella was really tasty - very fresh tomato-y and good crust
The fish was good but the breading on it was kinda weird
Abridged Good food hotel restaurant feel
The food was good enough that I won't write it off my list but I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't welcome my kind any more haha
Aside from the fact that my brunch buddie and I literally waited 30 minutes for the food to come out the food wasn't even that good
I bought it back to the office it smelled good and the togo box was stuff with food
The food is cheap and delsihcious and the drinks are a good price too
The food was ok at best but really the service was so horrible that I wouldn't recommend this place to an enemy
No hotties in tank tops but much better food unless you like overpriced mehworthy vaginal-themed AmeriMex
I could taste the quality beef in the burger the toppings were very good the bun was good
The reason that I am updating is that they expanded the kitchen remodeled tripled the size of their menu and now include Vietnamese favorites like pho bun and broken rice dishes in addition to the excellent bahn mi sandwiches and the best boba drinks in town
Place is clean food is good service is great women are beautiful
Having just moved to the area I have been searching for a location with quality food and tasty beer options with reasonable happy hour prices
I must say I was hesitant because I went with my then fiance now husband for dinner one night just to check it out and I was not impressed with the food
Plus grease-flavored foods really don't rock my boat
Overall it's good - some dishes even amazing
I was able to find some of the classic East European and Russian foods that I enjoyed throughout my life
They also have a bakery and meats worth noting
Our service was excellent -- water glasses remained filled the waiter stopped by often to check on things salad and dinner dishes were removed promptly etc
The plates came out and although my food was hot my son's plate was cold
I had the beef rice noodle soup $6  the broth was so flavorful that I was frustrated with the tiny spoon - I wanted to SHOVEL the bad boy in
When I mentioned to the nice young man who waited on us how much I wanted to taste the lemon/garlic/pepper dressing in the lok lak beef - which I didn't order cuz the weather was too cold for salad - he brought me a little bowl of it complete with two tasting spoons
Even my 7 year old who may quite possibly be the pickiest person on the entire planet proclaimed the food as being delicious
But I can't do that in good conscience for the following reasons  It's not a place to linger because they sling you into a table and throw your food at you super quickly
i've tried a few dinner items as well and they didn't get to me in a good way like the food i've had at most other indian restaurants--i guess i'm saying there just isn't a kick or memorable flavor to much of anything that i've tried here
it's the closest indian restaurant to my house but i'd rather drive countless miles more towards the tempe area to eat way more flavorful and seemingly fresh indian food when the desire strikes
We also had one of their Pizzas and ended up fighting over the last peice because it was so delicious
This place has some good healthy foods which are perfect for my diet after my workouts
Another good meal at Outback Steak House for me too - I enjoyed my tenderloin a nice piece of meat
Food that was supposed to be hot was cold
Sent my cold undercooked fish back and it came back warm but still undercooked
If you don't like top quality meats or haven't had them I defy anyone to find a better steakhouse
On all 3 occasions our service was excellent and the food was fresh and outstanding
Let's get to the foodAll in all it was excellent
Not too much dressing and very tasty but I don't go out to eat cole slaw so let's talk about the meat
We had the #4 Spring Roll for appetizer and I ordered #22 as usual and my friend had the signature pho I guess is #15 but might be wrong
The food presented nicely and tasted good
The server was extremely attentive the food was fresh and delicious and the intimate yet casual ambiance is to die for
My coworker kept complaining about how hot her meal was beer battered fish burrito
The beef burrito was good and the tacos were okay
99Let me be clear the food on the buffet is just as good as what one could order
These dishes were there however the sushi was very good for a buffet and had a decent selection
Nothing beats a good sushi bar with it being made right there to order but this wasn't bad
I had the hot Swedish Brisket with a side of horseradish
I ordered the Hackbraten German Meatloaf which was very good the mashed potato and red cabbage were superb
We also imbibed on some fantastic food-Seaweed Salad which was fresh and tasty-Calamari with Japanese aioli I could have downed a large plate of this goodness   too-Spicy Tuna rolls on true fried rice
crunchy and delicious-Dragon rools eel crab and avocadoTop this deliciousness off with octopus nigiri and las vegas rolls washed down with some $5 sake bombers and you've just had yourself a HELL of a happy hour
I managed to get out while I was still THIS SIDE of a drunken hot mess which is usually what happens when I have sake bombersI'm so glad we decided to come here it was great food at really exceptional value in a very cool hip atmosphere
I have tried a selection from each of the menu sections and I have always enjoyed my food at the Elephant Bar
I found Terminal 2 to be the smallest and 4 had the largest number of food choices Einstein Bagels Chili's Paradise Bakery / Grill Oaxaca Coldstone Creamery and Starbucks to name a few
It has a ton of chicken in it rice some vegetables and it's wonderfully seasoned
The coconut chicken soup thing was a little odd but the chicken in it was really good quality and tasted good while added to other types of sauce
For the quality of the food I would say that it was a little expensive but it beats going to McDonalds or other fast food restaurants
For fast food Mexican it's pretty darn good
Spicy pho with beef pork hock and tendon was very good if a little fatty on the first visit
The food is good but from what I've seen the menu doesn't really exist
She has food that is prepared and if you get what is available it is quite good
You have halted my visitations to Richardson's and kept my mouth and gullet happy with your outstanding foodstuffs and tasty maragritas
A marriage of southern mexican seafood pizzas and quality
I had the rotisserie chicken which was overcooked and not that tasty anyway
I highly reccomend the Spinach and Artichoke dip served hot in a dainty au gratin dish along with tri-color tortilla chips
You can also choose from an assortment of other dishes including pancakes cold cereal danishes etc
My husband had the coconut shrimp which was actually very good and I had the English style fish and chips which I have to say was not very English but the fish was very tasty
Each item had a wonderful spicy kick to it and my faves were the smoked turkey relleno a lighter take on its cheese-filled cousin and ten times more flavorful and the carne adovado tender pork studding a meaty hearty sauce
Each piece of meat was of good quality and was expertly prepared -- the lean yet juicy pork loin was my surprise favorite of the night
I never thought you could get an excellent burrito and excellent grilled meat in one place but Dick's proved me wrong
Food quality is Applebee's level so set expectations accordingly
The meat selection is amazing for the price huge selection of Ribeyes
And also my thanks to Dick's Hideaway for giving me this moment to revel in this dream world composed of nothing but delicious flavors and complete food coma
The asparagus was competently prepared as was the chicken enchiladas but lacking the depth of flavors found in the other dishes
Generally they have enticing daily specials a good range of drinks to include teas and the same general quality of food as the regular chain restaurant
Good food best to go when they're inbetween meal rushes
AND the food was excellent the wine selections were great too
you've seen these reviews cause in my head if the food and service are good why should i give a shit who is serving it to me
empanadita trio we had the beef-BLANDsome kind of black bean ball- the only reason this place didnt get one star is that the avocado dip for said BBball was tasty
Tired of bland chain restaurants I was really looking to support a local restaurant that was tasty and not the typical food
The short ribs pasta and chicken were amazing
It was all tasty and I'd rather have well made freshly prepared food than food that arrives all at the same time
Our minds have been changed BB is really good food
Good happy hour spot with a different take on your classic mexican dishes
We seemed to be in a miserable mood and was just not coming around enough and was not very good at presenting the food and drinks
I ordered Rare beef Pho and it was great the broth was fresh and full of flavor the meat was the most tender beef I have ever had in pho and there was a generous helping of beef and noodles
We had the calamari appetizer and my mom ordered the Crisp and Crunch Rolls AMAZING shrimp tempura sweet potato wild berry cream cheese so good I may go back tonight and order it for take home
The service here is not the problem nor is the the saturation of tv's quite impressed with the fireplace screen it's the bad food
I also noticed that they are always cleaning the grill which is a huge deal for good quality food
They have delicious Mexican food and fantastic margaritas to wash everything down with
I've tried quite a few of the dishes here and they've all been excellent
Glad I waited; bit of kimchi bit of little salty fish for small plates banchan along with the spicy pork  - deep flavor and generous serving - left very content
I wasn't expecting much from a chain sushi restaurant but the food was surprisingly good
I was really impressed with the decor atmosphere wine list beer selection food and most of all their acts to accommodate children
Good mexican food in a northern scottsdale
Definitely not half as good as the mexican travel trailer stomach-ache-for-weeks food but certainly better quality
Good portions fresh food great service and comfortable atmosphere
The shrimp is usually very very good and fresh and the chicken has never been anything but above average
A half order is perfect for one person and the combination of chicken bacon and mushrooms is mouthwateringly delicious
This is tasty food for a price you expect to pay in a place with a great atmosphere in downtown Cave Creek
I think their version of that dish is pretty good
Which had a lot of appetizers and rolls for almost 40% original price
The rainbow spicy salmon and California roll were good too
I asked for a dish of the Milagro sauce on the side to dip the fries in and it's yer basic Chipotle Mayo but delicious as well
The ladies had difficulty finishing their soup and a shared flatbread - Chicken Caesar flatbread which they both agreed was very good but the soup was also more filling than they expected
but I don't recommend the fish just for it's over-salted flavor and misleading portion size
I recommend getting the baked potato as a side dish and ask for the triple cheese butter
Cal so I grew up with very good Vietnamese food
Besides the Pho the Banh Xeo Crepe and rice dishes are very tasty as well
*  Amazing egg roll had lots of fresh veggies and a hint of black pepper
Everyone I was with really enjoyed their food
All the food we had was delicious and they had some nice choices
I've had a couple of experiences here and overall the food is really tasty
I didn't have access to a car so I was pretty limited to eating hotel food for a week
Now my favorite Mexican food is TexMex due to being raised in south Texas and really enjoy that flavor
This food is not TexMex but has a good flavor
My wife and I thought it was delicious but tasted like moist roast beef that was shredded without seasonings appropriate for a taco burrito or tamale
The crab puffs and egg rolls were fantastic but the real star of the appetizer course was the dipping sauce
Not that plasticy sweet n sour garbage you get at a lot of places this was delicate but flavorful and perfect for balancing the richness of the fried food
I am a fan of a lot of heat in my Thai food but we were doing it family style so I couldn't order anything 'thai hot
My favorite though was the Seafood Spaghetti Ridiculous amount of flavor in this dish
Clearly the owners recognize that serving amazing food at a great price is a recipe for success
Now if you like Mexican food and you prefer it HOT I mean seriously HOT Five Alarm HOT then my friend Los Dos Molinos in the answer to your prayers
The food is wonderful with combinations you'll find nowhere else
But it is amazing how well you can deal with the pain when the food is so incredible
Took off a star and a half because the novelty of the hand pulled noodle show has worn off and to be honest I don't think the hand pulled noodles taste any better than store bought dried noodles or dare I say it not even as good and aside from the fresh noodle show I don't think the dishes here are that good
nothing beats eating good Mexican food under the stars
Their food is really good so I cannot give this place anything lower than a 4
Wish they offered a plain meat chicken and pork gravy as the reductions and sauces just aren't complimentary to all flavors of pasties and pies
Suggest you make a reservation so you get he chance to enjoy the wonderful food that is in store
The seafood tower must change in selection of seafood which is good which is also why mine last night was so fresh fresh delicious
Its good to know that you can get top rate seafood in Phoenix
The location is great as the mall is a good place to walk off the extra mozzarella ;I ordered the small pizza with pepperoni and extra fresh mozzarella
The pizza came out hot with what we ordered on top plus a couple of basil leaves
The pizza was great with its big slices im a big guy and was filled up after two but the hot wings stole the show
We were also quite impressed by the sushi bar and the selection of pre-packaged sushi
I love curry and spice but I want to taste the food too and they gave me all of the heat and all of the flavor
The spicy tuna roll makes a great appetizer
I like the system and the food is very good but they need to tighten up their procedures quite a bit
I've been dreaming of it since I got back from a visit to Green Bay last summer ;I was excited to hear that Culver's opened here in Mesa -- I don't eat their burgers but it' s nice to have a place for frozen custard -- there are so few places for any type of frozen dessert in Phoenix which is odd considering how hot it is and there are even fewer places for custard
Son had chicken kebab very tender very juicy flavorful and served with basmati rice which went well with my lamb too
The food is very delicious I have tried most everything on the menu and have yet to find anything that I dislike
I am a big fan of the Carne Tampiquena and my girlfriend loves a dish they will make if you request it at the moment I am not sure of its name but it has fish and it is covered in a cream sauce it too is very delicious
If you are thinking about going to this place I strongly recommend that you try it and you will fall in love with the atmosphere food and the friendly people that work there
I ordered the capicola pizza and it was very spicy and flavorful
Overall we enjoyed the food but just not impressed with speed and service
The chicken filling for the lettuce wraps was so salty and oniony - not so good
The beef was the best dish - really tender and well flavored but so salty
I'd like to go back and try one of their fish options in the future since they had a good selection of mix-and-match fish and prep styles that sounded really fun
org/wiki/LimeyWe tried this for lunch on Sunday - Her cheese steak pasty was amazing and my chicken pot pie pasty was delicious too
The food isn't that good for that long of a wait
We also had a couple of desserts - the flourless chocolate cake which was a delicious fudge cake that we devoured
Very good very consistent quality pizza
I can personally recommend the Top 2 on the menu The Company Combo and the Chicken Pesto; so different that we split our 24 between the 2 as well as the BBQ and The Popeye
Food was excellent I got the Four Cheese Pastachettis with chicken
My wife's combo of chicken flauta and taco was not good
The food is good sure it might not be the best in the world but it's very good for Thai
The food was pretty good the tacos were OK not the best I've had
The first bite felt like yummy goodness it just melted in my mouth cooked to perfection and the hint of smokiness as well as the juiciness of the meat
For Phoenix this is as good as it gets for the whole package - food atmosphere bar & value
This location always has pretty good service and consistently good food
Other than the ambiance of being a  Rock & Roll restauarnt this place isn't good
I came in for a birthday party with 6 people and not one of us actually enjoyed our food
our food that he held my salad order until after I had gone through my appetizer which turned out to be significantly leafier than I had imagined
He also brought us hot sauce to try between courses personally made us some of our favorite cocktails and told us about how exciting it had been whipping the place into shape over the past few months between dinner and dessert
I had the barbecue chicken and it was delicious
Carmel's is good on the food as well as ambiance; the coffee however wasn't what I was hoping for
We also shared the crispy pork belly appetizer the table side guacamole the braised beef tacos and the pumpkin bread pudding
also dont be afraid to top cured meat with a drizzle of quality olive oil and some cracked pepper maybe a squeeze of a lemon for the price and claims i would expect it
A lot of great options on the menu especially the seafood centered appetizers
I got the Betty Boop which is a huge fried chicken breast with a super fresh and tasty waffle
The chicken was really good - not the strange consistency that can be found at other restaurants that serve the dish
There's nothing snazzy or memorable about this place other than the actual food which is quite good
My wife and I were starving for some good sushi and wanted to pig out on a budget
I recommend the VEGAS roll BAKED SCALLOP roll HARU sushi and SIZZILING SALMON are some of my favorites
Normally I don't have a bad thing to say about Four Peaks aside from the parking but after spending over $80 on Mother's Day brunch for low-quality food I'm very disappointed
The food here is always good and consistent
The food was very good and reasonably priced
As for the restaurant itself the food is pretty tasty
Happy Hour is also great - several good food and drink specials
My friend had the Thai chicken and said she enjoyed it very much
Good friendly service an interesting and appealing menu and great tasting food
I heard the red velvet cake is amazing but I've always been so full to get to dessert
It's good Thai food and worth a trip but nothing sensational
Their kalbi ribs are pretty darn tasty but it can be a lot of food for lunch with the 2 scoops of rice a scoop of mac salad and the ribs over steamed cabbage
Most of their chicken unless otherwise mentioned is boneless skinless thighs makes for juicy tasty pieces
I strolled up behind them removing my wayfarers and smile as I clasped their shoulders they greeted me with the vivacity that only an overtly imbibed brother and good friend can
The food is bar and grill with some fancy stone fired quesadillas that are great appetizers
The grilled cheese sandwhich is one of my favorites and the New Orleans Chicken Sandwhich is quite flavorful with Tasso Ham Real Mayo a toasted bun and a tender juicy chicken breast
For the styling and food quality Corbins is a solid choice
How much variation good or bad can you possibly introduce into egg drop soup fried rice and egg rolls
The egg roll was solid and the steamed rice was perfectly cooked and unusually tasty
The raw cabbage was a pleasant textural change but the spicy fish-flavored dressing didn't work for me
I tried a bit of the fish and it was pretty darn good
Prior to chowing down on pizza I had to order my first recommended dish the Spiedini Italian fontina cheese wrapped in prosciutto
A few minutes after our appetizers my pizza arrived
All of these ingredients mixed together on a pizza created a depth of flavor that made me happy to have taken the risk
The service was good the ambiance was like most pizzerias and the food was on point
Next time you are in town and want some quality pizza on the western side of the country check out Pizzeria Bianco
Yes the line was long and slow but the food was out pretty quickly and it was very tasty
During a busy lunch rush our tables were very clean and everyone enjoyed their foods
Food is always great as well I love the chicken avocado club yesterday I tried the fish and chips and it was delicious
Overall it's not the best Sushi experience of my life but it has great specialty rolls miso soup and amazing hot green tea
The wings are good the taco appetizers good their pizzas are good and the burgers are good
We ended up ordering a medium deep dish pizza and I really enjoyed it here
In between the great hours drink specials and tasty pizza I will probably be back
The menu is vast the food is good and the service is always up to par
They were amazing and we made some great dishes at home
I guess eating mediocre food in peace isn't good enough
The food delivered was as if it had been sitting in a bin for many hours as everything came dried out cold and no flavor
Oh and they have good food yeah i said it
com/447vcnJust sit right back and you'll read a tale a tale of a crappy bar;Good for me it's pretty close I didn't walk too far;The food is poor and the service is not very good it's bad
Buffalo chicken wings appetizer buffalo chicken salad buffalo chicken sandwich buffalo chicken wrap
I recommend it for out-of-towners almost as a historical stop but not too much for the food
The mark of a good food place is when they leave you excited to get back there
My cottage cheese was also amazing spiked with radish green onion and cucumbers
Not only was the food wonderful the service here was impeccable
Having waited a good half hour after we had already finished our fries my gyro plate was nothing to write home about - it was your usual fair with somewhat over cooked rice sauteed vegetables and way too little pita and tzatziki sauce for the amount of meat
My friend's steak kabobs were all but inedible - cold and seasoned with entirely way too much salt the meat was salty to the point that it was borderline bitter
Not only was the food not very good the service was also pretty terrible
Even if the food was good it's not worth the attitude this place gives
But he's good at it the food is relatively decent the house wines are serviceable and prices reasonable
I'm a fan of Fox's other restaurants and have always been impressed with the food
Often I think this place tries to be too fancy with their food but these were just mounds of bbq goodness
They have delicious salads and was look like good personal-pan style pizzas
albeit simply amazing food I'm going to say go here
Had already had the pleasure of dinning here several times before but this time got the seafood tower and was really impressed with the fresh sweet and ice cold sea treasures adorning this tower
Want a good homemade fresh pizza look no further than Classic Italian
In & Out is always clean the people friendly and cheerful the food was good tasting
This doesn't effect the coffee quality and customer service surprisingly as much as the food
But this is why Carmel's get 3 stars they raised the prices and the food is not good enough to warrant the price hike
The food wasn't good enough for the price and I almost lost an eye when our waiter tried to open our bottle of champagne
I went on a Sunday Simple Supper night which for those of you not in the know is something they do on Sundays where there is a set menu of appetizer entree and dessert with a couple of options on the entree
The dessert was also nothing special- some sort of coffee flavored ice cream with some shortcakes which sounded better on paper than they tasted in my mouth- and I love ice cream
You could have told us this before we wasted 25 minutes of our lunch break in your stupid renovated not very good food house diner
This Whole Foods is just amazing I highly recommend it
We had food catered by Bobby Q's and it was so delicious and there were vegetarian options too
awesome wait staff delicious food and really strange atmosphere
The food was simple and delicious warm bread with garlic butter meat ravioli with red sauce and some lovely veal parm
We both agreed the meat was tender and flavorful
Although the meat is very tasty I did find it a little light on sauce and the sauce is good stuff
This is just another little hipster Sushi joint that blasts Trendy music and only hires Hot trendy waitresses
I got a scoop of basmati rice and enjoyed all four veggie dishes creamed spinach spiced lentils spiced cabbage and curried vegetables
If you're looking for some tastey food and don't want to pay much this a place worth stepping foot into
HOWEVER their salsa bar is top notch and their food is delicious
The staff is always very pleasant and the food is always good
The chicken fried steak and the gravy were good
I use to love Barrio Cafu00e9 but I got tired of their prices going up and the food quality and service going down so I stopped going there
2 soups - I tried the tomato soup & it was bad the paneer dishestikka masala & palak were good the chicken curry was watery & of mediocre tastethe tandoori chicken was good howeverthe dal makhani & basmati rice were too bland & the dessertsgulab jamun & rice pudding were just okay
They have an Excellent dog food  Better than Iams
I recommend this place to any foodie looking for a more exotic yet authentic meal
I was so impressed with the authenticity of the Oxacan food here that I have been back for more many many more tacos
All in all it was tasty fresh food and it was perfect for a fast lunch
All in all the food is good but the only part that really wowed me me was the smoothie
Corned Beef and Cabbage is also really good not as good as my Mom's but close
The food here is really good; I just wish the service lived up to how good the food was
I'd eat here again just because the food was good but I'd hope the service was better next time
The food was super yum we ordered the Kobe Beef and Kimchi dumplings which I recommend
When we come to Arizona we always expect good Mexican food - and this place did not disappoint
I also tried the chicken enchilada and that was good
A wide selection of choice meats smoked on site delicious sides home-made root beer and lemonade and a yard for the kids to play in make you feel like it's Sunday at Grandma's house
The charm of the old building the cheerfulness of the staff and the high quality of the food make Joe's Real BBQ a must visit for any barbecue lover and their entire family
The food is excellent AND it's a great place to hob-nob
Trendy place with a spectacular view and wonderful staff but food was trying too hard to be overly complex
- Bread and dip enjoyed the eggplant hummus with ginger and sesame along with the soft rolls spiced a bit on top- Chocolate rolled cake my other fave bite if the night
Although visually I was impressed by the snap peas being sliced open like birds of paradise flowers the cheese crisp was overly oily and not crisp at all and seemed out of place in the Asian infused dish
Petersburg potato appetizer its a smoked salmon dish
The service atmosphere wine and food were all pretty good
He took drink orders and recommended 2 appetizer specials  Eggplant rollatini and Oysters with spinach ricotta and bay shrimp in an alfredo sauce
I should have added cheese because it was a little on the plain side but the meat was moist and rich with beefy flavor
Green has such a wide variety of dishes and flavors that people are sure to find something they like
Not conservative with drinks and the food was pretty tasty
I just see it as another Panda Express or Baja Fresh - good ole American fast food
I have been here twice and the food has been good both times
Spring rolls were brought out right away and were very delicious with a very yummy peanut sauce
;-  Most indians turn their nose up to American Style Indian food anyways because it is certainly not hot/ spicy enough
The dessert was fabulous and capped off an amazing meal so well
They have wonderfully amazing food really that good
For a recommendation -- Sweet Potato Fries ***Honey Mustard Chicken Salad*** this is totally my fall-back it amazing
We got so many compliments on how beautiful our wedding was how nice all the employees were and how wonderful the food was
I had the seared yellow tuna over salad fish was a bit flavorless but the salad w/ sesame dressing was actually surprisingly tasty
If you're not the best BBQ-er or the best chef buying this quality of meat is a must if you want good steak
when i moved to Tempe i asked a few natives what pizza was good and they all said nello's
Since I am not a huge fan of gourmet pizza and the overabundance of toppings I checked the menu for a nice plate of delicious pasta
But it took awhile for our waitress to come over so I glanced at the pizzas and found a couple that sounded good too
All in all the pizza was pretty good once I picked off half of the toppings
I'm a fan of NYPD coz i think they have really good pizzas
Da Works is their version of supreme and their Cheese reminds me of pizza by the slice at any pizza place in Queens but not as good as the cheese at this pizza joint my family frequents in Whitestone NY
I was impressed at how nice the decor was in the main dining area since I had previously only frequented the bar and sampled some of the wretched Japanese inspired bar food
We ended the night with two dessert sampler platters and if you have more than at least three people at the table I highly suggest you take time out of your evening to indulge because it was way good
The cutie pie slice of Mexican chocolate flourless cake was rich and dense with a deep cocoa flavor and a hint of spiciness at the end that let it be a bit more unpredictable and memorable than regular chocolate desserts
The food is outstandingly delicious and addictive
I don't recommend coming here for the food especially if you're vegetarian but it is a nice place to enjoy a beer and hang out in a fun western environment
She uses grape tomatoes and that's what this sauce tasted like I enjoyed it I thought it added a nice flavor to the pizza
They have an amazing fig pizza delicious looking sushi and one of the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever tasted it's called the Better cookie with oatmeal milk chocolate and dark chocolate
Anyhow I still go to Paradise because the food IS tasty and their cookies are yummylicious
The food is fresh and tasty and the service is prompt and efficient
75 as are the pasta dishes and panini sandwiches recommend Santa Fe Chicken Panini $9
Best part- it's an escape from ordinary mall food and the food is so good that maybe you'll end up making a special trip here when not shopping at the mall
The daal was good as was the chicken curry
In addition to the curry there was a chicken roegonosh that was very good
The food had alot of flavor but was missing any heat
They've done a good job on the interior and the look of the place although a little cheesy to have the Eiffel Tower thing in the middle me thinks and I like the bar space but the food and service are not worth going out of your way for
I recommend just taking the main course home and going strait to dessert   Oh btw only open for dinner
The sauce on the enchiladas was really zesty and the spinach added a much needed freshness to the dish; rice and beans were also good
I went to phoenix to visit friends and they highly recommended this restaurant for authentic mexican food
I had the fish tacos baja style and they were very good
We also had the sarandeado fish fillet and it was delicious
We didn't realize that America's was going to be more like appetizer sized food that comes out in entree time
8 miles away as I was going to the Fiesta Bowl and I noticed that they had an ad about delivering food to the hotel
Like them I wasn't impressed with either the food or the famous sauce
More hype than good food an incompetent wait staff and nasty looking guys in the lounge does not look like a good time to me
However the corona & lime chicken tacos were excellent our server was knowledgeable about tequilas & able to find something for my hyper-picky best friend to eat & the margaritas were good enough that my generally thrifty friends ordered 3 each
We've been going to Nick's for a few years now- and the pizza and wings are ALWAYS delicious
They use Boar's Head meats and cheeses so the quality is pretty good way better than regular chain restaurants
What keeps me REALLY coming back is that the food has great flavor and doesn't even try
I've been to restaurants where you taste the food and its like they are trying very hard to make it taste amazing
Also I know the mac and cheese is pretty highly recommended but it really wasn't my thing and I generally love comfort food
com/food-wine/flavors-of-the-west/bringing-bison-back-00400000019838/Try adding it to your menu
The salmon was actually really good but the chicken was lacking in flavor
Choices were sushi Johnny Rocket Cold Stone and some other places
The chicken is of better quality than Chipotle's which is a nice change
Where The Living Room lacks is definitely in food quality
In all if you're looking for a place with great atmosphere and good finger type foods then this is the place for you
I love German food and as far as the food went at Bavarian Point they had some good eats
But the quality of the food was undercut by the poor service
It's too bad really because the food *was* good
For the most part I feel I can find more exotic produce and grocery items and better quality meats at Whole Foods and I really don't want it to be that way
Manila Sunrise Gourmet serves up unpretentious dishes filled with rich and hearty flavors
We got a good mix of dishes such as fried fish dinuguan stewed pork lechon kawali chicken curry and stewed jackfruit in coconut milk
Each dish had very good rich flavor and came with a hefty side of rice
Out of all the dishes I was most impressed with the dinuguan
This is my first time trying this dish and despite the sanguine origins it was really tasty
Unfortunately with time the staff is slipping and food quality has gone down
Still a great place with great food but it's gone from a highly recommend spot to a good place to go
The food has absolutely no flavor lacks salt lowreys seasoning black pepper garlic powder mind you these are staples in cooking soul food especially Fried Chicken
Just visited this place for the first time and the food is amazing
The meal comes with three juicy pieces of mouth-watering chicken and the flavor is the best I've had in valley
The biggest difference is that they suggest to put the sauce on last which gives the food a far better flavor
But the food is just as wonderful and gets to your table just as quickly as all the others
This Chinese is the best that I've found in this area and I have close to a half dozen places that are closer but non of them have make food so tasty flavorful and fresh like New Asian Kitchen always does
I also have used this as incentive for my staff and have brought Spinatos Pizza in for them - HUGE MOTIVATOR because it tastes so good
The dining areas were laid back and cozy while the bar was full with people ordering sushi and appetizers
Making good on the promise of the initial smell the food was VERY flavorful
The food is not superb but it Is pretty darn good
Aside from the food it's just one of those places that makes you feel good
They do chicken katsu really good here
Then again you can never put a price on good food
Service was amazing and the food was great
Jenny noticed I was openeing birthday cards and she and my husband whispered a negotiation on my free dessert - a chocolate and cream concoction that was yummy good
The Chicken Bulgulgi and Kalbi short rib were slightly underseasoned but their Neun Myon cold buckwheat pasta and their boba drinks milk-tea and Taro were outstanding
The other problem came when one of the customer ordered the grill meats which the restaurant did not have good ventilation system
That said the food were good and we will return soon
Someone recommended we try The Mission for it's delicious food and amazing atmosphere and we were certainly steered in the right direction
We ordered an array of appetizers to start and the street corn was literally one of the best dishes I've ever had
Cold A/CCons Food is pretty expensivePizza is Chuck E Cheese StyleWings are breaded and you get like 5 or 6 for $10 with a wilted stem of celery and some ranch dressingSalad was okay but its hard to see well enough to spear it properlyA good friend once said ever eat food you can't see
If good food and fair prices are your thing eat first drink first buy a group and spend $5
For my entree I had the tropical pineapple dish that was another amazing concoction of shrimp scallops and mussels in a sweet coconut curry sauce served in half a pineapple
I eat here quite often they have great food and a wonderful staff
They have a great menu with a variety of typical Asian dishes some deliciously unique cooked fish options and even a wonderful hamburger with some exceptionally yummy mix of regular and sweet potato fires
I have tried their salads sandwiches desserts and all were excellent
For low quality food those prices are unacceptable
If someone tells you this place has good food you can rest assured they either have no taste buds or actually like bad food
Actually mine would've been better this sandwich had what seemed like a very poor quality lunchmeat
But the experience was well worth it and the food was good love the ambiance and decor
The delivery people were always on time friendly and the food was fresh and tasty
It turned the sandwich into an amazing mush of fish capers onion cream cheese and tomato and at that point I was sold
r rSEARED SCALLOPS lobster cream sauce with a puff pastry of sauted fresh vegetables - My bf thought this was very good but not as good as the Beef Flemington
Despite how large the restaurant is the high quality of their dishes remain the same
LOVE the Chicken Bryan it's the only thing I've ever had to eat there besides the Lobster Ravioli which is also excellent
I wouldn't have minded the experience so much but about half of the table got their rolls a good 15-20 minutes before the other half did
Without a doubt while I didn't LOVE the food here it was tasty enough for me to come back again and give it another try
Way too bad because there's nothing like a good Vietnamese chicken broth
We bypassed the apps ordered Thai iced teas pretty good and made in-house as the glasses arrived with the tea & milk liquids just starting to intermingle a chicken/lemongrass bowl reported as refreshing and the beef stew tasty but tougher than I expected
The menu carries a good variety and the food is awesome
The owner is Italian you can still hear the accent and he makes all of his gelatos from scratch with the passion you would expect from an individual whose native culture centers around fresh delicious and satisfying food
See my review about Meekong Plaza- here's a snippet plus a few additions among the restaurants there MyLynn is my favorite- they have a happy hour Karaoke great hot-pot and table barbecue and crawfish Thurs-Sun
She loves Mexican food and I had heard about the great patio and delicious margaritas this place had
I highly recommend the Rigatoni D and Chicken Prosciutto
Shorts t-shirts sandals kind of places - but with good food
I will write a more detailed review later on if I ever try something other than the Cuban sandwich but it is so good I have flashbacks to when I lived in Florida and had the real deal Cuban food there
The food came out quickly and everything was really good
The food and service was good and we may return
This is definitely a delicious restaurant and I really appreciate their consideration for local and sustainable food products but it is a bit out of my price range
We also had a combination special with shrimp scallops and beef that was very good as well along with the minced vegetables as a side
I had the Chicken Roll-ups and they were cold pre-made and lacking in any culinary skill what so ever
Next up was a bit of a taster as I plated a scoop of Korean beef tasty with a kick but not worth a second go two saucy duck drumsticks very delicious and several steamed shrimp shao-mai 'lightest' tasting I've had of these five sufficed from the Asian stir fry section
This quaint little shop although it has been expanded has a wonderful vibe and you are able to see just how fresh their food is
I'll be back for more soup and to try some of the other recommended dishes
I love the sweet yogurty tartness of it with the flavorful spiciness of the dishes
For dinner I had the Lemon Rosemary Chicken and it was huge I couldn't finish half of it even I would say it was good not the best I have ever had
I was not ready for the hospitality and amazingly delicious food/wine served to us by Tanzy
Our first courses consisted of mozzarella fresh fruit selections and bruschetta beef carpaccio appetizer meats calamari - all of which were spectacular and what I expected from this taste
The fish was tender not a lot of seasoning which is the way fish is supposed to be enjoyed
Of course more importantly the not too skimpy but not too overbearing dishes were delicious
My wife got some kind of fried mexican pizza that was huge and delicious most of it is in my fridge this morning
I know how good that inferno sauce is ;Turns out the owners opened a new place recently for American food wine and rock-and-roll Rhythm and Wine
The prices are pretty good the food is also a favorite of mine
So excited to write this review- classy fun modern restaurant with 5 star service a creative menu and the food is oh-so good
Start to finish- five star resort service and food and I would know that's what I grew up dining on-So to start- beautiful decor huge wine selection higher end price wise but not bad at all for the quality and the menu
it was a meal in a roll light and delicious
-Others in my group hadThe Kobe burger- the prix fixe menu with the filet the wedge salad the featured pasta dish and the soup of the day which was a braised beef stew pineapple bread pudding the sorbet over pound cake the peanut butter cup- All of which everyone thoroughly enjoyed
Overall I would absolutely recommend this place for a date special occasion or if you're in the mood to be pampered with amazing food and a great dining experience
The food is delicious and fresh and I love almost everything that I've tried so far
The food is good I love the California Taco's the margarita's are fabulous I love the strawberry one's and the regular one's are so strong they make me sweat
The quality of the food varies due to non-standardization of the recipe
The FLAVORS are incredioble the meat spicy and frangrant - the beans creamy and rich
All in all very good Sonoran food quick service fair prices and an overall great experience
The quality of the food and the friendly family feeling service is great
I ordered the 2 meat combo rib tips and hot links
Not your typical trendy breakfast resturant but delicous enogh to gorge yourself on some pretty good food at some pretty good prices
I highly recommend this place to those of you green local friendly natural food goers
The first time I ate here I didn't have a memorable experience because the food was not bad but there are so many good taco shops and Mexican food restaurants in central Phoenix that are less expensive
next had the chicken boti with rice and the beef kabob with the afghani rice with carrot and raisins  Both were wonderful and tasty
Complex flavors yet still had a comfort food feel which I loved
Hubby had fish and chips and enjoyed them but decided they were a bit bland
The BBQ Chicken pizza enjoyed by brother and his wife was good though it was served about 8 minutes after everyone else's food since the first one got burned
Apparently he was vegan for a bunch of years vegetarian for a bunch more and now just has the occasional meat to check out the quality in the restaurant
The food is simple and everything is tasty
Food quality is across the board extremely high there are moderate exceptions in some courses however through the exceptional highs that are reached in some moments it does not even seem worthy of consideration as a negative
Once again the experience of a restaurant vastly outweighs the food on it's own in other words takeout isn't as good as being here
When the food was brought out to the cafeteria-style dining area it looked just as good as expected
The place is not recommended dine in as it gives me the feeling of an indoor version of one of them mobile food wagons with some fold out benches setup
It tasted good but not the best pizza I ever had
The food is fresh flavorful and served in generous portions
The other dishes on the menu while tasty are a little on the expensive side for me $10-$12 and not in portions large enough to justify spending that much
Everything that we ordered peel n' eat shrimp tortilla soup jambalaya fish tacos and the cheeseburger in paradise were excellent
Excellent authentic Chinese food quick and friendly service and just about as cheap as it is possible for a restaurant to be
For mains we had a spicy shrimp dish and the eggplant spareribs both delicious
We have always loved their food but I think it's going to be a very long time before we can go back there and we will not recommend this place to anybody again
The Big Buddha Roll which we shared was very very tasty
Both the Buddha Roll and Best of Asia were $12 a piece the former totally worth it; the latter not
This is a bit pricey considering where it's located but not over priced for the food quality
As soon as you step in through the door you get indulged by all the wonderful BBQ smells and you also hear how others' in their table are cooking up their own meats and veggies
It was a good full that we got after consuming all our food and not a fatty full
Kona Grill is a chain which makes me want to give them only 3 stars but considering their food is quality they offer a fun atmosphere and their service is decent
From 3 - 7 they offer 1/2 off a small menu of appetizers sushi rolls pizzas and drinks
I can't speak for the pizzas I've never tried them but the potsticker appetizer is great and so is the sushi
Full of onions spices and great flavor I order this dish with a side of jasmine rice
I highly recommend Sens especially with a small group which will allow for trying more dishes and flavors
I got medium heat with some trepidation since I can not eat extemely hot food
If you like your food really hot I would get hotter
If I'm going to pick a dessert worthy of dreams the answer is not likely to be brownies
We spent 3 hours there and did not once feel as though we were being pressured to move on with our orders for drinks appetizer dinner and dessert
No matter how the food is presented or tastes to us this makes all the difference in what can be a good experience or great experience
The service food and atmosphere were the foundation of our excellent evening
we also had the lemongrass beef salad which was equally good
Food = not that many buffet options but everything they did have was very good
First let me say that the food really is quite good including the coffee and I am a snob
The Happy Hour is such an amazing deal for a ton of food
My dad got the paella which was pretty spicy but had great flavors and my mother got the chicken which was good
I enjoyed the food but the surly slow service coupled with the expensive menu items make this spot a poor value in spite of the lovely old house and charming patio in which the restaurant is situated
The food as always is fresh served quickly and delicious
I don't think thier food is that good and I've found other alternatives to them to eat healthy if I choose
All of the dishes were of generous portions and extremely flavorful
The food is delicious and offers a new dining experience - atleast it did for me
The brick oven gives the pizza a natural full flavor homemade style taste that makes you slow down and enjoy every bite
Parking is not the best and valet is not really needed but they very much have top shelf alcohol and delicious food to boot
Easy walkable access to food and drinks before or after a game is just good thinking
HOWEVER for the price the sushi is pretty good
I have not had much experience with thin crust pizza but I did like it - in fact that is the one thing I will remember about Sauce - that the crust on their pizza was delicious
Everyone else at my table enjoyed there food and the wings looked very good but after trying that chicken I won't be ordering anything but wings and beer
while their pizza is delicious and the commuter sandwich is bomb
Last time I was in Phoenix we went again and while the quality of the food has maybe slid a bit since I was 5  um I'm kinda a LOT older now it is still cool
The portions a huge but who cares if the food isnt good
Friendly service and consistently good food
They make your food to order and it is really good
I never mind waiting for the excellent pizza served next door at Pizzeria Bianco because it is always a treat to order some appetizers here
Even though you may think that you need to go into Pizzeria Bianco with an empty stomach so you can have as much pizza as possible it would be a mistake to not try some of the amazingly fresh and tasty things off the Bar Bianco menu
It included a very dense and good egg drop soup an egg roll that was piping hot and a flaky exterior a cream puff that was pretty much just cream cheese but was decent a large scoop of rice and the entree
I think the curry chicken is perfect for those not used to knock-your-socks-off spicy; it's still full of flavor
The food was pretty good I would not go back to order the Margharita pizza again but I'll definitely go back to check out the rest of the menu
No regrets about the food it was good the salad was $14 which was good but not 14 bucks good
The pizza is worth the trip and the money
i give it 4 stars because the food was good enough that I'll definitely go back to taste the rest of that good sized menu but not 5 because it wasn't upto par with other pizza ive had around the area
2 out of 3 of the food items we ordered were severely lacking in quality and taste
I gave it 2 stars though because the service was good and we didn't have to wait long for our food at all
we've tried some appetizers; the chicken satay and the spring rolls
The food was actually very good and the portions were generous
The salmon was great and I'm told by others in my party the fish and chips were good also
The meat had a nice flavor but I left the head sucking for someone else
They serve at least 2 Korean beers OB & Cass and they're both worth trying out and each goes well with the food
So far I've tried the followingGoat Cheese Appetizer - Generous portion size with fresh herbs and sauceMeatballs - Another huge portion size with lot's of flavorVeggie Flatbread - A vegan dish you won't miss the cheese on this oneMarket Vegetable - This was broccoli with a lemon aioli and bread crumbs I normally don't like broccoli but devoured this one
Overall the food is quality and a great value
A good place to meet every so often plus good food
It is my go-to place in Westgate for some good beer and delicious food
We had fantastic service I loved the proprietary wine selection the pinot noir was especially good and the food was delicious
We were quite surprised at how good the food was
Lastly the service was speedy and the food came out nice and hot
There is no other chain store in the Valley that can touch the quality of the meat poultry and fish here no antibiotics no hormones mostly grass-fed
The service was friendly and the food was   tasty
My recommendation is to pay a bit more and actually enjoy your food and not struggle to finish
I should have ordered the cod or the sushi because they looked amazing
The food is good and the selection of organic and specialty items is nice
I enjoyed the chix strips they were not greasy and actually had a good amount of chicken
I had the Gallina Frita which was excellent but a huge amount of food for one person
The shredded chicken was succulent and rich with caramelized onions and other flavors and the side dishes were good but not extraordinary
Overall our meal including appetizer and dessert took slightly more than 2 hours although the restaurant was not at all busy when we got there there were maybe 3 other tables seated
Probably won't ever go back unless it's for happy hour since this place is just so expensive but the food was quite good
When I was finished with my entree which was good and filling she came up to me with a plate of some unknown Arabic dessert I'd never had before and shyly asked if I'd like to have some for free
The food arrived quickly and was pretty good
Although the food was hot the cheese was melted and everything was executed well there was nothing about the food that made you crave it like Los Dos Molinos
The chicken was very tasty and similar to Tandoori Chicken
I didn't personally try the food but it did look good
Absolutely outstanding amazingly tasty meats
I just moved to Phoenix from Seattle and I'm missing my delicious Asian food a lot
The Thai food is AMAZING and the lunch deals are great
I've had amazing fried calamari in the coast of CA and in Spain and this dish was shameful sorry
As far as food goes we have many favorites- quesadillas nachos  messy but good  hot chocolate chip cookies and sliders
Let it be known the food was very good
The only issue that I took with the food was that they microwaved my hot sub
I usually pop in here for lunch but the flavors from the food the the ambiance reminds you of New Orleans
One thing that they make really good is the Catfish sandwich crispy on the outside with a side of coleslaw
Pretty tasty food i recommend Chipotle often for people on the go or when we have limited time
Sometimes there is a rush of people and it gets insanely crazy with limited seating and long lines however the food is still fresh and full of flavor
Highly recommend if you have to have fast food
The dishes on the lunch buffet were standard but they lacked the vigor that good Indian food has
The food was ready very quickly and the total price was good for the area around $10 for the three items
They serve up some pretty darn delicious food too
On the flip side the food is pretty good and the Micheladas are delicious
I have enjoyed each visit to the Fish Market
Our bill was $55 for three sandwiches and one beer which wasn't too bad considering the quality of the food and the portion size
and the most important attribute the quality of the food authentic tasting and looking fown tothe last taco bite
The service was terrific and the food very good
Both were delicious and I thought the meatballs were phenomenal
Again both dishes were delicious and the portion size of the chicken was more than my wife could finish so we left with an extra meal in hand
From the carnitas yum to the carne asada awesome to their fish & shrimp offerings everything I've had there is delicious
Everything was excellent but there were several dishes worth an extra mention
The seasonal salad was super fresh and full of veggie goodness including crisp slices of watermelon radish
I would say the best trait about Chuhgajib is their consistency in service and quality in their food
They are very tasty and have a variety of choices such as Pork Beef and Dumplings
The red green and panang curries are all awesome and the three colored fish has a very unique sweet flavor
a peanut flavored sauce on thin slices of beef that is nothing like any Ram or Rama dish I have tried at any other Thai establishment
They deep fry the FRESH chicken wings then turn them in the sauce many different flavors to choose from including suicide a little mix of all and then throw them on the grill
While I still like Flavors of India here I found a fairly large number of the dishes today to be soupy which is not my preference so I'm going to drop this one down to 3 Stars
With that said the Tandoori Chicken was good as was the Chicken Kandhari & the Chicken Makhni
I would and have recommend it to my friends and any body out there who is looking for food that is fresh local and just plain divine
Ordered the chicken nachos as an appetizer and although they were huge the chicken was bland and had no flavor
sure seems like if you're gonna shell out $6 for a bottle of water you ought to be washing down something more tasty than the corporate factory food offerings there are in SAN DIEGO
I am still on the look out for good non gourmet pizza downtown
This place is a great little hole-in-the-wall type of joint where you can go for good food as long as you can stomach the neighborhood and the dive-ish look and feel of the restaurant
Yes the tables have glass tops and the place is a run down re-purposed looking space that obviously had seen better days but the food is worth the compromise
A good analogy would be your mom's meatloaf or lasagna
The quality is a a giant step above fast food and the service is fast
Nevertheless its all about the delicious food here
You can stuff yourself with some pretty tasty appetizers and sushi rolls or sake bomb the work day away for some wallet welcoming prices
Their dinner is alright and some rolls aren't really worth the full price tag
Cold unfriendly service my martini overflowing therefore spilling as I attempted to sip and then acceptable but not extraordinary food
I'm not a huge fan of food chains but Grand Lux is pretty good
I prefer a traditional fire oven pizza but this is good for what it is
We cooked the pizza and enjoyed the pizza very much
I will say that my partner enjoyed her chicken dish which actually came out at the spice level she asked for
Have had the pizza and some other pastas too which are also very delicious
I got the soup and sandwich combo everything was delicious chicken was fresh and not overloaded with mayo broccoli cheese soup was perfect
The food at the reception was wonderful and surpassed my expectations
We'll give the food another go- if it's another miss we can always have our entrees at nearby Pita Jungle or the wonderful Haji-Baba and then head over here for the delicious ice cream it comes with these cute and tasty sugar cookies that add a nice crunch to the treat
But the quality of the food is really secondary to the location
Joe's delivers great value despite the high prices because the food is that good
For some reason I'd avoided the BBQ chicken pizza for a long time probably because I've had others that weren't so hot
The sides are terrific the beans the slaw the fries are all very tasty and the only problem is that there is just too much food I ended up bringing home 1/2 my sandwich again today
I don't recommend this place to any body that actually knows what good food is what good ambiance is and what good service is
That whole bit is good for a laugh every time I drop in but it doesn't take away from the fact that the food here is nothing to shake a stick at
Throw in the amazing food and nothing but the classiest service and I dare you not to have a fantastic evening
the coconut curry chicken was amazing
pad ped with chicken could have be a notch spicier ask for thai hot when you order so you can feel your intestines burn but the red curry paste it came in was extremely tasty
-Good kim chi sold by the restaurant/fresh foods stand just inside the store in what would usually be a deli section-Decent foreign beer selection especially Russian beers
Took forever to get our appetizer and took forever to get our food
I have to admit though they have consistently good food
But there were a significant amount of GNATS flying around us all night long gross I won't go back no matter how good food or service
This is one of my regular Vietnamese spots for two things and they arefried rice not on the menu& chicken curry noodle soupTheir fried rice is OH SO GOOD and greasy reminds me of Chinatown fried rice in the Philippines and in Malaysia the ones you get from the hawker stand
and the Chicken Curry noodle soup with the rice noodle the richness of the coconut and the thickness of the curry gravy mixed in with the rice noodle and the chunks of chicken with a little spice mmmm that's good eating
The food smelled delicious so I decided it was probably worth it to stay and give them the chance to woo me
The mint pepper chicken dinner plate was amazing
It bursted with flavor from healthy white meat chicken pieces fried with light skin no breading water chestnut and sweet juicy pineapple chunks
Often I leave other locations with one or two extra meals for the same price and food quality
The chicken fingers are in one word  AMAZING
Overall this place is where you want to go when you are craving some of those delicious little chicken fingers that everyone loves
While the appetizers and desserts are yummy I've can easily have similar items as delicious at much cheaper restaurants
My girlfriends and I wanted to hit up somewhere close to home for some good food and drink
The crab dip is amazing as was the pulled pork sandwich meatloaf sandwich po'boy and jambalaya
I thought the food was good not amazing but better than some of the other posters made it sound
My son enjoyed his pizza so if he eats - I'm happy
I could only take a few bites the meat was tough the sauce was unpleasant and the lack of salad type variety made it like eating a bowl of chili but not as good
Tab for two people for dinner and two drinks each was $70 too high for the mediocre quality of the food
If it wasn't for the pretty good food I'd give the place 1 star
I don't know if it's somewhere I'd go for a date or great food but it's pretty good
Another person said the chicken ceasar salad was good as well
If the food wasn't good and they didn't keep sending me two-for-one coupons I wouldn't go here
Salmon with Wild Blueberry Sauce - GREAT salmon for the price - blueberry sauce was really tastyBeef Short Rib - Very very tender beef
Citrus Crusted Chicken - Pretty good for a chicken dish
Dessert - pretty tasty chocolate/caramel fondue - came with very fresh fruit
I strolled through last night and was impressed with the shoe department
A delicious quick fix when I'm hungry and they have quite variety of pizza
The hot dog is extra fatty and greasy the BBq chicken sandwich is overpowered with sauce and grizzle
I'd rather go to Thai House which is further away to get Thai food - their portions are well worth the money there
On the upside the dessert did have a really tough act to follow; the cocktails were amazing the appetizers scrumptious the main course delicious and the service excellent
There is just nothing like a dish that presents such dimension of flavors and delights the palette
Despite the sad ending to our meal I would highly recommend you give this place a try just skip dessert
The food came within 20 minutes and was piping hot
The food is as amazing as the service and I highly recommend getting a corn pup with mustard NEVER ketchup and an Aiko dog with beer hot or as I am trying to get it renamed the Baiko
Do yourself a favor and DO NOT miss this amazing little food truck
Don't stress if there is a line the SLD crew does not screw around- and the food is more than worth it
The food was mediocre but the service was good
The first time we came we fell in love with that appetizer by itself and just enjoyed the other items we ordered sushi / steak
Not enough alcohol and the Sangria which is top-notch at Bistro tasted more like red Kool Aid-Food - not so good
I must say I wasn't terribly impressed with the pizza
It was pretty good but Nello's pizza didn't really distinguish itself from any of the hundreds of other pizza places in the Valley
The pizza is good the prices are good and it's a fun casual spot
my corned beef cabbage was served paper thin without bread or butter; but it was still very tasty
Crazy Jim's I've never meet him but his foods crazy good
I ordered the shrimp Kung pao with lots of good veggies and the heat did not overwhelm the dish nor did the sauce take away from the flavor of the shrimp
The egg drop soup was great and my husband's dish of shrimp and rice was very filling flavorful and healthy
Shame on me for expecting a good mixed drink at a sushi place but it was like 100 degrees and I just wanted a mojito
It came on a thin tortilla with cheese ground beef onion and a slice of green chili on each slice I enjoyed the chili
The service here was pretty good but the food left a lot to be desired
Every time I go I manage to find something good to eat as there are endless choices of food to eat and its all pretty good
We have been here a few times and each time the food has been high quality and really good
Our table ordered a half-and-half Reuben a jumbo philly cheese steak and my order the James Cagney a beef brisket sammich on an onion roll with coleslaw and some amazing chunky fries on the side
I would recommend it to people who aren't too familiar with Thai food and want to start out easy
Mind you this is Japanese/Mexican fusion not Korean but the idea is the same delicious combinations of Asian-spiced meats and pickled vegetables transformed into an amazing street taco
My buddy and I each had a three-taco sampler one of each chicken pork and beef for $10 along with some tasty craft brew at Sleepy Dog Brewery
Wayne but that is ok we still enjoyed the show we had and the food was good
Fortunately I was with a group and got to try the green curry and lemon grass chicken which was pretty tasty
I really enjoyed the soup that came with the lunch special I ordered mango chicken
The mango chicken was really delicious and I made sure to order it mild
I will definitely come back for it's convenience quick service and good food
The food was good and plentiful none of us could  finish our meal
The food was flavorful but of the hot dishes I tried only about 20% were hot
I might go back but I will definitely wait a few months to see if they get over the ew restaurant issues and figure out a game plan to adequately serve the guests and maintain HOT food
The Thai Chicken Pizza was very good- thai peanut sauce red onions chicken and cheese
The fish was good but as I ate it I couldn't help but wonder if it was any better than what I could have gotten somewhere else
Since the boyfriend doesn't drink he ordered food I sampled appetizers and wine
Meaning the hot dishes come out first or your apps come out last and Hana is no different
For 8 people the food and tip were right about $220 not bad for really good sushi
Prices are great the portions are abundant and the food is tasty
I've seen employees come in from a smoke break and start touching food without washing their hands; I've had delivery show up on time but still somehow warm or cold-ish; and I will bet money that if you call them regardless of what time of day it is you will get put on hold
I love their food and tasty drinks but I would love them even more if it didn't take 15 plus minutes to be greeted and/or have a drink order taken after sitting down
It isn't easy to find good sushi in Phoenix
They have some creative appetizers including the Asian Nachos which are essentially nachos with sour cream and chicken and guacamole but instead of tortilla chips they use fried wontons
I have had good service and poor service but will keep returning for the food
I order the hot wing or buffalo chicken pizza what ever it was called I didn't realize it was going to have the whole top of the pizza covered in ranch
This place makes amazing food from Uzbekistan a country from Middle Asia actually right on the Caspian Sea
Lagman which is a noodle and beef soup was very flavorful and hearty
The meat was so juicy smoky and flavorful
Vienna Beef turned me on to hot dogs can't go wrong
I wasn't even a hot dog lover until I moved to Chicago and had my first taste of a Vienna Beef hot dog
Not so fancy but the food rocks and the place is clean and it's a hot dog stand
The pizza is excellent try the santa fe pizza but ask for extra corn the staff isn't overly friendly or rude
The food is very cheap most items under $6 for a lot of very good flavorful food
Theres an amazing Whole Foods just down the street too
The dressing on the Picasso salad tastes like a delicious Mexican party in your mouth and the salad itself has so many wonderful ingredients including a very delicious slightly spicy fajita chicken
I definitely recommend that dish for anyone who haven't tried Chelsea's Kitchen
The cheese and smoked meat board was really good
The chicken had good flavor and was pretty tender this is what I mostly ate
The buffet also contained basmati rice fluffy and flavorful Dolmas hubs said these were okay salad that was very tasty and filled with veggies falafel little bits of heaven steak and chicken shawarma very very flavorful
I only order the catfish and fries as that seems to always be delicious and my favourite  it grows on you and when you want hot catfish this is the place to go
Sometimes nicer places have really small portions and seem to pay more attention to how pretty the dish is instead of how good it is but this place was spot on with both presentation and taste
My first two experiences were solidly mediocre -- nothing was awful but aside from one delicious dessert black sticky rice with pumpkin custard nothing stood out either
The chicken didn't stand out as being of particularly low quality but the noodles were some of the worst I've had at a Thai restaurant some bites were underdone to the point of being crunchy while others were seriously soggy
The beef was the last straw for me; it very may well have been the worst quality most gristly meat I've had at any restaurant I've ever been to
A dear friend of mine had been telling me forever about how wonderful the pizza was here
it was so crowded that some people had to stand to eat their food and it was soooo damn worth it
We are so used to fiery Tex-Mex here in Arizona that it is hard to believe that there is another side to good Mexican food
They make their bread fresh daily & desserts just as often so as you can imagine it smelled wonderful in there
Both desserts were amazing & I loved them both equally
After more than 10 years in the business still they have maintain the food quality and the cleanliness of this place
There are dozens of sushi places in Phoenix where you can get sushi at least as good as Pure for half the cost
And if nothing catches your fancy or are off-limits to you for some reason there is always the hot food buffet to check out
The food was excellent quality and everything was fresh and from scratch
The savory and dessert crepe we had were both excellent
Worth the drive if you like this type of food probably not if you don't
The fries were over seasoned and the chicken was dry but the fish in the fish and chips was good
Rounding up to 5 stars for the fresh tasty and inspired dishes that aren't too creative or Americanized
Since the menu was fixed but I wasn't crazy about the desserts offered I asked if I could make a change and he let me-had the Warm Chocolate Cake and it was AMAZING
Everything was delicious and we tried several dishes
It is worth checking out if you are in the mood for a fresh take on fried fast foods
Here is what we ordered*Thai Spring Rolls - these were excellent as was the dipping sauce which had a nice kick to it
The chicken was good but the beef was just eh
We didn't send it back because I don't like doing that and maybe this was a sign to try the chicken because it is amazing
Anyway the dish had good flavor but it was eh
the food has almost always been delicious with the exception of one botched sweet chicken lavosh pizzabit burnt
The food has remained delicious and the lunch specials are priced right the lamb vindaloo I had there on 4th July was awesome but there's something that pissed me right off when I ordered takeout recently
That's WAY too expensive no matter how tasty the food is
When I can get three pounds of Chinese food for under $20 see my review of Chen & Wok in Surprise paying double that for less food doesn't strike me as a particularly good deal
The service was wonderful the food was amazing and I dont know anywhere downtown I could walk away full but still feeling healthy for $5
Delivery of my dinner was not delayed the food was warm quite good quality and well prepared
Until I ordered from Truckin' Good Food I was a crepe virgin
My favorites are definitely the Chinese Chicken Salad with 3 of the most wonderful huge shrimp as a side dish
We came in to get their special which was a half appetizer a 3 topping 10 inch pizza and a dessert for 18$ which I saw online earlier today
Anyway after our app came out which was good we waited another 20 min or so until we had to ask for our pizza to just be boxed up along with our dessert because we were 'in a rush
I loved that they also sold east coast desserts TastyCakes which I had never had and liked and chips
The food was good and the service was good but it was not exceptional
Even though we'd already eaten I always like to look at menus to see if it's a place worth coming to for food
Their menu looked excellent with some very unique takes on typical bar food
The atmosphere the quality of the food the excellent service
What really works about this place is that the food is as good as the wine you can order
We ordered a bottle of wine the brie pear & onion jam bruschetta appetizer and a grilled chicken panini sandwich
Everything was wonderful although the chicken panini wasn't truly a panini it was still delicious
They have a very diverse crowd from 20's to 60's a great ambiance and delicious food
Since we were close to Chandler we hit this location rather than the original Phoenix location but the food and concept was the same so it's all good
It's been written many times before how this place works so there's not much to add other than the food is actually really really good
All white meat chicken the flavors were good and the Jade chicken was the shizzle
We went for dinner and had steak-nice selection of food on the menuand a good selection of sidesbut the steaks were just ok
With the robata grill cranky out delicious chared meats and the sushi line shouting greetings you are immediately drawn into this restaurant
The meat was delicious and cooked perfectly and the melted cheese and added condiments/ingredients supplemented the flavor of the meat without being overwhelming
I'm a sucker for a good plate lunch so it doesn't take much for me to check out a place that serves Hawaiian food
The chicken was cooked well and had a good flavor but I would have liked more sauce on it
The pizza's looked really good and I will be back to try them
Maybe next time if they throw anchovies and rice cake on their side dishes I'd be impressed
The place is fun the food is good  and the price is great
y husband had the chicken salad and enjoyed it
I ordered a pepperoni and jalapeno pizza and 20 hot wings
I think it would be good on raviolis or spaghetti but it was much too thick to be on a pizza for my taste
I may have been spoiled from all the amazing pizza joints popping up in the valley the last decade
We were both quite full after the meal but there was nothing terrible remarkable for either of us my food tasted as if it sat in the window for a while the eggs were lukewarm and the potatoes were almost cold to the touch as was the toast
The black and bleu burger looked good maybe next time I'll skip the pickles and go for the beef
Dick's and the related restaurant Richardson's are excellent - probably the best New Mexican food I've had outside of New Mexico of course - they are always tops on my list when choosing a restaurant
Service has always been excellent and the food memorable
The miso horseradish glazes is just what the dished needed to bring the flavors together
Barbacoa a slow-simmered and spiced shredded beef is elegant in its flavors and its tenderness
The salsa from the standard but fresh pico de gallo to the roasted corn salsa to the hot with seeds and green mediums are all a perfect compliment to any and all of the meats and you can experiment around as you see fit
Quick gourmet plates of saucy goodness with just the right amount of spice and flavor that would make us talk about the trucks for weeks counting the days until they rolled onto that welcoming asphalt off Raintree Drive again
The quality of the food is secondary to the insufferable noise level
Used to come here every Sunday now it's less frequent but the food is as good as ever
Overall I was impressed with the look and feel of the place - there's a very atural vibe carried through the decor and open air/sunlight that enhances the food
The food was on the pricey side but the quality was apparent
I had the chicken panang curry which was tasty with fresh ingredients and well cooked but I agree with the other reviewer that the ratio of sauce to rice seems off and too soupy
This is a very nice place to bring a love one for a date night Located in downtown Phoenix Cibo has great customer service and their pizza is DELICIOUS
For  not much I got a drink  plus a bean cheese and rice burrito with a fire roasted chicken leg and a chicken taco that were tasty and filling
If you get them with veggies you'll find that the veggies are a little oddly cut for the dish so I recommend some other topping
The Food Charleen's creative local-focused uber fresh cuisine features a short menu that is anything but on flavor
The chicken is moist flavorful and pairs perfectly with the texture and simplicity of the spaetzle
As tasty as the quality of beef was it wasn't the best I have had and wasn't worthy of the $50 dollars that I paid for
This is a family owned business that is focused on food quality and service
I unwrapped the first fresh roll and bit into it it was delicious the rice paper was thinner than I'm used to which made the roll a much more enjoyable texture
They didn't use as much mint or shrimp as I'd like so next time I'm probably going to get just veggie ones they weren't worth paying two dollars more for two small shrimps per roll
This restaurant is really close to my house and the food was good
With that said Oregano's does a good job at attempting to duplicate the Deep Dish Chicago Style Pizza
Nevertheless I like it and it's good for my Chicago Pizza Fix
The information above is for those of you who care about the quality of the food etc
Overall good quality food OK quality drink decent value for your money
I'm not sure why anyone would go to some big chain place when the food is fairly priced and so delicious here
However it's tasty high quality and I had more than enough food
She said the peanut sauce was good and the chicken okay but the salad was all iceberg lettuce
It was akin to chewing a meat-flavored hockey puck
The only good point foodwise was the dessert
And if that isn't crazy enough the salmon roll my mom had was actually amazing
But it's good for groups because you can choose from among various mediterranean items burgers pizza and more
It's not fancy just solid delicious food
Their gyro meat is flavorful tender and not dried out
Surprisingly the made to order pizzas are really good too
I have always started with sweet potato fries with Hula's own mouth watering sauce as an appetizer because you can not go their without trying this dish
Overall the food and drinks were very tasty and definitely worth going back for
Spring rolls are also tasty but I like the ones at Pho Bang better
The longer the line the more reassured I am the the food is likely to be good
I was half-way gone before I can start on the pizza so I don't remember too many specifics but I do remember that it was good
Came here for some pho and spring rolls after hearing this place recommended by some co-workers
The places that look like their housing criminals but you can't help but forgive it because the food is oh-so-good
I was really hoping the food was good
I told myself if the food was good I can live with it
They usually have a good band and the food is excellent
Of course I wanted the food to be as authentic and as amazing as possible to complete the evening
I also got an assortment of desserts and they were all amazing
So my party was a total success and I give credit to this deli for delivering quality food that is rich with flavor and freshness
True food offers a variety of healthy delicious choices
So believe it or not we had room for dessert and tried the Apple-Cranberry Crumble with dairy-free maple flavor ice cream
That was also pretty good but then again I usually never disagree with dessert
Another selection that sounded good until the plate arrived is the Malibu Chicken sandwich Your standard Tyson chicken breast on a roll with a slice of Oscar Mayer ham and some rubberish cheese
Please let someone renovate this place - it could be a real gem with a good menu solid food sourcing and a staff that cares more
Usually when you roll something this good it's illegal
As for the rest of the food it was not worth the money or the calories
I may have found a new fav with good New Mexican food
We ordered spring rolls hot and sour soup general tsos and
So I think it's worth a try if you like sushi without pretention
Shared the ahi chipotle citrus bites and the catfish beignets among several people and both were write-home-about delicious
It's the worst buffet quality food without the inconvenience of having to get up and get more
DO NOT EAT HERE IF YOU KNOW WHAT GOOD FOOD TASTES LIKE
Don't judge this place by any other criteria than the taste and quality of the food although my pork tenderloin could have used a bit more seasoning salt
Good pub food is a lovely thing to have downtown especially when Seamus is a regular after-work stopping point
The service is polite the food is very good and the price is reasonable
All their food is beyond good--not just for bar food but better than most sit-down restaurants
Its usually crowded but good food and beer tend to do that to a restaurant and the wait is comparatively short for a table
Granted I just came here after yoga class so my chi was already happy but the food really was tasty
food - tasty burgers as far as fast food goes i think they have a tasty Caloricly suicidal burger
After trying quite a few of the hot dishes I ended up enjoying a few of them
Finding high quality sushi in the Phoenix area has been a challenge for me as most of the places I get referred to are a bit too Americanized for my liking
Save your palette and your money and go elsewhere if you are looking for good clean sushi
Their quality would not match some of the 4 and 5 stars that I have given out but the food was good and the place is like a nice 50s drive in type
However if you're looking for a broad variety of good Thai food cooked to your liking at a very reasonable price come on in and pull up one of the leatherette bar stools
Start out with an order of spring rolls deep fried and served with a slightly sweet sauce or fresh rolls shrimp rice noodles and vegetables wrapped in rice paper and served cold with peanut sauce
The yellow curry is mild yet richly flavored while the Panang curry has more of a bite but none of the harshness than can mar some spicy foods
I've been here 10-15 times and always really enjoyed the food here
Atmosphere yeah right there is none just good food
The pizza was hot and fresh and tasted incredible
When the pizza did arrive it was cold and the box was smashed
Each dish comes with a side salad with the most amazing tangy rich dressing I think I will have to purchase a bottle of the dressing next time I'm there
The food was a little more out of the box than we expected but good
But the staff is friendly and food is delicious
Food Quality -  the quality of the ingredients they use is noticeably lower than typical restaurant quality fare
This place is quaint and friendly with a great variety of drinks and interesting appetizers both meat and vegetarian
So three stars - pros great happy hour menu happy hour goes till 8 till 9 until Sept 30th good food
The food was way over priced for it's quality
The rice is great and the chicken and other entrees are as good as any other rice bowl restaurant
probably not the best quality but the rice and veggies are really fresh the food is tasty and the service comes with a smile
Not only is her food delicious but she is very friendly and welcoming with her customers despite the fact that she is a very busy lady
As well as an appetizer of Vietnamese Spring rolls
The staff is wonderful great selection of drinks but the food is just
The fresh rolls were fat and delicious and I liked that they had both shrimp and tofu in them
It tasted pretty much like a standard interpretation of the dish nothing mind-blowing but definitely tasty and definitely worth a repeat visit on my next trip here
Fiance usually gets the meateater and I've taken a bite of it and it's also very tasty
This place is one of my favorites to bring anyone who would like to have great Mexican food that knows what good Mexican food tastes like
you can watch them preparing the delicious food
Even if the food tasted like crap and no I don't have first hand experience of what actual crap tastes like but I can imagine it would be a good deal
we've done D&B several times now and though it's been enjoyable it's always fun with good friends with drinks and games I find that it is a waste of $ and their food isn't even worth going in for dinner
Oh I came here for one purpose and one purpose only for their wonderful sweet and fancy looking desserts - especially the huge macaroons
However even if they did serve it on the bread I liked I'm not sure I would still like it because it the duck meat wasn't very good and it was a bit over drizzled with olive oil and there was absolutely no walnuts
oi the pastry case was filled with a good number of enticing desserts such as cupcakes different flavored eclairs tartes and mousse
Overall perhaps next time I would pick a better sandwich or even try their delicious looking quiche but definitely would come here for the desserts  However I must say they are pretty expensive
I'm on the constant hunt for good Chinese food in Phoenix
The lemon cake was tasty but I get the impression that the desserts are not made on site
The food menu looks good and the chef assured me that the soup was made fresh every day
The food is fast and it's actually good- giving you a great alternative to any other fast food joints out there
But it isn't just good food management  servers and even their valet guys understand what good service is
Good selection of sushi joints and I'm a sucker for a clean Walmart central phx ones are scary as shit
It is dark and dated but the food is delicious heavy and copious
There were 3 skewers and the morsel of chicken on each amounted to little more than 2 good sized bites
The quality of the food was good overall with nice curries and fresh ingredients
The prices were good but I didn't try the food
They have a good menu selection of typical Arizona mexican food
Makes me realize how spoiled I am to have good Mexican food at my doorstep and all of the great joints in The Mission
Pretty good food somewhat smaller portions probably what we should be eating
The food is excellent the rice noodle bowls Pho Vientamese beef or chicken soups and fried rice dishes
While I highly recommend the Red Curry with Chicken above all other dishes; their Green Curry is also excellent and comes in at #2 for my favorite and #3 is definitely their Spring Rolls
The best part about the Spring Rolls is that they come with a very light sweet and spicy yet flavorful dipping sauce
I ordered fish and it was really good can't recall which one sorry--white fish of some sort And it came with their little salad bar option
We noticed the cheese selections on the dessert menu and they looked good
Little bit of Asian Italian and French flavors dished out in a safe manner
Service is very good with our server explaining each dish as they hit the table
I realized I broke a self-imposed rule with my previous review of this place I sampled and thoroughly enjoyed a pasta dish and then added this place to my Pizza list
The cheese on my pizza was as smoky as suggested by the name and the seafood pizza had a lemon-y flavor that complemented the spice nicely
I am a fan of the prosciutto melt and chipotle chicken melt they also have a burger w/blue cheese add bacon and its amazing
The breakfast place we usually eat at called OVEREASY has good food but AWFUL service and it closes at 1pm
Not only great food service and decor but also a great resort to walk around with mature landscaping that is worth the tour
The service was top notch and the food was excellent
There was no rushing from the service and the food delivery was right on from appetizers through desert
I found the Broth was scrumptious but it lacked enough meat to challenge my favorites but otherwise EXCELLENT
Unfortunately I found the Spring Rolls to be gummy and NOT very tasty at all
The dishes were fantastic fresh and flavorful
They can whip up the most amazing dishes from the most obscure ingredients
One goes for amazingly delicious and authentic Mexican food-that's it
If you do not speak spanish you might also have trouble with the staff and sometimes they are not the friendliest but thats ok with me becuase the food is always good
The food was fresh and flavorful albeit rather uninspired
My dad ordered tamales a no-meat option was good and they were larger than expected
The brisket has a rich smoky flavor and the ribs had the perfect crust on the outside and juicy meat on the inside
The food has always been pretty good though in recent months we've noticed that the recipes have been substantially improved
We like hot dishes but usually order them medium for our friends - and that has worked very well with everyone enjoying the dishes
Take it from a long-time Phoenix resident that loves Thai Indian Cuban and Mexican food -  if you're looking for good Indian food in the Central corridor try this restaurant for dinner
The entrees were nothing more than goopy cornstarch sauce with little to-no flavor the meats and vegetables in everything seemed to be fresh and of good quality but were coated in batter and perhaps just barely fried- leaving them covered in soggy mush that has absorbed the goopy flavorless sauces
I imagine the black menu is tastier but it's ridiculous to have two menus with food of completely different quality levels rather than levels of authenticity
And while we did get some good food while we were there it wasn't worth the ticket price but if the beer we drank was free then it could have worked
Two years ago I watched a storm roll into the Valley with lightning at sunset would not recommend it but it was amazing of course to get a better view I continued hiking up to the ridge
The reason I capitalized SPORTS above is because you can not expect great food at a SPORTS bar it should be ok to good and cheap
+++'s FREE fast WiFi so you can check the scores and your girl that's with you who gets bored after the 1st Qtr can social network; OK cheap sports bar food breakfast burritos & other stuff before 11a and under $9; plenty of TV's; plenty of seating if you get there early; friendly although not speedy wait staff who put Hooters girls to shame; good relatively clean crowd although a little more than a healthy dose of the mid-western/north-eastern boys who think their team is THEIR team and those mid-west girls with the witch-chin beady eyes thin plucked brows stark nose and brown straight bob that wear banana republic clothes they're still hot and I'd take one on the chin for 'em
A real shame because the food and service are very good
The chicken and red lentils were great - moist and flavorful and some of the best Ethiopian I've ever had
The beef was good but not as good as the chicken or lentils
I'm a little bit conflicted on how to rate the experience because although the food was delicious during consumption the aftereffect was a feeling similar to being repeatedly punched in the stomach
As good as the food was due to the heaviness I probably won't be back
Had eaten here a few times in the past but was never very impressed with the food
My friend ordered the creme brulee for dessert and that was not good at all
The food here is not only amazing but also very affordable
I was impressed by the quality and flavor of the food here the first time I went
Next time I look forward to tackling their delicious sounding dessert menu they have creme anglaise
Bottom line is you get a lot of high quality food for a great price my order was $9
I really enjoy introducing people to places they have never been and I am happy to say Cibo recently gained two new fans of their charming outdoor patio and good food
Everything we tried was fantastic and I had the opportunity to sample two new-to-me dishes the burrata appetizer I have no words to describe how special and good this mozzarella is especially when combined with the salty prosciutto and a drizzle of aged basalmic and dessert
My mom ordered the swordfish which was pretty good
On top of that the food was absolutely wonderful
If you want a friendly and comfortable place where you can get delicious and expertly prepared food
The bar food isn't bad and it isn't good either
The garlicky hot wing sauce is insanely good and the texture of the tofu/mushroom mixture is so eerily chicken your mind will do a double-take
They have great food from what I have tried and the spicy thai wings were really good here I like to think of myself as a wing aficionado and these are great with many flavors to choose from
PERFECTION if you're looking for delicious New York-style pizza with fresh ingredients
I'm not a sushi expert by any stretch but suffice to say that the rolls here are well-priced fresh-tasting and overall pretty damn delicious with good presentation
I enjoy the Las Vegas but the Spank Me roll was really good as well
Good service laid back vibe even if the decor is a little college dorm with the lighting but overall fun good food and affordable
Half price drinks appetizers & house maki get the chicken gyoza - you're welcome in advance
Kudos for *consistently* fresh sushi served at a good temperature - but it could be rolled a little bit tighter sometimes they seem to fall apart easily
I've spent less than $20 with another person on 2 different rolls saki bombers and an appetizer
I liked everything about this restaurant and thought the food was amazing until I went to Ocean Club the next night and it didn't even compare
The atmosphere is fantastic the wait staff is busy - but good and the food is WELL worth any wait on a Friday night
People that came long after we did got their food way before we even got our appetizers
The cheesecake was pretty good for desert and we loved the ambiance but after the food
The food is your typical western stuff lots of steak and they even offer a rattlesnake appetizer for those who are a little more daring
I called in a to-go order at this place that included Pho and spring rolls and the host on the line stated my food would be ready in 10-15 min thinking that is pretty long in my head but I did order crispy spring rolls with lettuce and mint leaves so i say sounds good
Great service good food so-so preparedness
The not as good- Best looking dish scallops was not available- My halibut was overcooked- We came in on a Sunday and the place was half empty
I used to eat here at least twice a month but lately the quality of the food has fallen
but in the end had a hard time finding a restaurant that fit all the criteria good atomsphere for a table for one good food and within hotel shuttle distance
Highly recommend for atomsphere drinks and food
Also their bread rolls and butter are really good
I didn't get to taste the moz and tomato salad but I did have the kale and white bean dish and that was amazing
It was a chilly night and we saw that it got good reviews on yelp so we stopped in for a early visit- thought some good mexican food and a margarita would warm us up
She then reluctantly sat us at another 4 top we had to drag over another table to fit us all in and proceeded to complain to the server within earshot of us about us pointing and rolling her beady little eyes
Good appetizer specials quality if not adventurous food and the staff is friendly
Plenty the waiter couldn't hear us we couldn't have dinner conversation we couldn't see our food not good for eating nachos and it was completely impractical for the average client
The food was good warm and so was the air I am guessing 80+ degrees
Service was excellent and the food I thought was delicious
It was excellent and more than enough food
I also didn't have room for a whole dessert but I ate one of the free co okies on the way out and it was so good that I wish I had grabbed another one before I left
Although the food is good the customer service is abysmal and the prices are way too high
Not all of us are on the HCG/HGH train-so between the photos on the wall of the hottest bodies around and running into the Affliction wearing meat-heads I try to avoid most days
Since becoming a patron I have enjoyed the following items the most bombero chicken burrito chicken taco's pastor burrito pastor torta chicken nachos chilaquiles with red sauce breakfast quesadilla and burrito with chorizo and green chile pork burrito
Overall it's a great place with good food that you should definitely check out
The pizza is excellent but order early as they take about half an hour
The flies can't resist such delicious food
I'm no snob and the food really was good
i enjoyed the chicken with risotto the smoke flavor was a bit much
It is the typical Fox project that has good food but nothing that would be classified as unforgettable
The chile orange chicken is really good too
Mostly Food was dry and could use some flavor
So being from San Jose/Cupertino I've had me some good Chinese food and even better dim sum
Shrimp fajitas tacos morongo and fish tacos are all really good
The bf LOVED the jerk chicken and if he likes your food I'll def give the menu another shot
Nothing out of the ordinary for a pub as far as the food was concerned but it was good
I've been here several times over the years and pretty much everything to be said has been said on other's Yelp reviews but here is my overview1 - all the food is great portions good and priced decently2 - make a reservation - the place gets busy3 - the place is loud as heck
I feel like I'm 80 just saying it but the acoustics of the place are horrible and you have to yell to others in your party during prime time when the place is busy4 - food comes out fast but I have no idea why you have to wait 10 minutes for another beer or diet cokeLast night I had the short rib over creamy polenta and it was amazingly awesome
We tried the Horseradish-Mashed-Potato Stuffed Shrimp appetizer and it was wonderful
I wished there was a little more horseradish flavor but I am a horseradish fiend so I my taste may be over powering to some
And if you're the type of person that can't stand little kids running around avoid the fountain area by the food court on a hot day
She recommended the chicken soup for a cure but I decided to go with the Mi instead because I'm a huge egg noodle fan
Because I loathed the place even before this lovely birthday dinner and because the thought of supporting such an establishment makes my blood boil I ordered only dessert and the hubs ordered an appetizer and add on a $3 can soda
I ordered Chicken Parmesan - I ate most of it and thought it was a little salty but good Our appetizer of Chicken flat bread came late middle of the dinner
Service A+Food BAtmosphere B+ Overall I was impressed with Citizen Public House mainly because of their service
Honestly the food is pretty good and the little cafe is clean but I still couldn't manage to give it more than one star
The Asians who run it are always very pleasant also cook basics think burger hot dog burrito fresh sandwiches wrapped up etc and their prices are really reasonable for on-the-go food
The meat was cooked nicely the carrots and onions cooked but not overcooked and the noodles maybe a tiny bit firm but still good
and then my next question about whether she recommended the strawberry chicken salad or the warm chopped veggie salad They are both so different
The Green Chile Pork Chimi was filled with flavorless stew meat and was soggy
Went with 2 friends we had the pork tenderloin moist the cheese added flavor and a perfect combination of textures Alaskan Halibut Flakey not fishy had shrimp and a relish on top that make it truly unique and wonderful and Lamb Shank favorable not gamey well seasoned
So 3 stars because the food was definitely ok and worth eating
The food is reasonably priced but not all that good
I would highly recommend the Lemon Chicken it's extraordinary
Both times I've been here the service is mediocre sloooow and the food is overpriced and lacking in flavor
for starters I've had the spring rolls which are greasy but ok the crab puffs which are ADDICTIVE the fake hot wings which are so similar to the real thing its a little scary
I ordered a lot of food and most of them are pretty delicious
All in all it was a good place to get fast Taiwanese food
The food here is very good very fresh and the soups are very tasty
Good value if you can stack the food high I recommend this restaurant if your up for something new
Cons If you are new to this restaurant and you don't know how to stack up the food This may not be a good value to you
The food isn't as good as an normal restaurant but given that this isn't an normal restaurant This is not an drawback
They also serve lunch in here and they have amazing fish tacos
I didnt try any of the Mexican food but did order a roll that was delicious and served promptly
Lots of seafood in this version very tasty
I am new to the state of Arizona and had a mad craving for some good ole' Chinese Food that was not part of a 2 or 3 item combo with rice and noodles
The prices seemed  OK but the pizza didn't look all that wonderful- I guess they're selling the organ music
The tomato basil and mozzarella was a good dish
The vinaigrette on the side salad was a bit over powering once it seeped into the tomato and cheese juices; but overall a tasty dish
The buffet is a great value and the food is consistently fresh and delicious
If you go there for dinner I highly recommend the Chicken Makhani
I'm usually stuck with a boring burger as most hot dog places forget us people who have no desire to eat beef ears and pig knuckles and whatever else is in hot dogs
I would not consider this Mexican food but they sure do make a delicious tortilla and a yummy margarita that comes with a shaker to top off your glass throughout your meal
Hmm these wings were neither meaty crispy or quality
I had the Wednesday special of four chicken tacos and they were also of low quality
He was amazingly knowledgeable regarding the food and the wine
i buy fly-tying materials for my fly fishing adventures here and the selection is pretty good
We ordered a beef something salad AMAZING
Perfect for a personal size Pizza Hut pizza delicious and plenty of seating once again at least at my gates and the time I was there and everything went smoothly and friendly
The people were friendly the food was tasty and generous the atmosphere was happenin' though the ordering process was tricky to figure out at first and the pizza-by-the-slice prices were definitely fair
Unfortunately we were very disappointed with the food quality
When the server asked how our food was we told her not good and we would not return
Too many good Mexican food restaurants to waste your time and calories here
The sushi I do have to admit it is not worth the money at all
Besides the price and quantity this dish was delicious
For the main course I got the chorizo chicken chicken stuffed with chorizo and cheese with a chipotle sauce on top it came wth ranchero beans i didnt like these but thats just my preference I enjoy more authentic tasting beans and jalepeno cheese rice this was very good and the cheese dishes are made with white cheddar
The menu is a little limited but there is a good selection of appetizers salads sandwiches as well as some steak chicken and pasta entrees
This place is not cheap but the quality of the food and drinks make for  good value in my opinion
They offered to convert nearly any dish on their menu into a vegan alternative and it was delicious
and the Katheaw Cha rice noodles with tofu instead of beef - AMAZING
Service was top notch and as many other reviewers noted their prices are unbelievably low for the quantity and quality of food that you get
The chicken strips were lightly battered with a thin tasty coating
I've always had some difficulty finding good Indian food in the valley
The food was quite good and more than compensated for the slightly innocuous atmosphere
Good crust good sauce good cheese quality meats
The freshness certainly shows in the taste and integrity of their food it is so delicious
People this is food porn worthy in my books
That leek dish changed me forever as I now crave it in my sleep it was that amazing
It had a very clear pure beefy flavor and just melded so nicely with the caper raisin salsa
I purchased food from this airport Sauce location twice to date and I've been impressed - their food is consistent with their restaurants around town
While their food isn't five star worthy it's pretty damn good for the price and the fast-casual model
The chicken mole enchiladas I got were smothered in the best mole sauce I've ever had and my wife's carnitas in green chile sauce were equally amazing
Their pre-packaged meals are pretty tasty and cheaper than a fast food combo
I mean I eat from some grimy burrito places and their food is AMAZING compared to the stuff they're passing off as food here
I highly recommend the barbecue chicken pizza and if you're like me and prefer a little spice have them add some serrano peppers
My husband and I just moved to Phoenix from NYC and everyone told us that the food in Phoenix will never be as good as the food in New York
We could not believe how delicious the food was at Postino and the service was incredible too
One of my co-workers recommended it saying it was her favorite mexican food
I think I still prefer the beef tongue but all in all still a good meal
The food is still pretty good and so are the prices
Not the best Cantonese food we have ever had but pretty good especially for the Phoenix area
I ordered the Chicken and Biscuits that had large chunks of cooked carrots peas chicken laid on a tower of amazing mashed potatoes and smothered in Gravy
My husband got the Thai Chicken Noodles it looked really good
Shrimp on top of eggplant--this was by far the best dish and came with crispy scallions and peppers which added a ton of zest and flavor6
But watching him deal with people who are overwhelmed by the menu in the middle of the lunch rush would be worth the price of admission even if the food wasn't so good
Our food came out hot and fresh so hot we had to wait a few minutes for it to cool off
It's a little more than standard fast food but honestly you get what you pay for and this was worth every penny
La Condesa is an amazing little spot that has more than food but charm as well
The food was good and the atmosphere was cozy and full of obvious regulars
Pizzas salads and sandwiches are all delicious but what deserves an extra special shout out is the dessert case
The beef not much flavor the ribs were tender but I didn't get alot of the smoke flavor that I like in my ribs the chicken was delish-tender and smoky the pulled pork was excellent
This pizza was as good as it gets and very healthy
The service was great the food was great and good atmosphere
The sauce is simmered with Italian sausage even though meatless it produces a sublime flavor
Recommended for solid Italian fare and pizza or a couple pops in the nice cocktail bar
This is a good place to go for a pizza party with your baseball team
We looked at the food before deciding to sit down and it looked like it would be pretty good
I mean nothing -- usually there is at least one dish that you can eat to get your money's worth and there was literally nothing
None of the meats were good anything that was fish was too fishy the rice and noodles were dried out
Francis experience includes great atmosphere an extensive drink menu and wonderful food options
The food was 'OK' I was unable to determine if the crab filling in the rolls was true crab  the pot sticker filling was much like flavored sawdust however
The Good Location views prices The Bad Food
THE GOOD aka the foodIf you've been to another Roku or even a Nobu the menu will look familiar as will the prices
The sushi selection was pretty deep with a good specials list and lots of options
All the fish was very fresh and as good as you can get in Phoenix unless you're a regular somewhere else and get the special stuff
I suffered a long 4 years in Wisconsin a state devoid of  the chicken-y goodness that is the Chik-Fil-A
Food is a bit overpriced especially for Mexican food and in Arizona where you can get just as good for a bit lower priced than Los
I thought it might be a bit strange for an appetizer but it was the perfect amount of food to tide us over until our party arrived
Usually a flank steak is not the best cut of meat but this steak was excellent
My partner had a buffalo blue cheese chicken sandwich that tasted like hot wings without coating and a Chocolate Peanut Butter shake
We started our meal with the small portion of Tom Ka with chicken and it was amazing
I had won a free photo session after attending a Yelp event then participating in a contest on MelonFish Photo's Facebook
A cold soup this is made with cucumbers buttermilk dill and olive oil with chunks of lump crabmeat and a dollop of caviar thrown on top because why the hell not
Music was good but I can't say anything about the food since I didn't eat anything there
You can't order one dish and tell people it's good or bad
The cinnamon popovers were an amazing breakfast dessert mmmmmmmmm dipped in whiskey caramel sauce
Everything from the bread to the salad to the appetizers entrees down to the dessert was impeccable
I was surprised to discover that the peso actually neutralized the fishiness so that instead a robust flavor emerged that was totally balanced by the acidity of a dry graffignia pino grigio
We ordered mu shu pork chicken chow fun mongolian beef shrimp in lobster sauce orange chicken and we got honey wings for free if you order more than 29$ worth of food they give you a free appetizer from a list
The mu shu was fine and the mongolian beef was pretty good
Thai Basil's food is consistently tasty attractive and healthful
We both agreed that the food was delicious and fresh the service was quick the restaurant is clean and Troy is delightful
The food was good but I just couldn't get out of my head that it wasn't all that
Both times the food was very good love the biscuits and gravy
I am a huge fan of restaurants with good food which are not chains
was most excellent and the beef with broccoli had lots of sauce
Rollins even called us today to see how the cats were feeling after their visit and shots
The result is an incredibly flavorful meat taco
The quality of the food was good but inconsistent
Unfortunately because of the inconsistency with the quality of their food as well as the lack in variety of buffet foods I don't think we will be going back anytime soon
Based on Yelp reviews my husband and I have been enjoying Lalibela's delicious food for several years
It was huge and provided a terrific array of their tasty vegetable and meat dishes
I have to agree with the other yelpers that the deviled eggs and red velvet cake are to die for but the main dishes we had were bland and not really worth mentioning
I wanted dessert and wanted something different from the normal AJ stuffs they are good I know
They put it all in one bowl and you mix it up with fish sauce and hot sauce to taste
Family owned family run and the food is wonderful
Not only is the service wonderful the food is really good too and made to order just how I like it minus or plus things I do and do not like
Then to top it all off a huge selection of fresh salsas aguas frescas and lots of quick delicious food options in the restaurant part of the store
The inside of the place wasn't much to look at but if your food is that good then who really gives a fuck what the decor looks like
The portion size is the traditional street taco but the flavor of the slow cooked beef is where this becomes the must get
The place was unimpressive looking but there was quite a wait which I took as a good sign nobody lines up and waits for bad food
When our food did come out it was nice and piping hot but it was also unrecognizable
Maybe this place is only good for the pizza but based on this experience I'm not willing to give it a second chance
We're from Chicago and maybe there's just a lack of exposure to good food here but no way does this place rates even close to 4 stars let alone 5
The food is delicious made with fresh ingredients while you wait
The food is good but the overwhelming smoke smell was a huge issue for us
He had 4 or 5 recommendations for 2 or 3 different scenarios light meals heavy meals chicken/beef etc
on recommendation i ordered the Mama's chicken n' sausage gumbo
The stew-ish type dishes were flavorful all the spices bold
The fettucine & meatball was delicious the mixture of the alfredo sauce and the marinara was unique and very tasty and the meatballs were excellent
We were not so impressed however with the chicken parm
The best part is possibly the dessert - decadent and delicious
The service is outstanding and the food wonderful
The food was very good and just love their Potatoes
The family that runs Beaver Choice has charmed me with their delicious food and friendly spirits
I can agree with some other reviews and say that the food did take a good amount of time to get served but Beaver Choice has heard that cry and they are trying to work on it Also when I ordered off of the Grab & Go menu I got my sandwich very quickly
It would be nice if the chicken on the salad was hot
Outrageously good thai food in Scottsdale with great service to match
Their rotisserie chicken is good too--you can see the chicken roasting on the spit through one of the side windows of the restaurant
but the lame service the length it took us to get our food around 45 minutes after we sat down and leaving smelling like a chimney at 1 in the afternoon was not good times this place is always real smokey - even apparently in the morning
I come out of Target and roll my windows down just to let out some of that stank nasty hot air
The food has ranged from excellent to good
The food for the conference was surprisingly good
We even had a petite filet mignon dish that was very nicely cooked and flavored
My mom had the shaken beef and it was very flavorful and the meat was very tender
My husband had the lemongrass chicken and also enjoyed it
It was a huge amount of food but it was so good that I was compelled to order an extra side of hummus to go with the leftovers
The wrappers were a bit mushy and I found the rolls to lack flavor
My brother got the kung pao chicken which looked Delicious
The quality of the fish it self was un paralleled
I did attend an event here once which had the most amazing fish presentation I had seen there was a whole salmon cooked and its body between the head and tail was skinned thinly sliced cucumbers were used to create edible scales
For seafood in the valley this is my #1 recommendation and if you are ever traveling check to see if there is one at your destination as I found them to be quite consistent
All simple and astonishingly delicious dishes
One last thing during the cooler months the parking lot at Vincent's Cmbk West of 40th St is turned into something like a farmer's market with a lot of delicious food served up
The max burger had too many flavors rolled into one which just didn't work
If the food were superb like my favorite Thai place in Fremont CA where the service is spread really thin but the outstanding food makes it worth it we might have been less irritable but it was really frustrating to wait 15 minutes to order and 5-10 just to flag the server down again with a simple request e
The curry was ok but it had way too much coconut milk flavor and not nearly enough of the other important curry flavors tamarind fish sauce curry paste garlic
All this being said the meat in both dishes was good quality which cannot be said about the meat at the restaurant's counterpart Thai Basil at least at the Ahwatukee location we went to
It was savory and sweet at the same time a flavor  combination that in my opinion  defines Thai food and was unfortunately not present in our entrees
If it doesn't end up being a great spot for dinner it still might prove a great lunch place for standard Thai food at good prices
get the duck to start but look the portions are on the small side and the fresh fish starter is skimpy for the price but really good
I usually eat at fast/cheap Mexican places because I am not a fan of places like Garcias macayos Arriba etc but I have been looking for a good/authentic sit down Mexican food restaurant for a while
It was good not as good as I've tasted in Italy but superior to most pizza
I ordered a pasty stuffed with ground beef French fries onions melted Swiss Cheddar blend and it was DELICIOUS
We finished off with the Shirley Temple for dessert an amazing toffee chocolatey bread pudding that comes with a white cream you can stir into it
If you're looking for a good ol boys pizza place with pitchers of beer  unlimited amount of soda dark wood and dart boards
I sat at the bar for lunch and ordered from the Primi portion of the menu meaning first or appetizers a Beef Carpaccio $9
The food was good not awesome but tasty and reasonably priced
To be honest we have these dinners mainly to visit and have fun with each other so the food is only secondary and for just having a great evening out enjoying wine good food and conversation this place was perfect
We were in the mood for the Ethiopian food so we only ordered an appetizer from the raw food menu
We enjoyed all of the dishes though the lentils with cumin were my last favorite
We love the fact that this is not a large chain restaurant and has excellent food at a price that will keep us returning
It is very rich and tasty food but if you are strict vegan and you come here with a group which would be the only reason a vegan would even walk in the door eat at home or plan to stop at Green afterwards
He poured the maple syrup on the plate and drizzled it with hot sauce then explained how this is their signature concoction made special for this dish
In his defense however I did have a few questions about the cut of beef I chose and how I might like to have it cooked and he did seem knowledgable about that but in my experience with a restaurant with this kind of reputation he should be offering us recommendations and telling us a little bit about the aging process dry or wet
The Caesar salad didn't have any actual anchovies on it but had a very strong fishy flavor
Yes they were good 1 1/2-inch chunks but even if I mixed up the bowl myself which I would have to do as the dish is obviously served this way so you can SEE the quality of the meat you're getting there is no way I would EVER describe this as chunks of lobster THROUGHOUT
A good local restaurant/bar with nice service and tasty food options
The food is just good all around we haven't had something we didn't like
The food is always fast fresh and has good flavor
A very creative menu delicious food and a friendly atmosphere
I had the pizza and my husband had the Chef's salad which were both wonderful
Even if you aren't a vegan or health foodie this place is worth checking out as the menu is so interesting and creative
It's great to have a restaurant like this that is locally owned very easy on the wallet AND the food is delicious
a huge sizzling platter of meaty goodness
both were large and stuffed with tasty meat
As for the food my four companions and I all agreed that it was overpriced for the quality
When I picked up the menu I think I stared at the menu for a good ten minutes before I finally settled on the chicken tikka masala red curry pastie
I waited a good ten minutes or more for my food and I understood why
So we were looking for some good old Mexican food on a Sunday night of  study overload and were disappointed
Egg rolls were light and crispy with a very tasty pork filling
Our food came out quickly and it was piping hot
The pizza was decent not in top 10 though but was foldable and was worth the money
Previously I'd have to drive to Tempe or Arcadia to enjoy good food and good shopping options in the same place
The food is pretty good - I've had the nachos tacos enchiladas and some random salad and all were good
i thought the quality of the food was good and authentic southern
meat falls off the bone rich smoky flavorand i get to choose two sides
#and yeah the decor is a bit cold but i'm here for excellent food and great service not the pics on the wall
The service was great  and the food was delicious
That they're proud to share their delicious food with you
They have raw oysters delicious sashimi crab puffs all the classic dishes and even a Mongolian BBQ station
On top of all the wonderful food they have a full bar
Happy hour specials are great the food takes a bit of time to arrive but is always worth the wait
There is a traditional Carnitas which writes the book on good fresh street food and the Korean with the red pepper threads and feta cheese
They offer a good variety of  soup and noodle dishes as well as a variety of sandwiches banh mi
Fast service tasty food good prices - all in this relatively modest restaurant in a  quiet strip mall across the street from ASU West
I tried a slice of all the 5 pizzas at our table and found them all unique flavorful and definitely delicious- their Il Tagliere meat and cheese board is a fantastic appetizer idea
This location is not consistant with the quality of their food
Wow I was surprised that it was so good here they didnt have the specials that I was used to since I love Sushi Ave in Mesa Az
The Vegas rolls I had here were big and full of flavor I left giving the place 2 thumbs up
I was honestly shocked at how absolutely amazing the food was at Rosita's because it is in the Ghetto which happens to be less than two miles from my place ha ha
Honestly the food was really really good and if it we-rent for the REALLY bad service I would have given this place at least a four
This is the pizza that California Pizza Kitchen wishes it could be like  Organic natural and free-range products that are fresh flavorful and are balanced perfectly with the other ingredients on your pizza
The chicken artichoke was delicious with lots of toppings huge chunks of artichoke and very flavorful chicken
There is usually always a wait no reservations which is a PITA but the sushi is fresh service is quick so it's not always super friendly and the calamari salad is SO effin good
A quaint no frills Greek dive with good food
Honestly we were all waiting to see who ran to the toilet first but everyone was fine and had really good things to say about the food
Its not trying to be hip and the food is solid good and you get a great experience eating there
Its only open for breakfast but its a good place to grab morning chow if youre in Tempe and there's not a huge line out front and a 2 hour wait like some other breakfast places in Phoenix and the food is easily much better
I was shopping food trucks for my little girls party last year and found Emerson Fry Bread first so fitting because my daughter's name is Emerson but was pleasantly surprised as all of my guests were at the delicious flavors Emerson and his family created
The favorite is fresh cut fries with peppers onions and a few other things that made this a delicious side dish
If you aren't a fan of meats you might still love their burgers or salads with prosciutto because the quality is excellent
I was used to having a slightly spacey server but the food was so good that a little bit of forgetfulness would never stop me from going back
The food was pretty good but the service was less than desirable
Hong Kong is very consistent with their food quality and the service is always been excellent
The only problem is if I fill up on the various rolls and sushi pieces I don't have room for all of the other wonderful items Hong Kong prepares
Excellent food at the Good Egg by the way
So if you are a proponent of bigots racists horrible service an outhouse bathroom nestled in the anals of the kitchen average food cramped surroundings and unattractive servers that never smile; please solicit Wonderful Wandas
for my low carb diet a panda bowl with steamed veggies instead of rice or chow mein and string bean chicken is filling and tasty
you're not getting the highest quality food but you know you're getting something decent
It's basically piles of meats Wat or veggies cooked slowly with lots of flavors and served on Injera a sourdough-tasting spongy bread that resembles a large crepe
I cannot pick a favorite of the meats although the Alicha Sega Wat is very good
The food was excellent the chopped salad which really isn't a salad is a delicious starter and easily serves two
I had the half Italian beef sandwich I liked the taste of it with the onions and peppers on the crusty hard to find good bread
50 extraThey do sell hard to find Italian meatsand boar's head meatscheesesoilsvinegarscandy and pasta in shapes you can't find in your local grocery and many other things but not the whole red hot cherry peppers in vinegar that we were hoping to buy
I don't recommend the food but if you want to go out with friends and really tie one off this is the place
I also had the thai chicken pizza - this was sooo good
All in all a great experience and delicious food
Its a hearty almost beef broth like flavor
but it doesnt i think it smells like an old persons house i would give it a 3 for the atmosphere its cool to go see a sporting event there or go there for trivia night which is lots of fun and i would give its food 5 stars in particular their hamburgers for their price they just cant be beat theyre just delicious and the seasoned fries are always tasty fresh and crispy
Do not know if the food is good or not and do not care
Pizza arrived in the 45 min I was told hot and the driver was friendly and mindful not to let our dog out
The Chicken pot pie was good except for the fact they put a sprig of rosemary in it for garnish and the rosemary kinda took over all the flavors
His knowledge of wine was very good and he made excellent recommendations for the dish that I had selected
The beef was good but did not rise to the level of quality at the Grind or DeLux Burger though granted unlike the other two restaurants mentioned this one is not a burger specialist
GradesOverall   A-   No demerits taken Food      B    Good presentation of a burger with good food quality                        however did not pass the Ramsay Test* for an A
Drinks    A     Excellent wine knowledge and service technique was                         displayed by the waiter coupled with a good selection                        makes this a great place to enjoy wine Service   A     Good service as explained above *Ramsay Test  Chef Gordon Ramsay says that if you are going to make and serve a simple dish it needs to be executed with perfection
I will not give an excellent or A rating for a simple classic dish unless it is executed with perfection and is a sound and creative interpretation of the dish
We started with a very tasty minestrone soup with home made crackers and the dessert pumpkin cheesecake was also wonderful
I had the Beet Salad and Diver Scallops for dinner and a glass of white wine unfortunately I just missed the Happy Hour but my food was pretty good as was the service
As the name would indicate it's a buffet but you can order anything off the buffet as a main dish and a few other standard items are available daily Cuban sandwiches - didn't try these today but they looked just like the ones that I sucked down in Miami Plantainos Maduros - yummy caramelized plantains Tostones - smashed plantains fried in to little fritters and OMG good Flan
*Estofado de Res Al La Jaudinera Pulled Pork with Vegetables in a Tomato Sauce*Puerco Asado Unbelievably good roasted Pork - tender and juicy with just the right amount of fat for flavor*Yuca Root served in large slices - tender and yummo*Con Gris Black Beans and Rice*Frijol Colorado Red BeansIn addition they had two additional rices menudo pan little rolls - these were the only things that were somewhat generic and a soup but we all thought it was way too hot out to try this one
This place used to be a Pizza Hut and doesn't appear to have gone through much updating so don't expect much in the form of atmosphere but the food is really good - not fancy more like you would get at someone's home and is very clean
The food isn't fancy schmancy but it is all very good and authentic Mama does the cooking
I am always on the lookout for a good local friendly place to eat with great food that is vegetarian-friendly and I found it with Paradise Valley Burger Company
The food is fresh high-quality and delicious
* Outdoor festivals galore* Luminarias at the Desert Botanical Garden* MLB Spring Training in March* PF Changs Rock n Roll Marathon* Endless hiking opportunities* FBR Open and the Bird's Nest* Hotties from Minnesota and Chicago who are snowbirding it I'd hit itAnd best of all
I ordered manicotti and thought the meatball that came with it was very good and I think next time I would try a meatball sandwich
I love it when a restaurant has good rolls or bread to go along with your meal and I didn't care for the rolls bread was tastless and too much seasoning on top
I was pleasantly surprised by the high quality of food and the friendly waitresses
The pulled pork nachos was a tasty mountain of food and the fish tacos were nicely spiced
Good clean fun cold beer and good food - very hard to argue with
I was out of ideas for good food so I asked my sister in law and she recommended this place so i rolled the dice and took her to Windsor it did not disappoint
bread & olive oil and cheese or cheese and meats some bruschetta AND interesting wine information it's quite a good deal
But was was truly impressive was our personal server throughout the game who brought us wings pizza hot dogs and kraut -- all the food was a slight step above stadium food
So as I'm trying to make sense of the menus posted in both Spanish and English on the wall above the hot food line or whatever I am greeted by a nice woman that helps me decide where to go
The sides are curved to make a small cup to fill with beans meat of choice topped with shredded lettuce grated cojita cheese I'd describe Mexican parm--hard salty and good
I'll definitely take others for hot food and a fun people watching experience plus pick up a few goods on the way
5 stars for creativity in food/taste combinations ambiance excellent musical choices artwork service
CPH is very good about keeping you in the loop about the daily special deal and new dishes
Blackened Mahi sandwich tasted good but overpriced for the little amount of fish I got
The California Chicken sandwich also tasted good and was much more reasonably priced
I know it's tough to find good bread out here but there's a big difference between Kaiser roll and hamburger bun
We split a crunchy chicken salad and a burger and both were good but not something I would drive back there for
I found the flavors lacking the steak a little chewy and the chicken boring
Food here is good ordering is a bit awkward for me though
Not a true authentic deli but good enough when you need some hearty food
Food had good flavor and customer service was great
I recommend Jade Palace for lunch because you can get a pretty large amount of food for a pretty small amount of cash
$8-10 will get you soup the hot and sour is quite good entree egg roll crab puff as well as crispy won-ton to dip in mustard/sweet n sour sauce
There are several dishes that I would recommend the first of which being the Sweet and Pungent Shrimp
This dish is cooked in an amazing sweet and spicy sauce and the shrimp are lightly fried and crispy served with broccoli completely delicious
Another stand out is the Hot and Spicy Eggplant dish
Lastly I recommend the Szechuan Garlic Chicken
We didn't have any food but the menu was appetizing and the food that came by for other tables looked pretty good
Being a fan of good sushi i was hesitant to get ahi at a non-sushi restaurant but i was not disappointed in the least
When we finished our appetizer the bartender took our food order
It's a good thing we had time to chat inbetween the appetizer and dinner coming because there was absolutely NO TALKING when food was in front of us as we were too busy enjoying the deliciousness
Plans for that soon and i expect to have the same amazing food and service
I have to pay tribute to chef Binkley for unknowingly taking up the challenge of introducing my fussy parents to the world of fine dining on our holiday to the USA in MayMy parents enjoy good food but had rarely ventured outside their comfort zone of Chinese and Indian food and coming from Malaysia haute cuisine is very alien to them and it takes a lot to convince them about new experiences
The chicken was very moist and the flavor was damn good
; The new bar outside is nice and the food is still very good
i have been going to Delux for a few years now since it opened and have always had good food there
Chang's than dimly-lit lounge and at least for lunch it was nice to sit in a well-lit comfortably air-conditioned restaurant and enjoy some quality if standard Thai food
To sum it all up this was a great place to have standard but good Thai-ish food and if you focus on some of the less fusion-y dishes like the curry rice and noodles you will have a good dining experience
If you're in the mood for seafood I would strongly recommend against this place
and some of the best crispy chicken tacos I have ever had good shredded white meat chicken stuffed inside a soft shell and lightly fried for that tasty crispiness
Tuscan inspired food with well developed flavors and plenty of attention to detail in the presentation as well as the preparation
I enjoyed the Pasta Pomodoro with Chicken Angel hair with grilled chicken tomatoes pine nuts and a cilantro pesto drizzle $13
The flavors complimented each other very well and made the dish satisfying but not overwhelming
The food is real cheap and just a typical diner food with good sandwiches and soups
The food is good and I enjoyed it for something a little different lunch
The food is still as good although my boyfriend had the seafood sampler last night and despite being fair it had definitely been frozen
If you sit at the sushi bar the sushi is pretty darn good
Anyways they have good sushi at the sushi bar did i mention that
They have a great menu selection and the food is always excellent
It is worth it- the food won't disappoint
After reviewing the menu--which has a good selection of choices--I decide on the panko fish over white rice
That wonderfully kind lady was sad to see me leave because she wouldn't get to see if I liked my food
Pizza was good crisp crust savory sauce a bit too greasy for my preference but a pretty above-par slice
However you still rock a great tea the food is good and it is so girly fun to browse and linger
So the food is amazing and well-priced the service is prompt and consistent the staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating
The food is pretty good for a fast rice bowl type of restaurant
Being that I've resigned myself to never again eating the great cheap Mexican food I had in Chicago or even in Madison I might have just lowered my standards -- but I think that Rosa's serves inexpensive and tasty food
I've got no complaints and I'd probably go back if I'm with people that want to go but I think I can find similar quality food for me at about 4 or 5 dollars less for lunch
It needs to be tight not loose Flavors are good but there could be a variation of sauce for the spring rolls
4 rotating flavors for over 20 rolls is not a good ratio
Pricing is not bad for some items but I do agree with other reviews that for most items the pricing is a little high for the neighborhood biz and the quality of food offered
Though I would skip the fried chicken - - the flavor is nothing to write home about the chicken fingers were better leaner and non-greasy compared to the fried chicken entree but it might be the house made sauce that may have saved them
From the quality beef to the exquisite buns these are awesome
It's one of those places where the food and drink menu are both sooooooo long that they kitchen and bar probably have a tough time turning out good stuff conssitently
I'm not impressed with the side dishes garlic mashed potatoes are good but those are hard to screw up
Their prices are reasonable and the food is good
The pizza with chicken pesto and sun-dried tomatoes was delicious
Hot and UNREADYI needed to stop here every couple of weeks over the summer to pick up  Hot and Ready cheese and a pepperoni pizzas calling ahead was not an option as we never knew when we would be going by the store
Four out of 5 times they were out of Hot and Ready pizzas and we either had to wait for them to make the pizza or just leave and find something else we usually just left and found something else
The pizza itself is about the same quality as the freezer pizzas in a grocery store
Bottom line Hot and Ready is a great concept but only if there are actually pizzas ready to go
This particular location has a pretty standard size Arizona backyard and really demonstrated how much food and goods you can produce out of a small residential space with a well-thought out system
Not only did we literally receive the bill before it arrived she was terribly unhappy with the seafood quality and flavor
the drinks ARE cheap and strong the food is actually delicious
Food is excellent service is good and the prices can't be beat
The Jap-Chae appetizer thinly sliced beef with carrots mushrooms and spinach over potato noodles in a sweet and savory sauce was delicious and an amazing deal
Bathrooms are clean 10% discount for students with valid current ID and the food is a good deal for what you get
I come here a lot just for the excellent food
As for  the sushi well the gaari was bitter  a good sign that the place is unauthentic and the slices of fish which I ordered tuna and salmon  were too thick  on the maki and in the rolls too skimpy
I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and quantity of sushi
Each roll I ate was tasty and service was very good
My favorites are the homemade chicken noodle soup their foccacia style sliced bread so wonderfully garlicky and their freaking lava cake
Last night I had the awesome opportunity to sample the great portions and wonderful food of the Grand Lux Cafe
I could have gotten the same quality food from many places and gotten service that was far better
By the time I tried a taste of a friend's dish it was absolutely cold
You could tell the quality of the food is amazing but the temperature lackluster service and severe disorganization were a major issue
There was however little positive to say about PastaBAR except I can tell the food WOULD have been amazing
After a $60 bill for three -- appetizer one espresso one bottled beer and three entrees -- we had to eat again at Denny's a few hours later since they were essentially the only other people still serving food in the area at that hour
I really like sushi but it's hard to find a good place living in the desert and all
Their staff is helpful and the food so fresh and tasty
I can almost definitively say that the Veal was the most tender and flavorful piece of meat I have ever eaten
I always try to stick to the more obscure and Burmese dishes and they have always been an exotic and unique blend of flavors
I think I had the same waitress everytime and she was helpful in figuring out how many dishes to serve a party of six and which dishes she would recommend
We all loved it and were suprised when the pizza was acctually good and so was the salad bar
So In short i would say the food is better at Chuhgajib and a little cheaper than Hodori but the win was not as good
We both ordered pasta dishes which were good and the portions reasonably sized
The next thing you know they brought up this place called the Good Apple Health Food store after telling them I was into alternative health and wellness as were they
Bread is homemade and was delicious and fresh only suggestion would be add more filling I would not even have minded to have paid and extra buck for another spoon ful of chicken salad
so i highly recommend it to anyone looking for a filling of pizza and entertainment
had the chicken and shrimp lettuce wraps very good and the calamari also very good until they got kinda cold and rubbery - but when they were hot they were delish - especially with the spicy sauce they come with
All in all the food was very good and I would have given it four-five stars if the service had been better
There's a wide variety of very good Asian food so don't hesitate to try Tottie's just about anyone can find something to please their palate
My wife was very impressed with the Tandoori pizza which I still need to try without the chicken while I'd been favoring anything with mushrooms
I think they had more appetizers and dessert on their menu than wine
Really good neighborhood cafe for breakfast and brunches   I have been here like 4 times and each time they had great service and good food
I know its not those fancy fusion food where u get two bites worth of food and U are still hungry and end up with a big check
I hear they have an excellent fish fry too on Friday but like others who reviewed it they seem to close a little earlier
The other noodle dish was so bland that we had to add FOUR different sauces to it just to give it some kind of flavor
The food was okay - pretzel bite fondue was delicious but the baked mac and cheese was runny and tasted like Kraft mac and cheese
I really enjoy the beno boxes highly recommend the salmon teriyaki version--the value is actually pretty good for the amount of food you get
Other friends have also commented that the food quality is bad now and I for one will not be going back
I go in here on my half hour lunch break to grab a steamy hot bowl of chicken curry about once a month
Oh my Naughty Nielly always orders the chicken teryaki bowl and that is pretty good too
Management staff and food has changed and not in a good way
It seemed like the food is not as flavorful as it used to be and the staff spends more time with each other then with their customers
The menu hasn't changed much but the quality of the food and ingredients seem like they have
The head chef made me a cucumber roll that had everyone at my table wanting to to try it and they couldn't say enough about how flavorful the roll was
The seafood pancake here is also absolutely delicious and huge for what you pay--especially compared to other Korean restaurants
That being said the restaurant does lose a star for fluctuations in food and service quality
On the plus side they got the correct dish out to us not long after we talked but on the negative side I don't think they would have caught it if I hadn't asked the waitress and my family was certainly not impressed
The salmon spice rub was wonderful but the fish was dry and very overcooked
I think that the area can really use this  swanky new spot but the food quality presentation and service is in serious need of attention
The food is very tasty the tempura squash was exquisite but it's a little on the expensive side for what you get
Tee Pee was recommended to me by a friend as the best Mexican food in town
The guacamole was generally flavorless and had the consistency of baby food
FoodHad a bento box lunch here the other day and the food is just really good
The food ranges from edible to pretty good
The spring roll that was called mango papaya had no flavors of mango or papaya whatsoever although I did detect mint
The flavorings were delicious but the spring roll was just kind of bland
At the same time the menu describes the restaurant and it's offerings as Nothing fancy; simply good food that nourishes and rejuvenates the body
The food is flavorful and the setting is perfect for a group of people
When I've had sushi here it's been delicious as well
If you're looking for a well-rounded meal I'd recommend Sushi Ken over Mido Sushi Teharu and Sushi Eye
All were freezing cold which made the meat luke warmish
Green beef was ok as long as I piled the pretty good tomatillo salsa over it
Summary-decent but plain food with good service
It's a hot spot in Scottsdale see if you can make reservations but a drink at the bar and some rolls would be all good too
We opted for the Chateaubriand for Two and it was some delicious melt-in-your-mouth beef
The food is delicious and the price is right
I recommend the gaucamole the sliders esp the chicken and the wings I asked for mine extra hot & they delivered
Started with Duck pate my wife had a salad  we each had the flat iron steak at the recommendation of the server and we shared a chocolate souffle for dessert
The duck pate was very flavorful and rich served with marbled rye bread an herb infused creme fraiche cornichon and some sort of meat gelee which weirded me out
Despite the promises of tasty Mexican food this place seemed sooooo mediocre to me
The people are friendly and the food is cheap but I'd be willing to pay a bit more for one thing that really lacked in my experience - FLAVOR
Old Country Buffett gets a bad rap but honestly to me their food with the exception of the salad bar is just as good as Golden Corral
Being a creature of habit anytime I want good sushi I go to Tokyo Lobby
If you want good sushi on the west side or the entire valley for that matter say no to Sakana and yes to Tokyo Lobby
We came during peak lunch hour and being that we were the only diners there often a warning sign to me I was a lil weary of how good the food would be
Can't complain about the actual taste of the food it was delicious but unless you come at happy hour you'll probably leave a few bills short and hungrier than you came in
Everything was pretty tasty except the chicken with orange sauce or orange peel or orange whatever was too orangey is that a word
An enormous juicy seasoned all meat patty stacked high garnished with the freshest tomato lettuce and onion with optional bacon cheese and  a hot pepper on a toasted bun
The food was good nothing extraordinary but good
Had the spring rolls the vermicelli salad a curried pho an excellent fruit dessert and a simple tofu and noodle pho for my son
The smoked chicken jalapeno alfredo was good but I may skip it in the future
These days Phoenix is finally starting to get the hint that GOOD food on mobile trucks can work - and work well
Nice fresh rolls perfect remoulade shredded lettuce 2 good sized cornmeal breaded catfish filets fried to perfection and a dollop of black bean salsa
Prices are VERY low for the quality and quantity of food received
Fresh hot delicious food and WONDERFUL people in the truck
We were disappointed that their famous buttercake wasn't a dessert choice but the profiterole was good and my husband had the chocolate cake
The airy sweet fresh goodness permeated the car
Few things compliment a weekend shopping trip like a great burger - exactly what we told the friendly staff of a local antique store who recommended we satiate our beefy cravings at Don and Charlie's on the eastern fringes of Old Town Scottsdale at Camelback
At the waitress' recommendation we split an order of Don and Charlie's famous macaroni and cheese a baked pasta dish layered thick with sharp grated cheese and a complimentary hint of celery salt
The BBQ Chicken Sandwich - like its burger counterpart - is a plump slab of savory smoked chicken barely contained by a cracked-wheat bun and delivered with extra helpings of their tangy signature barbecue sauce which exponentially improves the already memorable flavor of most entrees and sides
No greasy hangover food here - just quality barbecue and burgers and an attentive staff
Richardson'st impressed the hell out of me and I can't wait to go and eat more of their delicious food
Their food is so good it makes me wanna cry
WARNING this is not authentic sushi it is trendy innovative Scottsdale sushi but hell is it good
One year I actually did all of my Christmas shopping from a laptop at Scramble while enjoying some tasty food and milking cup after cup of coffee
But the food wasn't so hot and umm the girls were average as well
The food was flavorful and offered good portion sizes
Legit Filipino food is not quick to make and not good when you make it in large batches and just have it sit there waiting for someone to order it
Since we are constantly trying new places we will surely be trying other Filipino joints in the area but we will also be going back to CF for some good food to make us feel at home
I went in and decided to try a new item other than my usual rotisserie chicken  which did I mention was like the most delicious thing ever
The have crappy fries so dont get them as a side the mashed potatoes are very good and they added a speck of nutmeg and have a fresh thin jus from the chicken
The fish was cooked to perfection and the dipping sauce was full of flavor and the perfect amount of spice
On a good note - the food was pretty good
We started off with the shrimp springrolls - but our server completely forgot to put in the order so our appetizers came out with our main meal
The food as dinner wasn't worth the $70 price tag
The food is good and they have fresh squeezed grapefruit juice
I've had a good experience with the food and the drinks and I still think it is a cool hip space but I find the service issues so disruptive that the Duce has dropped to my in a pinch can't think of anyplace else to go with a group list which is a bummer because if this issue were corrected it could be a great hangout
The owner is an awesome guy who's usually there during the day making sure all the food is wonderful
The beef sandwiches I get them with hot peppers and cheddar and the cheeseburgers are must haves
I would take a star off because they don't have milkshakes and I would sure love a good milkshake with this food but everything else is so good that giving only four stars wouldn't do it justice
There aren't any meatheads there which is good so people like me wont be intimidated
I'm beyond impressed with the quality of food that Yoli's Cafe has to offer
On the side she got Mexican Cold Slaw and this amazing side of re-fried beans that had a hint of beef and cheese
I did like the fish and the service was good
It's too bad because Phoenix could use a GOOD cheap Seafood place
I'll probably still go to Ticoz because their food is good but I will always miss the good ol' days of two delicious tacos for $5
It only adds to allure of the bar and keeps the good times rolling literally
All in all the food is good and it saved me from almost death and i got to my job on time
Is their infamous Chicken Fried Everything enough to blow me up into a giant hot air balloon until I go to 'Awesome-Portion-Heaven
kool-aid hit the spot on a hot day and the chicken and waffles were amazing on their own
You aren't getting doughy pizza drowned with thick tomato sauces and lots of poor quality cheeses and toppings
The Pho and various soup dishes are great and they don't skimp on all the goodies to go with providing large plates of Thai basil bean sprouts peppers etc
The pork and shrimp rolls are also excellent and very big - almost a meal on their own
However Blue 32 has great food good appetizers timely service during games and a balanced environment
*Good prices and tasty bar foodI will definitely be back
All the food is good as well as the sweet stuff
Food wise I've only tried the Turkey and Brie and that was before their menu changed so it might be different now but it was really good
The Scottish Salmon and the sugar Brined Chicken were also cooked and presented perfectly beet salad and edamame succotash also delicious
We started with the Caprese Salad for a light appetizer which was served with a dash of Balsamic vinegar that really made this simple dish just sing
We also ordered the Chevapi that was quite tasty for a simple beef sausage
We shared the organic greens saladgood and the trio of warm doughnuts for dessert yum
The pumpkin custard dessert was worth saving room for
The food was AMAZING the drinks were strong and the service was fine aka busy
Before I came back to WA I went to Lilibela for diner with daughter and it was a good dining experience for my first time trying Ethiopian food
I had the spicy chicken and lentils and it was delicious
Daughter had beef lentils and vegetables and they were also very good
I highly recommend this restaurant for people that like trying different foods and are willing to experience what the world has to offer if you don't like spices curries and different vegetables this place is not for you
I had the chicken sandwich with mac n cheese which was absolutely delicious
I'm beginning to think that a lot of people in Phoenix have absolutely NO idea what good food really is
The chicken fajita soft taco's that JD gets always look good too
The flavors of the pesto and fresh tomatoes complemented the fullness of the lamb and the onions added a little sweetness to this savory dish
The mussels were creamy shrimp was flavorful rice was cooked right and the plate did not have a fishy smell or aftertaste
It didn't have a lot of espresso or alcohol flavor but the portion size was enough to share and the airiness didn't make you feel like you ate an overwhelming dessert
The menu had a good selection of burgers sandwiches and a few entrees pastas chicken shrimp and steak
Good place for upscale bar food and a cold beer while watching a game
I mean the staff knows what is in all their dishes and I asked for the Tofu Yellow Curry with no fish sauce added in with rice which came within ten minutes and it was so good
The pizzas are delicious and the menu is pretty extensive
I think between the two I liked the bbq chicken better but they were both seriously good
This place isn't anything fancy but the food really is good
In fact the prices are extremely reasonable especially when considering the quality of the food
Amazing specialty drinks and the food is very good as well
The patio only offers sushi appetizers and dessert
Everyone at the table tried a pizza and the consensus was that they were all very good
I tried the bruschetta pizza and it was delicious and I'm not even a huge gourmet pizza fan
I've had amazing food and its not always expensive usually not
I just expect quality and care in any dish
I was craving Thai food and went to Thai Rama  on a recommendation based on dinner my sister had there 3 years ago
The food is good the menu offers just about every variation of everything - chicken pork beef lobster scallops
Prices are pretty good really good if you hit it weekdays for lunch special - and lunch special includes General Tso's Chicken for fans of that
Whoever is the Chocolate Writer there is absolutely wonderful and it added a little extra to my wonderful dessert
I would recommend the beef chow fun the chicken Egg Foo Young and the Kung Pow Chicken
Unlike any of the other chinese food joints in Surprise it's actually worth a visit
They've got a large variety of items imported from Korea from household goods cooking utensils snacks sauces instant noodles fresh fruits vegetables seafood and meat
The meat is hard to chew threw the fryer way too hot and every dish uses the same bland brown sauce
There isn't much I can add here but concur how amazing the fried chicken is
I ordered a dirty martini to drink very good and the grilled chicken breast entree for dinner
For dessert they brought out the chocolate chip cookie and ice cream on the house for the birthday girl and it was SO good
Both were very tasty with good selections of chicken
The pasta dishes may or may not be worth considering
The pad thai the most standard Thai dish was excellent as expected but the Rad Nar is my favorite noodle dish from La's
As to the other dishes they're all good
The salmon is crispy and holds the flavor of the dish
The meatballs are huge dense and flavorful but the Baked Ziti always has me coming back for more
We shared the appetizer plate that had calamari and alligator tail meat among other things - all of it was truly stupidly delicious
I like paying for air conditioning and good food
All that having been said if you're craving good seafood and have the money and patience and can get a seat without waiting for an hour Pappadeax is about as good as it gets in Phoenix
We ordered a few different salads and 3 different pizzas along with a breaded mozzarella/rice ball paired with marina sauce as an appetizer
not to badly priced There beerbatered cheese is amazing on the pizza
i did feel bad for the waiter because last night we ordered slices and he accidently gave us 8in personal pizzas yet we only had to pay for slices so it was overall amazing haha
I love their Bulgogi beef and chicken the flavor is spicy and smoky
I am not vegetarian nor vegan so I am not knowledgeable in appreciating good mock meat but I CAN differentiate between tasty and unappetizing
My boyfriend got a mock beef dish that had this underlying soy flavor
Entrees grilled salmon -- this dish was really tasty
Overall Food Good healthy food try the salmon and the onion flatbread
We split a gluten-free Margherita pizza with fresh basil that was delicious
The chicken meatballs appetizer was tangy spicy flavorful and hearty
The roast chicken was simple tender and delicious
In all this was one of the best dining experiences I've had in a while with well executed food and service and an attention to detail that shows how much the chef and everyone working here cares about putting out excellent food
I got the trout with fried spinach and some sort of cheesy vegetable side dish that was amazing
she had the calamari pasta and i wasn't too impressed with her dish
in any case delicious food less than mediocre service
I'm talking delicious food and the best deal in town
The food was good but the service left something to desired
There was a lot of seafood and all really fresh and good
If there were just a couple of fixes to the factors in that equation preferably the quality of food and the presence of pre-game drink specials it might become my venue of choice before a game
I really wanted to like this place because I saw a photo of their veggie sandwich in the Phoenix New Times Food Porn
The service was fine the food looked delicious but ultimately everything I tried was bland and forgettable
The food filled the void but had no flavor
By now we're all perfectly aware that food trucks are a thing and a wonderful thing at that
Theonly thing preventing a 5-star rating was that the goi cuon spring rolls were goodnot great
As a general rule I steer clear of chain restaurants across from shopping malls but I must admit this place has got some seriously delicious seafood
The prices are reasonable the food is absolutely delicious and the ambiance is pleasantly modern without being too hipster douchey in your face
The tacos were filled with flavorful grilled meat or veggies and fresh salsa/avocado and Gallo Blanco does not skimp on the filling
Overall the food and experience here was so good that I am already thinking about when I can go back
Delicious food relatively low prices and decent enough service
They have fantastic food including fresh made mozzarella made at the restaurant really good chicken wings ask for them crispy
Even though we only had about a half hour the waitress made a couple spot-on recommendations Beef Stroganoff & Pork Chop - and after checking in on yelp we even got a free glass of house wine
I'm not often in Scottsdale but will be back due to the delicious food and retro ambiance
All in all a good standard place to eat exremely nice servers and decent food
just not what I want when I think of the good ol Midwest pizza
The most notable was the patty itself which had a nice mellow nutty flavor -- not trying too hard to be be fake beef and not overpowering in soy flavor
It must have been tasty because this is one of the first times I've missed my opportunity to try a bite of her dish
She mentioned something that should be readily apparent to most foodies which is that the key to providing tasty veggie options is to go with a macrobiotic whole food focus -- this approach de-emphasizes the constraints and instead focuses on building a good meal from quality ingredients
The items are stuffed with plenty of meat and garnishes the guacamole is usually quite fresh and everything is tasty
We had a delightful brunch felt we could be in Provence and ate the most wonderful and interesting food
The Anaheim rellenos were pretty good and of course the fluffy chips are great but I have never had a memorable dish here
The food here is stellar - quality ingredients great flavor and nothing cookie-cutter
It makes even simple dishes like eggplant parmesan really good
She also had a chicken soup with rice noodles Katheaw Saikmorn which she said was delicious
We ordered the BBQ spring rolls for an appetizer those were really good
With our appetizer we got 4 full size rolls that were plenty for the two of us to start
My husband ordered a stir fry dish and he said that was good too
It takes a good while for the food to come out and we don't really get much drink service in the meantime
Prices are what you'd expect from a high-end resort restaurant with great food excellent service and wonderful atmosphere
This is a great way to stretch your budget especially when dining with friends where a few beer and appetizer orders can take care of appetizers for the table and ultimately pare down the amount and hence cost of the sushi order
There was however one roll that shined and really hit the mark on both texture and flavor profiles The Pink Panther Roll
I believe it is blame the Kirin/appetizer combo deal for my memory lapses a spicy tuna roll with lettuce on the inside and tuna sashimi over the top all covered in a light japanese mayo sauce
If you are alone or eating as a pair I recommend eating at the sushi bar
I find this is a great place for groups since everyone can find something to like the atmosphere is wonderful especially in the cooler months and the food and drink is always good
My recommendations the Blackend Fish SandwichThe Mahi MahiRainbow Trout yeah I like my fish
The ranchera spinach was fresh tasting but didn't have too much flavor; the mole was good but the sauce needed to simmer longer to help smooth out the flavors and the Veracruz style with a tomatillo sauce and cotija cheese was excellent with gooey cheese and nice chunks of chicken and plenty of spinach all rolled in what seemed to be a housemade fresh corn tortilla all this plus soft drinks and 20+ percent tip for only $18 a piece can't be beat for the price in the area
Not the kind where you get sexual satisfaction although eating good Asian food can be orgasmic which is why they won't let me eat at the restaurant anymore but the taste and morning after effects are always the key
Many delicious dishes and the gigunda pork egg rolls are huge and give me pleasure like no woman can which is why no woman will let me eat in the restaurant anymore
You go here for a nicely paced delicious sushi experience
Their food is good again not great but they have an interesting menu with some more traditional Irish fare so this is a good alternative to other Irish places that call themselves Irish because they serve Guinness and have Notre Dame banners on the wall much like Outback Steakhouse calls themself Australian because they have Foster's posters and Boomerangs on the wall
They food is very tasty service is fast and friendly and they are conveniently located just south of the 101Hwy on 67th Ave
8 Close to home9 The food is pretty good - - kobe burger is great
Goodcents slices the meat and cheese when you order your sandwich and their bread is baked fresh - you can't beat it
Overall 4 stars for good food and service
I had the chance to spend a wonderful day with my Foodie Bear and a friend
You will have to wait for your food longer than if you get a hot dog at Costco which I also love but it will be worth it
The only thing I'd complain about is the long wait for food and the dishes wasn't piping hot when it reached the table
Fresh tasty and beautiful food in a classy quiet but energetic atmosphere
Food came out so hot and had plenty of the veal capers mushrooms capers artichokes  and a savory lemon sauce
The pasta side dish has a really delicious really fresh marinara sauce
for my Mom to try at home she's hard-to-please but LOVED the leftovers so that I could demolish the pastry creation   [I just recently found out I'm allergic to pecans but y'know this dish is so good I'd definitely keep it in mind on my next visit when considering my dessert options
They are friendly customer service oriented and work at producing great food for a good price
Exactly what a dining-out experience is about  - good food reasonable prices and welcoming environment
Sunday is a special day for all those people that want to get out and enjoy some good food and drinks and hopefully some good games
Along with all of the delicious food laid out there is a open bloody mary bar
There food normally is really good and they always have great specials during the week just make sure to ask
Five stars for Cornish Pasty -- for being something a little different for having tasty food AND for having about a dozen choices for us vegetarians
It was really good although it was cubes of chicken rather than shredded chicken which I'm used to
89 which is about what you might spend at a fast food restaurant on breakfast so why not stop by here and get something delicious instead
What I had of the food was good but I would eat dominos before paying for service that I don't receive
We ordered the fried sausage ravioli the coconut chicken tenders the chicken lettuce wraps tempura vegetable medley and the chef's sliders all from the appetizer menu
Since I'm not all that big on fried food all I can say is that they were good for fried food but it wouldn't be something I personally would order
The Service could be a little better and I'm not a huge fan at how the tables are so close together However the food is DELICIOUS
The rooms are basic the hotelmis typical convention fare and the food was up and down but we did have one or two meals over the three days that was out of the ballpark
though it does have good food for drunk people
We ordered $40 worth of pizza for takeout and it took almost 2 hours -- was told 20 minutes
Items I enjoy *Guaca Tony this is a great but filling appetizer a huge bowl of guacamole with a giant large size pizza crust yum
Ultimately though I would definitely recommend this place for pizza
Anyway sandwich looked good roast chicken with apples grapes goat cheese etc
^_^* We shared a walnut pear salad and a 10 gluten-free pepperoni and jalepeno pizza and both were super delicious
My friend commented that gluten-free pizza crust usually tastes bland but it was very tasty here
The service has been consistently good so far the beer cold and the food tasty
I've been ordering the fish and chips which has been mostly good
While not perfect the fish and chips was still quite tasty and as long as your not afraid of a little grease you'll probably enjoy them
My First thought are these Chickens on Steroids =]*Fresh Crispy Tasty and Piping Hot just out of the Fryer*Waffles were perfect
I have been to their Sunday brunch too- that gets pretty busy and the food was really good
The truth is pizza was very good but for us to travel this far plus long wait and hoping to get some to die for pizza was too high of an expectation
Let's start with the food Good ribs good chicken brisket is dependent on the day it seems
Sure I could find some neighborhood Thai joints that satisfied my craving for the sweet and spicy flavors of Thailand but it wasn't until I had dinner last night at Soi 4 that I remembered what Thai food really tastes like
I would rank the burger places around mill as1 Smashburger for their delicious Arizona burger and the awesome smash fries2 Chuckbox for delicious char-grilled meat that actually tastes like meat3 In-n-out for great-tasting meat and some of my favorite fries4 Five Guys5 Fatburger seriously why the fuck does anyone eat at Fatburger
Kobe beef burgers very delicious pizza and detailed salads leave you feeling satisfied
I'm no sushi connoisseur but I know good food when I taste it
while the wait staff are really wonderful the food was just okay presentation is nothing like usual Ethiopian fare family style
Such great recommends from the Oscar the head sushi master
If you order your sushi of sashimi toro they don't charge extra but it is extra good
Fish fat is supposed to be good for you so eat up
If you just are looking for a divish type bar to watch the game at with just decent food then this would be a good spot but there are many options of places like that I feel have way better food
It wasn't the prettiest dish to behold but it was pretty tasty and I would definitely order it again
Service is good the location is good the food is good and best of all they have a decent parking situation
Would absolutely go back for some good pizza pie
Although a bit pricey for what you get the pizza was very good
Cornish Pasty is a great example of my theory that food inside of food is always delicious
We started with the cold seafood platter which was fresh and delicious
I got the shredded beef and it tasted as good as it looked
The combination of excellent service delectible food and ambiance off the charts makes this place great
Give this place a try for a very romantic dinner with excellent food
Those who joined us for this meal seemed to share some of the enthusiasm over the dessert but I don't eat sweets so will have to believe their accolades worthy
4 On top of it all the food wasn't very good
Unfortunately I've been pretty let down each time I've tried to grab some good food from Scott's
Went to El Pollo Loco with some friends for lunch and saw they have new burritos on the menu so I decided to try the Poblano  it was a good size burrito don't really need a combo meal with it cuz it's a meal in its self it has chicken avocado rice beans corn cilantro onions and cheese with salsa wrapped in a gold wrapping um kinda like Chipotle
The food was very good and the prices were reasonable
The freshly made pasta was excellent and the meatballs were large & flavored very well
My wife had the Chicken Cacciatore and it was also very good
THE FOODAppetizer  shrimp canape was as delicious as it was unhealthy
Strawberry rhubarb dessert was rather good and helped dealing with the emotional pain of the bland chicken
OVERALLThe place is nice but for the money the food is just not good enough
I recommend asking for firecracker chicken
I would NOT recommend the orange peal chicken
This is shrimp chicken and beef in a brown sauce poured over a hot skillet plate at your table
This was not disgusting like the first dish but did not taste good either
Nothing sounded more delicious than fresh-tasting octopus shrimp fish and mussels in a cheesy creamy sauce
Let me begin by saying that the food at Luke's is really good i am a semi-regular customer
Chicken and Waffles Gluten free and tasty
The food was very good and I love the sweet potato tots
Their sushi is usually pretty good and they are by far the cheapest place around for it
The fish is almost always very fresh and it just tastes pretty darn good
It closed a while ago without our ever having been there - the wait was always too long and I was leery because I had heard that the food while good was very very spicy hot
When his food arrived on a dangerously hot metal plate it was cross-dressed
The meat was moist and the caramelized onions and the crema were good addition
Keep up the good work that is served with a smile great beer and food with lasting memories
I have eaten here and had dinner to go it always takes forever and it is not cheap I expect cheaper if theres no atmosphere or really good food would make up for it
I have not gotten sick from the sushi here but lets just say I didnt feel so hot after eating here the last time
Now I'll be honest I've only been to the Roosevelt twice and actually had a good time both times but I had to give it 3 stars for a couple little nit-picky things as well as the fact that I'm anti-bandwagon when it comes to sports and food
It was good enough we thought we'd try a main dish
The ravioli with meat sauce was quite good
That sauce along with their thin crust and cheesey goodness makes for some fairly unique pizza
Service is good they have a wide variety of desserts
I've  been there a few times before why the lack of customer service and the quality of food this time
The vegetarian springs rolls were very good for an appetizer
They need to spice it up and add more flavor to their dishes and then I'll come back
If your a glutten for good food can stomach dropping $65 pre drink for dinner and want to walk away with your belt buckle popping the tasting menu is a must
Also got a noodle dish called the pad key mew w/ tofu that was pretty good and spicy enough for my tasting but my friend recommended to get it Thai Spicy if your into that
In stead of talking about the quality of the food which is good there are a couple of things that you need to know about this incarnation of the chain
And the curry fries as well as the corned beef & cabbage taquito oddities are also good choices
I've also had the fish and chips which are great most of the time with one or two exceptions oil wasn't hot enough/too cold/etc
It's a hole in the wall but then against so are most Chinese and Mexican places the good ones anyway so if you are truly about great Indian food come here
When they asked how hot I wanted my green curry chicken I did a double take
With never empty glasses of wine  My FavsSweet Corn RisottoScallops cooked to perfection with a parsnip puree mmmmmmmmAlaskan King SalmonCenter Cut Filet MignonBrussel Sprouts yes Brussel Sprouts Tempura battered with a sweet relish AMAZING4 hour braised beef short rib Talk about melt in your mouth  Red Velvet Bread Pudding I will go back just for this anytime I am near the QuarterI can't wait to go back to Tanzy for a full meal but I don't know how I will be able to top this evening of amazing food
It's definitely a staple of amazing locally owned AZ food
I am a big fan of their salads when I used to eat meat their antipasto was amazing
Oregano's is always a great spot to meet up for drinks and excellent food
The service is pretty good very friendly and if it's your first time which is was for us they give a sample of part of their menu beans red jade chicken chicken with ginger chicken fried rice shredded pork and jerk chicken was thrown in since we were curiousI got the egg foo young with no meat in a burrito and added regular fried rice to mine
I would probably come back to try the meat dishes since the red jade chicken was a spiced up version of sweet and sour chicken and the jerk chicken fried rice was good
While they don't do alot of fancy custom Americanized rolls like some Scottsdale douche was complaining about their sashimi is amazing
no way people who started at 9am are going to hang around in the desert sun eating overpriced hotdogs and hamburgers all day they don't allow you to bring in outside food or beverage
One was red one was green one was Equadorian I think Ok so for dinner I got the Bandeja Paisa which seriously Im not even sure what was going on there but it was incredible meat and I think a sweet plantain and sweet sauce and just some good Total comfort food
We got the coconut flan for dessert good but Ill try something else next time although Im not really in it for dessert
Very good hamburger made from meat that was packed into a patty on site or at least it looks that way
The fresh meat/seafood selections most notably the Kobe beef burger sirloin beef burger beef/chicken kabobs and Chicago hot dogs can make anyone look like they can grill
I'm not even going to get into their hot prepared meals or their sushi as I could go on and on
The food was good quite authentic and fairly priced
But if you ask me to compare Chou's Kitchen to the street food I had growing up in China Chou's does not come close in taste and quality
To me it was not spicy enough because it is traditionally a very hot dish from Sichuan Province
But the flavor was there and I was thrilled to see a dish Chinese restaurants in the U
But the quality of the lamb was so bad and almost inedible it was predominantly fat and connective tissues and the very small amount of lean meat was tough and overcooked
4 Soybean Paste Noodle a soupless mix-it-yourself cold noodle with cubed ham sliced cucumber and a soybean meat sauce
I would recommend this dish to people who like homemade Chinese dumplings because they are delicious not because they are the watery relatives of potstickers
It was delicious and I have to honestly say that although my quest to find the best mexican food in the universe will never be complete this is my favorite place for shrimp Cerviche so far
I would probably go here again but not under the pretense of eating amazing food
Hits-hot and sour soup-crab angels-wontons-chicken and vegetable entree-almond chickenMisses-sweet and sour pork-lo mein possibly worst I've ever hadThey have weekday and weekend lunch specials as well as family-style specials both of which will save you money
Lunch/dinner specials often include soup fried appetizer like wonton egg roll crab rangoon etc and an entree or two
Yummy pizza at a yummy priceD I never eat my crust because it's usually never good enough
The Daily Dose is a spruced up trendy-ish bar restaurant slightly away on Scottsdale Rd from trendy restaurant row with spruced up good solid bar lunch and dinner food
Except the food happens to be very good and dependable
I'm not talking much about the food because while good you might not leave and talk for hours about it
the pizza is huge a bit greasy and very tasty
they're a sweet family living the american dream and they make a tasty pizza
My wife is very picky about food quality and always looking for the organic option or at least pesticide free
The food was screaming hot when it was dropped which was a good sign it was right off the grill
Farm burger $14 was one of the best burgers I've had in the Valley - flavorful beef patty with a moist tender interior
I recently had the chicken pesto sandwhich and it was delicious
Serving size was very generous but flavor was missing from the chicken
The beef hard shell tacos are very good
Second to have a local neighborhood sports bar that has the game day atmopsphere of a college hangout but then serves the quality and variety of food that A-T does makes its a great stop any time of the day or week
I fully recommend this ice cream joint to all dessert connoisseurs and sweet tooths alike
Or I could be at the deli counter getting some delicious Boar's Head meats and cheeses
The chicken-fried steak was huge and tasty and the gravy was good although I don't recall much chipotle
No the atmosphere is not sexy; the W hotel is sexy Sushi Roku is not
The service is definitely rushed and I certainly enjoyed my time more at Stingray than Sushi Roku
The food is good but incredibly overpiced
I certainly have no problem paying 200-300 for a meal but it better be good and honestly the sushi at Stingray Ra and Kyoto is better than this place
With the economy where it is the dish reflected the smaller portions you would expect for such tasty food at $8
The place is kind of a dive but the food is good
The top of the pizza was burnt just enough to give it that perfect flavor
I don't remember the last time if ever I had a pizza THAT good
I was a little disappointed we didn't get to try a red pizza but we were plenty full from the appetizer and main entree
it is suppose to be a casual place with awesomely delicious comfort Chinese and Mexican food
The food is always good but Kevin our server was kind polite friendly and helpful
The chicken was perfectly done not overly sauced and the pita again was warm and wonderful
I've been to Gus' fried chicken in Memphis and the chicken here is just as good
The food is always delicious way better than PF changs especially the chow mein and garlic chicken
I can go just about anywhere and eat just two bites and think their food tasted good
Please put some time and energy into cooking the rest of the dish and let's see if your molecular gastronomy - culinary offerings are James Beard worthy then
Three of us shared entrees actually so I also tasted a wonderful Scotch beef with buttermilk mashed and organic broccolini and barbecue chicken pizza with house-pulled mozzarella and grilled green onions
It was a chicken stew flavored with walnuts and pomegranate
The papa rellelena was so dry and the meat inside didn't really have any flavor
I had the seafood salad which I was amazing
I enjoyed the Mac + Cheese- which was a large portion of  chicken breast applewood bacon wild mushrooms cheddar parmesan campanelle pasta & truffle oil
The only reason I gave this place two stars is because I think their food is good
Aside form the chewy flavorful baguette and the tender roast beef the bold and creamy notes of the cheese spread makes this sandwich a stack-of-love
This was one of those desserts you savor and enjoy though I ended up eating the whole thing in about four bites yes it was that good
I ordered the Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket Sub which is JUST as good as it soundsbeef brisket topped with melted cheddar cheese and sauces
so my only dilemma next time is choosing between the already-proven-to-be-great Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket Sub or something else that apparently will be equally as good
Naan was boring spiciness of the meat dishes lacked flavor to make them complex
Perhaps it is just that I have been spoiled by the amazing Indian food I have had elsewhere but this just did not stack up
The meat was flavorful & cooked to perfection and the brioche bun was amazing
I've had the kalbi chicken bbq and cold noodles
My recommendsThe Basiled Chicken and Brie SanwichMac and CheeseWe were even treated to a nice Brandy Alexander in honor of my friends birthday
The first thing I ate was an egg roll which was pretty yummy then I ate a small crab rangoon which was cold
My boyfriend wasn't really impressed with his either most of the food was barely lukewarm but 'I told him we might as well try the sushi before we leave
They didn't charge me for my meal which was good since I wasn't about to spend $15 on an egg roll
The food here at Essence is really good
We started with pepper soup and meat pies; both were delicious
I had it with the pounded yam which was light and rather fun to eat  We also enjoyed the eugusi jerk chicken barbecue shrimp and tomato stew; all were very well seasoned and delicious
We had a fantastic meal and the total bill was around $63 for 6 entrees appetizers and dessert
I enjoyed the Chicken Adobo a favorite of mine and the Chicken afritada which was suggested by the owners
Both were really good I had hope the meat was a little bit more tender but the flavor was there
Instead my review is based on the fact that it is not really quality food and definitely not fair priced
The service is good and the food's even better- so much better in fact we went there yesterday and came back this evening
Pizza good but not as good as the sandwich itself
Service was spot-on atmosphere was fine drinks were cold and refilled often the beers even came with chilled glasses and most important the food was fabulous
Here's what we hadAppetizers *1 large order New York Egg Rolls 2 total egg rolls but we had them cut in half so each of us had a half
All the food was at best barely warm and most of it was virtually cold
We nicely explained the issue mentioned that we did enjoy most of the flavor of the food but that most of it was cold and obviously had sat there ready to bring out to us for a very LONG time
The Thai spring rolls are very solid and the housemade sweet/sour and peanut sauces are delicious
Garlic shrimp tonight and if I remember correctly the Choo Chee seafood curry dish a few months ago but both very good--I doubt they have anything that isn't really enjoyable but you may have to try a few to find the true gem
Another friend recommended this place and it was a nice spot for a cheap drink and decent food
It's not often that you find a place with amazing food and no wait for a table
We ordered the seafood tower as an appetizer
which was good but I have definetely had better seafood towers
We felt like a celebrity from the amazing food at T
The place has a very family-run feel to it for good reason and the food reflects that; eating there almost feels like you're having lunch at a friend's house
The meat dishes were very tasty I really liked the chicken tika witch is almost the same as tandoori chicken with a bit more of a barbecue taste
We had some amazingly rich flavorful food and interesting ingredients
They clearly use quality meats - in fact they advertise this
What can I say that hasn't been said about this place other than the fact that my dad was visiting from Mexico and found this place as he strolled through Downtown back when this place first opened and recommended it to me
You can tell the difference between this place and other breakfast joint once you taste their food its natural organic with lots of flavor and it smells fresh
This place has a special place in my heart because I remember going to it when the hype hadnt started and I hardly to wait to eat there at first so I am glad for them because they really deserve all of the attention that they get for their delicious food
Well like most really hot foods these wings take awhile before they really hit you
My reuben was good-the corn beef was moist and not fatty at all
Great prices for delicious food that is still perfectly edible for many days
I enjoyed the Tuscan Mixed Grill which itself was one of the greatest dishes I've ever had
Stopped in for dinner with a friend and was amazed to find one of the best bartender/wait staff in the world delicious food and a great atmosphere
My companion and I split the Aztec Chicken which was very good
Spicy hot flavourful and the side dishes are quite a treat
Portions were generous gyro meat was pretty good meat didn't taste as fresh as it could be and same goes for the rice and potatoes
I had the chicken fingers appetizer with the blackened cajun spice and they did a first rate job with the seasoning
I realize this is what I order at all of these joints but it's a good gauge to see how each establishment prepares this dish
The scallop dish my wife ordered came with a sauce that was bland and lacking in flavor
I was not impressed we usually drive out of our way to go here because the sushi is that good but at this point Im not sure we will be going back
This was my first time  I know impossible to believe that I have went to a Philipino restaurant I had  stew that was slightly spicy don't want to know what all was in it  but it was very  very good it did include beef and potatoes
I also has the pork that was simmered in a brown gravy very tasty dish
Still we had a great time excellent service and some good food and wine
The food was not exceptionally high quality but it was GOOD and it was filling and large
This place is perfect for students on a budget but the food is very good too
The Carne Asada Taco with pickled radish and salsa fresca was also very good
After all is said and done I will keep coming back because the food and service is generally good and the restroom smell if a minor offense that has nothing to do with the food
Pizza sandwiches mexican a noodle place and a grill along with a hot and cold salad bar
It may cost you more to shop at Whole Foods but its definitely worth the extra money
Sushi bar Starbucks thanks for not helping my addiction wine concierge lots and lots of cheese amazing fresh bread stand etc
The food concessions were surprisingly good not overly expensive $8 and freshly made and 20oz soda were only $3
My husband had the only winner at the table Cha Cha Chicken  tasty and good texture
If you've been to Jamaica and enjoyed the food then this place is a MUST GO
Ridiculously affordable for the quality of food I walked out thrilled with the experience
The food was very good but the service was not
The food was good but if they had better customer service I would drive out of my way to get there
The chicken wigs were good - not spicy enough but good nonethelessThe taquitos were goodThe chile relleno was good and HUGEThe green mac and cheese was NOT good - mushyThe posole soup was DISGUSTING - I took one sip and I returned it back to the kitchen
I'm so full of their good food right now that I can hardly sit and type this review
You can taste the real orange flavor in the beef and chicken
The food was piping hot even when we got home
The staff is pretty awesome and I have always enjoyed the food
Their pho really isn't even all that good but the rest of their dishes are usually quite tasty
They've got a good variety of dishes and everything that we've tried  other than the pho has been very good
And then we ordered food and it was really really good
6 meat Ragu sauce was undeniably good but the homemade pasta was just  meh
Just because it's on Food Network show it doesnt mean it's ALL that good
I'd love the top-notch expertly prepared fish and steaks the ginormous portions and the way they make everything -- including lettuce leaves -- deliciously heart-attack rich
I wouldn't recommend Teakwoods for folks who aren't into meat
He also offers my 1st love Shaved Ice in many natural flavors as well as lush green salads warm soup and don't forget a chocolate covered frozen banana or a greek yogurt granola parfait for dessert
I threw her a request for dessert flavors and one of the recommendations she gave - Lemon Soufflu00e9 - was one I didn't expect to like but turned out to be my favorite of the purchases that day
Friendly staff great food and a bar with a wonderful ambiance and outdoor seating
The food and the cocktails were so awesome that night and the staff was amazingly friendly
I don't normally go for seafood items but had crab cakes once that were delicious in DC and always wanted to taste crab cakes that good since then
Thus the average of one star service and three star food quality makes two
Chicken steak fish and shrimp all surrounding a bubbling green sauce that's so good you want to drink it
I was super impressed by the menu and the food
Also don't expect New Mexico prices but for me the food was worth the prices
I wasn't overwhelmed by the quality of the food but the flavor was nice and it was a good change of pace from the same old deli experience
Things I like about The Vig- great outdoor patio with smoking section- great outdoor fireplace renders the patio warm & comfortable in the cooler months- consistently good service; attentive affording knowledgeable & friendly- hot bear DJ on Friday nites- bacci ball court on the side- Trivial Pursuit cards at the tablesTheir sweet potato fries with curry-mayo ROCK MY WORLD and the grilled chicken sandwich ain't bad either
The California Carver pizza is super unique and amazing
If you like good beer good food and good times this is the bar/lounge/restaurant for you
- As noted above we had a Groupon with a value of approx $175 which included 4 drinks 2 appetizers 4 entrees and 1 dessert
It is slightly pricey but its quality food with unique ingredients
The appetizers aren't your normal fried bar food you would find most places either
Along with my friends we split the meatball appetizer the stuffed portobello mushroom and the oven roasted wings medium
The meatball appetizer came on a triangle plate with a generous helping of their red sauce in the middle
The wings were excellent with them being oven roasted the flavor of the juicy chicken and the sauce on the wings was amazing
The pizza we had was a hot potato pie which came with potatoes bacon onion and a drizzle of sour cream
We ordered few appetizers multiple sushi and few rolls
The appetizers and the sushi were pretty good for the most part
That being said it was really interesting to us because usually a non-authentic sushi restaurants try to cover their lack of skill by serving pretty good rolls which is basically an Americanized sushi
*Location = thank goodness that there is at least one pretty good sushi place around Chandler area*Food = pretty good*Service = very good*Atmosphere = nice and hip*Price = expected for AZ sushi place = over $100/a couple
The spring roll appetizer is also quite delicious while you wait for your pho as well
The atmosphere is wonderful prolly the reason I stayed with 4 stars instead of 3
There are free peanuts good food and a fun atmosphere
Hubbie's shrimp dish was good too but the broccoli ringing the dish could have been cooked just a little bit longer
The Coq au Vin was too irresistible to pass up and when it came to our table it delivered as promised; a wonderfully rich Bourgogne sauce covered Chicken leg on top of an equally decadent mound of Mashed Potatoes
I actually haven't ever eating their food but I've heard it's good and I have yet to try it
Yes it's an abomination to real sushi but it's pretty darn tasty
I tried this place for lunch today and really enjoyed the food and the pricing
There was a heaping portion of chicken and it was delicious
we tried the buffalo wings which had the right taste and texture as meat ones and the ranch dressing was perfect the CRAB PUFFS which were mind-blowing the bbq sandwich the curry pasta the argentine sandwich delicious bread and chimichurri sauce the fish tacos which were good but not nearly as amazing as the other entrees and the kung pao chicken
All the flavors of the seafood has been extracted into the soup because biting into the actual seafood themselves it tasted very bland
The meat had more flavor than other Korean restaurant I've tasted thanks to the fat
The dishes were wonderful and eating rice helped to balance strong flavors
If you like strong flavors then these dishes would be perfect for you
The chicken was on point crispy and well seasoned the mac and cheese was oooey gooey cheesy goodness and the waffle was oh so scrumptious
We ended up ordering the Blue Crab Cakes and Spicy Tuna Roll appetizers I had the Pear Walnut starter salad and my husband had the fish and chips
The decor is appealing the food is decent for the price the service is friendly and all in all is a good experience
So if you're leaving the mall or the movies and you need a quick bite that won't hurt your finances and the food will taste good and the decor and service are great this is your joint
So good-- it was the BBQ beef BBQ pork and BBQ chicken
The Chicken Biryani was beautifully present ed and absolutely delicious
If you are new to Indian food this is a good first step
We had the Rosemary Chicken and the Chicken Tikka Masala both were excellent
Bistek Tacos-The meat is flavorful and perfectly cooked
We each ordered the iced tea to drink and were served a passion fruit-flavored tea that I thought was very good but beware if you're a fan of regular plain iced tea and think that's what you're ordering Adam Carolla would have been pissed
I made a good choice with this meal the wrap was very fresh and had lots of tender seasoned chicken and fresh crisp veggies
I'm glad there's a place in my neighborhood that has such fresh tasty healthy food choices
I've never tried the food but have had good service when trying to get a drink
They do have a few pasta dishes that I enjoy and they do taste good but not good enough to outweigh the cons of this restaurant
It sucks because their food is pretty tasty
So left Margaritaville and went to the yard house for drinks and hung out there for about three hours and enjoyed pizza during reverse happy hour
Carolina palate the chicken fried steak smothered in good gravy with eggs and grits was way above par
But if you're looking some good fish or oysters and hate side items check it out
Perfectly marinated meat not greasy high quality and served on the most delightful little corn tortillas
Try your pizza with sun dried tomatoes meatballs and risotto-- so good on that delicious crust
As good as the food was at Malee's and as much as my wife and I appreciated the ambiance of this restaurant on a rainy night corner table next to the fireplace nicely dim lighting the service was above and beyond what we could have ever expected
The philly cheesesteak springroll with carmelized onions and spicy ketchup was very good
The skirt steak is seasoned and cooked to perfection the traditional beans and rice are wonderful supports and the fresh tortillas and guacamole make the dish a masterpiece
I understand why GOOD restaurants never put salt on the table but every dish we had at Noca was out of balance and could have used adjusting
The roast beef was good and veggies fresh  but the horseradish mayo had no kick to it
The food was EXTREMELY delicious and I could not wait to get home and tear through the bag to get a bite because of the delicious smell wavering through my car
After the meal I was extremely content with their food as well as their Blueberry lemonade just one of their many flavors I might add
Being new 4 months to Phx and coming from LA the land of amazing food I was asking around for some good places to check out that only a local may know about
My boyfriend enjoyed his beef fish and cochinata tacos
I also tried the chicken curry that the hubby ordered and it was very delicious
The dirty looks were well worth it though because the food was SOOOOOO good
Having never tried Ethiopian food and having seen the ratings I thought I'd give this a shot
Fortunately I was preceded by an apparent regular who was introducing the restaurant to his out-of-town friends; I got some food recommendations and a peek at how to eat without utensils
I'd order the miso glazed butter fish and sushi rolls on my next visit as they were pretty tasty
Lots of chunky veggies and chicken in a very tasty broth
aside from a really clumsy and spacey but really nice waitress the food was AMAZING
bevs not includedThe food was good to excellent
We finally chose the duck fajitas which were superb as an appetizer for two the grilled salmon with autumn vegetables and black bean cake which was delicious and as healthful as you can get and the tagliatelle with mushroom meatballs which was astoundingly flavorful
The food was ok however they spilled sauce all over appetizers and still served it
I haven't eaten in the main part of the restaurant but I would not recommend the sushi bar
Finally to the right a large deli section with fridges filled with the same meats cheeses and sides you enjoyed in your sandwich**Fud**The food is excellent of course
In the long run we ended up waiting 30 minutes after we finished our appetizer to get our sushi
The final nail in the coffin is that the Vegas roll was cold when we got it
When I am craving an amazing sushi meal I'll go to Yasu
While it's not amazing fish there's nothing wrong with it - nothing here to get sick from
I am also a HUGE fan of their freezer section you can get everything you need for a tasty and cheap dinner so those nights you don't feel like cooking the frozen food is a god send
I could go on with issues seen during previous recent visits but the bottom line is that there are too many good pizza places around to spend any more time with this one
Beyond that though this place is super clean unique in some of the design attributes and the food and service are quite good
Our food was fantastic - we did a sampler of a bunch of appetizers based on our servers recommendations & quickly ate everything up
My main course was the Tuscan Chicken Salad - it was amazing
If you want good New Mexico food drive the distance to Richardson's or if you don't want to drive stick with Ariba's but DO NOT go to Secreto
I got word that P Sub opened up in Chandler and went down for lunch and had an AMAZING southwest chicken sandwich and my fiance had The Torpedo
For $2 more you can get two side dishes - cold salads hot beans fries or chips
The meat seafood and poultry are all top quality but you'll certainly pay for it
They also always have hot entrees for lunch and dinner that you can buy a la carte or with side dishes for a full meal
Since I live in Tempe I attempt to find good places to grab quick noshes that are NOT chain or fast food joints
The desserts were good too - warm choc cake salted caramel pudding and the peanut butter
delicious food expertly prepared and served
I would absolutely go here for Happy Hour for the discounted prices on the amazing food too
While traveling thru the area I stopped here and ate dinner  a few days ago with my college student son   The food was really good
They seem to put a lot of care and quality into each dish
We both enjoyed the pasta dishes not the greatest we've had but definitely good
They probably have the best gelato you can get in the valley but the food wasn't amazing
First and foremost the food was excellent
My husband's pasta dish was light and tasty but the butter sauce lacked a little flavor
The atmosphere is cool and the prices are extremely reasonable for the quality of the food
Great food good portions and affordable drinks
There were so many things we wanted to try; we decided to forgo the appetizer and get two pizzas as our appetizer
She enthuisiastically recommended the fried shrimp po'boy and chicken/sausage gumbo which I ended up ordering
The decor is fine and the sangria is still delicious but the food and the mood are in decline
On the rare occasion that I would foray in the realm of entrees few things were more delicious than the chicken palm frond
While the food is still tasty it doesn't seem to dazzle
Service was quite good portions were large we each took some food home and priced were OK for the quality
Price  Not badService GoodAtmosphere  GreatFood  GreatWhile slightly more costly than I'd pay for a typical sandwich lunch it's worth the cost
My friend while she loved the food was surprised I'd recommended a place with such poor service
I enjoyed these but unfortunately I didn't order them vegetarian and the meat detracted from them
The egg rolls were good but the pork was fatty and pretty unappetizing
*update* I've been back numerous times and the food is good and the value is great
I will be a frequent customer of Lolo's and would recommend if going have patience as they supply good food and the demand is there
are all very good and are a step up from typical bar food
I still have not tried any of the desserts but they all look delicious
If the place is busy which it usually is because the food is so good   you have to stand in a long line
The food is above average the drinks are pretty good
the alaskan and little mermaid rolls were very good
The ambiance was amazing the waiter was very professional and friendly and the food was amazing
Of course all the ambiance and service in the world means nothing without good food
Bruschetta is one of my favorite appetizers or snacks - basically a favorite all around so it takes a lot to impress me when it comes to this dish
The flavors were bright and fresh and the fish played nicely with the fresh tomatoes
The fish was fresh flakey cooked just right and seasoned in a way that brought out the natural goodness of the swordfish steak
This was good fish and they made it shine
Their cheese pizza is a classic thin crust New York style pie with good sized wedges laden with too much
We also tried a pepperoni pizza which had plenty of flavorful disks that were just salty and spicy and oily enough
On this Friday night at dinner time they were able to have our 2 pizzas cranked out in under 20 minutes with a good lineup of other orders and the phone ringing
Bobby Qs is a your run of the mill BBQ restaurant with fun and slightly cheesy decor fatty yet satisfying and tasty food and overall a fun time
Like I said the food here is fatty but pretty good
I would rate the quality of How Do You Roll as a couple of steps above a high-end grocery store sushi bar Whole Foods AJ's Fry's Signature etc
But it's not even close to as good as any of the trendy sushi spots in the valley
If you're looking for something that's of a higher quality and can be served in very healthy style as long as you avoid the mayo based sauces then roll with it
The food seemed consistent with the other location portions spiciness flavor everything seems to be a duplicate which is a good thing
Good food consistent service easy in and out
It was good but I was missing the tomato sauce on my pizza so I guess I am not a white pizza girl
Their hot stone bibimbop is pretty to look at but has almost no beef in it
The curry dishes are delicious and served in generous portions especially when ordered for take-out
Spring rolls and hot tea are necessary components of the Pho experience
The shrimp spring rolls were a hit; I loved the ratio of rice noodles greens basil and lettuce and shrimp--not too many noodles and plenty of the good stuff
I wasn't ready to eat my dessert so early in the morning so they were awesome and packed my brulee in a cup of ice to keep it cold on my way home
In any event the food is pretty good so go by and check it out
We finished this amazing tasting menu with a sampling of four dessert- chocolate type cake oil olive cake lemon cheesecake and fresh berries and mango paired with a dessert PinotOverall the meal was AMAZING
If you want healthy food that's delicious this is the place to go
I substituted the chicken for some Tombo Ahi it was a few dollars more but OH SOOO WORTH IT
This place seemed like it would be in an airport except that the food was actually good here
Our party of four enjoyed each dish on the table ravioli Nina veal saltimbucco with fettuccini alfredo veal francese with rotini in a fresh tomato sauce spaghetti bolognese along with an appetizer of the gnocci
The food is excellent - I enjoy the pork meal that has the stupidly spicy mustard sauce
Overall I've enjoyed both of the meals that I ate at Taneko but with better places to eat real Japanese food like Yasu Sea Saw Hiro's and even Sakana I'm probably not going back real soon
Lunch special came with typical cali roll and the udon soup was ok in portion the broth is pretty flavorful
Sometimes I get the lollipop roll or the hotty hamachi too
This place offers great happy hour discounts and the rolls as the other reviews state are fresh well made and most importantly delicious
I know some people like to go for the 'cheapest' most basic rolls for sushi like spicy tuna/california but I would highly recommend their specialty rolls What the Heck is my fav as they are really creative/unique and very very tasty
It's definitely worth stopping by if you are close by if you are a fan of good sushi
The location is great the people are fun and fun to watch as are the TVs the food and service are both very good the prices are outstanding the Bocce Ball is different and it's always packed
The pizza crust has a great contrast of crunch as well as chewiness which reminds me of the crust at Mozza in LA but it does not have the complexity in flavor of Chris Bianco's
Within 20 minutes they brought a quart of hot chicken noodle soup and a Chicken/Bacon and a Roast beef sub right to my door all hot and toasted
Their dishes came out fresh and very tasty better than some places in the Bay Area
Quick hit for a hot dog with everything - bacon mayo beans tomatoes and onions on a soft bun/roll
they had one with wagyu beef on it that was really good
If all you are looking for is a huge buffet and you don't care about the quality of food this may not be your place however I found the selection to be more than sufficient
I guess I should qualify this as I like hot food and mild to me typically will flame my family's tongues off
This dish had a great albeit mild chicken flavor and the cream cheese and cheddar combined to add a cheesy overtone
Sometimes the food specials on the white piece of paper are good but not consistent
The food was quite tasty but I will be careful and get a level 2 spice next time
Since moving to Chandler last year we have been back several times and have been very impressed with both the food and the service
I have enjoyed the pretzels the now famous nachos with chicken mind you the spinach-artichoke dip some of the various wing flavors and a pizza
The parmesan fries were delicious the grilled beef sandwich was okay but the milk shake was just awful
I have regularly returned for the consistent good food since moving to the Biltmore area
The food here was pretty good and along with plenty of seating a bar area and a nice big menu I can see myself coming back here as a customer
An amazing pizza place in the middle of town
On top of the amazing food the Pino's crew are fantastic
They are real service oriented people who are passionate about the quality of their food
Highlights of the mealBrisket- Tender delicious excellent rub and crustRibs- Fall of the bone meat with great flavorSauce- Just enough tang and sweet
After my initial visit I switched my cats food selection to Blue Buffalo per a cashier's recommendation
Let me say THIS burger had that char-grilled black crunchiness you think of when biting into a perfect backyard burger in the mid-summer with all the flavors of top-grade savoury flavoured Angus beef
If you are looking for good food solid service and a nice atmosphere then you probably want to avoid this strip mall hangout at all costs
If you love low-quality food poor service and a revolting atmosphere then you need to steer your lifted F350 right on over to Texaz Grill
The meat was bland veiny chewy and not even good enough for my neighbor's dog
The food can be summed up as atrocious inedible poor quality and even hard to look at
The food is pretty good but honestly after a round of 18 anything's goods and there's probably fewer things in life that make me happier than drinking a cold draft from an ice cold mug that you can actually see vapor swirls coming off of after a long round of golf
Fun Saturday night music venue with good food & beer for only a few $
The 1$ carne asada tacos are straightforward; meat cilantro onion grilled jalepeu00f1o - delicious
They have fish a good selection of it and decent quality
Overall it is not a cheap meal but good fish rarely is
Pretty good food but the service wasn't the best
Good service Great Food Outstanding Beer selection
but their food is so good that makes up for everything else they lack and I will keep going back just because of their good bbq
The Fake Mediterranean stuff like the lavosh pizza are good but I can't really say that anything else is anything but adequate
The breading on the chicken was delicious not greasy and surprisingly thin
My friends got the pork chops and catfish which were both equally amazing
They made the amazing food even better with how personable and fun they were
If you are in the mood for soul food then this place is worth a trip
The pizza is unique in the chewy and crispiness plus the hand picked farm fresh ingredients and flavors that will throw your mouth and tongue into doing the tango with each bite
Not much of a menu for food or for drinks but a good place to hang out and lots of space for larger groups
The service sucked big time and I could have made food just as good at my house
I can't say enought about how good the food is
Go and see Eric and eat their amazing food
It is clean the people are exceptionally friendly provide excellent service and make a great chicken sandwich
Usually you can get good food or good service but it's very rare to get both
Their menu looks amazing -- I haven't seen chicken gizzards on a menu since I left home and though I haven't tried them yet they're on my list for the next visit
But if you want to spend an evening with your family enjoying pizza and listening to a pipe organ with all the bells and whistles literally this is a good destination
They also have a small food menu that looks delicious but we haven't tried yet
Ok the Broccoli Cheese is good but I at least wanted Chicken Noodle which almost all Subways have every day
All in all go for the pizza and baked goods but go to Fry's for the rest
It reminds me of a scaled down version of the wonderful Oyster bars that you might find at some of the Las Vegas Casino's with the addition of some other tasty seafood boils and cajun concoctions
The flavors of the other ingredients are apparent and the clams are just a nice tender mild piece of meat that makes a nice filler for the soup
The service was very friendly and fast the restaurant calm and clean and the food pretty good
The crab cake salad stew jambalaya roasted chicken and salmon plates all received enthusiastic thumbs up from our table and the desserts cheesecake and chocolate cake cups were delicious
The food here was good but nothing to die for like Matt's
Grimaldi's doesn't make the absolute BEST pizza in town but it definitely is good
We had dessert as well which was pretty good
One of the things we missed most even after a few weeks was the amazing quality ethnic food
We ordered carry out and they recommended a comparable lamb dish to my favorite dish at our Chicago place
Although the food sounded appealing was disappointed when the it came out cold and soggy
My youngest began to fuss at that point they were both in their double stroller and this woman frowned at her and said Well it's hot I wouldn't be happy either
Unfortunately the food itself wasn't very good
The taco's ground beef was too salty and I generally like salty the rest of the food was fairly bland and only luke warm to boot- the plate was hot just not the food on it
Again really good the food has greatly improved
Me being from India I expected a bit more from this restaurant but looks like the chef just forgot how to put out a good dish
The food was very good the staff was helpful friendly and on top of things plus they elicit the Alice Cooper image in a very accurate way although they did a not bring me a snake-thank God
I would have only given this restaurant 3 stars due to the dirty plate and the lack of green peppers if it wasn't for the fast friendly service and the good pizza
The pizza I ordered was pepperoni and mushrooms it was very tasty and cooked better than the pizza I had at Pizzeria Blanco and I didn't have to wait for over 2 hours
T Cook's is one of those rare places that can genuinely say everything is good when you ask for their recommendationsMaybe it's just me but the atmosphere ambiance service and food combine in subtle but effective ways to create a meal experience that you really don't find very often
Compared to SF or NY I would say quality is just as good and you get a little more food for your buck
The Kobe beef flatbread is small but amazing
I think the beef is cured because it has a depth of flavor that is just incredible
The Mission in old town Scottsdale was also very good food not quite as good but fantastic ambiance outdoors and very good food
Alternatives mac and cheeseThe waffles are good but to be honest with you I feel like they just get in the way of the best fried chicken I've ever eaten
As for the food I got a 1/2lb BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger and it was pretty damn good
The curry chicken was made with chicken breasts not a whole chicken that gives it flavor when its cut down to the bone marrow
All in all I enjoyed the FOOD but the rest of the logistics not so much
East coast atmosphere and east coast food  on the expensive side for being a cheesesteak dive but it's worth it since you cant get them anywhere else in this stinkin' desert
I ordered a salmon dish on recommendation from the owner or the man as a perceived as the owner
to continueWhen I got my main course I found that my salmon was a bit over cooked and the sauce they had placed over the fish was ice cold
Lemmie tell ya though I don't do hot meat and cold sauce
Where else can four adults and two children start with miso soup and crab salad eat a gorgeous platter of sashimi a tempura appetizer sushi until they are filled and a scoop of ice cream PLUS have sodas and wine for $121 pre tip
Then after a good amount of time they brought the smaller more expensive Pancho topped with spicy tuna and the soft shell crab rolls
Panino $7 + $1 additional for a slice of Proscuitto - basically pizza crust-like bread with mozzarella tomatoes and the additional proscuitto inside served cold
I popped in here several times a week to pick up staples it was always an adventure to see which prices had been marked down-- they even have a section in cold foods where they mark older stuff way down
All the rolls are delicious but our favorite is the Crunchy Roll with octopus and the Las Vegas Roll
The sandwiches were made with good quality bread meat and cheese
No but it was good enough to finish it - I was STARVING by the time we ate   The wait staff was pleasant enough but I can get much better pizza with no wait back home
Tasty hors de ouveries tastes of full sized menu items including white prawn with sweet and sour papaya mint and chile and a tender ribeye with beech mushrooms pearl onions and horseradish mashed potatoes were passed by attractive staff attired in risquu00e9 garb
Our server was fantastic and prompt the food was wonderful and the space was really cool
My favorite dish was the Roasted Beet salad- it is the perfect size and really flavorful
I guess the only caveat is we never have a to-go box of the delicious food to take home ; Also if you like wine the owner has other bottles that aren't on his list and he prices them well
Had good chips/salsa took a few minutes to get our drinks then once we ordered food was out in maybe 15 minutes at the most
The food came out in a reasonable amount of time but mine was not very hot still warm but barely
Definitely worth a try if you're looking for good Thai food
The food presentation and description will remind you of Chinese cuisine but the flavors are unique and delicious
I have been to this place 5-6 times and thought the food good the coffee great and the servers especially the brunette with the ornate cube necklace very accomodating
Ottos has definitely found a repeat customer in me*edited 1/23/11*i just moved to texasand the one thing i havent been able to find is pizza as good as this places was
We thoroughly enjoyed our 16 pizza along with the free garlic bites and marinara sauce
The pizza sauce had a great flavor with just the right amount of garlic
The pasta was delicious and the meatball and sausage outstanding
I enjoyed the food and seeing everyone else's dish was a marvel
The meat was essentially flavorless and the rice/beans forgettable
Ruth Chris why does your food have to be so average and underwhelmingThe restaurant is very nice inside and they have a great outdoor patio for drinks when it is nice outIf you go ask for Bruce he is the best server that I can remember having for any restaurant - was exceptional and I dine out at many high end placesHaving not been to a Ruth Chris in 4 or 5 years it was time to give it another shot i remembered the food being very average and being underwhelmed by the steak which was the case again - The steaks were cooked correctly I feel their steaks are bland especially compared to other chains like MasterosThe desserts were very good and the highlight for us both the sin cake very dark chocolatey and the bread pudding with raisensWon't be going back however the location and the service are fantastic so if you do enjoy Ruth Chris steaks you will be happy here - go see Bruce and he will make sure you have a fantasic time as we did even though the food wasn't up to our level of expectation
Now there's a delicious pizza where you're not waiting out the door for
you know just good solid diner food But when they call me cutie as they serve my coney island and fries it just makes everything
but that's a quibble not a criticism Jim's takes me back to the days when I could sit down at the counter for lunch next to Hugh Beaumont and get an open faced roast beef sandwich for lunch served by a wise-crackin' waitress that always calls me good lookin Even if it never happened that's how I remember it Hon
fish taco tasted like it had been fried hours before just hard and cold
Overall food was good and service was sub par
Stab a piece of steak -- dip in pot of hot broth -- wait 3 minutes -- let meat cool a bit -- eat
Also the pizza is not bad the prices are fair the salads taste fresh and the place is bright and welcoming with comfy hotel room art and a steady flow of people getting their orders to-go perhaps to avoid my hero server
The food was excellent the service was good and the space was clean
The food was good and even though I was with a large group the service was great
Can't wait to go back for the hand cut and huge pork loin sandwich which besides a side dish includes  cup of really good looking chicken soup
This is hands down the best Chinese food in town so good that I drive 40 miles to chandler once a week to get a taste of NYC
My food arrived after a short wait the sandwich was generously filled and the bread tasted possibly homemade it was thick and tender the soup was piping hot but just right to eat and was also delicious just needed some salt and pepper
The salad was extraordinarily good with a ton of cured meats and artichokes
The dish came with a ton of delicious gigantic pieces of shrimp and the portion of the pasta could easily feed 4 people with all the salad and apps we got
Their thin crust pizza was delicious and crispy even in the center
Don't get me wrong the pizza was solid had a tasty House Special and the beer specials rock local brews half off on weekends but I would never chose this over local staples like Oregano's or Nello's for good pie and beer
Overall it's a solid pizza with good ingredients
I orderedLocal Organic Greens Chinese Long Beans Toasted Nori Soy Sesame Vinaigrette $10Pan Roasted Free Range Chicken Garlic Mashed Potatoes Chinese Broccoli Lemongrass Pan Jus $28Glass of Orin Swift Prisoner Red Blend Zinfandel Napa $17The Organic Greens were very tasty
The Chicken was amazing so tasty and juicy
Which I don't mind as long as the food is good
Most people would tell you its good for airport food and that may be true but once you peel back a few layers of the onion you may change your mind
Favorite items include Blackened Chicken Tacos not on the menu Parmesan chicken and Cobb salad I recommend the mini unless you want a salad large enough for two
Marginal service and marginal foodPROS the bus boy was busting his hump and doing a damn good jobCONS food was on the tail end of warm
00 chicken breasts that need to be cooked but it's too hot to cook inside and too hot to cook outside
And at just over $23 for 2 dinners appetizer and 2-liter bottle of soda I didn't feel so bad about the chicken
This Filipino Food was very good and I think most people can find something they like here because we tried three different meats and a tofu dish and all were different all were cooked nicely with good developed flavor
Both my picks looked familiar like Chinese or Thai dishes to me but neither of them had the seasonings I thought they'd be but the food was still tasty and good
The Chicken was very moist and had great developed flavor from being slow cooked on the bone but they didn't brown the skin so I found the skin unappetizing and had to remove it
Pearl is an anomaly in Scottsdale- a reasonably-priced quality bar/sushi place that doesn't discriminate
All I need with my rolls is an Asahi and Cold please
As for the food I can't really tell you what I had but it was good
The sushi was delicious - quality pieces and very fresh
Food was good too; lots of veggie and meat options
falafel good chocolate covered nut rolls delicious
The food was a disaster coffee was cold the eggs were not cooked the veggies were not edible the hollandaise was out of a can or other container and had been microwaved or something still retaining the shape of the container read not warmed enough
The food was good and met my expectations for fresh sushi
Did here they have good pizza and a happy hour at three
The owner lady is friendly and helpful with the dish recommendations
Please see my pics of the yummy pan fried beef buns green onion pancakes freshly made napa cabbage and pork dumplings and the cold salad appetizer of parsley green onions and jalapeu00f1os
Ray suggested the Q-Rolls appetizer and it didn't disappoint
The food was poor the service sucked for lack of a better word and overall nothing worth coming back for
The beef sandwhich is just awesome and tasty
The broth is just delicious as is the noodles and chicken
-The food is bomb I had Stuffed Jumbo Shrimp wrapped in bacon over dirty rice recommended
-Beast Seafood in AZ hands down for the reasons above I would definitely check it out if your in town and want some good food and southern hospitality in the desert
For some reason this chain has decided not to use the good ol' tried-and-true gyro meat roasting on a spit that is served by almost every other Greek-ish place I verified this with the server
The food was very good with the truffle mac & cheese being a fave
Upon asking some locals about the really good sushi place downtown to which no one knew the name we were eventually led to Stingray
The sushi rolls were all excellent and we ordered way too much that neither my friend nor I could muster the bravery to finish the last one
It's a mountain of morning goodness so be prepared to walk or roll around the grounds afterward
But the food quality and service here seems like it is still very much the same
Quick and courtesy staff and hot and delicious food
Anyhow the bowl didn't fit nearly as much food as other places I guess it's good I didn't over -stuff myself but the price was higher and that whole  meat product area was really bad
So I came here with a voucher for a 3-course meal for 2 plus a champagne toast which was a good deal but about all I'd pay for the food we got
Besides the meat which was delicious but served in very small portions it was substandard especially for the price
* The staff is really friendly* They offer a bunch of varieties of pho an pack the veggie pho with lots of broccoli and bokCons* It's not located in the best area of Tempe* The broth wasn't extremely flavorful definitely beef based* You get a small portion for the price of the pho
I wish I could be wittier here but I have no idea what sort of flaccid cardboard-flavored awful disgusting stuff the reviewers who like this place were eating before they thought that this was good pizza
Pizza arrived late and was cold the driver wasn't at all apologetic and once again it tasted awful despite the beers we pounded back to dull the senses and lower our standards
If you want ACTUAL good pizza go to NYPD
Their desserts are great too and the free cinnamon crisp-y things they give you with your bill are very tasty
He was great the food was good so the experience was saved
Initially I had gone in for a hot dog but ended up ordering the Italian Beef sandwich
It was made just right the juice was tasty and the beef and bread were great
Thankfully most of their food continues to be delicious that's a plus
The food was amazing the staff was sweet and KNOWLEDGEABLE they could answer any questions and helped me even if I was being a little indecisive and the atmosphere just added the cherry on top the energy and vibe in there was just great
I had the natural chicken as my entree and while it sounds like a very basic dish I enjoyed every bite of it
8/12/12Two more pizzas since my last  DELICIOUS

Scores with the trifecta of great food good service and killer ambiance
Same as last time all of the food was fresh and delicious
If you want authentic delicious Mediterranean food head to Eden's Grill
I was told the Curry dish was good nothing extraordinary but good
The food wasn't amazing but it was good enough for a theme chain place
I cannot stress enough that the food is worth coming back time ands again
Worth noting until recently the service was consistently so far below the food and the rest of the experience that it presented a quandary
Seriously - would it be that hard to throw on some hot pasta dishes to the menu
The Now use these amazing organic cibatta rolls and have removed the High Fructose corn syrup from everything
I do wish there were fewer fried appetizers and more items for people who don't eat fried food out of the bar
I had an amazing lamb shank and my husband's game-meat was absolutely flavorful
I recommend this place for great food and a nice relaxing night atmosphere
The food and service were good but for the prices and what you get I would intend to disagree
I was first impressed that the chefs communicated in Japanese saying 'onegaishimasu' with the waiters to come and pick up the food but in the end was quite offended when they began to shorten the word to 'mas'
Their food is relatively healthy in comparison to other Asian cuisine restaurants and the Pho is AMAZING
The broth in the Pho is flavored perfectly and the meat is oh so tender
I always get the #4 Pho with brisket and the #17 egg rolls both of which are amazing
The food is delicious but it's the service that really makes this place
The prices are reasonable the food is good and the service is top notch
Outstanding artisan pizza with as good a crust as I've ever had and homemade mozzarella
Pita Jungle on Apache is the kind of place I want to love art on the walls specials under $10 good location a hip vibe and an eclectic and healthy menu but due to poor service mediocre food and other better restaurants  in the vicinity I can't bring myself to recommend Pita Jungle on Apache whole heartedly if other options are available
The Good The Daily Specials this night are about 10 bucks and feature a variety of grilled chicken tilapia mahi mahi hummus pita and vegetables
Meat service includes 15 different types of meat here of which I tried about 8 and they were all on the decent to good range
I don't think I asked for one thing all night and the food is good
The food is consistently good and they have an extensive menu
My favorite is the shrimp tacos and my husband loves the french dip their pizzas are also very good
I was very impressed with the plate of homemade pasta menu options that the waiter brought to show us - but then a little disappointed that the majority had red meat in them
I loved everything about our dining experience from the service to the meal except compared to the many restaurants I've eaten at I thought it was over-priced even for the high-quality of their food
the rolls are creative but they are all covered in sauce and less amazing than the photos make them out to be
i enjoyed the taste of my ginger just as much as any of the rolls
I'm impressed by how pretty The Parlor is; the decor the food even the people inside are just lovely
The food was great; good fries that are crisp on the outside and extremely tasty the Funghi pizza is decadent probably due to the truffle oil and I highly recommend the tiramisu
The food was not good the service was bad
Turns out that the menu they have online is not the same as the one they have in the restaurant but there were still some good seafood options
The fish was cooked well and had nice flavor
As I looked in the display case at the food there was a pretty good variety
She used to greet us and chat a bit at the table not now; in fact she's become quite rude -  I really enjoyed this place but find myself frequenting numerous other establishments for my Chines food fix
I think the blend of cheese on the New York Three Cheese pizza is excellent
Chicken was thin dried out and also flavorless
food was good I'd say a 5 on a scale of 1 - 10
The food came out at the perfect temperature to just start eating right away - which was good because I was STARVING
The food's flavor and quality however are very good the place is always sqeaky clean
For having never eaten Ethiopian food before all were impressed
You can't beat a good Vienna Beef hot dog
and Higley Hot Dog makes a good Vienna Beef dog
transplanted New Yorker was not as good as I thought it would be unlike the other yelper I think they gave me too much meat too salty and too big
Salmon melt was delicious but the after taste was a little fishy
I told her that it was good and then she suggested Pumpkin Creme Brulee for Dessert
IF you actually been operating for 15 years it has to be under different name cause the food was not even remotely close to be good
JT is a funny neighborhood joint that hits the spot when we're looking for a good fast foodish local dinner
Each time I've gone the food's been decent the meat's been pretty good and the pitas have been pretty decent too
There's a nice movie theater Harkin's right in the mall & a good food court
La Fontanella is for gourmands and romantics who are serious about quality ingredients and dishes prepared with a heavy measure of love
However the past couple of times the food has been overly salty or not as tasty
As for dishes I recommend the Kung Pao Chicken very flavorful
Both were good but we're not pros on Greek food
Overall the pizza was good cheesy and my boyfriend and I made short work of it
44 is a hell of a deal and it's pretty tasty pizza
How she thinks these will evoke any kind of flavor into food I have no idea
As previous reviews have stated there are excellent appetizer specials when you purchase a Japanese beer such as fried calamari chicken yakitori edemame and of course pot stickers fried or steamed for $1
The fish is served with a sweet sauce which is delicious and when eaten with Kirin Light it creates a perfect pair just ask for it you will not be disappointed
Rolls are excellent as well some of my favorites would be the Cajun wild fish roll or the crunchy eel roll
I really like this place and was surprised to find such good Italian food in Glendale AZ
I've been here several times now and the food is always delicious the wine selection is very good and the service is always terrific
The shimp pasta dishes are also excellent
Anyway rolls arrived and I had a good excuse to change my mind
We recently saw Troll Hunter and really enjoyed the movie
I HIGHLY recommend this place if you're craving creole or seafood
The app crab wontons was delivered first and had a good flavorful sweet and sour sauce that I used to flavor the rest of my food
Which meant that my food was delivered and since my date and I didn't care to share dishes we both sat there awkwardly waiting for his while my food got cold
While I was attempting to choke down my too-soft spaghetti drowned in too much sugary-sweet brown sauce little grisly bits of chicken and a handful of bean sprouts that I tried valiantly to save with some hot sauce and failed miserably the birds were stalking us
Food was actually OK once it came out correctly pretzel bun is nice touch but items were cold because they kept reworking the same plate as opposed to just providing a fresh meal for the customer
We can't give half-stars so I'm going to go on the up side of 4 and a half just based on the food quality and authenticity
I am guessing it is not really a traditional Oaxacan dish but damn it was good
You can tell he loves what he does and it reflects in the quality of their food
Amazing food great  pricing delicious and one of a kind
The food came out quickly and was delicious for both me and my brother
My husband ordered the beef tenderloin and our waiter informed him they were all out but assured him they had a wonderful top sirloin
chandler is really looking up these days - i can get true birria here get a jamaican meat patty from down the street cuban moros and christianos across THAT street and a really really great hot dog with chili and asiago from the hugest pittsburgh fan in an antique shop a walk away from there
As I was craving a salad for lunch I visited my local Whole Foods and created an amazing looking salad
Whole Food is too expensive to have this low of quality and bad customer service
PEARL sushi is good sushi for a tolerable price and has great employees that look happy to be there
The rest of my family really enjoyed their dishes except for my mom
But they have one thing going and that is pretty good food
I had a pesto chicken linguini which was pretty good
I'm kind of disappointed that they either have staffing problems or just like taking their time because their food is quite good
Food wasn't good at all specially for the price
Besides the great company and great place ambiance wise the food doesn't worth the visit
This is where I take my parents when they visit and where we go when we want to relax over a bottle of wine and consistently tasty food
The pizza was dry and didn't have a ton of flavor
The grilled chicken with hot wing sauce in place of your standard tomato sauce was very good and even better heated up the next day
I would recommend this place to anyone looking to relax have a great beer and good food
Their brown rice usually comes out really good not an easy task for most places and the chicken and veggies are tasty
However I had noticed lots of other people eating sushi here during my previous visits and from what I could tell they enjoyed their meals
I was happily surprised with the quality of the sushi at Haiku Grill
The rolls were a good size other places I've gone to make them too large to easily fit in your mouth and had a good amount of fish in them
The food was excellent too & he has gotten rid of most of those garish chairs that were hard to get in & out of when it was Indus
What you'll get here is different tasty food with significant overlap in dishes to an Indian Buffet since after all Pakistan used to be part of India
The bbq chicken was very good but I was taken aback by how hot the jalapenos were
However a few months back my friend invited me to a food truck event in Scottsdale and raved about the hotdogs
Back at the office everyone enjoyed the food
Although the food is good I do wish the food wasn't as expensive as it was
If you want to eat you will have to order in they don't mind if you bring food in although I think they occasionally have hot dogs and they put out bowls of a pretzel sort of mix
The first time I went on a recommendation and the food was
The chicken enchiladas were fresh but lacked any real flavor or spice
The food arrived and though it was good one notch above decent it was
The quality of Chicken exceeds any other market around-Frys Safeway
There are various types of sausages you can get at the meat counter are excellent
The food and drinks are good and they have a great happy hour
The VBB  with tofu chorizo mushrooms corn spinach potato egg whites & charred tomato salsa rolled in a wheat tortilla packs a flavorful punch but didn't leave me feeling so full that I couldn't go back up and get a cookie later
The vibe is wonderful but they have to have consistency in service or food for it to survive
-The barbacoa beef and carnitas are super tender and flavorful
Things I don't love about Chipotle-The chicken is a little bit fatty and not as flavorful as the red meat and pork options which is disappointing since I'm trying to limit my red meat consumption
But this place makes more then good pizza
I tried the machaca pounded beef con huevos and it was deliciously spicy
Warm friendly service excellent food at low prices served in a very nice establishment
However as the other reviews point out the food that they offer is take-out food from another restaurant and as such we never bothered to order anything to eat as we don't go to a wine bar expecting to have such poor quality deli delivery food
My sandwich was excellent and others enjoyed their food as well
My husband however was intrigued by the tortilla soup and fish tacos which came highly recommended by our server
my excitement peaked and then fell when I placed my hand on a cold dense roll; I was hoping it would be fresh and warm but sadly it was the butter that was warm and melty
The flavor was spot on though nothing out of the ordinary or flavor popping and the meat was literally melt-in-your mouth
Oddly however my usually non meat-eating husband found it within himself to take one for the team by eating the final bites of the tender goodness; he couldn't even resist
The food was good and really more there than one person needs to eat
The food was good and plentiful and inexpensive
Don't get me wrong it was good but it wasn't the best fried chicken I've ever had and the customer service was ridiculous
- including a calabacitas stroganoff type dish over a bed of egg noodles instead of spanish rice which was filling and tasty
My boyfriend enjoyed his carne asada chimi but I thought the meat was burnt and could have used more oomph
So for food we both enjoyed our saladsCaeser and Veggie
I ordered the Surfrider Chicken Sticks and Steak Tacos while my friend ordered the Mango Chicken Caesar someone else in our party had ordered it and enjoyed it
Awful service cold food no food and a fake-Malibu serving bartender give this place ONE star in my book
The decor was very well done the service was attentive and the food was wonderful
I usually order the Thai Basil their signature dish and it is so good every time
Fried Chicken & Mashed Potatoes - the hubby enjoyed and LOVED his fried chicken
So it's a good experience for the hubs who likes that kind of food
Five dollar select appetizers- including the infamous boneless buffalo chicken dip as well as $3 beers and well spirits
Other than the buffalo dip I have enjoyed the Southwest Chicken Wrap which I thought was above average
I would say pass on the corn bread chicken dumplings are an odd shape texture and flavor
hard to even order different dishes when it's this good
The chicken was just thick enough to give it some texture and the bacon lent just enough smoky flavor to the whole thing
The food is good and if you stick with a sandwich chicken or otherwise you can easily stay within the $10 range
I had the fish tacos on the recommendation of the cashier - not great - I much prefer the fish tacos at Rumbi
My husband had the beef tacos and the same thing -  very little flavor to the tacos - the one thing I did enjoy was the spicy chicken on my daughters quesadila
If we go back I would only have/recommend the spicy chicken
Our typical fare includes a big bowl soup to share a cold dish #1 which means something husband and wife - includes beef tongue stomach etc in oil herbs chilies and roasted peanuts  spicy chicken with bone in any of spicy beef or pork dish and some sort of stir fried veggie
I found the food very tasty and the service was great and entertaining
I enjoyed the atmosphere outside the service was quick we were only there an hour and the food was fantastic
The items we ordered included smoked salmon appetizer spinach artichoke dip prime rib classic California roll bread margaritas apple walnut cobbler
We pleasantly enjoyed our second time around in a booth with beers and shared a delightful ceasar salad and the soup of the day-brocolli cheddar I can't complain about this little airport bar/resturant since their staff was so quick friendly and the food was pretty tasty
We weren't starving and wanted to try this place out so we figured we'd give it a shot for a quick sushi fix
Prices were extremely reasonable for the quality of the food- $55 for three courses $65 for 4 $95 for 9+ courses
Everything we tasted was absolutely wonderful from the quarter free range rabbit appetizer to the chili peppers in aoli sauce to the seafood stew
Chris Bianco's pizza's are every bit as good as Thomas Keller's Oysters and Pearls
The service is always very good and fast but the food isn't that great
They have a menu for food and their food is neat sounding but all of it is bland and flavorless - much like the way this club has no soul
Ambience- Pros- Modern clean Cons- dark and tables too close to each otherService-Pros- Attentive polite concern Cons- Food came out a bit too slowly maybe because of ARWFoodPros- flavorful food presented in simple yet appealing styleCons- nothing really stood outFirst course-1 meatballs with polenta - meatballs were moist and polenta had good flavoring and consistency2 prawns with beans- prawns good grill flavor seasoned well beans were also creamy and well cooked3 cheese artisinal board- good quality cheese with some fruit compoteSecond Course1 cioppino- good seafod flavor seafood- clams prawns and octopus were fresh and the tomato broth well seasoned  I add lime and chilli powder to give it a kick2 Wagu brisket- well cooked and seasoned favorite is the grilled cauliflower according to hubbyThird course dessert1 ricotta fritters- dry and boring after 1st bite average tasting 2 chocolate flan- nice presentation inside little jam jar
Although food was good not worth the long distance drive
Both are BIG patties of meat that are recommended to be cooked to the rarer side
It's just a Subway so you know that the food isn't going to be amazing
Most of the other employees are pretty good as well which is a rarity in fast food
While you're waiting for your order grab a table out on the patio or browse the shop for local foods jams honeys or spices as well as cookbooks and other tchotchkes
The options weren't exhaustive but that is not indicative of the quality of the food
I'm gonna rate each dish even though I didn't partake in each-Mozz Sticks good I would order these again
I've been to and worked at other Applebee's that have consistent service good food and less of a wait time
So I may go back and try the sushi but it would have to be amazing
Their noodle dishes are so good and they are very helpful with subbing tofu/etc for meat
Sure you have to get rammed by a stroller or two to get anything good but that makes shopping here much more interesting than at the mall with civilized people
The food & service were good but they add an 18% service charge tip onto each bill for the wait staff to share
We didn't think the food was that good to go so far out of our way and be told we have to tip 18%
Our large party would agree that the food and the atmosphere are still top notch as are the wines and that delicious homemade limoncello
We were planning on having the table sample some of Cibo's delicious crepes for dessert and I'm positive we would have certainly drank a bit more as well but instead we chose to leave early and take our business elsewhere
Small mom and pop shop with fresh home made food at amazingly low prices
The food comes out quick which is good because when they turn off the lights you can't see your food unless you push it way back towards the little lights
another drawback is they keep all the theaters SO cold that your food gets cold
25 star dishes and appetizers  The spicy riblets are INSANE
I did not find the chicken good at all service was slow and the plates came out one at a time minutes apart
The tomato gin soup is crazy good and if they happen to have the cold sweet corn salad as a side dish don't think twice before ordering that
Desserts are also good as you'd expect from a place that lists them first on the menu
I read some of the comments about there not being good Mex food in AZ well NOW you DO
As for the food the parmesan fries were highly recommended so we ordered 2
My review may sound really bad but I don't want to knock the place because the food was good
The Taj beer was icy cold to put out the heat of the nicely spiced food
Tandoori combo plate was loaded and had a great depth of flavor tart yogurt garlic marinated chicken lamb shrimp and sausage
its hard to find a good pizza here in phx and when i finally did they had to close down
This place has good food and if you're coming here for atmosphere you're not coming for the right reasons
Mindfully I have not had much Read Any other Ethiopian food so I don't have anything to compare it to but everything I got was very good
Most vegetarian dishes I have had in the past usually have either lacks in texture or lacks in flavor but the fosolia I had lacks in neither
The only thing that wasn't good was the salad which was made with not the freshest lettuce but there was so much delicious food that I was not hungry for it anyway
People working over there was very nice and the food tasted really good
on top of it being centrally located it also has some pretty damn good sushi
I normally always get the standard a sake bomber edamame a roll and some sashimi but my co-diner decided to be gutsy and try  The Exit Wound is possibly the hottest noodle bowl in the Southwest
The food was really good service was excellent
I'm not one for chains but I am one for strong drinks good food and my awesome friends
If they pay attention to the dining room details they also pay attention to the food details which is a good thing
There are times when I've ordered online for a particular time and when I arrive my food is already cold
but all I can really come up with is that the sushi was pretty good
I had heard from a friend that the Brown Sugar Hoisin Chicken Tacos were good so my wife and I tried them off of the tapas menu they were very good
For dinner my wife had the Chicken Caesar Salad the chicken was cooked very nicely with good seasoning but the salad itself at risk of sounding snobbish was rather pedestrian
a nice family owned place with good value and an excellent quality pizza
Sauce can make or break a pizza and J&J's does not disappoint; it's tangy and delicious and the pie that's right
almost hidden away but it it well worth the hunt for this Chandler pizza gem
Their Pollo Magnifico was good - but it's not specifically better than the same basic dish at other restaurants Poco Pollo con queso at Ajo Al's or Pollo Fundito at Valle Luna and a few other spots
Rich beefy flavor with lots of star anise clove and fish sauce
The cobb salad is really good but the pizzas were disappointing
This place proves my theory if you make it snooty enough everyone will think its good matter how bad the food is
Okay so the food isn't amazing but they do what they do best
The wings might be fantastic since they offer many sauce flavors but I don't know since I don't eat meat
OK for the food We ordered Calamari and a salad to split as an appitizer delicious
We didn't order dessert but we ordered hot buttered rum
This is not your typical chain restaurant it much higher quality in service and food
The food was very good but the service could use some work and organization
The gumbo was a fairly large portion that was rich flavorful and chock full of sausage chicken and okra
It's always good to try the popular dish at the new place to see how they prepare it
; That being said the food was really good
Now for the good part the food and beer
This pizza is too good for words I added a prosciutto base shocking I know and feta and the flavors from these just complemented this pizza
The first time I ordered Mongolian beef and the soup of the day was hot and sour soup which was quite tasty as well as the Mongolian beef
My second time there I ordered the kung pao chicken which was good but the soup of the day wasn't all that great
was with a party of 8 and everyone was pleased with their dish from omelets and pancakes to fresh salads and fries you can tell they are all quality ingredients
I tried the Kung Pao Chicken which was very good could have been a little hotter and my partner in crime chose the orange chicken - she raved about it
This was the last thing I was going to order and now I know I'm going to have a hard time ordering next time cause I know how good this dish is
We didn't try the wings but I had a meatball sandwich which was pretty good but not good enough to entice me back for a second trip
You can watch your food being made and pulled from the hot oven
I've had just about everything  but my top recommendations are chicken shawarma falafel and manaeesh both the za'atar thyme and cheese jubna varieties are excellent I have not tried the meat version
The chicken machaca carne asada are all wonderful
If you are looking for a delicious place to eat good Mexican food on a day where you wandered out in shorts and flip flops
The fish tacos were made with Alaskan Halibut and were delicious
The food has a wonderful freshness to it and I would definitely go back again
The food is pretty good but the prices are too high
- Seafood Salad For a $10 item you get an amazing amount of food
Truthfully to get sushi this good in Arizona it's worth anything
Food we ate a wonderful and healthy breakfast at the Blue Sage would return again and Roy's was an excellent dinner
We were in Phoenix on vacation from our home in Oregon and talking about food our favorite subject with a local  resident and commenting that we sure wished we could find a good bagel
Hey minds out of the gutter please I'm talking about the brieEntrees - I had the chicken and prosciutto ravioli which were delicious however I would have liked more prosciutto taste and less chicken
The food was good and was brought to our table quickly
Good Mexican food but nothing really special
I called to order take out on my lunch break and sure enough by the time I got there my food was waiting and was nice and hot which seems like a tall order for most take out
As for the food the flavors were great and I was devouring it like a mad man
It's hard for me to order just one thing so usually I order a crepe as my dessert even though I'm tempted with all those delicious pastries staring me down in the display case
I just tried one of their featured items for lunch today and it was very tasty- Chicken del carbon
They mix antioxidant-packed fruits strong cheeses excellent sauces and quality grilled meats
Every time an out of town visitor asks for great Mexican food we also recommend this place
The only thing I would change is the portion size on some of the dishes but that's just cuz I have a big appetite it's tasty and I want more
Good food great service and lots of gluten free options
Seems like a pretty straightforward menu I played it safe and went with the Chicken Parmesan and it was tasty
Overall it was good food and quite environment but a little more thought into decorating and how to incorporate the homey feel would give it great character and charm
Pricey but great food and so worth it for a special occasion
From the old 'market' that it used to be to the awesome wood fired pizza oven to the line of fresh salads pastries and other goodies - the renowned bathrooms
I had take out brought to me from this place today so I can't speak for the inside of the store but the food was very good
Keep up the good work on the beer but fire the guy that came up with your pizza recipe and start over
Everything was very good the Salmon was very good and will be repeated the Scampi wasn't so great but still a good dish
The chicken had a nice crispiness on the outside and had the flavor of lightly fried chicken without all the fat
The meat was so sweet & tender and the fat was so flavorful
When our food came we both agreed that it was good but bland
My egg dish was tasty but not spicy in the least and his steak was prepared to his specifications but he said it tasted like it had no seasoning on it whatsoever
I think if it was closer to us we would definitely be back but it really just isn't worth the drive for such boring food
We had several traditional Chinese dishes but from the aromas and the crowds I'm guessing the Dim Sum was really good
The family style dish portions were good and the food was fresh and tasty
I loved the crispy crust of the pizza thought it was super good
I'd say if you haven't been and you love pizza its worth the visit
Sure it's expensive but the quality of the service and food is superb
We started with the calamari which was outstanding - it blew me away that seafood could be so good in the desert it had probably come in on the same flight I did from Boston
It's a great place to hang out the service is excellent and what food I've tried is really good
About $9 total for meal tax and a 20% tip for some really good food
The variety is amazing and the quality of food is top notch
The desserts were so good especially the Bananas Foster
It's a treat but you certainly leave feeling like you got your money's worth or close to it because it's hard to eat that much food as it is a bit on the pricey side
The salads look amazing but I've never been able to get past the pizza
The desserts look great but I'm  never overly impressed when I get one
If you are looking for a taste of the rich life without actually being rich then consider hitting Sushi Roku at The W hotel between 5pm and 630pm Monday through Saturday
Our waiter was excellent he did a fantastic job describing each dish and making sure we always had drinks in our glasses and got us anything we needed
Photo center has been good for on-line orders via Snapfish and no real complaints about the rest of the store
The food is delish and the service was good
It was my first time here i had a good experience but i thought the food i had was ok
Good selection of food but I think you have to make it your own if not you get a pretty basic plate such as shredded meat of your choice with green or red sauce
The food was good - although I've heard amazing things about their garlic fries it really wasn't my thing
They kept coming around to fill our glass with water and to make sure the food was good
The fish was wonderful-however because of the incredibly similar presentation of the dishes i sided with my original favorite-perhaps out of being biased but it was also smaller here
The food is good I had the SoCal Burrito w/ shrimp and the beer is even better
The food is pretty standard and nothing is extremely good
My BF's twin brother ordered the chicken for $25 and said it was no where near as good as the steaks we had all ordered except him so which is why when you go to a steak house you must order a steak
Next to that are the appetizers then chicken then assuming the seared ahi but I had come for the steak
I ordered their meat pho and the flavor was good
The food and drink specials are good and there's a different one every night
The first time i had the pak lok beef - it was very good the beef was a bit tough but the flavors were amazing
The crepes were both our favorite dish i would still recommend the stir fried chicken though too
We have so many excellent choices here in the Valley & certain things didn't measure up to the best*  The food selection here was slightly small for an Indian or Pakistani Buffet with 19 items counting the salad items separately
*  At many of these Buffets you come away raving about how good the Chicken Tikki Masala was
The chicken was fried crisply and had great flavor
Yes it's more expensive but better to pay more for good food than waste it on bad
Better sushi to be had elsewhere their sushi is really not that good at all fatty fish with poor texture
Tasty and interesting but I'm definitely more of a meat person
Extremely flavorful dish uniquely prepared
The menu/dishes are certainly unique and very tasty
My only critique is that the dishes are extremely rich and heavy which is good every now and then
We are not your usual fine dining crowd and I think my experience here was a healthy dose of pretending I was a judge on Iron Chef and actual honest-to-goodness good food and excellent service
Ok silliness aside the food was excellent and the staff was incredible
They did have their schtick down with their food presentation but they were also good sports and looked like they were having fun
The food quality was surprisingly good for an airport sports bar--burger was tasty bacon was crispy but not burnt and made with actual sharp cheddar cheese
We both preferred the BLT but I am sure the Chicken Salad was more healthy and it was tasty as well
I only had a bite of the fish so I can't speak that much to it the bf enjoyed it
Obviously this is one restaurant that does not care about the quality of food or service
As to the food -- I thought everything was very good to exceptional but my wife found some of the stews only adequate
Yes scantily clad nurses will serve you your food cheerfully chat you up and be agreeable to a photo shoot at the end of your meal
I enjoyed the food the ambiance and the flaming dishes
Well I pretty much liked it =p it was good with the pita and rice =For the finale we had a flaming dessert
Anyway the dessert was really good and looked delicious too
I expected a full flavored carne asada and got a very bland meat burrito with a guacamole that might as well have been just avocado puree
They have a reasonable happy hour and the food is REAL good
Both places deliver on the pizza quality and the service has always been up to par there is just nothing I would change so next time you are thinking about going out and getting a pizza then you must try Grimaldi's
But spicy so beware They also have a good Tangerine Beef dish
curry chicken salad sandwich is a tasty lunch on the run and i agree with the cupcake reviews
Prices were reasonable but this certainly isn't something worthy of putting on a national television show about great food
But for the Super Bowl I wanted to get some smaller portioned appetizers and deli foods without sacrificing quality
I think Richard who now has over 30 restaurants probably needs to pay closer attention to the food at his restaurants to keep the quality up
That said those dishes that were good were very tasty and this was a nice convenient spot to go for dinner while at the Princess
Most rolls were warm instead of the crisp cool I'm used to and the flavors weren't distinctive
The food took a really long time but  I was satiated with my appetizer of veggie spring rolls
I had never had cold spring rolls but I enjoyed them
and If you wrap my spring rolls up to go wouldn't you think to wrap up the tasty peanut sauce that came with it
I am not a picky eater but I do expect quality and consistency when I pay a restaurant for food and have been a loyal customer for years
The quality of food at the restaurant is not the same
Would definitely recommend for dining in as the restaurant food itself was still very good and if you're having a party or wedding this is the place to pick for catering
And the sauces in my guy's meat dishes were equally amazing
Now that I've popped my Ethiopian cherry I'm determined to learn how to cook some damn good Ethiopian food
We were taking the food to go so I loaded up on the salsa and wanted to try the green guac sauce man glad I did that guac sauce was delish mad that I didn't get more LOL We got our food and was headed out but I swung by the guy grilling dogs outside man they looked and smelled so good gonna have to try one of them next time
Upside-Incredibly FRESH delicious and UNIQUE food and cuisines-Customer service is great they always seem like they are in a good mood and ready to help-Nice 'garden' selection flowers pumpkins etc
we had chicken nachos the BBQ sauce they used on the nachos was really tasty
I had the Poke Stack which was fresh and the wasabi/soy sauce had the perfect amount of kick my wife had a summer salad with grilled chicken that she said was excellent
This gelato is MUCH healthier than dairy queen or coldstone creamery's desserts
I still shop at the supermarkets for household goods junk food and other staples
The pizza is delicious and the wait is ridiculously long
But we go every chance we get and the food is just as amazing as it was at their Queen Creek location
The pizza which is NY style thin crust cooked in a coal fired oven is just the right thickness with some chewiness and good bite
I would definitely recommend the white pie which is much harder to find well done out here in AZ outside of Bianco of course or at least that is what I heard I just am not willing to invest several hours of waiting just to get a pizza
the presentation was ethnic as you expect the service and food were excellent
The chicken was cooked very well and the sauce was rich smooth and had a nice depth of flavor
I feel the pizza deserves its own side-note Despite the fact that the owners are from New York and despite how incredibly delicious the pies are here I would not call this true New York style pizza
A fine establishment with good atmosphere friendly and expedient service and most importantly some really delectable food
The tuna appetizer has been pushed on me more than once and I have always been very disappointed in the quality of the fish
The food should not need trademarked names a celebrity endorsement or other affirmations of healthiness if it really does the good things they say
Mostly it's just a great location good atmosphere and decent food that you can feel good about consuming
My dish came out good a ton of steak some veggies the Genghis sauce and a little of some other one and egg or two and some fried rice
The Sushi was definitely up to par and tasting delicious plus the prices are excellent
By the time the waitress came to serve our food it was cold although we commented on how when the fajitas had first arrived they were not making a sizzling sound
I ordered the Noki a dog with green chiles pintos cheese and an all beef Schreiner's hot dog
They are friendly helpful serve high quality food and go above and beyond what the customer wants or needs
I still gave this place 4 stars because of good food and good service
The food is spicy but not so hot that you have to drink gallons of libations just to put the fire out
Can't complain about the quality of the food it was spot on and cooked to perfection
All were very enjoyable - they were tasty had good texture and were more interesting than the standard sushi restaurant fare
I prefer New York pizza and grew up back East so I've experienced a lot of good New York style pizza
I think that always makes me angry that the place is called Streets of New York and the pizza isn't even nearly as good as some slices I'd buy at some random place in the food court of the mall back upstate
My husband and I went to check this new seafood buffet out and weren't too impressed
The sushi bar was good but not too many options there either
Overall the food was good but I don't think it was worth the money of $16 a person
or you could just go across the street to Whole Foods pick up a pretty good bottle of wine some awesome cheese and crusty bread and call it good
If you are going for the first time be sure to pile your food high and pack it in the bowl and to use alot of sauce the will let you take a 2nd bowl just for sauce if you ask and I recommend doing that
I would come here again because this is one of the few quality tasting sushi places I have found so far in Arizona
Otherwise the food is actually very fairly priced - eSPECially considering how AMAZING the atmosphere and ambiance are
50 splitting a mouth-watering pizza $11 and splitting some melt-in-your mouth donuts with chocolate drizzle $5 i felt pretty good
I can't wait to go back to try my favorites butter chicken and tikka masala although everything they had looked so so good
Walked by since my hotel was nearby and it looked cute but since I had just had lunch the first time I decided to come back after dinner for dessert
The chicken was nicely cooked and flavored
The place itself is wonderfully stylized and the staff are perky but new but the food was disappointing
After we were done the waiter who was excellent brought out a small dessert for me with congratulations written in chocolate which made it even better and it was excellent
I've been here a few times and the food has always been good and their bakery goods
The food was good and the environment was comfortable
It seemed initially we were on a path of places that aren't really known for good wines however interestingly enough the wines were fine and it was one of the best pairings I've ever seen in which the interaction of the wine and the food was drastically well done and clearly apparent
all kinds of good clean hippie fun So all in all The Farm has absolutely delectable fresh invigorating food that isn't all that pricey and even though you may have to wait a lil while for a table at peak brunch times it usually turns into a lovely stroll through the gardens and fun shops fairly painless in my point of view
I can't wait to go back and try the food and more of the delicious drinks from Chris
Maybe it was because they couldn't find any good food
Prices were pretty good too especially for the asian-ish dishes
So family brought home some food from Huauchinango a week ago or so and let me tell you it was good
I also picked up some great quality ingredients for my next homemade pizza while I was there--San Marzano tomatoes imported pepperoni from Chicago and some cherry peppers
OK so when I FINALLY got my food the eggs were cold the hash-browns were burnt on one side of course they hid the burnt side on the bottom and when I said I ordered grits they said they ran out and replaced them hash-browns
Most of the meats were a gray color the hot and sour soup was mustard yellow somehow
We narrowed our orders down to the appetizer size of Korean Beef Taco and a Hawaiian Poke Stack to start
The taco was a small flour tortilla topped with marinated grilled beef Asian slaw and a spicy DELICIOUS sauce
We were really impressed with the quality of the sushi grade Ahi
If I'm in a pizza mood a simple Oreganos thin crust pepperoni is delicious and always hits the spot
Finally for dessert the Pizza Cookie or Pizookie or whatever you call it is amazing
I am not a dessert person by any means but this thing is sooooo good
As for the sushi we all loved tuna tartar appetizer
The good to great rolls included the big daddy spicy tuna and banzai which included jalepeno
I felt that the tootsie roll was too heavy with eel sauce but it was still enjoyed by all
Firstly I didn't know what to expect because the place looks fast foody but once you get your amazing food in front of you it's like the rays of heaven come down and shine on their tacos anything weird or whatever about the place disappears
They were made with beef instead of pork my favorito but the beef was good just not my cup of tea
From what I understand they don't serve any pork there which is just bummer but eh their chicken is pretty good
Besides being hard the meats didn't have much flavor
I also tried the Tostadas de Tinga the chipotle sauce and chicken combo was amazing
-For the ambiance & location I expected dinner prices to be a little lower BUT then again the food was very high quality
I got the Vegetable Thali which came with several different curried vegetable dishes rice naan amazing pickled onion and raita
The decor is fine actually the way I would prefer for a Chinese restaurant that has excellent food and service and the wait staff were quite fluent enough in English for me
I wish I could name everything we tried but I can't -- the butterfish tataki is every bit as good as you've heard as was the kobe beef and the 10 other things we tried
For dinner we all got pasta and every dish was good but not great
His p's had a pizza and it was really tasty although I only had a bite
I always order the chicken kabobs rice salad and hummus and it is amazing everytime
aloe vera juice and those sinfully delicious dessert rice and of course the makoks
They all come with the normal side dishes and are all delicious
The ironic part of Moto for me I absolutely LOVE sushi but I order other items on the menu here because they are so freakin' tasty
The chicken teriyaki bowl is so clean - excellent pieces of all-white meat no chewy surprises
The flavors are all amazing and everything --veggies and meat alike-- is stewed to perfection
Quicker grilled dishes include the giant scallops wrapped in bacon and tasty lamb chops
It's certainly not much to look at on the outside but as soon as you walk in you can smell how good the food is going to be
It was a far more subtle dish but no less wonderfully composed
My favorite items on the menu are 1 the pupusas kind of a soft gordita-like exterior with a meat and veggie thick stew-like interior - outrageously good
; 2 the yucca frita fried yucca plant very starchy like potatoes with some deep fried chunks of pork and garnished with radishes and cucumbers; 3 the ensalada drink a bright-yellow fruit beverage with finely chopped assorted fresh fruit- comes with a straw and a spoon; 4 the plantain with beans and sour cream a dish I wasn't sure about at first because I am very picky about my banana-type foods but it totally and unexpectedly works and is ridiculously delicious
I thought Wagyu beef was supposed to be tender juicy and have a good natural flavor
The mushrooms in the tamale were on the chewy side but all in all the dish was excellent
I forgot what wine we had but it was spectacular and so was the cheese and fruit appetizer salad grilled fish with a sauce that was phenomenal  roasted artichokes and interesting dessert that was almost pudding like but lightly and deliciously vanilla-ly
The peanut butter chocolate pie that we shared was just alright but many of the other desserts looked tasty
They do have good BBQ ribs chicken and some seafood
Round up the family for a rootin' tootin' good time and some GREAT food
Dino and Jenn are the owners Jenn came over introduced herself to me she already new my brother and wanted to make sure that everything was fine with the food which was excellent
The sauce they use has so much flavor it makes me want to buy it but then I know I'm too lazy to go home and make a mediocre pizza and waste their awesome sauce on it so I just come in here and eat it
Prices are a little high $3 for 3 pieces of bacon but all in all I thought the food was tasted very good and was filling
The beef was a good quality juicy and served on a generic but fresh bun
I will tell you that I HATE their sister Cheesecake Factory their food has no flavor worst Sheppards Pie ever
I had been to Fez for drinks which are good but had never been there for food before last night
Then within two minutes of finally getting our salad he brought our hot food Knishnosh and the Philadelphia
The slices of pizza here are huge and at a good price
The Pho Tai was the perfect choice for a healthy light and flavor-full lunch and for less than seven bucks it certainly beats the usual fast food suspects
A buddy from work recommended this place and I was skeptical only because I am a snob when it comes to Chinese food
Their Flamingo Special Chicken is out of control good
The pizza here has an extremely flavorful thin crust and the pies are made by a real pizzailo chef straight from Italy
The pizza is generally perfectly charred with a nice depth of flavors
This pizza is very similar to the pizza you might get in any good restaurant in Italy
Sitting outside among the beautiful mature trees and the cool lights at night makes for a wonderful evening out and few restaurants in Phoenix can match the consistently great food and ambiance
We heard about Elements that had incredible  views and amazing food with an top master chef
For dinner I ended up with the spaghetti with meat sauce dinner salad with Balsamic vinigrette dressing and it was tasty
I always get the griefo which is a veggie sandwhich and NO I am not a vegetarian the only complaint i have about beef is when it doesnt come out rare enough to moo at me thats just HOW good this place is
Although the pool is just beautiful when no one is in it  I've come for sushi yoga happy hour drinks and appetizers and after hours and every time I have felt it was a 5 star experience
If good food makes you happy this is your happy place
Like others have said the food isn't over-the-top amazing but its solid Mexican and its solid consistent
The meat was done perfectly and was very flavorful and not at all bland
Good food fair prices but could stand to maybe be in a space half its size
Shredded Beef TacoAlthough we all enjoyed them their are better tacos in the valley
I wasn't even a huge fan of the beef green chili on top and it was still amazing
We were forewarned this place had no prices on their online menu and appeared to be owned by Mastro's which consistently has excellent food
Excellent steak spot and a welcome high-end addition to the Scottsdale food scene
Very good menu top to bottom - creative rolls plenty of cooked food too4
Ken the head chef is the man - great guy and one amazing sushi chefAnd here's the long versionI've been to Yellowtail several times now in the last month
I'm amazed at how good and fresh the sushi is here
Ken one of the owners does not compromise on quality of the sushi
Because of his great focus on quality the food might not always come out immediately but it comes out plenty fast enough and it always melts in your mouth
He also does an extremely good job at making spicy sushi - his spicy tuna is actually spicy not too spicy just right
Again Ken just does not compromise with quality - the rolls are presented nicely on the plate and extremely good
the sushi fish was fresh and the rolls were a good size
Overall we had a good trip our food was good the service was pleasant and overall it was a good value
The food came nuclear hot so it did take some time for it to cool down enough to eat
I am not the food authority at the office if some one is going out they now ask me where to go thanks to my recommendation of this place for lunch
The food is always fresh and delicious my favorite sanwich is the Thai stick and an egg salad one that i forgot the name of
Good cheap Mexican food but like a previous comment it gets harder and harder to keep going back
The way they process orders is annoying but that's not a deal-breaker if the food is worth it
Overall the food is just okay - good enough to stop by if it's on the way to somewhere else - not good enough to make a trip specifically to dine there
I said I felt I had waited long enough while all the groups around me ordered and enjoyed their food
If you're in the mood for dessert there's a coldstone smoothie place & starbux within walking distance
i mean it was REALLY good pizza but i'm just not a pizza lover
Green proves that vegetarian and more importantly VEGAN food can be interesting and delicious
I have tried most everything on the menu and my personal favorites arespicy buffalo wingsjerk tofu saladmexicali burgerthai peanut bowl with crispy tofuoriginal g spicy po-boy sammyOne more thingThey always have delicious daily specials and homemade desserts
The food is always tasty and the margaritas flow without end
Now I am pleased to say that I am able to easily munch on tasty food sans meat/cheese
The noodle dish was good--very fresh tasting and was made even better with the addition of some Siracha sauce
The spring rolls and dipping sauce were delicious as served
I ordered an oatmeal stout Samuel Smith to have with my Southwest chicken sandwich and both were equally good
The stout went down nice and smooth and the chicken sandwich was very tasty and spicy having been served with a chipotle mayo condiment
The food was pricey- our lunch ended up being almost $40 for the 2 of us- but it was good
Per the recommendation from the server I had the fish tacos
Then the owner decides that because the food is brought out that makes it excellent service
I'd add that the menu has a good number of items on it and never did I suggest that they should be able to make or sere every single type of Cambodian dish
a hole in the wall restaurant with good food and service would get 5 stars to me but a pricey steakhouse with amazing ambiance but ok food and good service would get 4
First I'm very impressed with their pizzas
They have high quality meats though I don't like that they decide to use crumbled beef instead of sausage
If you go larger than a Medium pizza the pizza can get a touch soggy but a good reheating method makes it better
With Zoe's I feel I'm eating healthy and tasty food when eating out
Epic failure number five was the sub-par meals that followed along with the flaming drink that is not worth ordering The food was by far the worst thing of the night which compared to everything else would seem like nothing
Typically Latin restaurants disappoint where dessert is involved but The Mission is an exception - the pumpkin bread pudding with scotch caramel pomegranate and a scoop of vanilla ice cream was WOW-worthy
On my first visit we were not messing around and ordered the delicious Dogfish Head 120 minute IPA
The fundido was good and I'd like to try it with sausage/exotic meat
The food here I've eaten here 3 times is decent but not as good or flavorful or as fresh as La Canasta
So If you are ordering for yourself or a couple of people not really saving any money and you are getting lesser quality food
Now Manuela also recommended  the Queso Suizo which is a pure cheese dish the tortilla soup which i am definitely trying on my next visit the Pechuga Suiza con Alambre de Res and the Pechuga Suiza which is chicken breast
Anyway it wa pretty good the seafood wa not overdone which I always appreciate
Prices were the going rate so we walked out after an appetizer and our Seafood Medley for about $16 bucks
The rolls are average but their sashimi is excellent
The bill wasn't exactly cheap but it isn't every day that you get that fresh of fish in Phoenix that meets that quality
It's a good price for a good portion of Filipino food in downtown Phoenix
I was looking forward to the grilled chicken mentioned by several Yelp reviewers but it wasn't on the menu so I asked the owner Brian and he said that it gets too hot to grill on the side of the truck with the temperature hitting 100+ degrees in the summer
was friendly and on point i enjoyed the unique drinks Kiss & Tell was fun and orangey Gin Press was stiff and the flavors were well balanced and the food was good - just a bit pricey
I wasn't super hungry so i just got one roll and tried some seaweed salad but I'm looking forward to trying the kareh raisu hot dish next time
Overall the food was quite good and for cajun in phoenix it was great
What you MUST orderAppetizer Q- RollSide Mac n CheeseMain Dish AnythingAlcoholic Beverage Shipwrecked
full of meaty cheesy saucy goodness* Meatballs = not a fan
Soups are very good bread items are ok hot foods are not very good in selection and just blah at best
Spitfire is fresh and exactly what this neighborhood needs; simply prepared delicious food in a relaxed environment that isn't a clone chain
Some other dishes that got good reviews from my group were the grilled veg sandwich pizza salmon and albacore tuna panini
Our food came out quickly and all was good
I went with high hopes on a Smunch day having never been and expecting some pretty damn good food
I highly doubt that I was just grumpy that day because I'm never grumpy on Smunch day but the prices seemed a little extreme for the amount and quality of food
I'm not one to go out of my way to write a bad review unless the place really deserves it and sadly this steakhouse certainly does due to the quality of food price and service
The style was perfect the prices were not exorbitant the food was delicious the service was tremendous
The food was good and the service was nice too but somethings were a little offmy burrito was sort of flat not rounded and the sour cream which I thought they forgot to serve along with the salsa was actually already in the burrito
How hard is it to make a chicken sandwich taste good
thought it was going to be a cold sandwich but the cheese was melted on top of the meat
- I don't like mussels so I sent mine back and got gnocchi instead which was goodSalmon with potato - okSteak with carrots - meat was not tender3 cheese plate - goat cheese humbolt fog and ripe camembert   - This was the best thing we had
Service was fantastic friendly & welcoming & all the food was very good
My husband & I had a lemongrass chicken dish on rice - wonderful
The meat was delicious the gluten free bread wasn't hard or gross like some--it was slightly sweet and quite tasty
it will probably be amazing  Sushi is  just presented in a beautiful way
If you love corporate sushi i don't recommend this place
It didn't effect the quality of service or food
I've had everything and its all delicious o frills food; they make it like it's described
Despite that I still give this place all my stars because it has delicious food; I have never had a bad experience especially because of the awesome servers
We had NEVER tried Indian food before but we were both impressed
I was in love with the chicken tikka masala it had such a different but very delicious taste to it
My fiance got the chicken curry and thought that was pretty good also although we both agreed my entree was the best
The products sold are of consistent exceptional quality and there are many things that I buy here that other grocers cannot replicate frozen mango chunks blueberry muesli pulled BBQ chicken perfectly prepared frozen meals
Whether it's fresh sliced pineapple and French vanilla ice cream or Swedish meatballs with homemade dipping sauce or any other amazing product you can always look forward to chatting with the designated sample-giver
can you tell it was not a good experienceWell the food finally came out  and as a rating on the food I would say it was average
Not only that but the food was goodIt was suggested that we try the Burrata with Walnut Pesto and Oven Dried Tomato and we are glad we did
It is hard to find good creole and/or cajun food here and while this may not be considered authentic it is good
The carne asada was seasoned well the chicken needed a little more flavor and was a wee bit dry
Quality of the food was still very good but I wouldn't advise you to go to this restaurant on any holiday especially if it's your first time --- it may not meet your expectations
Foods I Recommend Pork Lo Mein Emperor's Chicken Shrimp Lo Mein Sweet and Sour Pork Kung Pao Chicken Mongolian Beef Sesame Chicken and Chow Mein
Considering the price atmosphere and quality of Havana Cafe's food I will never return
I recommend this dish with no reservations
Are there really words in the English language to describe how wonderful this food is
The whiting they ran out of catfish was all kinds of bland except for a really strong fishy flavor whiting is the least supposed to taste like fish especially for cajun fried or was that what the bucket of hot sauce was supposed to represent
The jerk chicken tacos tasted nothing of jerk the only noticable flavor was from the sweet thai chili sauce added on the side
The red chicken is ridick and the tri tip was amazing as well
The food does take a little bit but its more then worth it
Such as Turkey meat loaf which I have to admit didn't sound good to me but I reluctantly tried it and it was good
The bathrooms are just as fun and borderline creepy as all the other Food = AMAZING
In my case it's the delicious complex flavors that only grilled beef can provide
My dinner partner had the beef drunken noodles - loads of food and very tasty
Turns out it is lots of veggies and LOTS maybe too much cheese rolled in a tasty beer bread wrap
The food was good the service was ok the ambiance was again just ok
The beef in the beef salad tasted like beef jerky but the seasoning was good
I've always had a great time at Lucky Strike - the food is good the service is fantastic and the place is really cool and different
3 juicy NOT greasy pieces of chicken greens mac n cheese and some good-ass corn bread
It's a great alternative to the mall food court and good if you don't have time for a full fledged restaurant
The food was absolutely perfect good size portions the flavors were excellent and at a good value
My chicken was really good but the sides that came with it were not good
If you're wary of spice the kitchen can whip up mild iterations of dishes - if you're adept at eating the spicy goodness that has been bestowed upon us the chef is proficient at adding those flavors to the food too
In addition to the mustard leaf wrap appetizer the Pad Se Ew and the yellow curry chicken are also phenomenal
The Bama roll was delicious so as soon as I got it and sunk my teeth in I forgot about the annoyance of being served last
The service has always been great and the food is very good
My only complaint is the price but I have to tell you the food is definitely worth it
Good food decent prices open and inviting atmosphere
It's been said that pizza is like sex when it's good it's really good and when its bad it's still pretty good
I got so much more food choices and much better quality food at The Pizza Buffet and Much Much More at half the price
But because of the quality of the food and the outrageous price this will be my one and only visit to this place
But all I could hear from the tables around me was how tasty the food was
The food is good and well made and the setting just can't be beat
True Food Kitchen did not live up to the hype I was expecting after ready so many good Yelp reviews
I am hesitant but will consider going back for another try in hope the service and quality of food is better
I do recommend it for people who love to experiment and go outside your average dishes
I have never written a review but the food at Havana Cafe was so underwhelming and not in the least bit good that I feel compelled to share
The food continues to be delicious here and the atmosphere continues to shine but they just can't seem to make up their mind when it comes to timing out the food delivery
I'm only taking one star off because the food is extremely delicious
Never had the food parking is good as are attitude atmosphere and service
The tacos were tasty especially the fish tacos
Overall food was good for its price and the presentation was not too shabby
Overall tasty food at decent prices nice ambiance and really nice fish tacos
Overall good food and totally reasonably priced but i would've loved to have a beer with my dinner
For Lo-Lo's though I had to make an exception; their soul food is too damn delicious for only one serving
First their chicken is very very good
odd While I am begrudged to give a good review for New York pizza Pat's just made themselves a new customer
Lulu's chicken enchiladas are graced by an amazingly delicious marinade and sauce unparalleled by other local eateries
The fried chicken is yummy although I don't really care for their veggie sides cause they're over cooked and all the goodness seems to be gone
The fish was good the portion was ridiculously small and the accoutrement were completely forgettable
The food was very well prepared and very tasty
The sushi was excellently prepared as well
There were four of us for dinner so we sampled all the salads and appetizers which were all wonderful and then had the wiseguy pizza which had homemade fennel sausage as one of the ingredients
The meat had a food flavor and the tortillas were nice and crunchy
Scott had the baseball cut steak essentially a huge lump of beef -- very very tasty and opted for the Wild West Mix Grill - elk pike and wild boar & venison sausage
But tons of other bars have that too AND good food to boot
The food was really good but the environment was the best part
It's delicious food and a really fun place for our kids can't ask for much more
On top of all this terrible service the food was not even good
There is the tendancy to go with large portions rather than quality food
The staff was nice food was good prices reasonable establishment was clean
This is a great place to eat except they are hit and miss with food quality and level of service
I can't say I've ever had British food before but if pasties are a good representation of British food I'm a huge fan
I had a bite and it was definitely was really well seasoned beef was tender and the flavor combination was great
Thank goodness I planned ahead for dessert
My husband is Italian & has grown up with an Italian mom making homemade pizza his whole life he was very impressed
Most of the time I shop I get trapped into buying yucky snack foods but here I can divulge in delicious low cal treats and pre-made meals
Food-The food is delicious and they have the perfect portions for me
We ordered Fontina Burger - 4*BBQ Chicken Pizza - 4*Grilled Veggie Pizza - 3*Sweet Potato Fries - 2*Garlic Fries - 4*Onion Rings - 5*Chocolate Milk Shake - 2*The good- great selection of American food / good portion sizes- allow upgrades to different kinds of fries to your meal- the decor & cute history behind the farm- open kitchen / sauce bar- friendly staff - outdoor picnic benches under a huge tree where the kiddies can enjoy themselves- hand washing fountain conveniently located by the soda fountain- kiddies love the cool restrooms The bad  - lots of flies outside that's summer in a farm for you- limited seating inside- real vanilla milkshake tasted weird  too much lemon juice
The only thing I was raving about after this meal was the dessert The hot chocolate cake
The pasta dishes are also fresh hot and seem quality
There are several foods that are worthwhile but I have had some that are average
The burgers are very good and their pizzas are worthwhile
Green is good for quick vegan on the go and I think that most of the food is good at Green
It has a good amount of heat but that can be countered by ordering it with grilled shredded chicken
The Bollo Pasta is excellent with chicken or meatballs the Ziti is good although the bread bowl is gross and kitschy the alfredo the dark is also nice and lighter than most of the other pastas
I would also recommend the big ol' ravioli if you are in to ricotta but make sure to order it with the sausage or meatballs
Food wise this buffet is above average and definitely worth a visit
Everyone was very friendly and the food was delicious
The french dijon potato salad was a wonderful side dish
I went with friends and we shared an appetizer salad special and a meter of pizza
The food arrived and I must say I was impressed
The crust on the pizza was slightly sweet baked perfectly and the toppings added nice flavor to the crust without overwhelming it
The pizza arrived hot and the box it came in was actually pretty fancy for a pizza box
Thank goodness Lo-Lo's knows how to make their namesake dishes and make them well
The fish tacos were good but a little salty for my taste
The only saving grace in the meal for me was that the dark and milk chocolate creme brulee dessert was so rich wonderful I almost felt I could overlook the countless other ways this place fell short
The meat was cooked a little more than I usually like I'm a run it through a warm room guy for most meats but the flavor was still good
I think they are really trying and the food quality alone warrants a visit
The food quality and flavor are the same for the most part but you do leave wanting more
Somehow the place just doesn't fit but the food is good and inexpensive
The menu choices are varied mostly mediterranean Italian and creative and the quality of the fresh organic ingredients with such flavor that your eyes may roll back into your head
Taggia's food selection includes something for everyone in our party; steak delicious pizzas seafood pasta dishes and so much more
We have gone here to celebrate special occassions or just to get away to a contemporary but welcome relaxed environment with excellent service and great food and drinks
The good is that most of the food is pretty good
From our triple onion tarte appetizer to the filet mignon and lamb shank to the chocolate pecan tarte for dessert
It is a little pricey $88 before groupon discount for 1 appetizer 2 entrees and 1 dessert and coffee but totally worth it
Ambiance is great loved the patio seating so ask for courtyard if weather is good service was excellent and the flavors and food were perfect
The chicken is always hot and it's so tasty
The chicken is very flavorful and you always see it cooking on the back grill
For some reason I have let the place on Adams in downtown with national reviews as my local benchmark for pizza and I keep finding places just as good if not better and Humble pie makes my list
Big pieces of bread cheese ehh lotsa of olives I think the meats just werent that tasty
Donuts for dessert are a must powdered sugar and some sugary goodness syrup
But the food was just that good so I'd rather round up than down
We ordered the chicken wings appetizer - a little different in that they were a bit smoky but the quality of meat was pretty darn good
That is not a comparison of quality; both places serve equally mind-blowing handcrafted food I just happen to prefer it in sandwich form
I always used to come for lunch and was never disappointed so thought it would be a good place to meet a friend for drinks and a little food after work
I like nori and  'maki' rolls are more filling than nigiri style sushi; however the salmon in my 'sake maki' was also lacking in flavor
I attribute the flavorlessness in my sushi to the quality of the fish being used by Hana; in all the sushi I ate at Hana the fish was 'lean'
As with good steak sushi's flavor and tender texture are dependent on how much 'fat' is in the flesh
the higher the fat content in the fish the higher the grade levelflavor content of the fish
Added edit   Hana does offer sushi from 'wild' sakesalmon at the higher price of $10; that price is more than a little expensive and as I didn't try it I don't know if it has more fat/flavor than the 'regular' sake they serve
By the way fish fat as opposed to red meat fat is good for you due to the omega 3 content in fish fat
The food arrives and the portion is really big and smells delicious
The broth was really good and the meat just fell apart
Again I am not a connoisseur of Vietnamese food but this was damn tasty and filling
If you are going to open a restaurant where you serve sandwiches don't you think it would be a good investment to buy a meat slicer and the meat
Speaking of dessert we've tried quite a few and their daily flavor of cru00e8me bru00fblu00e9e is our must have selection
The food and service are consistent in quality and everything tastes wonderful
I've been looking for good Thai food ever since traveling through Thailand last year
I'll probably still stick with Tokyo Lobby but this is a good place for non-sushi lovers aka people who only eat the cooked stuff
I've had Indian food that was light but still tasty
The flavor of the fish came through but I think the beurre rouge wasreally what accounted for that flavor -- while a cinnamon froth added just a slight kiss of sweetness
Our pizza was delivered to our table still bubbling and with a warning from Alberto Now you two take it easy this pizza is Super HOT and I can tell you from experience because I no longer have the roof of my mouth Enjoy
Dinner Appetizer Pizza and Root Beer for two under 20 bucks
The meat is supposed to be this amazing specially raised beef - that's all good but could you maybe add some flavor/spice to it
From what I understand their pricing on rolling tobacco and pipe tobacco is pretty good
The radish cakes were chock full of goodies but served off a plain non heated cart which just about cancels out the yum factor for me
We did grab a couple of food shots though - check those out
Thai chicken Was actually quite good for a mild chicken I expect Thai to be spicy this was not
Not to dwell on the decor but the food simply wasn't that good for me
The menudo is rich red and peppery and is chock-full of fatty meaty goodness yeah yeah yeah we all know it's offal but it's freaking GOOD
Good thing their prices are so great otherwise I'd end up in the poor house because every time they post the nights specials with a picture of whichever Delicious dish they are featuring I am sold
I have had their seafood gumbo chunky spicy goodness jambalaya fried catfish fried shrimp
The next time I come here I'm definitely getting another meatball maybe try one of the other hot sandwiches and one of the salads
Plated like a photo shoot and tastier still this dish showed that the kitchen has a gentle side as well
they're very friendly inside and recommended i try the corned beef sandwich with melted swiss and mustard
I tried a filet mignon/mushroom/mashed potatoes dish that was very good
To have a place make really good pizza AND good wings is a rare find
My coworker ordered the appetizers Golden Rolls and Heaven Rice Rolls
The Heaven Rice Rolls however was very good I didn't expect to like it but I really really did
My husband had the Orange Peel Chicken which was incredibly good
While I loooooove Greek food I have to say the few times I've been to this Pita Jungle recently I wasn't impressed
A few weeks ago I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala usually a full-bodied flavorful meal and it was downright bland
While I know that Pita Jungle has a great reputation and while I will say I have had good food there in the past
I can't handle much spice but my dish was just hot enough where I rather enjoyed it
The fruit on the Caribbean salad and the fruit and cheese plate are amazing and the chicken combo plate is so large it's two meals
The kung pao chicken was very wierd and not even close to expectation-more like bland spagetti sauce over noodles with peanuts and chicken w/chili oil for that LOL oriental flavor-dish needs to be totally reformulated-chef/owner please google kung pao chicken recipes
I got 2 carne asada and one chicken and although both were good the carne asada takes the cake
My boyfriend got the carne asada burrito and he said the meat was kind of dry but the meat in my tacos tasted really good so that may just be a matter of personal preference
The pollo diablo had a nice spicy flavor and the jade red chicken was also very good
A different server brought the food to us realized we weren't ready and rushed it back in the kitchen where it sat and got cold
I especially like their crust you can tell they have good pizza ovens
Overall the pizza service and ambiance are good though it's overpriced in my mind
The flavor was actually pretty good for bar food
Prices are decent; location is great; food quality is good with a nice twist; ambience is chic and trendy; completemary valet parking is a plus but don't forget the tips
The stuffed veggie pizza was good two
Bottom line great pizza with out the crazy waits or prices at other good pizza places in AZ
Everyone trying and sharing each others food as it was all memorably delicious
Service was good food was overpriced and overrated
We had there cheapest red wine and split an appetizer salad and pasta dish then each had a main course fish and lamb no desert
Interior decoration is good food is OK staff are nice and table is clean
All of that can wait in the name of delicious Swedish meat
My roomie is vegetarian so she got a boring dishthe house salad and I got the bistro boulliaise I cant spell and it was DELICIOUS
but any time we go we end up always ordering a delicious pizza
As a group we decided to split appetizers A chef's platter with Southwest Chicken Eggrolls barbecue buffalo wings and potstickers and 2 baskets of garlic fries
The Southwestern eggrolls were bland so I dipped them in ranch and the garlic fries were very greasy--the garlic was minced and spread over the fries so there wasn't much flavor and since it was raw minced somewhat intense
Marzen bacon burger - I had a bite of my friend's burger and it was pretty good nicely charred meat crisp bacon
Some of the food is pretty good although a lot of the stuff if just okay
Although the food is still very good I love the grilled artichokes French dip sandwich and baby back ribs the service has gone downhill
There were only a handful of other people there so our food came out within a few minutes and it was all very good
I will say the food for that was great service was top notch and the coffee cake was so unbelievably good
All the ingredients taste so fresh and the bread is equally delicious I have to admit I am picky about bread coming from San Francisco sourdough land I have to admit that all the food and wine fill me up so I have never tried their desserts but I am sure they are amazing as well
I normally don't like Italian food at restaurants but this was excellent
The amazing part is that the beef and the chicken had a grain to it just like the real stuff
-she remembered every person by first name and even caught on when I was trying to slip my charges under Brian's name and excellent food
5 high quality other beef was really good and the pretzel style bun was a nice touch
I drove about 9 miles across Gilbert that is quite a chore because I wanted to serve good roast beef sandwiches for dinner and I needed good bread
Their chicken is the bomb & smells delicious as you pull up to the drive thru window
Our fav side has to be the mac & cheese weird I know considering this is a mexican food joint but man that stuff is good
So as already stated the food is very good
Seriously you have good food; please back it up with some basic customer service and humility
I like the meat and seafood options and especially the smell of grilled food but the flavor could use a lot more spice
But I was very impressed by the assortment of interesting pizza toppings
I wanted to try it since its popular and I may go back to try a regular hot dog or a chili dog just since it advertises good meat and Ive never had any other hot dog except store ones and of course at the fair
The salsa bar is a tastebud orgy of sheer delight and a playground for foodies who love complexity of flavor
I go to bars for good drinks and good food
The pizzas are good and so are their specials
For example I have thoroughly enjoyed my jerk chicken both times that I have dined here
The quality and value of the food must equal the surroundings in its ability to satisfy customers
And dagnabbit sometimes you just NEED to have a triple order of fresh hash browns in the middle of the nightMay be a little bit too brightly lit for my tastes especially in the wee smalls but the food is consistent and the service alway polite and attentive without being pushyOh btw always make sure you tip a little extra to the good peeps working the overnight shift   ;
First of all I had kids that didn't want the normal hot dog and chicken fingers kid's meal so I had to pay $3 for a meal share for each of them really
I remember the food being good but not outstanding
Kabuki's happy hour is from 3-6pm and offers a wide range of appetizers salads sushi and rolls to satisfy most people
That being said the place is really a unique jack-of-all-trades because it has something to offer everyone also the food is good or something
Brought the grandparents here in hopes of impressing them with some quality Thai food
Overall the food was above average in its category particularly the sauces and I enjoyed the setting but the lesson's been learned
The drinks are good and their desserts are tasty and well priced
The starter was pretty good but the pizza and mushrooms were excellent
It was awesome that they were open for one and the food and service were very good
I would not recommend Chinese food from here
My husband and I had heard wonderful things about Oregano's throughout the years we've lived in Phoenix 22 years and decided we had to finally try Oregano's Pizza
The deep dish was fair could have used more cheese but did have a good buttery flavor in the crust
If you're craving a good pizza try Grimaldi's
A good portion of chicken breast tenders peppers tomatoes and the onions
The bar was filthy dirty and she did not clean up after customers and we waited a long time only to get cold food
Fried calamari is a bit bland but worth the volume bigOff the happy hr menu my fav is the scallop dynamite roll
the desert roll bananas fried and topped with fruits w/ a hint of white chocolate chip was surprisingly good
The food here was authentic and flavorful
The food was spicy but not so much as to loose touch with the flavor of it all
The design decor + ambiance will feel somewhat familiar as will the quality of drinks at the bar aside from much smaller martinis - but the food at Hanny's is a strange departure from the top-notch bar food found at it's sister restaurant in Scottsdale
All our rolls looked good but sadly not tasting all that great
The dim sum was plentiful and there was a lot of variety - however unless you watch for the carts that just came out of the kitchen and only order off that one there's a good chance you'll get lukewarm or cold food
All 3 ribs tasted good baby back st-louis beef
The rice and beans were a lousy side dish though and had little if any flavor
I ordered the half sandwich and chicken and corn chowder it was so good but I couldn't finish it because it was so filling but not in a heavy greasy way - just very satisfied with a delicious meal
I recommend the Tempura the Boat and any of the sushi combos
The beef was tender full of flavor and plentiful and they have several salsas to accompany your free freshly fried corn chips
He did eat the other half of my Paddy Melt which tells you how not good his fish was
When my buddy Hotdish wrote a glowing review of Sonora Mesquite and their carne asada I knew that I needed to try it out myself
So I got the restraining order quashed and headed out to Sonora Mesquite for some of the best food I've had and I've had some good stuff believe you me
We've been here with friends a few times and most recently on our own and each time I really wanted the food to be good enough to repeat but it's just not
The food is very very good and it is so cool to have business owners so proud of their product and at Sonora Mesquite Grill- they have much to proud of
The food was good and the beer selection was pretty decent as well
The sushi was very good and the service was very nice and accommodating
The food took quite a while but was well worth it
Or at least make sure your food is so good they want to deal with attitude
I also tried the Tootsie Roll which tasted like an orange Tootsie Roll pop and The Perfect Pear which tasted more sour than pear-like-our table wouldn't recommend that one
It was a really delicious dish-I just wish there was more of it
To me pizza is either edible or it's so good I have to go back for more
The chicken was a bit too charred but still good nonetheless
We went on a Saturday night around 7 pm and it was not that busy at all beautiful decor and a very romantic setting For those who were complaining about the lighting they might want to get their eyes checked it was fine The menu offered a number of tasty meals I had a flat iron steak and my boyfriend has the roasted chicken with gnocchi it was amazing  We sampled some different wines and had a great waiter Frankie he was very good never let our glasses go empty and had lots of recommendations for us we can't wait to return again
I was not a fan of the pita bread it was very good bread I just would prefer my dog on a roll
The fish batter was light and crispy not too greasy and the fish was tender and flavorful inside
I did get a large bone in one of the pieces of fish I ate though    The fries were nice and crispy and the coleslaw very flavorful
I ordered the meatloaf not really sure why but it was pretty good but a little heavy on the onions
We'll probably go back at some point considering we find ourselves at Mesa Riverview and Tempe Marketplace rather often but next time I am saving room for the mini bucket shot desserts
First the positives the food was pretty good
The chicken was excellent I recommend smothered in gravy even though that makes the chicken a bit messy and harder to eat
The food is pretty good too- try the focaccia sandwich
We started off with the caprese salad which the homemade mozzarella was DivineMy husband enjoyed the hot Italian sandwich and I was very pleased with the roasted chicken sandwich
I mean heart palpitating good when you consider how delish bar food REALLY CAN be at 2 am
The tomatillo sauce that topped the entire dish was one of the best I've ever had - a little bit of tang but oh so flavorful
But I'm here to get some free drinks and possibly some high quality sushi
She says she swears by the place and you really get a good amount of tasty food for your money
When I went here given that I like spicy things I was immediately drawn to the food additive section the hot sauce that is so hot that for liability reasons they can't call it hot sauce jars that contain substances with higher Scoville ratings than some pepper sprays and carry 5-point legal disclaimers
Sapna seems like it should be excellent cheap healthy food in a unique triangle-shaped setting
We said the food and I'm glad we did because it was excellent Mexican food
The food was good way overpriced the dog thing was a huge turnoff we won't be back
So besides the whiney man and semi-attentive server the food is absolutely delicious and the atmosphere is great
I would definitely recommend The Parlor to anyone who likes awesome gourmet pizza
They have delicious drinks and appetizers I love the sweet potato fries and the crispy coconut shrimp rolls
Searched for a place with good happy hour deals and food and this one was in more than a couple Best lists
I thought the food was pretty delicious
so to summarize if you are looking for good food go elsewhere
Great place to sit at the bar and watch the roaring pizza oven on a cold Arizona winter night
They offer breakfast lunch & dessert crepes & they are Delicious
My usuals are either the Nutella Crepe-YUM or the savory Chicken Supreme-Soo Freaking Good
Dessert was good I just wish that they created ones that were a little more complex in taste like the rest of the menu
Our entrees natural half chicken sustainable salmon and spaghetti squash spaghetti were all very tasty and reasonably priced
We did not order dessert this visit but I would recommend the maple ice cream thing
I would definitely dine here again because the food is excellent reasonably priced friendly service and most importantly
They carry high-quality food treats and toys
There is also a food court with delicious entrees and on a hot summer day you should get some fresh agua frescas but everytime I am there I never see pina and that is my favorite fresca
The patty isn't cut down with beef or pork so the flavor is very game-y which can be a good thing if you are into that
I also tried a bit of my friend's Smart Chicken which was amazingly tender and juicy and perfectly seasoned
$5-$7 for a burger combo of higher quality than any fast food place
As for food the roast beef sandwich is very good as is most of the menu
They've got a manually operated prosciutto slicer that will capture the attention of any good foodie
Great place to eat a good pizza but there are some things that need to change
Both pizzas were good the crust was fresh and the ingredients were good also but it did not wow me in any way
The Stallion was the star pizza with some very good meat toppings
BUT you know when the FOOD is GOOD when you are asking the waiter for more bread to scoop up the remains of the sauce on the plate
The pizza is not even worth eating IMO
You'd never know there could be such good food in such an unassuming place
Lightly battered in corn meal the catfish was hot tender and tasty
Back to the restaurant at hand  the problem with Aiello's is not the food which is remarkably good for the price and it's not the service which is fine
WoW what a mistake I forgot how damn quick the service was & how GOOD the food was
The selection is good and the food comes out fast
You can specify how spicy you want most of the dishes and they are good about getting it just right
I started with a great bowl of meatball soup from there i had a lot of different Mexican dishes that were all ok  Rand thought they were not spicy enough but for me spicy wimp they were good
they also had oven roasted chicken that was quite good
If she did she would have learned that our food was cold and we didn't have silverware
What also came as a surprise was how much I enjoyed the side dishes
The meat had a gorgeous charcoal-grilled flavor and with the bacon and provolone add-ons I was extremely pleased with my selection
In closing truly good food is worth the wait and I felt that our food was definitely worth waiting for
Upon pulling into the hotel parking lot I drove along the front of the hotel and passed by a security guard that was patrolling the lot
Another outlandishly flavorful breakfast dish
Other than that expect tasty food and great service
Anyway the food is very good as usual
she thinks RA sushi is good and if you think RA is good well I just feel bad for you
Now for the sushi we decided not to get any appetizers just in case we didn't have enough room left
I feel like when it comes to sushi you buy too many sushi rolls and after you ate an appetizer it's kind of like
I would have to say I wasn't impressed but I definitely wouldn't say that this sushi is 'horrible' like some people are saying
For the summer roll it was pretty good I must say but the avocado wasn't too fresh
Lastly the fuji roll definitely the least favorite of the three not too much flavor but not bad either nor do I really have anything to say about it
I just think the rolls are a little over priced for what they offer and in some cases the flavor is either missing or just way too much
The service and food are consistenly good
Also  the young man who took our orders was really polite and helpful but the food was just not very good
I'm a big fan of the tavola calda hot food served buffet style with a focus on protein and sides model and ate at many such places in Italy but the hot table at La Piccola Cucina was not so hot
The food was delicious and filling and he owner / chef was friendly and nice to talk to
The only thing good about America's on 7th St is the food
Sprouts' food the spa's restaurant is pretty tasty as well
The food is unique and the ingredients seem to be very high quality the volcano beef cooked on a rock was very well marbled and delicious
The lemongrass dishes spicy wontons gyoza-all quite good
Impressive service high-quality sushi and a stellar happy hour make this a very coveted destination
The Rustica pizza was very good nice crispy crust I like the sauce and the toppings covered the complete pizza
For dessert we had a homemade brownie and cookie with ice cream--that was delicious as well
Overall good quality food at a reasonable price
We stopped in more out of geographic convenience and ended up surprised at the quality and tastiness of the food
If the Diavola pizza wasn't good I would have only left 1 star
if you like seared tuna the black orchid ahi tuna dish is super delicious and filling the portion is huge
I used to get the Cold Pasta Salad with Chicken and it was so delicious that I would devour the thing in 5 minutes
I could deal with higher prices if the food was the same quality
The Tostada Chicken Salad that I had was pretty delicious- the greens were fresh- often bars have limp and lame vegetables so I was pretty impressed with my meal
I have raved about how they have the best pizza I've ever had and was pretty sure that I'd never find another pizza that was as good
The food here is quite good as far as Chandler goes but you could get better and more at the same price elsewhere if you were willing to drive a little
Each dish is smaller tapa-sized but packs a lot of flavor
Hot sesame oil was poured on top sizzling to slightly sear the fish
Make sure you grab a butter tortilla for the ride home to hold you over while you smell all that delicious food
It was a medium sized bowl of pasta didn't taste fresh boiled dried with a good red sauce and a fair portion of good seafood
All in all we felt that the food was good
I enjoyed my food and time here but not the check
I know it's all about the pizza here but honestly I can barely remember it after finishing with that halfbaked wonderfulness
We ordered the stuffed deep dish Numero-One-O pizza and honestly although it was good it was just TOO MUCH CHEESE
But only 1 1/2 of the 6 people I went out with enjoyed their entree mostly pasta dishes that were too bland and sauceless
The short Really good pizza with a crispy-chewy crust and fresh solid ingredients--all out of a food truck
The long During downtown's First Friday Art Walk we often snag dinner at the food trucks usually opting for some delicious gourmet hot dogs
While the 12-minute wait might have seemed long for food truck food and while I'm no expert the pizza was great and well worth the wait
The pizza was still nice and hot but not so hot that we had to wait before digging in
I personally should've laid back a little on toppings and somehow a sprinkling of basil chiffonade made it onto the pizza but it was still good
I still really enjoyed it though and look forward to visiting the truck again--hopefully it will be a frequent vendor at First Fridays Food Truck Friday and Saturday at the Downtown Public Market
Anyhow I had the chicken roll ups they were good
The beef was tasty and I really enjoyed the BBQ sauce though I'm not sure if it's made in house or not
I like dessert and i like cookies and this was just delicious
we got the O'Riva Pizza - large to take home leftovers and it was good - not a traditional pizza at all and probably not the best pizza i've ever had but would i go back definitley would i order the same pizza you bet
Everytime I leave like I enjoyed the food but was slightly ripped off
If I were to recommend something  The calamari and fish tacos were good
The food is always good but not Great
The food in this place is always pretty good
On the top of all of this deliciousness is usually some sort of meat usually pork or beef
Good timing on our partFood was just
My shrimp and vegetables were really good and the teriyaki beef was good but it was drenched in too much sauce for me
As we waited for the delicious Avocado and Plantain Spring Rolls $6
Both were so good we decided to split one more for a dessert of our paleta meal
I ordered a Korean pork dish and it was ok came with sticky rice a sauce some pickled veggies something that looked and tasted like a Vietnamese quiche really good and some salad veggies
There are several healthy and very tasty food options
You can douse your food in sauce if you like but you'll be missing the smoky goodness of the meat that way
Food was OK Denny's quality prices were descent
I am very tempted to give it 2 stars - but because the food was very hot fresh and good I had to go with the 3 stars
I can't do that no matter how good the food is
This one's a good stop the drivethru is usually pretty busy but the service is quick and the food is good stuff
Last time I went they didn't have any jellyfish out which was disappointing because honestly jellyfish is pretty delicious
And for those of us living far away from our beloved Islands The Havana Cafe offers the perfect mixture of culture food flavors music and atmosphere
The kitchen manager is very polite and checks in with you on the food quality
Every time I've been here their food tastes amazing and their soda is super fresh
Highly recommend their chicken strips dipped in beer batter
The owner came and chatted with me for a bit and recommended the chicken dog for my next visit
The meats are all flavorful and moist especially rare with most other gyros
I don't believe in ratings based on price you get what you pay for the food at Modern Steak is excellent but I do only give it 4 stars for originality steak places with mac and cheese and asparagus are a dime a dozen
I liked the pizza more then I thought I would and that is good given the high price they charge for it
Despite that we did have a good time and once my job situation gets more secure so it is not so painful overpaying for pizza I do plan on going back for some really good overpriced pizza
This place is worth the three hour flight AND eating my grandma's meatloaf
The store is amazing to visit there are fish and game mounts and awesome exhibits to take a look at
The fresh baked and pulled meat is super delicious
The two guys in the food prep area also both greeted me & wished me a good evening when I left
The food was well cooked a bit salty but delicious
The chicken and spinach enchiladas were bland but the seafood enchiladas were very good containing shrimp and bay scallops
The food was tasty especially their broccoli
com/ I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you are dining with more than one person so that you can try a variety of their Tapas dishes and share a pitcher of Sangria
2 My friend K had a gross shrimpy incident where she pulled all of the shrimp out of whatever dish she got because they tasty old and
I seriously cannot recommend the food served here
It came off a little crowded which means one of two things the food is really good or the place that is merely convenient and cheap
But the fish was nicely prepared and the ravioli was excellent
So good I may have to break my driving rule and have dessert there again
Pizzas are very good and consistent every time we get them
The broth was flavorful and rich and swimming with noodles veggies chunks of beef
Though I wasn't at all in the mood for soup and wish the menu had made mention of the fact that the dish was far more similar to soup rather than curry it was tasty
It was really good nice and flavorful and a well-balanced mix of veggies beef and sauce
We enjoyed the sweet tamale appetizer chicken fundido steak and lobster tacos
The food was decent but not worth returning for
Every dish is so well crafted every flavor perfectly balanced
The food here seems to focus on savory flavors with a delicate sensibility applied the use of herbs and spices
Of the dishes I've tried I highly recommend the pumpkin soup market vegetable flatbread and roasted salmonsuperfood
I don't buy all my groceries here because I don't think some things are worth what they charge but in all honesty you can only find certain things at Whole Foods that you can't find anywhere elseTrader Joe's Sprouts Sunflower etc
The usual counter worker isn't that friendly which is a shame and always seems put out but that doesn't make the pizza any less tasty
Brie goat cheese burrata mascarpone fig spread prosciutto smoked salmon If the quality of the meats and cheeses was better the rating would be much higher
For dessert I got the half Hot Fudge Sundae and it was big
Appetizer Salad or Soup Entree and Dessert
The spring rolls were fresh and had the perfect flavor and texture
We ordered our food extra hot because that is how we roll
Herb & Flavors is a clean and modern looking sit down restaurant that serves food made with organic ingredients
FOOD You had no choice of appetizers or desert
Justly famous for their good food and friendly service
took about 30mins take our orders another 40mins to get our food and a good 45mins just to give us our checks
The meat is perfectly cooked the sauces and aiolis are on point and those fries cooked in the truffle oil are crazy good
Along with the delicious food the atmosphere provides a hip feel as all the Fox restaurants do that is comfortable while still feeling sophisticated
I am not even a dessert guy but the warm brownie squares gelato ice cream and chocolate sauce is just too good to resist
I'll definitely be coming back here after those late nights in the library for some cheap flavorful and filling food
Not really impressed yes the burger was better than the typical fast food burger joints but it definitely wasn't better than In-N-Out like some people would try and lead you to believe
I've Been here a few times before this places is pretty good I like the Jerk Chicken I also had The Curry Chicken and The Curry Goat was not a big fan of the Curry Dishes and I do like Curry
But the Patties and the Jerk Chicken I do recommend
We had edamame and gyoza off of the happy hour menu and the salmon roll which was delicious
Meats are slow smoked and arrive hot smoky and juicy with a choice of sides and hot or mild sauce
Back then the waiters were surly the food was good and the 99 cent margaritas would knock you on your tukus
COLD LETTUCE HAS NO PLACE ON A HOT PLATE OF MEXICAN FOOD
Just as we placed our order for the combination appetizer plate and the kefta and chicken combo entree the wife came out of the kitchen to serve a couple nearby
I wasn't too impressed with it so passed it up but they also had some fresh Sushi for people to try out
Benihana wouldn't be my first choice for sushi or for going out at all really but if you have a special occasion for some friends it would be a good place to consider
The food is fresh hot and generally very healthy
Margs sangria and their specialty cocktails are all $5 beers are on special and there's a good selection of food priced for happy hour
Let me hasten to add though that these were classy dishes including crispy Sesame Chicken big grilled shrimp & other tasty treats
The flavors that were in the dish were all delicious but was just kind of bland overall
If you have a passion for New Mexico style hot and spicy food and you just can't seem to satiate that burning desire for those dishes that make your endorphins dance then Carlsbad Tavern is the cave for you
The only reason I give them 4 stars out of 5 are due to one or two dishes that were good but rather bland these being the Fettucine Alfredo and their dumpling dish
I'm talking about Mexican food eaten in the US not the wonderful food eaten in Mexico
I have eaten at several locations and have always found the food wonderful
Chicken was very moist and tender potatoes au gratin had great flavor profile but lacked caramelization vegetables were crisp and delicious bu00e9arnaise sauce was just the right amount and tasted amazing
I love eating out and I don't mind spending a lot for good food I just can't belive how boring it was
One of them ordered the pizza which tasted really delicious
The prime rib Friday and Saturday only are wonderful but if you want it you will need to come early - it's a limited cut of beef at the restaurant - when they run out that's it for the night
Weight gives you a good idea of how much meat is in the sandwich
Other sandwiches on the menu that looked interesting photo -Georgetown turkey breast bacon provolone avocado; -California Gulch tuna salad and provolone;-Comstock double roast beef and provolone; -Silver City salami ham and provolone
My medium 8 King Bullion had roast beef turkey breast and provolone see photo along with some veggies
Barbeque glazed salmon over squash/sweet potato hash and a tamarind sauce I haven't had a salmon dish this good/unique in a long time
I had the thin crust whole wheat chicken pesto pizza and it was amazing
One time my pizza came messed up and the staff was amazing about making up for it
Warning if you are in a hurry save Oregano's for another time because there pizzas do take a long time but are well worth it
Typically when I need some quality meat to grill or some fresh seafood
My husband has the salmon as was very impressed I don't do fish so I can't go into more detail
They serve the type of food that continues to come up in conversation throughout the evening in a good way
I was craving a white pizza and my server recommended the Pear and Prosciutto
I LOVE me some good goat cheese and pizza
Now that is not a pizza I usually enjoy but after we swapped a slice I felt like it was pretty good
Anyway no trace of attitude this time just good service and excellent food
The sushi was my favorite and the entire reason I will return and recommend anyone who doesn't like buffets to give this place a try
The spread was amazing with crab legs oysters tons of dessert
Singapore noodles are sort of a hard dish-it's either oily and flavorless flourescent yellow with shoe-leather pork or an incredible marriage of char siu and curry
and if you're looking for some snacks to back that liquor then go for the uber-garlicky fries the tempura green beans or the good ol' fashioned pepperoni pizza
Pizza was too thin and kind of soggy for my taste but still tasted good especially if you like thin pizza
Oink has amazing amazing chicken fried steak
Note I'm not a big tartar sauce fan b/c it hides the flavor of the fish
In addition the food they served was also pretty good for hotel food
I don't usually eat hotel room service if I have a choice but on the few occasions that I was forced to order in I was impressed at the quality of the food served and service that I recieved from the room service staff
-Continential breakfast it is good plenty of selection they let you take as much food as you want back to your room
And this is why I adore Geisha the apps don't suck the rolls are yummy the drinks delicious and the atmosphere cannot be beat
consistent food consistently good service a decent wine list and a feeling of occassion
The quality of the food is mediocre compared the legit ones in Hacienta Heights CA or San Gabriel CA
Pretty good Chinese food - like what I'm used to from the East Coast NYC
And the kung pow chicken had a nice flavor with some whole black beans in the sauce
I had a perfectly seasoned seafood pasta dish Not too creamy or salty leaving room for the flavors of the shellfish to emerge and blend into the sauce
I usually get dragged to a yogurt dessert after eating ridiculously large meals so thank goodness it's lower in fat
Food was amazing and the owner Joe is absolutely the best restaurateur in existence
The meat was really juicy tender and flavorful you really get what you paid for
The food was flavorful cooked to perfection and had wonderful presentation
My sandwiches were cold I mean cold to the touch the meat and the buns and they were not wrapped in foil
What can I say when they put the pizza sauce under and on top of the cheese except for DELICIOUS
I recommend the spring rolls which are around $3 with happy hour
Whenever I want to throw all of the healthy eating out the window for the day and succumb to the deliciousness that is soul food I make a visit to Lolo's
I had the Gamberetti alla Fra Diovalo Shrimp and crab meat sauteed in a Fra Diovalo sauce served over linguini pasta AMAZING dish
The shrimp and crabmeat were scrumptious and the chicken and sausage were really flavorful
A good percentage of males from New Orleans know how to cook soul food because it is important to preserving our heritage said Duma
We stopped in to get take out because they do not have an online menu and we were rather pleasantly surprised by the quality and flavor of the food not to mention the great prices
The staff was friendly and the food was quickly prepared and hot when we drove it home
The food is good not great prices are very reasonable but I LOVE the beer selection
A few places you can enjoy are Southwest Moes Margarita Johnny Rockets Ocean Blue Cold Stone a new pizza place that slips my mind and so much more
You can't beat the deal on the rotisserie chicken and the seasonal items are worth grabbing as soon as you can
Our food took about average time to arrive and was hot or cold as it should be according to what was ordered
Overall I would say average but the food was really good and worth another star
The burnt bits stuck to the crust took a little getting used to but didn't detract from the overall flavor of the pizza which is killer with the homemade mozzarella
I was almost put off by the club-like ultra-hipness of the place but after sampling the food I was glad I stayed the lamb kisra was one of the most flavorful dishes that I've had the pleasure to have tried in the Phoenix area
I've also heard that Fez's drinks are pretty good though I was there for the food not the liquor
The complimentary duck fat fries eliminate the need to order appetizers-The beignets I had for dessert were good but not mind-blowing
Time may has passed but I still enjoy the quality value food at Amados
- and after reading a few yelps on this place I figured we had to give it a whirl since most had tried the bacon wrapped shrimp and enjoyed this signature dish
I want to go back to try some of their seafood entrees which sounded really good
It does seem to me that the other time I ate Thai the food was alot more tasty and I did find the food here somewhat on the bland side
The torta was good had different cuts of pork in it and i think a slice of breaded beef
The answer is yes i am going back to try some other stuff on their menu the service was quick and the waitresses were nice the food was good especially the juices and the atmosphere was whatever
Every course was delicious- Oysters- Charcuterie plate with rabbit confit- Seared scallops over brussel sprouts and fingerling potatoes- Sliced kobe beef with gnocchi- Some chocolate orange pot de creme type of dessertThe standouts of the night were the rabbit confit moist and flavorful and the gnocchi incredibly light and airy - if these are offered as part of the regular menu order them
My companions were happy with their dinners - and it did look and smell like the flavor that was missing in the appetizer may have been made up for in the grilled meats
People are friendly the food is delightful music is wonderful and everything combines to make you have one of those moments where you look around and realize I'm so happy
We got the boom dip which was excellent and the Chicago style pizza
Two things about this pizza 1 The crust is buttery crisp and delicious
We did try the cookie dessert and it was tasty but again not out of this world
The atmosphere is nice great friendly staff and good food
I myself had the ricotta gnocchi - a delicious bowl of upscale comfort food
Also - not over done or over complicated - just good simple food
The food line is super fast the portions are huge and delicious
This buffet doesn't offer as many food choices as those of Pancho's or Camarones but the food the service & the price are all good & it's a comfortable place
Tasty food in a casual low-key atmosphere
What I Liked The Brizza BReakfast pIZZA was DELICIOUS
Our drinks were kept full our food was delivered hot and he was friendly and fun
Several of us enjoyed the Cheeseburger in Paradise while one friend had the Seafood Mac and Cheese which was delish
Nevertheless the food was pretty good and had a nice grilled flavor
Although the food was reasonably good the long wait bait and switch and high prices make me doubtful that I will return
Crazy promotions like Fish races on Thursdays shirtless shots at 1 wearing sombreros for discounted tacos and other similar wacky ideas make the atmosphere fun
It was good but the bun or something added way too much sweetness it almost seemed like a dessert
The pork chop is always grilled just right and their food flavoring is very consistent for the most part
Similar to the most recent review I have to preface this with a I know you're reading this and thinking 'why the heck did this person give a fast food chain restaurant a good review'
If I can spend a bit more I'll go for the caesar salad though I skip the unsatisfactorily dry cold chicken add-on
We had the thai chicken pizza which was really good
Sounds like a minor distinction I know but the two main dishes served family-style tasted quite different and he went with spice level 2 I stuck with the still-hot-for-me level 1
My friend tried a few different sushi rolls including the spicy tuna which I tried too- it was delicious
But what's atmosphere without good food
The Rotisserie Chicken wasn't better then something you can get at your local grocery though Id have to say that the groceries are far more moist and flavorful
Excellent mix of a variety of cheeses meats and other fresh ingredients
Go to Postino if you want some really good food wine or conversations
All of them were very delicious especially my scallop dish
There aren't many seafood restaurants in this part of town or the valley really but this one is very good
Traffic Jam serves up some tasty food but is somewhat lacking in organization and atmosphere
While the food is good the service decor and organization are somewhat disjointed
My team and I visited Famous Rays Pizza since it was right behind our hotel and for pizza it was okay
I've eaten here several times and I think the food tastes very good
The food was pretty good but it seemed to be missing something
Similar to the law of diminishing returns in economics I am a firm believer that there comes a point in time where eventually no matter how good the food you're waiting for is - it's just simply not worth the wait
While I can say without a doubt that the pizza at Pizzeria Bianco is awesome I would hesitate to recommend this place to everyone
The party of 3 that was literally right behind us in line before the open was still not seated when I was leaving the restaurant that's after an appetizer and 3 pizzas
She's also allergic to onions so is used to having food that has no flavor Heehee
I recommend Chizona's Pizza for a good Italian Beef if you're in the Scottsdale area
However the issue is that the food's not that good
The atmosphere is so-so but the staff is Japanese and they do not hold back on the quality of food
Will not be in a hurry to get back especially when next door AZ88 has delicious food and the staff are happy and upbeat
We ordered the cheese pizza which is a really inexpensive but delicious tasting Margarita pizza sooo good
Not a big deal though the food is totally worth going to get yourself
But the food is some of the best Indian food in town lunch specials are really good and the happy hour is great so until now I just put up with it
Honestly I can't say I won't come back because there isn't much else in the area and the food itself is really good
The service is always excellent and I have never had any long delays in getting waited on or getting the food
The food was pretty tasty but I can get similar platters at just about any other joint downtown
Food was really good I had a wild boar burger with coconut curry sauce and carmelized onions along with the standard beef/bacon/cheese burger
Two thumbs up for good service good food good location cleanliness and an all around good experience
Our appetizer finally arrive iwe've now been there for 45 min and I say I was wondering if we were forgotten and the food runner then decides to YELL AT ME
To top off the miserable experience the food was below mediocre Over cooked the cole slaw was awful and we kissed any chance of our drinks being refreshed goodbye
I thought the food was quite good although the portions were a bit small even though I did not order for the small plates menu
Excellent food we had the pretzel fondue appetizer main dishes gnocchi the pasta dish with rib meat and tomato sauce and the burger
My dad a diabetic introduced me to this place and raved about how this place didn't make his sugar go wonky at all and how the pizza is amazing
2 entrees and soup for under $20 was reasonable and the food was really quite good
my mongolian chicken was spicy deep fried and tasty
i don't think they used all white meat chicken but honestly it was too tasty for me to care
I've never been that impressed with Paradise Bakery but the food is good
I've learned that La Grande does more than make a mean sandwich- they also have some of the best yogurt/granola I've ever had and have decent sushi for being a grocery I recommend the spicy tuna
The food is always amazing and of course very filling as well
I just had their Calimari which was delicious and a Sicilian pizza the square kind
Italian food is my favorite and their Italian food is delicious
The food is delicious the service is friendly and the portions are pretty large
Everything is very tasty I just love the beef Republic ramen with a bit of sesame chili oil added
The gyoza are great crisp but not too crisp and the flavor and the flavor of the sauce is great and at 3 for $2 not a bad little side dish with the soup
The food is generally tasty and the prices are reasonable plus there is a half plate option
It doesn't seem right to not use lady fingers for this dessert but it was amazing
get some good wine or find a friend with a taste for the stuff and have them pick you out something to bring they do not have any on hand and their food goes very well with it
The chicken was again cooked just right and the sauce complimented both it and the seasoned mashed potatoes wonderfully
The steaks looked good as well but I only had eyes for fish on this visit
Everything about Durant's was amazing the service ambiance food the feeling
I never knew spring rolls could be so delicious
The food at Pita Jungle is really good but the service at the 2 locations I have been at is always the same horrible
The sides were the gorgonzola mac and cheese and a dish I almost refuse to believe were brussels sprouts they were THAT tasty
Three of us shared a ravioli dish it was cold
when we told her about the cold food and cheese she couldn't have cared less
The pizza here is pretty damn good for Phoenix
I understand that from time to time people want to throw larger parties there but you need to explain to these social megalomaniacs that there are other people eating in the restaurant and that this is not the local Pizza Shack and that running around taking tons of flash photos bumping into other tables yelling and screaming and acting like ass-hats in general is not acceptable behavior
The hubs deserved some good eats so we headed over to the Brat Haus as my hubs is a lover of all thing meat
The lamb and beef were fairly interchangable as far as taste but both were excellent cuts of meat and the sauce they were in was very tasty
Not sure if they offer BYOB anymore but the food was delicious and had a nice kick
The only downside is that the area that sells ready to eat pizza hot dogs etc is facing the mall
Sometimes food needs to be unhealthy to taste good
And while Oregano's pasta dishes are good and tasty i can't give a 5-star rating to a restaurant that doesn't make its own pasta or at least buy fresh from a local vendor
sorry - the authentic Italian-style minimalist pizzas don't quell the good ole American boy in me who wants a HEAVY pie
Nice people serving up quality healthy mostly organic food
He made some excellent recommendations about side dishes
Ok I'm somehow still surprised to find good food in the area but I think that's because I'm only ever a visitor
It's not the  most amazing bar in the world it's not the most delicious food in the world but it's a great fun neighborhood bar that's clean open airy busy and non-pub'ish
This might be good for many other dishes on the menu but a curry gets better when prepared beforehand and sits a little bit to deliver more flavor
Hungry for some good Corned Beef I whipped in here today for lunch
of Chicken & Matzah Ball Soup their spelling to start things off & it was delicious
Then there was my 1/2 Hot Corned Beef on Rye sandwich neither piled up sky high nor skimpy but in between & on plain bread with a bottle of mustard there on the table to add your own
The Corned Beef was lean tender & tasty
The pasta outshined the veal for me but I thoroughly enjoyed both dishes
The egg rolls are crunchy deliciousness which is a complement to any meal
The two dishes we ordered were delicious and reminded me of food cooked at my grandma's house in Hong Kong
The weather was cold so we wanted a braised dish served in a hotpot
This is a great local business whose owners care about making fresh flavorful and thoughtful ice creams and other desserts
We had a variety of appetizer plates - mac n cheese crab cakes chicken & waffles - that were way overpriced and just average at best
The sushi at Sake Bomber's is decent--its not over-the-top amazing and certainly not bad
There are so many rolls appetizers specials dinners to choose from--its a little intense and perhaps overwhelming for the indecisive order-er
Sake Bomber probably isn't your best bet for sushi in Tempe and certainly not in all of the Phoenix Metro Area but its a good place to go when you want to mix it up in Tempe maybe you've been going to Sushi 101 every night or for big groups
Dinner was a little pricey but for the great quality of food and service I'd say that it was worth it
She checked on us after we received our food and called out goodbye as we were leaving
Their food is good always spicy and flavorful
I have to deduct a point for service though the last 2 times we dined here it seemed to take forever to get drinks and the servers aren't very good at explaining dishes nor are they personable
We shared a three egg omelet with chicken apple sausage and local hot peppers that was one of the best I've tasted
Even when we show up not long before closing we are given the same excellent service and food
Entree  The Sweet Fire Chicken with the above mentioned chili paste added is a fairly good fast food meal
the fruity dessert thing that i got was so delicious
The food was perfectly cooked and everything was fresh and of quality ingredients
95 and literally was 4 slices about 1x3 inch pieces- far from worth the price and not the best sashimi grade fish I've had
Otherwise for the two of us lunch was $50 with tip- kinda pricey but the servings were decently large and food was excellent quality
Visit one  good sandwich lots of food for the price relatively quick but no ice and soda was warm
I get the feeling the people at Burger Studio paid more attention to unsuccessfully making the inside look sleek and modern than they did making sure they use high quality ingredients in their food
Flavoring was excellent and they kept their food fresh and warm at all times
The Machacha Tacos were good and the food came almost immediately
I wouldn't say the food here was super excellent this is Arizona after all and there are some great Mexican places but it was good and the prices were reasonable and the service was prompt and cheerful
We did takeout and the food was pretty good
Our order consisted of Cha Gio Fried Eggrolls Bun Cha Gio Fried Eggrolls atop cold rice vermicelli with lettuce cucumbers sprouts and nuoc cham sauce and Beef Chow fun Beef with wide rice noodles stir fried
The beef was well-cooked and I enjoyed the lime juice red onions tomatoes and cucumber
Just good Italian guys and great Italian food
The food quality is amazing my steak was so good
The Arizona chicken rolls are an appetizer that can't be missed
The burrata salad didn't come quite as I expected but my waitress suggested a different type of bread to accompany it and it turned out to be an excellent dish with said addition
Granted that this is the only place I've found in the valley to serve moist brisket or even give you a choice but the meat was lacking flavor
The sauce is sweet and lacking a kick either from vinegar or spice but if the meat is good who cares about the sauce
The menu is typical bar food including burgers sandwiches pizza wings as well as some taco and quesadilla selections which I always appreciate a good quesadilla so I will have to try it next time
good cheese and fresh mushrooms and olives so I would order pizza here again IF they have a thinner crust option
The cold pulled chicken was moist and robustly flavored
I still havent found truly authentic and amazing Chinese food in Az
The food smelled delicious but I can't comment anymore on it since I did not eat anything but the happy hour prices were fantastic includes both food and drinks and it doesn't get too crowded
We ordered a few pizzas and I thought they were delicious
Good solid food good solid service fun and yes touristy atmosphere and some of the nicest people working there that you'll ever meet
Food was pretty good too given the volume of people served
The  chicken marsala was flavorful a bit dry but it is difficult to keep it moist at catering events
The cream mushroom sauce was very tasty also and helped cover up the minor chicken dryness
Bread to go with the pasta was very good desserts cake were soft with plenty of icing
THE FOOD We ordered an appetizer Tempura Mix battered & fried prawns and vegetables $7 which came out pretty quick and was scarfed down pretty readily
Definitely not the best sushi in the world but pretty darn good for the middle of the desert
Sushi eye is a little farther than we would normally travel but having gone in for lunch two weeks before I figured it was worth the risk
I would definitely recommend Sushi Eye
Food is excellent I love the Hummus its a little spicy and the pita is warm and I usually end up with more hummus then pita and they always bring out more
Their hamburgers and fries are amazing sandwiches are to die for and I haven't had it but their pizzas look tasty
The value for the money is very good - when we went this week the  four of us each had our own meals and dinner salads we split two appetizers the Kickbutt garlic bread and fried Ravioli  two desserts two sodas and three beers
Aside from the pizza the rest of the food seems good too
I loved my pizza but that almost made me wish I had gotten it instead - SO good
Overall though North is a cool place good food good service and if you order an Arnold Palmer you get the lemonade in a nice little carafe--stay classy North
AYCE menu is a bit more limited than regular sushi menu but still offers a good variety of itemsYou'll find most of the usual suspects on the AYCE sushi menu plus a variety of specialty rolls
Salmon and albacore nigiri spicy tuna handroll and agadashi tofu were all very good though agadashi was really just tempura tofu with dipping sauce
Also really enjoyed the Hot Night roll - spicy tuna crab and avocado deep fried and topped with spicy mayo sriracha and sesame seeds - yum
The appetizers were mini pizza/bruschetta - some had mushrooms and some has tomatoes with cheese
50 and included an egg flower soup egg roll with mustard and sweet & sour dipping sauces rice and a good portion of chicken
All in all Great Wall was a good and low-priced good service option for a Chinese food
Their sauce is unbelievable and their meat is tasty
Moving on the chicken sandwiches are pretty tasty  that it makes me forget for a little bit how much I hate their service
Doesn't matter if its grilled or crispy they both come out well but honestly this place is known for their hamburgers so I would say that if you are chicken sandwich connoisseur that's it not really worth your time or money
The Meatball skewers were very good I must say
It is wonderful to find this variety of organic food and have it delivered right to your door
My brother and I have had lunch here a couple of times and the food has been excellent both times
I ordered the blackened catfish with dirty rice and it was excellent
The food is fairly good for a bar - still have a lot of the greasy favorites and they are favorites for a reason but there are also some decent salads and such
I would recommend sharing it with another since you get four pieces of fried fish
For dessert I had baklava which seemed to have even more honey sauce and nut filling than most - very tasty
From the chips and salsa at the start to the blazing hot main course the food was great
The price is excellent for the food you get
Great food totally worth the extra few bucks you would save some where else
The two visits I have had have solidified this claim as the sandwiches soups and desserts are AMAZING
The chips and salsa were very good for my lunch entree I chose the Mexican pizza with ground beef
I enjoyed the Mexican pizza except for the ground beef part
even the pudding desert dish with cashews and raisins was tasty
so first visual impression was a regular drop joint hopefully with a good underlining food
the chicken tasted like boneless fried chicken cutlets w a side of Louisiana style bbq sauce instead of katsu saucenot goodthe beef was borderline beef jerky thinly sliced over sauced beefsome of it was tenderalot of burnt ends and grisly biteswith a copious amount of marinate
The chicken is crispy crunchy greasy and flavorful
He said that their meatball subs were good and he described it as a ice little spot that he remembered enjoying
Any decent pizza joint should have been able to toss the various toppings on their pre-made cheese pizza stock slices pop them into the oven and deliver them nice and hot to our table within 15 minutes at the most
In summary if vegetarian or Kosher pizza pasta and sub sandwiches are what you're after and the idea of fish meatballs sounds good to you then this is the place for you
Somehow I seem to end up here on Friday evenings with my brother and order fish and chips to be downed with a good Guinness
The thought of a restaurant dedicated solely to chicken fingers lead me to believe they MUST have perfected the art of amazing chicken fingers
Food is very good portions large ingredients fresh
My wife and I had our first date at china doll on 7 ave and Osborne it is long gone and that place used to be packed with Asian folks and the food was not very good
Our food came out cold dry  and BURNT
Of the 7 people eating only 1 of us enjoyed the pizza cheese and sausage/mushroom pizzas
The chicken pesto did not have the way over the top oregano flavor so it must have been in the tomato sauce and left out of the pesto sauce
However I didn't mention that we also ordered bruschetta for an appetizer not realizing that it was basically the very same dish
Good sushi and a great location for people watching since it's in Old Town Scottsdale
Food came out fast and was good sushi overall
Also while the Kobe beef was good other gourmet burger places have cheaper options which are superior
It  was actually very good and I could see myself ordering that if I was not in the mood for red meat
All-in-all it was an excellent evening with great food and service
As a result my gyro was less than hot because we all waited until she had her food
Thought about three stars b/c of the food delay but both times I've been the food has been quite good and my food this time still had good flavor
Simple but not simplistic this is food that tastes good and you feel good about eating
The dinner included dessert and we went with the warm pecan pie with bourbon flavored whip cream - OMG it was the BOMB
I've also tried a pasta bowl and pizza when I was with my daughter since there is no kids' menu and they were also good
Desserts - huge portions and yummy flavors but
While it may just appear to be another trendy gastropub in Arcadia it does provide good food good drinks and a fun vibe
In fairness they offered half off appetizers but only the one's without meat
Just seems like the quality of the food has really gone down
The owner told us they had been open for 80 days as of yesterday and that they make the hamburgers and the all beef hot dogs there
I suggest that they visit 'The Parlor' and take a look at the quality of the Artisan meats that they serve on their carving board along with the thickness and temp of the meats
They need to turn it up and light a fire under the asses of these young guys that are looking at a high profit margin by sacrificing quality food
A few of the sandwiches are really good but the vegetarian and vegan options are pretty bland - when I started eating meat again I started liking the food here a lot more
My husband typically orders the burger and said that it is a good and satisfying when you're looking for an All-American burger on a good roll
We've had friends order the flatbread pizzas and the wings and all said they were really good too
I mean I'm not Vegan I'm not going to pretend that I understand Vegans either I like meat and stuff that taste good
As a non Vegan meat eating cheese loving son of a bitch I fully recommend you try Treehouse bakery because damn that shit is good
I had the chicken schnitzel cordon bleu and my husband had the frikkadeller and both were delicious
ReviewPros-good quality grade SUSHI the truest I've tasted in all the valley-portion size-good variety in happy hour & reverse happy hour menu-good ambiance and social scene-good locationCons-poor replicas of some Asian dishes evident in the tonkatsu and Korean Kalbi-price vs valueIf you've heard that this place is expensive you heard right
The great white pizza is amazing and so is the pizookie
The food is terrific the prices are low and the service is excellent
I go there at least once a month to get my Korean food and side dishes She also makes different side dishes - they are always fresh and good
awesome little place to taste the real korean food - cheap and good
The Quebac Poutine is french fries topped with cheese curds and hot beef gravy - so yummy
When the food finally arrived my chicken cordon bleu schnitzel was big very juicy crispy and all the sides were delicious
The food may not be fantastic but it sure beats a lukewarm rubbery stadium vendor hot dog any day
Tv's and charming booty butts everywhere kinda like any given home that offers good food tv and a honey combined for a gratifying result
We started with an appetizer of Blackened Shrimp & Crawfish Fondeaux with garlic bread which was free by using a coupon I got by signing up on their website and providing my e-mail address
I would've been a bit disappointed if I had paid for this particular appetizer since it skimped on the bits of seafood and wasn't a particularly well-done fondue not nearly cheesy enough but it kept the group I was with something to nosh on while we waited on our entree orders
Think about it I come here everyday and have for about the last 1000 days and this dish was so amazing I decided to create an account and post my opinion
When good people and affordable food and drink culminate together it's a 5 star dealio
EDIT  Next time we went there were plenty of high chairs the food was still great and they were even cool with me bringing in a Chick-fil-a sandwich to pair with the soup we ordered no matter how good your sandwiches are it's hard to beat an amazing $2
Maybe in Illinois this is considered good but here in the land of Mexican food it was a complete failure
For an entree we split the grilled sword fish which was good
The food was good I prefer their dinners but good for the reasonable prices
And the food here is slightly different from the other Jordan's but just as good
get the iced green tea - apparently it's much popular than their regular tea - it was quite nice there were several refills to be had through the course of the mealwe ordered 3 of the large pizzas to share between four people it looks like all of their pizzas are thin crust - yukon gold potato funghi and the Salsiccia the sausage one apparently with Schreiner's sausage which is a local sausage placepotato pizza 2 - it was okay for my first potato pizza - the potato slices it was very thinly sliced and it was more leeky than potato-y which was a little disappointingfunghi 3 - the mushrooms had a very strong taste but not like a shiitake mushroom it was a surprisingly nice flavorsalsiccia 3
The quality of the food started to go down and we stopped going
The food is so-so and the service is pretty good
We really like the hot and sour soup and the Flamingo chicken
Service is slow food is good; don't expect any fortune cookies
One last thing If you like hot pots be warned The hot pot dish on the menu is already prepared and simply served to you in a literal hot pot
However the food is great so I think it's worth it
this place has nasty microwaved food for way more than any of it is worth
He gave me a sample and the chicken was chunky and delicious
The turkey was tasty the provolone was yummy and the sourdough roll tasted like it was fresh from the oven
- Clean decor - Tasty homemade food that's on display for visitors to see - A good family-style atmosphere that greets you the second you walk inside
The service was pretty good we got refills pretty quickly and the food came fast
For those of you reading this that have not tried this amazing Chinese/American psuedo dish it is one of my favorites
I especially respect that when the food is delicious with such restrictions and it is so good job Grassroots
I have tried the Spit Fire Free Range Chicken which is the juiciest half a chicken I've ever had in my life amazing flavor as well served with dirty orzo which is like dirty rice but with orzo and it translates perfectly
The place looked like it was going to be great according to photos on the wall even Bobby Flay has met the owner I just hope he didn't taste the food
The service is excellent the staff has worked there for years and is speedy to run around and refill drinks and clear dishes
I ordered as a main the seafood panang and it was so good
So this place is legit good service and good food
The hubs had a meatball sub and commented on it's deliciousness
We got dessert to go chocolate dipped strawberries and fudge cheesecake so good
My parents always get a pizza and I'm not sure which ones they have gotten but they're always really good
I've also gotten the meatballs as an appetizer and they were good but not anything too special
I recommend bringing home extra pizzas to eat the next day
And being from the bay area we know good sushi and this is def my new favorite spot
Things I've tried thereLoLo's special which is 3 piece of chicken with 2 waffles Stupid fries side of potatoes smothered Chyna's honey hots which are their hotwings Ivan's chorizo and eggs and their banana cream pudding
My food always arrive and taste just as good as the last time as to their Scottsdale location the food doesn't taste the same to me
The food was pretty good- huge bavarian style pretzels are always great with beer
They carry high quality foods which is what your pets should be eating
Spinach and goat cheese salad was quite good had them add grilled chicken to it
The chicken looked very good with a small scattering of large plump mushrooms and they had not forgotten the plain pasta
I don't really know how you can screw up Italian food but they seem to be doing a damn good job of it
The size of the meal was very good and filled me up quite nicely and then some so I guess the food and drink was a good value for my money
They either need to better season their meat/bun/something or start using some secret sauce to flavor up their burgers
The food tasted good but everything else about dinner tonight was awful
If you want to be served food and enjoy yourself I would recommend going somewhere else
So in all fairness I'm giving Sakana 4 stars for the overall experience of my party -- including one of us who enjoyed her first full sushi meal
If you go on Sunday - Thursday their customer appreciation menu provides reduced price sushi in full portions it says good for an appetizer or snack but they're complete rolls
As for the sushi -- I was a little disappointed that several of the selections were just fish on top of a California Roll since I hate that roll but there were creative enough selections that it made it worthwhile
The maki rolls were falling apart a bit but were tasty nonetheless
Overall a good place with friendly service and a decent selection of sushi options
I'd recommend checking out the Las Vegas Roll which is a Philadelphia Roll that's DEEP FRIED
The food is Applebees quality but a little more expensive
I'll admit I'd never had Ethiopian food before but I was familiar with the eating with your hands concept and knew the flavors to expect
Fella liked his meats but enjoyed my vegetarian dishes more
Food was good Even if not overly memorable and the atmosphere felt a bit nicer than a normal sports bar even though most folks were wearing sports themed clothing and yelling at the TV
The pancake shu mai shrimp duck and sliced beef inside a wrapper are highly recommended all were excellent
Over all it was good the chicken tenders and the fries were cooked to order and they served with our choice of both BBQ sauce and ranch
I used to recommend Lemongrass to everyone I'd meet whenever I'm asked where do you go for great Thai food
A coworker who visited the cafe twice reported back that while he enjoyed the food he didn't think the cafe would do well since each time he visited he went twice many many moons ago business was very slow
It used to sadden me that I couldn't enjoy the great flavors LTC used to offer but I've since found a handful of other places that offer equivalent if not better dishes
I do wish the owners/cooks all the best in their venture as they can provide delicious dishes at LTC
Excellent chips and salsa great patio and consistent food
The server was attentive but not annoying the food was delicious and the wine was a bit disappointing for the second time in a row
I've also tried the Italian Grilled Meats and it was delicious but not quite as good as the Bobbie
I've been to Wildfish a dozen times in the past and it's just like the other Yelpers report consistently good food cute space good service
The crowd is a little on the older side bar is packed with 60-year-old+ patrons but other than that Wildfish is definitely a good happy hour spot gem in Old Town Scottsdale
Defalco's has an excellent variety of sandwiches and salads all rolled up into a cozy little Italian grocery
the food is good but so is a lot of other food in the area
it is worth it and it is great comfort food
If you ever had 3 days of meetings in different cities each day spending more time at the airports than the hotels you will discover that you can end up eating non stop because food is available everywhere
I checked this place out originally based on the reviews that I had seen here on Yelp and I must agree that the food here is pretty good
Under that approach you get a cold appetizer hot appetizer fish meat/poultry cheese or dessert
The chicken quesadillas were good in the fact that they had a lot of chicken meat which was tasty
One of us has the Halibut Fish and Chips and it was as good as it gets
We all loved our food the house wines were really good
The waitress brought a dish with the fries and chili - but no nacho cheese which is what makes them so good
I asked for his recommendation between the Shrimp w/Diablo sauce and the Chicken w/Mole sauce
My husband had the turkey berry sandwich which I didn't try no meat for me but he said it was good
The seafood pumpkin curry I ordered it 4/5 hot and it was spicy enough I guess
The eggrolls were perfectly rolled so they were probably frozen but they were good
I was impressed with the menu and love the concept of beer first food second
To get the best of both worlds we had sushi as an appetizer which I found quite enjoyable
It was a great night and at $28 for the Tepanyaki it was a great deal considering the quality and quantity of food
The environment leaves much to be desired  but the food is amazing
My boyfriend always gets a salad we share a pizza half cheese and half applewood smoked bacon and have an appetizer and we are usually out of there for 18 to 22 bucks before tip
I would recommend this place to anybody who likes pizza and wants a change from the everyday pizza chains that are out there
The veggie pesto chicken is extremely flavorful the eggplant parmesan is chocked full of various delicious veggies like zucchinis broccoli spinach etc
The food is very good and way beyond 'buffet' quality
Around 10 cold dishes and around 50 hot dishes plus fruits salad desserts sushi station and Mongolian grill
Sushi was okay better than buffet quality but not as good as ones you get at sushi restaurants as the fish was not so fresh
For dessert yes I broke down I recommend the pineapple upsidedown cake
Eve award best non-burger sliders I've ever hadHighlights- Jewish sliders tender sliced beef brisket on top of deliciously seasoned crispy potato pancakes in between 2 soft dense shiny challah buns
But if you're looking for a clean decent VERY inexpensive Chinese restaurant with good food and friendly service this is the place
After my shopping was finished I stopped at Al Hana the little restaurant inside and had the beef schwarma as recommended in several reviews
The food there is good if somewhat old-fashioned
We did not try any bar drinks appetizers or desserts
The steak literally could have doubled as a dessert - it almost had a brown sugar taste to the outer crust while the perfectly cooked medium rare center oozed out delicious juices to mix with my Maestro's Potatos a highly recommended side that is much more affordable then the Lobster mashed potatoes which I decided to pass on after reading yelp reviewsThe wife had a filet which was cooked to her liking but not mine since it was medium well lol which she also enjoyed
I am not even a dessert fan and rarely even order it - but the wife was in the mood for something sweet and the waitress recommended this one which was one of their specialities
Not only was the warm butter cake delectable but the bowl of home made whipped cream that came in a HUGE bowl could have stood alone as a worthy entry on the dessert menu
I shudder to think how many calories were in that dessert but it was totally worth it
This pizza is so good when we drive to Phoenix to see MIL we call ahead pick up the pizza and take it with us out to Apache Junction
They chose the Wagon Wheel Sampler Platter as their Appetizer to share which had Crispy Fried Garlic-Pepper Zucchini Buffalo Chicken Tenders 2 Loaded Potato Skins and Shrimp Cocktail
Overall it was a good food experience
The food was flavorful and at the right temperatures and I would certainly go back
The service was good we made it easy by ordering pitchers of beer and a few large pizzas
I'll be suggesting this place for it's great pizza good service and It's good accommodations for bigger parties
It's important to also note that each country has their own unique dishes flavors cooking styles but we also share some common dishes like jollof rice pepper soup casava leaf fufu etc
I've typically had this dish at my favorite Senegalese restaurants or prepared by family friends and I was expecting a flavorful delight
I was disappointed with my food as were my African & Caribbean friends but our African-American friends enjoyed their meals
She was so nice that I wished I genuinely enjoyed the food
The other reviews appear to be somewhat mediocre but I really feel their foods flavor made it worthwhile
After being greeted by the amazing sushi chef didn't get his name we were brought drinks and we immediately started putting check marks next to all of the selections we wanted to try
Placed on top of the sushi it is very good definitely try it
We went through each of the rolls - the Alaska was very good the salmon nigiri was amazing literally so fresh it melted in my mouth
I'm always in that area but not much impressed me food-wise
We decided to give them another shot a month later the service was great but the food was still not that great
For some reason they season the food with quite a bit of salt in everything which really ruins the flavor
If you want real AUTHENTIC Szechuan style Chinese food this is as good as it gets here in the Phoenix region
Let me stipulate that I am an American Born Chinese however I fatten up every time I go visit my Grandparents in Taiwan because the food is sooo good and my dad is very picky about the Chinese food he introduces to me here in the US therefore I am very picky about my Chinese restaurants that I go to
If you want egg rolls kung pao chicken fried rice or won-ton soup you're better off getting your taste worth at a Panda Express
The pizzas he serves up are nothing short of amazing
Can't wait to go back and see chef ray for teppanyaki he was so entertaining we never wanted to leave his table and the food was just as good
I was so impressed I didn't really have high expectations of dessert and I was totally blown away
I had the chicken parm with penne pasta which was good
my husband had the chicken parm pizza which he also enjoyed
Nice service and dessert was pretty good too
The chicken was tender and delicious but the sauce was like nothing I ever had so unique
My drink came out first in a huge fish bowl glass it was just as good as I hoped it would be full of liquor and fruitiness
The food and service were good but not excellent
Awesome Mexican Tienda Joint - super friendly staff almost too many menu choices to choose from - I had what was recommended by the cashier - the steak fajitas - and they were incredible - I left stuffed with tender beef guacamole fresh tortillas peppers rice beans chips salsa muy rica
I can't remember what everyone else had but 3 out of 4 of us really enjoyed our food
This is one of those places where the food is worth the wait
The chicken was juicy and well cooked throughout with a savory seasoned breading corralling all the flavor
I remember the food being good I got chicken tenders and garlic fries
Someone else had the chicken though and that was good
The desserts were good overall but again not great
The service issues are still there but not nearly as bad oxtail continues to rock my world goat curry very good last thing I had here was their escovitch which was an amazing preparation of fish it somehow had the sinus-clearing sensation of wasabi with some sour and sweet tones
With places like Scramble offering better food better prices as well as free wi-fi you are only going to gouge your Hotel guests not your local neighbors so we'll stay away
The food is excellent and enough to leave you stuffed
Good food takes time and the menus even say which dishes take an especially long time to prepare and bake maybe they added that recently
We also ordered the Parma Pizza-delicious
I could have folded the thin crust pizza up and shoved the whole thing in my mouth that's how good it was
Wonderful margarita cocktail steak fish sides and of course dessert - chocolate cake and the butter cake
Having moved from Chicago it has been a challenge finding great Thai food in AZ but so happy to have discovered Thai Dressing- it's delicious
The vegetarian Pad Thai with tofu is just amazing they do their Pad Thai without fish sauce which is hard to find as is the Panang curry and the Drunken Noodles
A great way to start the meal are the Thai fresh rolls with tofu;  crispy veggies and herbs tofu and rice noodles wrapped in fresh rice paper with a delicious dipping sauce
He also likes his food Thai hot and says that they do a great job making it extra-spicy if you order it that way
Overall the service was friendly the food good and the atmosphere enjoyable
The club was packed with fresh quality meats the croissant was nice and flaky and the chips Lays I believe was a nice side
I have passed by this place many times with my girlfriend and always meant to stop in due to the sign outside advertising the red velvet cake flavor my favorite dessert
mixed with some modern favorites Swedish fish red hots etc
here's what we had*albacore crudo with applestruffleblack garlic -- one of the most amazing dishes I've ever had
2 reasons - 1food quality 2 price1 When a place serves only sandwiches you'd think they'd pay attention to their bread
Picazzo's boasts a menu which includes appetizers salads organic and gluten-free pastas and of course pizza and dessert
One of their best appetizers is their Mama's Meat-za Balls $9
Made with three meatballs with mozzarella artichoke hearts organic tomato sauce basil and Parmesan it is a savory appetizer that easy starts the meal off on the right foot
This pizza is a delicious combination of organic olive oil and garlic Fontina and mozzarella cheeses mushrooms tomatoes goat cheese Kalamata olives and basil
But still compared to the surrounding establishments you get decent food at a good price
Overall this is a pleasant place for get togethers and have a good time with beer wings pizza and pizookie
I didn't know Chinese food THIS GOOD existed especially in MESA
Like Mexican and Chinese food good Korean food is another thing that is hard to come by in the Valley near Tempe
Other than those factors I think all three pretty much rank the same in terms of the quality and taste of their food
Wonderful atmosphere and the food was ahhhmazing
Chicken marsala $15 was good not great as was the accompanying pasta alfredo
The dessert lounge is really chic with it's stylish interior WiFi  case full of 10+ Gelato flavors Gelato cakes and other tasty treats
The tootsie roll is impossible to f up there so it was good for what it was
It was ok again 3 stars only that high because no bad fish flavor
It seems the quality and care for the fish is there but the sushi chef destroys all the rolls with too much mayo or Krab
The spring rolls were simply delicious
The service at this restaurant was borderline terrible from needing to ask for everything including more chips and water refills to waiting too long for food which then came out on an extremely hot plate as if it had been sitting under a window for far too long
The food is not that great your servers aren't that hot and your drinks are weak get over yourselves
I recognize that airport food doesn't live up to a higher standard but the traditionally prepared hot chicken wings at $11
How very shocked and appalled I was to find that some fried chicken parts had found their way under a hot sauce dispenser presented before me
Meant to be a hang the menu is bar-food oriented tasty small dishes with Asian and American foods represented
A good Mexican food restaurant typically has a solid chips and salsa presentation but their salsa was weak and had gringo written all over it
This place was a good place to be seen if you get my drift but the food was just like everything else
The steak taco was good juicy and not as sweet as the other food
I liked one or two bites of the chicken mole quesadilla but couldn't have more than that the sweet chocolate flavor became too strong
The mahi mahi burro was good but I question the freshness of the mahi mahi it was overly fishy other than that it was very good
But after I put the salt and pepper on the food was pretty good
The sushi is creative and tasty and the drink specials rock
I love that they have different flavors for edamame cheap bombers and did I mention the fish sticks are way to good
shrimp and chicken cooked well the rice is excellent and the salsa adds a nice sweetness
The food is always tasty; I especially enjoy the vegetable pakoras
We also ordered a Watermelon Agua Fresca which was so refreshingly delicious even though I'm not sure it was a good mix with Mexican food we took it to goI ordered the Enfrijoladas Homemade corn tortillas filled with chicken and topped with a black bean sauce see picsWOW
Another Amazing dish even though the tacos were pretty spicy overall it was all very fresh and flavorful
Their food is fantastic; the meats being much higher quality than most local competitors
I've tried three of the rolls from the appetizer menu the pho ga and two different bun dishes
They hand make their tortillas all the meats are good and seem pretty authentic
There was a massive amount of shrimp on the plate which made this dish a tasty and very good deal
All the ingredients were well prepared and very good on their own but for me it wasn't as good as my shrimp dish
I am usually a little apprehensive to try a chicken salad at a place that I'm not familiar with but it just sounded so good zatar spice currants pine nuts arugula tomato and lemon vinaigrette
Pitchers were cheap food was good bar food we had the chicken nachos
delivery was timely and the food was fresh and hot when it arrived
This is seriously good food given in *seriously* small doses
The Center Cut Iceberg Salad was tasty as was the Sliced Beefsteak Tomato Salad
Overall the food and service at Morton's is good
Having studied abroad in Florence I KNOW GOOD PIZZA
The shell was crispy and tasty but the beef filling was bland and boring
Both dishes were tasty and I cant say anything bad about them I also cannot say anything great about them either
Each dish came with 2 sides and I can safely say that the side dishes impressed me more then the main course
As with any good pizza joint there's always something unique that makes them stand out
I really enjoy a good brick-oven pizza but with amazingly fresh toppings and good sauce it's allll about the sauce this truly stood out as one of my best pizza experiences
Being a visitor I was definitely impressed with the quality of food and service
My friends helped me order off the happy hour menu and the food was delicious
Plenty of food great menu and amazing happy hour prices
If you are looking for a casual restaurant for lunch or dinner and you're in the mood for Italian food Nick's at Paradise Valley in the Whole Foods shopping center is an excellent choice
-Grilled eggplant appetizer-Stracciatella soup-all of their salads are delicious-pasta with meatballs -salmon or tilapia picatta style-Shrimp Fra DiavoloI don't think you can go wrong with so many options to choose from
I recommend saving a little bit of room for the Hazelnut Tartufo for dessert
It's 110% worth trying to give yourself something to consider next time you're dreaming about meat cheese and buns
The entire experience was fantastic from the pours on the drinks the service to the amazing food
Maybe it's because I'm a good ol' midwestern boy who knows what red meat is supposed to taste like or maybe I'm a f*cking burger snob - either way this burger wasn't impressive
The fresh bun and toppings were nice but the meat lacked any flavor
Although the prices were a little bit on the higher side hovering around 10 bucks a dish including bottomless coffee it was well worth it
The service was very attentive and the food was good
We also ordered Mongolian beef which was good and the house fried rice which has shrimp chicken pork the works
Good food good service moderate prices
The only reason I give it 4 stars is because I don't believe the quality of food and service match the prices
I went with the Escoviche Fish recommendation blacked fish with coleslaw and a grilled pineapple slice  the Mango Lemonade and the Sweet Potato Puddin' almost $50 for just me I felt it a bit over priced even with out my food poisoning
Desserts were pretty good both times I went
We then did a salad and vegetable and i had a small dish of roasted cauliflower with pistachios capers and brown butter and I thought it was quite good though I would have liked the cauliflower a little more roasted but nice - at this point a solid 4 stars
Finally one person got the Kobe bone in rib the half order with the blue cheese grits now that came out hot and it was good - so at this point - because of the slower than expected service from the primary waiter and the fact that the main dish was blah - the overall agreement by my group of five mixed group men and women was a solid 3 stars though if you just came for cocktails and appetizers and they have a good list of starters then we would rate it a solid 4 starts with 5 star potentials if they work on the operational workflow of the kitchen to get the food out hot
They are much better than many other fast food places and well worth the few extra bucks you'll pay for a good burger and fries
The pho was good and I loved the veggie spring rolls
Though it's limited to beef or chicken I feel the meat is consistently of good quality and portion
The food was pretty good and after my date raving about the Apricot BBQ Feta Chicken sandwich he was going to have - I figured it had to be good
Since I wasn't that hungry my brother and I decided to just get munchies so we opted for the Supreme Appetizer $18 which was a giant platter of lettuce mini chimis rolled flautas and a machaca salad in the middle
The rolled tacos tasted like it was fried in warm oil because it was stale and not crunchy but the meat was good if that counts for anything
Saketini has great service wonderful chill atmosphere and a large food/drink menu
I ordered their white pizza the idea of fresh mozzarella was too good to pass up almost immediately upon sitting down
Well they staff behind the line are good because even with the flood beginning my pizza came out in what seemed to be record time
White pizza not the paragon of flavor but it still should have had SOME presence on palate
My boyfriend had the chicken enchiladas which had the choice of red or green sauce and were served with delicious black beans and rice
The food is excellent - certainly the best Italian food in the East Valley
Now i don't mind waiting for good food that's not the problem problem is you can never find a waitress
The food is above average not amazing fantastic but definitely good
The roast beef was nice and rare and the sandwich was overall quite tasty
They have a bunch of stuff on the menu I'm happy is in walking distance from my office like a basic egg salad grilled cheese tuna salad regular salads burgers pizzas deli sandwiches and breakfast served all day--no launching with a half or partial menu at all which I take to be a good sign
The Mex & Match area of the weekday menu allows you to select one or two of many main item choices all the same price each & one or two of a good number of side dish selections all the same price each
The shredded beef taco was large too with plenty of meat & delicious
I was looking for a Fish Fillet in Spicy Sauce and a Hot and Sour Soup
The food is priced reasonably and of great quality it doesn't get better than that for me
We order one last time because the food is pretty good
Secondly this is an amazing lunch place for foodies on a budget
You still have all the food stations you remember from state run institutions like the salad bar the pizza bar the hot meal bar and the deli counter
It is important to note that it is NOT THE SAME MENU as the VIG but that does not discount the food quality whatsoever
The chicken & eggs are also tasty but merely an afterthought to those delicious waffles
The veggies were crisp and the chicken I opted to add was tasty
The thin crust pizza is actually pretty good
Inside the stadium the food choices are slim and not very good
The Papa Johns branded pizza was awful and didn't taste a think like Papa John's pizza - soggy crust tasteless sauce no herbs or flavoring and barely any cheese
I ordered a  combination seafood plate which was good but not great
Overall excellent food quality and enjoyable atmosphere
I would recommend this place for meat lovers
The food has always been exceptional and the service wonderfulThis year it's sucks far below acceptable levels
I love good ol Mexican food but this place has missed the mark
But as far as good food and good service I highly recommend it
The food was pretty delicious but it was the service that really stood out
J explains that he did not realize the portion would be so little for my pasta and how he thinks I need to eat more food which granted I did so he wants to order another appetizer
The waiter was knowledgable about the nuances of each dish which was good because two people in our group never had Thai food before
Overall a pleasurable meal with wonferul service and presentation but for the price they could really up the quality of the food
My food was hot and steamy when I got it and it was goooooood
We also ordered a brownie and ice cream dessert which they put a candle on nice touch and it was pretty good
This place is garbage just another hyped-up trendy Sushi joint that tries to make up for their lack of quality with a hip/modern atmosphere
The sushi is not good the rice in our dish was hard and the food was way overpriced
Have you ever been to one of the restaurants where the food is consistently good
If you're not in the mood for a meat-and-cheese appetizer the pretzel fondue is definitely worth a shot
I feel pretty comfortable saying that given the good drink list and affordable good food you should expect to wait for a table unless you like to eat dinner early
We shared desserts -- the chocolate overload was good and the peach cobbler was not overly sugared like it usually is in most establishments
Overall I would need another try at this place without the Groupon deal and see if they can execute more flavorful food
It's great to know that there is consistency in the quality of the food generous quantity and outstanding service at both locations
The green chile chicken omelot is stunningly tasty
Decent specials friendly service pretty good food
Sushi was tasty not on par with some other restaurants near by Stingray Geisha a go go but freshly made and good flavor
Next time I am going to order the prime rib or the chicken friend steak because I hear those are excellent
If you are looking for place with some good meat with good prices and excellent service then this is the place for you
Also looks like they donate a TON of quality food to animal shelters saw 3-4 pallets of damaged bags waiting to be picked up last time I went which is great to see especially from a small business
The food and service were pretty good
Aside from the above complaints my food was good and considering they've only been open a week I had a very positive first experience here
And don't forget dessert - loved the flour-less chocolate cake dark chocolate with a hint of sweetnessThis place is awesome and everything on the menu is healthy and tasty
Otherwise if you feel like splurging on good food this is the place to go
When they changed owners the food was good for a little bit then as expected changed and was horrible now
They have a great selection of cold noodle hot noodle and soup noodle dishes
We ordered the small Moto for dessert - and that was delicious and a small was plenty for two people
Regardless of the price and the mediocre food it was well worth going for the amazing company of the awesome Phoenix Yelpers
The menu  for SteakenBurger consists of either Cheesesteaks or Burgers with a few chicken items thrown in for good measure
Great atmosphere AMAZING food and a highly textured and blended femininity and masculinity decor
I am a sushi fanatic so I really enjoyed this dish
Not a lot of flavor in the meat filling at all
This is not a place to go if you are in a hurry but the food is well worth the wait
The rest of the dish was delicious though
The atmosphere is great food tastes good and the servers are very attentive
We ordered some chili frito's in the bag a chicken fried chicken a chicken fried steak and a pork chop all with mashed potatoes corn and white gravy and totally tasty biscuit
Update Went for dinner this time and the service wasn't near as good prices were much higher than food value and as such it wasn't worth the bill price
Come if you want hearty lunch foods though then it's worth it
I've never been here besides for happy hour so I can't comment on the dinner dishes but the happy hour food is good
Today the line is just not the same the food choices are smaller and hit or miss on quality
Does it have good food for a good price quick friendly service and a good casual atmosphere
If I had to choose a favorite it would be the fish or the seafood in general but every bite of everything was honestly amazing
It's mostly residential but well-worth making a special trip like every single day for this food
I have had other food but the pasties here - the pasta salad is delicious good strong greek salad too - but its useless to try to compare it to the pasties
Their desserts are so good too last time getting the Banoffee pie to go which was sinful it was so good
A few more tidbits o' info  the sausage is homemade so don't hesitate to get a sausage pizza; a slice of cheese pizza is sublime needs no toppings at all; the 4-cheese pizza is dreamy order one; try a pizza with pesto mozarella and ricotta you'll weep it's so good
It was hot so we didn't sit on the patio but by looking at it I can see it as a super cool place to hang out in cooler weather and I am for sure coming back to try the dessert- I am a sucker for red velvet cake and was crushed I was too full to have some this trip- next time dessert first
Only recommendation would be to make the food in the back
That's partially due to the wonderful food but the management of this particular restaurant exceeds all others
Highly recommend  their Honey Seared Chicken Kung Pao and Mongolian Beef but it's the service that earns them this 5 star rating
3They bring out food at random times sometimes meals before appetizers some meals come way before others
I want my food when its fresh and hot and that's when they deliver it not sitting on a counter getting cold for 20 minutes while your friends' food cooks
You could taste the smoky flavor in the broth of the mussels and the jerk chicken was fantatstic
Cheap good food and lunchtime portions of sushi on the side
Tamale filling was tasty shredded meat as it should be but corn meal was barely warm and almost tasted only partially cooked
The staff is very friendly and well the best part the pizza was wonderful
The crust was thin and the meats on the pizza were very flavorful
My fries were cold my chicken strips were gross and frozen pieces of crap thrown in to a deep fryer and tossed on my plate
The food here is nice bar/pub fare and is always fresh and hot
Much like the butterfish it was another highlight of the night with its sweet ghee flavor and texture much difficult to execute on a grill
Had borh the blackened and pan seared  Butterfish very good
My most favorite is their orange flavored chicken
-Italian was pretty decent as well something like a more homemade type of pizza hot-pocket with pepperoni salami ham mozzarella and stewed tomatoes then served with a side of marinara sauce
Sadly the hummus wasn't on the menu probably because of the pita but there are several delicious items including the spinach roll-ups
Pane Bianco features home-made bread baked in on-site wood ovens hand made mozzarella basil and greens out of Chris's own garden and high quality meats from locally owned Schneider sausage
My dish was amazing as well with lots of flavor and tons of vegetables including mushrooms zucchini and cauliflower
In past reviews I always mention how it can be difficult to find vegetarian dishes with lots of flavor unless you are at a vegetarian restaurant
The reason why I'm impressed it was a whole chicken breast in my Med Chicken sandwich
bad service wicked crowded completely overpriced lack of organic options your staffs amazingly entitled attitude ALONG with marginal food
The Tempura Salmon Roll appetizer was
I've heard the food is pretty good so I'll have to go back and try it
The quality of the food is beyond excellent
My wives Pho was flavorless broth with some pre cooked cut up chicken thrown in there
The food was excellent and the place was a very fun atmosphere to hang out in
Food was decent I got the buffalo focaccia which had all the right flavor but kept falling apart
The staff is great and the food is pretty good
Given that the group consisted of 160 guest I was concerned that the quality of food would suffer
But we greatly enjoyed their nigiri sashimi and rolls
Once we ordered a sushi boat and everything they gave us were very good
The gals loved the guacahummus  salsa and chips  a great start with drinks  we had wonderful entrees  like the special of chicken pasta and my delicious blue corn enchiladas which I would gladly have again
And it was delicious--plenty of peanuts the noodles were perfectly cooked and they didn't skimp on the meat
The fried spring rolls were okay but they were tiny and not piping hot
We also got a perfectly toasted roll right from the hot hearth - temperature 600+ degrees
er gig going and we're impressed with his adventurous spirit and love for good food
They have curious and amazing bacon filled treats like bacon brownies and today we tried bacon scones YUM along with a really adorable seating arrangement attached to an eclectic 'whole foods' type shop
Now don't get me wrong their pizza is tasty
They have a cheese schnitzel literally the ONLY meatless thing I could find on the menu but it was good
I think this place is worth a visit even if you don't eat meat you can have the cheese schnitzel and a humungous beer and feel like you're in Germany for the day
As for the food - I have absolutely  no doubt that they use the highest quality ingredients
I started with a meat & cheese plate that was very good
My selected meats/cheeses came with pesto and a tomato sauce along with some very good flatbread
I was pleasantly surprised--this was an excellent salad thanks mostly to sweet pears contrasting with spicy-coated pecans and chicken that was clearly hand-pulled from a whole roasted bird and unlike most chicken on salads this included both light and dark meat
The crust quickly became soggy in the center of my 12 pizza but the overall flavor was very good
The toppings were good quality but the sausage on my pizza overpowered the flavor of the cheese and sauce
The food was fine on my only visit to Blue Fin when my son and I stopped in on a hot off peak summer afternoon following a library assignment
The best way I can describe this is to think of a wine pairing with a food that will make flavors pop
No getting free meals or making a scene because honestly the food was good and I don't like getting stared at as I explain the circumstances
But once you're inside it's almost charming and the food is really good I'd say
I ordered the Aaron's Choice which is hot corned beef and pastrami swiss cheese coleslaw and 1000 island dressing on an onion roll
Cherry Blossom Roll was beautiful and tasty
Prices also are good and actually cheap compared to other sushi places I've been to
I have had the chicken fingers which were tasty
99 with either their tasty onion rings or sweet potato fries with their Pineapple-serrano dipping sauce~Ahi Tuna and the grilled peanut butter and banana sandwiches~Thai Ahi Salad and Chicken Caesar Salad All of these are a flavor-fest your mouth and tummy will thank you for later ^ Don't forget to leave room for desert at The Coffee Shop or a tasty shank/malt
Everything at Joe's Farm Grill is is well prepared and they are consistent in delivering quality fresh tasting food
I don't think it's the healthiest food around but if you want a good breakfast this should definitely be on your list
The rice was alright but again that beef bouillon salty flavor
For Italian food that tastes good for about the same price Oregano's is wonderful
The service was good and the food was outstanding
We tried 3 different appetizers- the cheese borak AMAZING the hummus with meat DELICIOUS and the spinach pies good but not outstanding
The chicken and kafta were VERY flavorful the filet was good but not quite as great as the other 2 kebobs
It was over done and the quality of the fish was impressive as the color was straight from a salmofan and there was very little salmon flavor defiantly not a wild sakeye
The cold chicken is very tasty the tofu strips were a concession for my daughter and the pigs ear skin in Sichuan pepper oil were one of the things that my daughter was struggling with - but rather tasty
Next up was the cold deli mix which contained my favorite oil/pepper mix but instead of beef tendon my #1 choice or pigs ear eh my wife suggests that this is cow lung
Thankfully we had the lamb ribs dry rubbed with cumin which although was rather sparse in the available meat category the flavor was rather exceptional
If you want to eat Szechuan and the real Chinese pinyin spelling is Sichuan you have to- do as good as you can to suspend your beliefs on what is edible and be willing to try something out of ordinary to find the real live food tastes available here
- definitely do a plate from the cold deli counter and make sure you get something with the Sichuan peppery oil whether it's beef tendon or even just the cold chicken with the oil
We were pleasantly surprised at how good the food was here after coming for a late dinner
My partner had one of the flatbread pizzas and he found to be very good
Each dish has a subtle mixture of flavors that is complex and oh so delicious
Looked a bit cramped but I can handle that style of seating for good food
It was served with an ample portion of delicious meat and they were generous with the veggie toppings and yogurt sauce
All the food I've had is very good which is why I return over and over again
However the food and service is always excellent
I ordered the Salsicca and what used to seem like a high quality pizza no longer did
The sausage was some sort of ground meat like substance compared to what I remember being a high quality sliced sausage
My friend had a white pizza that she enjoyed though my observations about it were mostly the same as though it had gone downhill
Explored local joints Venezia's was one online and they looked good but Pizza Hut online won us over for the price and the 20% off coupon they give for your first online delivery order
Appetizers ordered bacon-wrapped scallops seafood dish with lobster and crab pieces and shrimp cocktail
Went with the family and it was a good time with good food
Other members of our party ordered the Italian the Porky pronounced as orgasmic the Shepherds Pie the Reuben good corned beef the Chicken Greek said to be very tasty and the Lamb Vindaloo usually very spicy but apparently toned down here for American palates
When mixed with the other ingredients it picked up it's sweetness from them and tended to tone down the overall sweetness of the dish - a wonderful idea of what would otherwise have been an overly sweet dessert
Overall this was a wonderful eating experience with several authentic dishes on the menu as well as some creative ones
BWW is good for wings bar food beer and the game
I am compelled to write this review not because of the food and drinks although those were good but rather due to the best server I have had in probably all my dining experiences
but the quality of meat makes the burger as mouth-wateringly delicious as a burger can be
The food is light and tasty yet simple without all of the fillers e
Drinks are good and service is excellent especially if you are ordering food
The Butterfish Tataki is so wonderful
However food this good gets my vote for another trip to Roka
The salad had a delicious citrusy/sesame tasting dressing that mixed well with the rice and chicken
After looking at the dessert menu I learned that the creme brulee is infused with a different flavor every day
I had the Ahi tuna which was good and my girlfriend had the swordfish which was great
I was disappointed with my burger but lucky for me my sister offered some of her fish and chips they were so delicious it inspired me to write this review
Our waters weren't refilled throughout our meal but we almost didn't notice because the food was so good
The pizza is really good but there is only a hair's difference between this pie and other great places around Phoenix
Next time I need a fix of good Greek / Eastern mediteranean food I will be back for sure
Terminal 4 is good overall with food choices and space but then you're probably flying Southwest which is lame so no matter what there's reason to be unhappy at Sky Harbor
Good food costs so stick to the fast food chains if you are looking for a $3
Totally unpretentious small very casual interestingly-named family-operated and offering good values on large portions of delicious food
We hadWatermelon juice with tapioca pearlsMilk Tea with tapioca pearlsFried Dumplings appetizerBeef noddle soup with Shaved NoodlesSea food noodle soup with hand pulled noodlesThe 'boba' drinks were excellent
The meat was devoid of flavor and overcooked
If you need a spicy-food fix i strongly recommend you do not try this place lest you want a visit to the doctor the very next day
The satay is also worth the money the chicken is excellent and the peanut sauce is just the right amount of sweetness
only thing is the food was not all that great which we were kinda bummed about because it did look very good
b/f tried the Mongolian beef and was not impressed at all
The pastor was very tasty and tender but the fresh pineapple chunks were a bit distracting the fruit was definitely not roasted with the meat as is typical for authentic pastor and a little caramelization was all it needed
It is a bit cheesy both in food and in sense of humor but the food portions are huge and taste pretty good
I always get the wedding soup which is delicious with meatballs and small bits of pasta in a chicken broth
But the bread was good and those of my party that will eat spicy food enjoyed the pepper's in oil
I had the chicken parmigiana which comes with a little spaghetti on the side and wasn't impressed by the sauce
But if you know what good pizza is supposed to look and taste like and you appreciate service that keeps your drink full the whole time stop by and order a pie
Pizza subs Mexican and a good half-dozen kind of hotdogs round out the bulk of the non-standard baseball menu
it is the most delicious well done foodie health food I have ever had
Again the stacked beef enchilada's were void of any flavor at all
Although the food presented well I mean it looked good but my goodness it was just terrible
The bland meat was simply browned in a skillet without any flavoring at all and then shoved on to a corn tortilla and then covered with what was supposed to be red chili sauce
I know this restaurant can make pretty good New Mexican food but something has changed at this store - either the manager is cutting corners by saving money on spices or she is just incompetent because this place is capable of better service and better food I just haven't seen it in a long time
We had finished off the oxtails when the eggplant dish arrived they were supposed to have come out together - it's a good thing we like to share
I love the Lobster hand roll and they have a great dynamite roll but I can't remember the nameIt has a small dining room and sushi bar and can get a little crowded on Friday nights but the quality and price make it worth any short wait
I've had a lot of items on there menu and I have enjoyed each and every dish
The food is good but for the price I think you should get a little bit more
I'll definitely be coming back for some more tasty food
And one of them got there Pizza before me not sure how that happen The pizza wasn't good at all to be honest but  $5
There was not one good thing about it The bread was nasty and hard there wasn't enough meat Not sure if it was the Cheese or the Meat but it was was very salty
Bistro 24 has really nice food with an excellent and interesting bread assortment
The chicken vegetable stir fry was delicious and tasty
My favorite is the Improv which is a turkey sandwich filled with cranberry sauce and herbed stuffing but I have also enjoyed their Reuben their roast beef sandwich called the Van Gogh and have ordered on numerous occasions a grilled cheese made to my specifications
The food is always consistently good and meals come with a cookie
I phoned in my order during a busy dinner time so it was a bit chaotic and the food took a longer than they had quoted me but it was worth the wait
I wasn't sure about a vegetarian pad thai without chicken/shrimp but neither was missed because the flavor was amazing
It was beautifully decorated but I really wish the food had been a lot hotter
I'm surprised that the Indians we saw there would actually stand for it - the Indians back in India had no problems with returning food if it wasn't piping hot
Today's features offered some lovely eggplant *purrs with happiness* and good vegetarian dishes as well
The spicy scallop hand roll was weak the rice overcooked and the seaweed wrap nori rubbery though the actual flavor of the scallop was good
Coles slaw spring roll potstickers stir fry veggies and a salad to go along with a decent amount of beef teryiaki  tender slices of beef with a good warm slightly sweet flavor
The hot double chocolate fudge coca-cola cake with vanilla bean ice is an absolute to die for dessert
I want to start saying that I'm new to Phoenix and I searched online and I decide to visit this place and my remarks about this place as the following Restaurant I have tried both beef and chicken shawarma; i didn't like the taste of their chicken shawarma so I wanted to try their beef shawarma; this is what I have to tell about their beef shawarma; They use the cheapest quality
ignored us until our cold food showed up and it wasn't even what we ordered
I know I am pretty optimistic with my reviews but I mean it this dish is delicious and weirdly refreshing
Spring rolls are large and tasty the fish sauce that came with it just spicy enough
Beef Noodle soup instead and it was excellent
The good Great service nice decor in the seating area very colorful n peppy place okay food
I found the food not too flavorful and more saucy than I have had at other mexican places
The food is straight-forward mid-west steakhouse and the meat is exceptional quality
The sandwiches lacked meat cheese ingredients and worst of all flavor
The price isn't too bad and the food is very delicious
I have had a few different pizzas and their pizza bread is amazing
If you like good pizza and great beer check out Fate Brewing Company
We ordered the scallops appetizer a salmon roll unagi roll sweet corn mushrooms BBQ crispy rice teriyaki chicken and black cod
The salmon roll was ridiculously good a nice piece of salmon atop the roll fresh and melting in your mouth
I remember a review I read where the reviewer was talking about the owner and how good his food is and somewhere he has a really good restaurant in him
The prices were reasonable and all the food fresh and delicious especially the pastries
Their food is good not the most amazing but they have big servings and the service is always good
The pizza at the buffet was like cardboard and so we complained that it was not worth our money
Service was good consistent with the fellow CBs I've been to across the country and food hit the spot
Definitely a good spot to go for dessert maybe after a first date
We ordered their beef tips which were delicious and also an order of their wings
The food was good everything was cooked okay but was not a fan of the bread in the basket- the taste was bit off
We started off with the wonderful lentil soup on the house no less and then went on to the spring rolls gone in 60 seconds
The bread was average the meat was pretty good and the Apple Cider Slaw turned it into an above average sandwich
Above average food along with a good beer selection and friendly service gives Big Earl's BBQ and above average rating of four stars
The biblical verses on the walls were a bit much for me but if that's what it takes to run a pleasant fast food restaurant then so be it - I'd definitely go back for frozen  custard - if you're a frozen dessert fan you'll be impressed
I went back because the food is good most times and the atmosphere is great but I have lost my patience now and not going back
I probably have had better pizza in town but it was still good and for the prices such a great deal
I also really enjoy their hot food and salad bars
they have a nice little seating area to enjoy your food and a good bakery with local ice cream sold there as well
Cabelas also has an amazing display of live fish and wildlife that is a sight to be seen
The sauce has a warm and sweet taste and the pulled Chicken looks to be all white meat and quite tasty
The pizza at Bianco is so good that I was ready to build a wood-fired oven in my backyard to try to replicate the pizza goodness
As if the food weren't good enough the actual restaurant and neighboring bar just have a great feel to them
I just tried the corn beef hash and it was very very delicious
Everything from appetizer to dessert was wonderful
So when I heard about True Food I got all kinds of ferklumped especially when a few coworkers told me about how delicious it was
I can have an amazing meal with the best food I've ever had but if it takes 20 minutes for a server to come and just take my drink order it's going to affect how much I enjoy said food
And who doesn't love some delicious fried chicken
The Kung Pao Chicken was delicious with a little kick to it
Good fresh food excellent service so I was pleasantly surprised
I always crave some quality food at late hours and Filberto's and McDonald's does NOT seem to cut it
Regardless of the amazing food the service is impeccable
The beef had no flavor lots of it but no flavor
I'm still a little surprised at how a Mexican food place like this could have little flavor
My friends family and I have been here many times and I have to say the food is really excellent and more importantly super authentic
I recommend the beef fried rice and whole fried fish
The flavor of the taco with just the pinto beans and veggies was pretty good but I was really looking for some meat
The dessert frybread was good but after a couple of bites it seems like a bit much
The food is damn good not the best ever but damn good so good in fact we go every Sunday as a group to eat there
Nothing is low cal just good filling food
So when you want good solid food go here you will be happy
They are also one of the only places that has Habanero Salsa that is hot but does not make you want to spit out your food
Definately cafeteria quality although you can buy the meatballs frozen downstairs
Having tried the hummus garlic was overpowering and stung the tastebuds the Caprese Salad too heavy on the balsamic The Gyro Pita meat was tender and juicy and the Sausage and Peppers sandwich very generous portion and handmade fennel sausage very flavorful and juicy I can't say that I would go out of my way to come here to eat
Presentation didn't blow me over but taste and quality of the food were wonderful
A go-to neighborhood fave Radio Milano had a pleasant environment amazing food and best-of-all -- neighborhood night on Mondays and Tuesdays
At the counter though I see one a menu which photographically depicts each dish
And the rice was excellent - simple and plain yet really tasty - and went well with the chicken
I live 5 minutes away from Ah-So and love having a good sushi place so close to home
I usually just sit at the bar and order sushi but the fish is fresh and the bartenders are friendly and give good service
The atmosphere is perfect for hanging out with friends over the deliciousness that is a yellow tail and scallion roll and a couple of cocktails after a long day at work
The sausage & bacon scramble is good as well as the chicken & avocado scramble
The service is consistently good here and food is out so quick which is prob why the wait times are low
I even heard some guys complaining the price and quality of food outside when I was walking toward my car
Meat was of good quality and was cooked appropriately
Meat had been a good cut but was dried out and a bit tough Again the sauce was just OK
Beef Ribs  Tasty  Large & Meaty Sauce was again
Both dishes were tasty and the only reasons I give this place 4 stars are because of the lemonade and the hired help
It was clean they got my order right however the food didn't taste as good as I remembered
The food itself was decent quality by buffet standards they have the basics seafood basic american cuisine like chicken nuggets pizza sushi and other asian cuisine like sweet N sour items orange chicken etc
If I were to give this business advice it would be to restructure their buffet line to help with people getting bogged down and to offer a bit more variety and up their food quality
Maybe it's the quality of meat but I really can't complain it was very reasonably priced
The pizza was also good and I would recommend it
hiro can't be beat for really good fresh reasonably priced sushi
Everyone tucked into the food and it was delicious
The food is good the staff is great and the beers are fantastic
He suggested a dish he said would be spicy but it was slightly mild but very flavorful
The summer rolls were very good and came with a delish house sauce
I can't explain how amazing the food was
Their garlic Naan is amazing The chicken Korma is possibly the best I have ever had among the many other delicious morsels
the only good things that i've had here are the chicken crepe and the cobb salad
I never am one to complain about decore or seating if you are giving me good food I will sit on a stump so the plastic chairs do not bother me
Miso soup = the same as everywhere else The Katana roll = dude this thing is freaking amazing but for 16 bucks I dont know soo good though
some beef wrapped in asparagus= soo bad I took it back Spicy Tuna was over minced like mush All in all the meal was good but for 70 bucks I left hungry and pissed The waiter was soo weird and creepy
I did go back a second time and had good food and a waitress with a name with like all syllables
If you're looking for a great family restaurant with excellent Chicago pizza look no further than Oregano's
Being a Chicago native I am always looking for good authentic Windy City pizza
Oregano's warm chocolate chip cookie dough served hot with vanilla bean ice cream and chocolate chips is one of the best desserts we've ever had
I have had mint salad at other middle eastern restaurants however this was not so amazing and should really be served as a side dish and not a meal especially being $9
Being a Persian it is difficult to find good Persian food in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area unless I am eating a home-cooked meal or at the nearby Persian Room
We had heard some of our family friends who are also Persian raving about this new almost fast food type of Persian food restaurant where you can get good and affordable Persian classics like ghormeh sabzi vegetable and meat stew  and khashke-badamjan eggplant side dish  so we decided to give it a try
But back to the review in my mind I go to a place to eat good food and this was not what I had in mind
really pretty good food helps that the price is right
The service is always great it is reasonably priced the food and wine are delicious and the ambiance is wonderful
I have not had any of the salads or pizzas but hear they are good as well
11-8-09 UpdateNow I can Attest that the Chicken Pesto and Cuban Pork sandwiches are also amazing
I ordered a chicken breast with a waffle and a side of mac and cheeseEverything arrived steaming hot even the syrup
My waffle had a scoop of butter that was twice the size of a golf ball The chicken was so crispy and flavorful not too spicy or salty but just right it wasn't even greasy
Ok knowing all that I went with the small chicken cheesesteak and this was a solid hot sandwich with the free addition of onions and sweet peppers
The entrees come out pretty fast and they were all very good thank god the food was good
All the dishes had some very nice presentations and all very tasty especially loved the scallops with the hint of almonds and citrus fruit grapefruit and orange the slightly bitter taste of the grapefruit was such a good complement to the rich scallops
We came out feeling very good about the food minus the bread but not so much about the restaurant itself
Also the next day warming up that pizza in the oven gave it that slight extra crunch that made it really good so I recommend you warm it in the oven if it isn't delivered bubbling hot
I'm certain if I keep coming back and they maintain this level of good food and service I'll update with a higher rating
All in all it was OK but in the future I'll go for good Sushi rather than OK
The nice thing about it was that you can order breakfast foods all day and it still tasted good
Food is delicious authentic and cheap
I highly recommend swinging by for a daily lunch special but the service and food are worth the trip around the clock
Anyways the food was fan-damn-tastic and worth the price
That said the beef sandwich was very good size the hot peppers and sweet peppers were very tasty and the flavor was great
Kids said the Cheese Pizza was cheeeeeesy not bad but the good cheesy
I love the hot plates and the butter and salt combined with such flavorful tender beef are incredible
Mint Thai is a bit of a whole-in-the-wall but the food is great at a good value
The food was very tasty and if you sign up for their text club when you sit down you will get a free order of edamame
I honestly find Panda Express the only better quality Chinese food around locally
It has the fish tank and handi-crafts for sale but the work force is Asian and the customers were mostly Asian and that's a really good sign
I think people are intimidated because it doesn't look like RA on the outside or other flashy type of Asian   places here in AZ -  If this place was in LA or SF or NYC I guarantee there would be a line out the door every hour - because of the good food at good prices
We will continue to eat here once a week because of how nice the family is that owns the place  the good prices and the good food
My recommendations for dimsum Everything - at the great prices it's worth trying everything - My recommendations for entree's if you're not into dimsum  - Fish with Chinese vegetables- West Lake Soup- Noodle Soup with Chicken and Fish- MaPo Tofu- Walnut Shrimp- Kung Pao Chicken
The food serving/ price is real good considering their small bowls of soup are huge
Even though the majority of our food wasn't very good we had a nice evening
The service was really great and the appetizer was great but the entrees and dessert weren't that great and then being made to feel like we were ripped off at the end
i know it is just mexican junk food but damn that fundido is good
for some reason there's a buy one get one free entree coupon in my valpak every single week - that makes my mexican junk food fix a pretty darn good value
The food wasn't very good overall it was maybe good in the bland 'bertos-esque way that some people seem to like
I'm not really a dessert girl but the little cup of cake was pretty wonderful
Let's start with the food pretty tasty though I could've done without the guacamole and sour cream on my carne asada fries
they were tasty and I was not too disappointed in letting you be my first Arizonian Mexican Food
Overall I enjoyed the food service and atmosphere here but they fell short of 4 stars for me
If I'm paying 12 bucks for a noodle dish it had better be excellent not just good
Since everything was cooked by the time we got around to eating it after trying to organize the platters and dishes on the table everything was cold
Most of the dishes were tasty but the soggy calamari with asian pesto dipping sauce was abominable
Everyone has been commenting on our amazing hardwood floors and praise God we no longer have to pay a carpet man for spilled juice or food
I tried the sliders and initially thought it was steak since the meat was very high quality
When in AZ we'll definitely plan to come back here mainly for the excellent service at all levels along with some of the best steakhouse-style food we've had
After just a few minutes my order is on the counter perfectly parceled with everything I could need; extra teriyaki sauce hot sauce sweet and sour and if we get a ginger chicken bowl another must try item there is also extra ginger sauce
59 +tax you have spent in a long time**For a nominal fee you can substitute white meat chicken and/or brown rice both of which I highly recommend
Every dish seems to have just a hint of extra spice or subtle flavor that elevates it above standard breakfast fare
Freshly made corned beef hash that has the look and texture of canned but with a phenomenally fresh taste and a smokey sweetness that is amazing
Crisp and fresh batter that has the texture and flavor of great fried chicken
Anyways the sandwiches are really good and all the meat cheeses and all the fixin's are really fresh and always plentiful on your sandwich
The chief was good and the food was good but was small portions compared to most Japanese steak houses I have been to
I can recommend the hot Roast Beef sandwich the Reuben the Meatball sandwich and the Sliders
In addition the California and the Mango Salmon Rolls were quite good as well
He was also the one who recommended the Thai Tuna Roll which adds even more points to his score if possible
It did leave me with a not-so-happy feeling when I left despite the fact that the food was just as good as the first go-around
* You will pay a chunk of change for your meal here but it will likely be worth it * You will also likely order something that they're out of mango salmon roll the first night grilled artichoke the second night and every night I've ever gone to a Hillstone for that matter* It's a chainBottom line is that Hillstone is probably one of the better options in this neck of the woods
The dishes are large so they're perfect to split if you come with a group and I recommend that you do just that
The food is delicious and the owner is extremely sweet
We've been coming there for years so on occasion he'll bring us an extra dish to sample like the amazing Walnut Shrimp
The food was edible and bland and flavorless
The only food we had was appetizers but the pretzel fondue is amazing
Bread and oil is good and so is the chicken pate
Either drop your prices to make it just a large bar food type menu - or dramatically increase the quality
How about stopping all of your investment and hard work on the Australian theme and going with a good food and comfortable atmosphere theme
I had a glass of Malbec with my Apricot BBQ feta chicken panini delicious and the thick potato wedges were awesome it hit the spot
I'm not a vegetarian but this food was really excellent
We love the food here 'cause it tasty and affordable
I went with a group of 4 and we had a couple of bottles of wine and a plain pizza as an appetizer to share
if you do have to wait sit at the bar or by the fireplace; you can't complain once you have a drink in hand and the scent of the fire mixed with hot food and good energy
PS - we have it from a good source that the burgers here are even better than the pizza
The service is fantastic food is amazing and I even kind of  like those weird smelly hippies they hire to play guitar on the loft
But the chili chicken noodle soup and milk shakes are amazing too
I mean I'm usually full to bursting after an eating adventure but I would like to be able to tell you how good his chicken pita a special was
But the beef was falling off the bone and very good
Cuz straight up the food wasn't THAT good to where I'd look over all their flaws and go anyway
Also when you are building your meal the red meats will be more flavorful and you will most certainly need to add more flavorings than the amounts listed on their ingredient list
Overall a fantastic place to go catch up with friends and enjoy some wonderful food
This is authentic Italian food and it is good
I would not recommend this place for New Year's dinner since it is a special menu they make up and one dish costs $50
But it was good diner food and just what I wanted
My friend had their Chicken Pasta Salad and as usual it was delicious
We had the honey hot great flavor good size a lot of meat  we will definitely order those again
The amount of sauce meat etc was perfect and the dough was amazing
I highly recommend trying out Upper Crust it's a nice local joint with good service great food and reasonable prices
The salt level could be taken down a notch but other than that this food is AMAZING
After going to Vegas and trying vegan food at restaurants here Green is still winning as far as value and quality goes
I felt so excited when I saw the pizzas they were making and how everyone was pulling steaming cheesy goodness from their lips
There's nothing that says good pizza better than 1970's Cher and her nude chest
The food the other patrons ordered looked and smelled amazing
This could easily be upgraded to a 4+ star if the food tastes as good as it smells
The guys delivering the food remind me of California SoCal boys they are good looking and they seem nice and attentive
Fresh spring rolls are also a good try
The food looked as amazing as the scenic view and tasted as good as it looked
They do have a lot of items on their menu that sound great but I feel like the quality of the food is very hit or miss
The bartenders can definitely mix up some good cocktails and they have a great patio but the sushi they serve at Happy Hour is awful - not well prepared and tastes like it has been sitting out for a while
Besides having great customer service their food is good too
I love their beef chimichaunga and it's delicious every time
I know in downtown Phoenix they have their Food Truck Court Wednesdays which I've been to a few times but to have to pay for the privilege to eat at a food truck and wait in line like this not a good experience
The chicken wings shrimp spring rolls and Chinese broccoli were particularly good
The rest of my table thoroughly enjoyed their dishes as well - especially the baked pasta speciality which my husband said he will get without meat next time because you don't need it
The summer rolls are good but could be improved if they didn't put so much shredded iceberg lettuce inside
The pizza was good but we stayed until after happy hour was over and my friend ordered a slice of pizza
Overall a bit pricier than what I like for a pizza joint but I would consider getting just the pizza to go since the dough was good
The ambience was great the people were great the bar keeps are super cool the wait staff is very friendly and on par and the food was really really good
As consistently good as the food is the service is likewise consistently slow albeit friendly
So I'm thinking the food & bakery items  will have to be really good to want to come back
On the positive side the band Rock and Roll Memories was very good
Despite the poor food we had a good time and will return for the entertainment but doubt we'll order dinner again
It was really good and the pitas looked incredible loaded with tons of meat
You just don't get food this good every day
The cashiers at Whole Foods were friendly and helpful - I was impressed
I had enjoyed the following less 475 calories dishesMussels - nice red sauce and cooked perfectlyFlat bread  I had both the Reuben and Chipolte shrimp with crushed pineapple WOWCab Chicken - nice healthy great flavor came with golden beets which I have not had before very pleasant surprisePeanut butter and Chocolate mini dessert and Red Velvet Cake miniThe FlatBread I have to say is hands down the best alternative to pizza I will never fill guilty again
The brisket was good but the pulled bar-b-q chicken was out of this world
Well I want free wifi I want a place to sit and eat good food I want all of the latest bestsellers the classics and maybe listen in on an ongoing presentation toward the back of the store
This place does not disappoint; from the friendly and professional service classy yet laid back ambiance and the more than amazing food
I can not wait to try more of the delicious food
The food was pretty good and the happy hour prices made it worthwhile
My friend ordered quinoa pasta with meatballs and enjoyed it
Lettuce was chopped nicely and the beef strips layered on to were tender and tasty
They accommodated our request for a table for the occasion waitstaff were efficient and the food was excellent
Unfortunately the various pizzas I tried were salty & not very good
where the pizza isn't very good either but they earn 4-Stars from Yelpies anyway with their super friendly & appreciative staff plus so much other good food out that you don't have to think much of the pizza to love the place anyway
As a fairly new connoisseur of Greek food this place is pretty good
Lousy fairly expensive food but pretty good service
The food is good and relatively inexpensive
The food & ambience turned a pouting 12yr old into a happy kid again and I think that's about the most amazing thing you can say about food
SummaryFood Incredible Oatmeal cookies/Good Black Bean Soup/ Blah salads and onion soupBeverage Selection Caffeine Free Diet Coke great
Pork is supposed to be good because you have good quality meat and do a good job cooking it not because you slopped on too much sugary sauce
The food is flavorful and delicious and always leaves me too full for dessert
I believe there is food here but I come here pretty late at night so don't have the pleasure to recommend anything
So far I have received decent service and delicious food
The two words I would use to describe the food at True Food Kitchen would be FRESH and FLAVORFUL
I probably will never be able to enjoy a vegetable from Safeway again after the amazing produce from True Food
The beef wasn't terribly flavorful in my opinion
I tried the chicken salad for dinner and it was tasty and just then right size
Lots of variety with different proteins and many stir fried pans most dishes had decent flavor but many had too much oil
If you're in need of something with a lot of spice it may be worth asking to have the food made to be extra spicy or just try somewhere else
We hoped the food would be just as good as a restaurant that has also been around for many years in our Colorado hometown where they serve fabulous shrimp chicken and french fries
I have to say that although there were many happy people eating here and the staff was incredibly friendly we didn't think the food was good at all
Lemongrass soy beef noodles papaya salad hotpot stuffed tomatoes
The imperial rolls were amazing for not having any meat in it
The food was still reasonably priced authentic tasty and in a nice relaxed atmosphere
Everything from the appetizers salads pasta dishes pizza and desserts are first rate
Alberto likes to share stories with customers and is very entertainingDon't be fooled by the casual setting this is Italian food at its best and is as good as it gets
The pizza & wings are amazing as well as the club sandwich
If you are looking for good food & good brewskies you gotta try this place
I have to hand it to Filiberto's they do make some pretty tasty food at a really good price
Anyways foods as good as it is at other locations and Im quite full after eating what I could and putting the rest in the fridge for later
Winners were the roasted chicken and the pot roast sandwhich fantastic we will be back for the pot roast sandwichDessert we had 2 they were tasty but nothing special and we left a few bites on the table since I make a rule to never ever leave a desset behind this either spoke to how full I was or the lack-luster nature of the dessert I havent decided which
Ok so this place has amazing service even better food a great wine and beer selection and has a perfect ambiance
We then attempted to order an appetizer only to be told that they were out of a key ingredient for that dish as well
The quality of Bianco's pizza did not justify our investment of time
If I wait 3 hours for food it should be amazing
They need to have a football menu and another beef is that 3/4 of their appetizers are more expensive than some entrees and sandwiches
The spices and sauces for the dishes are unique and very flavorful
I'm willing to give it that excuse because both the service and the food were quite good
The tilapia was a good dish and pretty much cooked to perfection
Oh the food I started with miso soup and edamame both hard to mess up they were good
There were some other dishes that sounded great--the pork belly sliders and lamb ribs sounded especially worth trying--and none was more than $10 or so which is pretty reasonable as far as small plates go
I ordered a dish called A taste of Greece or something like that which had samplings of Greek staples like dolmades and some *really* good lamb that was cooked perfectly without me even mentioning anything about medium rareness or temperature
If you are looking for a nice but family friendly restaurant where you can take your time and enjoy a good meal of great Italian food look no further
The MOST DELICIOUS AHI TUNA SANDWICH everrrr the food was soo delicious and I couldnt stop saying/thinking it the entire time I was eating
i feel like ordering the sandwich and just eating the fish would be well worth it as well
The Fish Amok was delicious after the fact I was told I shouldn't eat Vietnamese talapia due to high levels of mercury
The meatloaf sandwich was very tasty - it reminded me of a Bahn Mi sandwich from Lee Lee's - and for only $5 you can't beat that
The Katheaw Cha - a stir fry noodle dish was just okay because the noddles were greasy but the beef & shrimp were tasty
I wondered whether the dish was good because of the memories or because it was just legitimately good
Meat was dark so it was juicy and flavorful but was also supposed to be spicy and was not
I wholeheartedly recommend this place if you want the takeout variety of Chinese food
I recommend Nee House more so overall but for tasty stick-to-your-ribs let's-get-Chinese-and-watch-a-movie Chinese food Dragon Palace is hard to beat
It varies from location to location but it usually consists of a california roll 8 pieces 6 pieces of nigiri squid salad and some other goodies
I have taken so many people here and the response has been unanimous cool atmosphere and AMAZING food
I've heard other desserts like the Banana Chocolate Tart is quite delicious so don't let this one thing deter you from coming here
We've purchased and enjoyed fish from this company a handful of times
but it is some of the best quality fish I've had - and I admit we're not the best cooks but we haven't even screwed this fish up
I ordered the Chicken Pesto Sandwich which was good but a little hard to eat being so big and the Tuna Sandwich both $12 for myself and the Bf
Also got the seafood chipotle soup which was interesting and tasty
I guess it makes me feel good to see fast food actually taking its time cooking
In Zen 32's defense they do have+ A great location+ Very fresh fish+ Low carb rolls+ Possibly the best tuna in town+ Creative and tasty specialty rolls+ Good sushi selection+ Neat little complimentary sunomo type appetizer+  A really good drink menu yummy plum wine
Ever- About 2 really good waitresses and about 10 clueless waitresses - Wait staff has no idea what is in the specialty rolls- Long wait for food- Confusing happy hour rules- Tables really close together- Disappointing desserts- Disappointing appetizersSo basically you have to do the math and see if the +'s outweigh the -'s
The beef was served with crab meat not a fan equadorian potato delicious
Plus the sizes of food are definitely moneys worth
Go for the food -- it is worth every penny
I'm not a fan of crawfish but my friends always rave about it so I gave it a shot
The crab cake was delicious - kudos to them for not skimping on the meat
Serious comfort food menu and I've gotta say this weirds me out in such hot climates
We received our food in good time Ill give them that
The atmospehere and food here are amazing
Maybe this review is a little unfair since I am from the San francisco bay area where Vietnamese food is authentic amazing fresh and dirt cheap but I can't help it
The salad was good but would have preferred some fresh cucumbers lettuce and picked radish to dip into my fish sauce
They deliver quickly and the food is always delicious
I'd recommend getting the combo platter that comes with fried rice and an egg roll I substitute and get a spring roll in its place - they're really good
She answered all of our questions about the dishes and made some wonderful suggestions
I gotChicken Chow Fun - Delicious and love the wok breathe or air when you open the containerCreamy Chicken Corn Soup - Huge portion but the soup seemed bland
i might toy with the idea of maybe giving this place another shot and trying one of the pizza's or pastas
The food was tasty and even impressed my boyfriend the chef
Unfortunately I forgot the name of the tomato basil wrap dish I ordered and while it was healthy delicious tomato basil wrap egg white cheese spinach and smoked turkey
Excellent pizza but make sure you get a whole pizza
Its a good place that is semi close to downtown if you need to get your sushi kick for lunch
All the food is amazing and everything is all you can eat
I must admit my dish was delicious but a little over priced for a sloppy joe even if it was made with turkey
Everyone else's dishes looked just as delicious but however their desserts looked to die for
My expectations was a very spicy and tasty dish
The food was always good and the menu choices were different
39 with tax no tipThe food for the most part was good
A little more flavor but not nearly the size nor quality of fresh shellfish I had along the waterfront in the Fishing Village below the town of Sorrento
A little secret The owner loves good quality beef hence the burger and the carne/steak are AWESOME
Something good for folks who may not be int he mood for traditional mexican food but are going with a group
Ruth's Chris for example along with the bitter taste of the non-deserved 200$ bill you get sub-par food with excellent service like that actually makes up for it
The salad had a really nice presentation a good amount of dressing and the fish was just melted into my mouth
The salads are all good the pizza a bit more hit or miss but they do make a really good grilled cheese and if there is tomato soup that day all the better
The human sense of smell and taste are among our strongest senses often triggering long forgotten memories and able to cause acute cravings for tasty foods
Both of the cobblers I tried made me think of my my Grandmother's kitchen when peaches or apples were in season making delicious cobblers from scratch for this reason alone The Original Cobbler Factory would get my recommendation but these well made desserts stand out on their own merits and deserve a place on the table
WBC's added a few new sandwiches and one hot option jumped at me and its name was Braised Beef $7
We tried four of them; my favorites in order were The Banana Chocolate Tart very rich must share the Apple-Cranberry Crumble the maple ice cream really makes the dish the Lemon-Ginger Frozen Yogurt sweet tart and cold and the Lemon Olive Oil Cake very light fluffy and delicious
The menu could probably use an upgrade ingredients seemed good inspiration was lacking so the food is up to par with the ambiance
Pros Great Pizza Cheap Beer Waitresses that don't stank great appetizers decent prices perfect ora Great UFC bar you can even bring your mom and dad here Cons I'm not there with a cold draft in my handThe S
Bro's pizza combo was legit heck everything we had tasted good and was hot
I had a chicken with artichokes which was really good while my spouse had Veal Marsala which she enjoyed
but is it really good date food to chew on crispy crunchy bread loaded with crap that falls off all over the place
Enjoyed the food and liked the fact that there are smaller sharing plates
The Cheeks & Beans had really tender beef cheek meat and the Burrata Bonanza with avocado arugula radish fried shallots was good as well
However the food even if it had been the correct order isn't worth the price
Being a meat lover myself I should've known that the meat lover's pizza was particularly more tasteful and better than mine but mine was still good
This wonderful crust paired with the meat lover's pizza was sooo- good
Another tasty rendition of Pho was the Chicken Pho and it tasted great as well
Shrimp Spring Rolls were excellent and a bargain v/s the others
But it is not a lot of food to fill you up so I recommend getting it half price during happy hour
The only reason it gets 3 stars is I never seem to crave ZTejas; it is simply my go to place at the mall that has good food and a great happy hour
On a Friday night a hostess/server greeted us after a good 5 minutes of waiting by the door and asked us if we would be ordering food since the kitchen was backed up
Let me tell you too I can eat food at really hot so I imagine a lot of other people ended up getting food that was well done and well done steak don't get me started on well done steak it should only be eaten by immunosuppressed people
The meat was high quality I think but how could I know it was cooked to oblivion
Good upscale mexican fast food if that makes any sense
The food is very good not uber great but higher quality and delicious
Just had the Mediterranean that was served hot and just melted into ecstacy as my meaty jaw sank into that great fusion of olive feta and chicken with that delicious dressing
We got the assorted marinated meat combo appetizer which tasted awesome IN my soup
All of the meats and some veggies are marinated so everything you order is full of flavor
The food is fresh-fresh-fresh and delicious
}The chicken portion was generous the dressing was light and flavorful plentiful mixed greens not crappy iceberg but $8
their sweet&sour shrimp/chicken/pork are all amazing
one is served with their egg rolls *which ARE so good but sorry dragon palace are still #1 by a longshot* and the other is served with their sweet&sour dishes which is thicker and richer in red color
Top Shelf has had consistently good mexican food for the last 30+ years and we always enjoy going there
In terms of food I got a huge Chicken Chimi which as although good gave me terrible heartburn which I still have faint traces of
The service has always been good and the food fresh
The dishes always come out piping hot; from pan to plate and out to the table
They have everything from your mass-brewed American lagers/pilsners PBR Bud Coors Miller etc and a good selection for the beer geek/snob Sierra Nevada Stone Dogfish Head etc
The food was very good we had a cheese pizza with sun-dried tomatoes basil oil tasty
This restaurant is really good and I'll go back many times this night didn't do the food justice but everything else was awesome
Now to the food which is just as amazing
They've got decent fish and chips although they don't hold a candle to George and Dragon and the other stuff's good too
They also have free UFC fights so if you're into those types of things it might be worth a trip to not pay for it at another bar with equal amounts of average bar drinks/food
This tasty dish includes eggs cheese green chiles & some other stuff
So I asked whats good here Wendy she said fried chicken so I got it it came with choice of salad or soap and a side dish
The cook came from the back to say hi and tell us what's good everything- I don't think he was lying the guy in front was excited to tell us about the family that owned the place and the type of food they serve
The tandoori chicken was good but the portion was skimpy and there was more bone than meat
I can see that this place would be a good family restaurant but I also didn't think the prices were all that great in relation to the quality of the food
The desserts are pretty good though and the staff is friendly I just won't be going back unless it's with my grandma
I'm not sure if there was no flavor to my dish or if it was so spicy I couldn't taste the flavor
We followed up by ordering the Mini Chicken Tostadas and the Pork Belly Pibil as our appetizer
I don't come here for the greasy bready pizza and flavorless old-people pasta - although the lemon cream and caper pasta is so delicious I want to fill a swimming pool with it and
From Crispy Spicy Tuna have to order it every time to the drinks love the Geisha a-go-go; the sushi is good the happy hour is great; have had everything to eat on the happy hour menu
and the dessert ohh my god it was so good
Taste was more like the usual pizzas you could get at the usual lower quality pizza chains so I didn't feel like it was worth the money I was shelling out for this versus other fast food places
Everything from the beautiful decor to the warm personal service and of course the delicious food made this my new favorite steak house in the Scottsdale area
The drinks were pretty weak but the food was pretty good and the atmosphere is fun
Always great service and excellent food
Not too impressed wit the menu or with the rest of the food than we ordered
Aside from the service which was great I have to say that I was really not impressed with Mido Sushi
If I had to give this place a ranking on the list of all the sushi establishments I've visited it would definitely fall towards the bottom of my list for taste and quality
99 and many of the reviews on here stating that quality did not suffer as a result of endless rolls
Now that I've been here I will say that the all-you-can-eat sushi option would be great if you were looking for quantity rather than quality
Since my eyes are usually bigger than my stomach and I prefer higher quality sushi than I had here I'll probably find a better option in the area next time
I don't think what anyone had was the best Mexican we have had but we were happy with our food and especially loved their creative deserts and delicious Mexican coffee
We recommend to the owner that some grated horseradish we be the perfect finishing touch instead of the bland creamy horseradish sauce with which it was served and the fresh stuff was delivered to our table moments later
Next we ordered a pizza my husband had done his homework and read the reviews so we decided to try the Di Notte - fontina pecorino gorgonzola mozzarella and spicy salame thin crust good texture flavors were different we ate it all
Good atmosphere great food friendly service
The veal shank is drop off the bone excellent the  hef's special seafood was fresh and absolutely divine
From the name chicken nachitos you would expect a little appetizer on a saucer with little bites of chicken and a spoonful of guac and chips but instead you get a huge platter filled with slow roasted shredded chicken gallops of cheese heaps of guac and some slices of jalepeno peppers
I ordered the Chicken Pesto Flatbread Pizza it was large enough for two but I was able to eat half there and the other half in my car back to work Yup it was that dang good
The seasoning on the chicken is amazing and the contrast with that and the sweet syrup on the waffles will be something you will crave after you eat here even one time
The heat cannot mask the flavor of this dish
I had an hour to spare so I was willing to wait for hot food
Nothing too fancy but very clean and tasty food for a buffet
Sushi wasn't bad but they do use cheap Imitation crab meat but the fish on it is actually good
I always order Rainbow and caterpillar roll both are tasty
Had spicy tendon water boiled fish soup dumplings rice cake awesome pork belly with pickled vegetable and some green veggie dish that I'm not sure what it was but very tasty
*Some of the veggies in my curry were undercooked think aldente potatoAll in all the flavor of the food was good but 1 cup of rice and 1
Both times the food was good and the portions are generous
I enjoyed the lettuce wraps Swiss Chard I learned is not a cheese but rather a type of lettuce leaf and the coconut chicken and the ginger sauce it comes with are great
The prices were ridiculously cheap food was hot and tasty
So we're in town on business and need a good Japanese food fix
Also had a chicken entree that had fried plantains and beans and rice that was quite good but too big to finish
The other dishes were pretty good samosas were ok their curry is tasty and the food isn't that spicy
and the banchan was for the most part quite enjoyable - tasty seaweed both dry and wet apple salad radish/cucumber kimchi
the service was fantastic the food tasted wonderful it was rather affordable
Yes you're enjoying wholesome local food which is both more delicious and better for you
For someone such as myself who really does not like fish i enjoyed this experience and I'm glad i got to have it
it was amazingly spicy and flavorful- the meat was lean and the portions were plenty
Their food is delicious and they have a huge menu
Simply the food was not good and you are over priced
The pizzas all tasted really good but I would not come here again because of the prices of the food here which is the only reason for the two star review
The margherita pizza was completely devoid of flavor
Most of the tacos are tasty but I have had better fish tacos
The torta and half chicken asado is wonderful and they have tasty strong margaritas
When we finally got our food it was darn good though
*  The veggie burger had quite a bit of flavor and was well worth giving up the beef for the night
I ordered the Sunkissed Roll and it was pretty good
The food is excellent and taste delicious
The food can be very-good or average-good and the menu changes frequently
I wouldn't say it's the best Indian food I've ever had but it's close by and very convenient for me to get to and has some good options
I like to get their tandoori chicken pretty good - not the best I've ever had but still if I want tandoori chicken I don't have too far to go
Still worth going to on the ocassion I am craving Indian food
The bread was cold and there was barely any meat in the sub
In addition to the lack of good food the dinning area was a MESS
Service is good the girls liked to flirt with my male friends which 'Hey it will make the boys tip well and passing out free samples does help sell the food
We both enjoyed the sushi and found some rolls better then others
The food was very good and although I can't compare with a home cooked version of the food I did enjoy what I ate and its also a bake shop which allowed me to try the ube cake which its now my favorite cake
I've never ordered online so I don't know any of the issues that people are having but if you want a good NY style pizza in the valley Mamma Mia's hits the mark
YesPrime rib no casino buffet should be without it plus you get an offering of creamy horseradish or the plainer intense oneCheese selections snob appeal to have a cheese course after my main and prior to dessertBerries & creme anglaise on puff pastry this was soooo good I sat here an extra 15 min relishing this with coffee14 flavors of gelato/sorbet go ahead that really nice counter lady will kindly scoop several mini tastes into a platter for you
But weak drinks bad food and poor service are not a good combination
Two of us ordered fish tacos which were very tasty but 4 of the six tacos across the two plates served were extremely undercooked
Had the tacos been served correctly the first time the taste and quality of the food would have tipped this over to a 3 star review
The food was really very good but difficult to enjoy when the overall meal was so poorly managed
I order hot and the food is bland and lacking any sort of spice
Very good food not up to par with some other Japanese spots we love in other cities but still very good
Not sure if we'll go back which is too bad since the food was very good
Now for the food I ordered the vegetarian tacos which were so good The vegetables were not your basic veggies they gave me carrots spaghetti squash ear tree mushrooms bok choy and parsnip
My husband had the short rib tacos the meat was so tender and flavorful
We passed on dessert only because we had eaten gelato at The Gelato Spot in Old Town Scottsdale which by the way was amazing
I had the chicken skewers and we got the bruschetta quattro for appetizers
I don't know maybe this is to be expected from a place that seems to go more for appeal rather than food quality
2 Spinato's Pizza is a great Chicago style pizza joint that delivers to the hotel
After dinner I can get a dessert I feel good about while my SO can go to Haagen-Daaz and suck down two giant scoops of ice cream while he complains that his boobs are getting bigger
Fish and chips were good albeit one of the pieces of fish still had the blood line in it
I can go to the location out in Prescott and enjoy the same friendly service and amazing food that they offer at this awesome location I chose this one because its closer to me
1 thing I found odd was that at no time did the server ask any of us how the food was even though I clearly had not eaten any of mine and nor had my wife chicken lettuce wraps they were'nt bad just not good
We wanted something good to eat and fast food was not going to cut it
Everything is really good here except for the eggrolls which are only mildly disappointing
The chicken in Black bean sauce from this place is bordering on sublime and they do a really good job with fresh live seafood vegetarian dishes and various types of Chinese barbecue like Char-Su and Spare-ribs
I ordered a bagel and wished I had just gone to TJ and picked up some wild Alaskan lox organic eggs organic bread organic butter and I would have gotten it all for the price of their lox & eggs breakfast plate with plenty of quality food stuffs for 4 other meals
=my cuz and step brother were not a fan of the gravy but I enjoyed it I couldn't stop tearing my food up
Have yet to try the pizza but heard it is really good and I will do so on my next visit to Scottsdale
Do people realize they are paying like 7 bucks for an appetizer and like 6 bucks for a dessert they could get a LOT more for their money at an independent real restaurant
Good food although the hot stuff especially the beef wrapped asparagus things were better than anything raw
The service is outstanding and the seafood is excellent I've had the sea bass scallops salmon ahi and filet but if you were eating the same food anywhere else I don't think it would stand out relative to the exhorbitant prices
Their refried beans are very good the best you'll get from a fast food restaurant
The crab puff and spring roll appetizers were greasy and probably from Costco
For dinner we ordered curry with hot spice drunken noodles with hot spice pad Thai with medium spice and chicken and broccoli with medium spice
After he brought it out when we were done with the meal it was basically the same dish as the drunken noodles and chicken broccoli but it was in a bowl of hot water
the jerk chicken was pretty tasty but could have used some hot sauce and a good kick
Every one else enjoyed the food although it wasn't warm and small portions
My wife is Korean so having a good Asian food market definitely helped to ease the transition from her going from Korea to Phoenix
We mostly shop on base for the meats and some other items but this Asian market shines when you're trying to find Korean ram-en noodles and an assortment of oils kim curry and some other items that you don't typically see in US grocery stores and although we don't usually buy it their meat selection has been good the times that we've been there
Pros Good place to WATCH sports lots of TVs           Friendly serversCons Food and beer
5 starsservice 5 starscheese plate 3-4 starshanger steak 3 starsspecial grouper almost 5 starsspecial of the day gnocchi about 2 starsdessert 4-5 starsThe Cheese plate was a  small mound of house made ricotta good and very drained a small mound of goat cheese and a chunk of cheddar and another one that was more tasty than the cheddar served with a large amount of crust slices
Special Catch was Grouper it was seasoned and cooked perfect with some greens and tiny thin multi color carrots on a buttery mild red wine saucethis dish was delicious
Quality could be better but when you meet the woman who delivers the food you'll know that it is pretty darn authentic
Definitely give them a try the prices are great the food is tasty the portions are huge and the value is high
4 stars because the quality of the food is not top notch but other than that everything is fantastic
A nice find by my friend as we were here for spring training and we all were in the mood for good Italian food
Also the food they offer is neat from pizza to white castle burgers fries and popcorn with a selection of self-serve flavor powders
You order your food inside but your hot dog is made outside right in front of the restaurant
Only the hot dogs are made outside though the rest of the food is made inside
The food is out of this world delicious the staff congenial and the owners who are often on board for the evening shift truly care about their guests
Though the menu could be seen as comparatively small it's quite impossible to go wrong and there's always a good assortment of meat poultry and seafood all cooked to perfection and plated up with delicious beauty to suit the various tastes of any friends and family you may care to wow with the wonder that is Cafu00e9 Bink
$30-$40 for an appetizer entru00e9e and dessert
We had been running into a soggy crusty low taste and quality issues on a repetitive basis that we really needed to give it time to figure pizza out
It was really good and the best pizza we had had in Arizona in quite some time
We waited 20 minutes for this excellent pizza
I tried the new Chicken parmesan flatbread which was very tasty
The food is hot and reminds me of that California beach-style mexican that you can get in San Diego
Wise Guy - No tomato sauce on this note that half of the pizzas on the menu do not have tomato sauce but the onions mozzarella and sausage were amazing as well just bursting with flavor
The food lacked flavor the green chili sauce tasted like they opened a can and poured it on top
My husband commented on how he preferred Blue Nile to Lalibella because at Lalibella a comparable dish would have sides that kind of run together in flavor and texture
They both seem to have their pros and cons which don't necessarily have to do with the food's flavor but more so personal preferences on texture price Blue Nile is a bit pricier than Lalibella and types of offerings Blue Nile seems to have a more extensive menu than Lalibella
I might have given four stars if I tried a dinner because the dinners at their sister restaurant Saigon Kitchen are pretty good and I know they use sushi grade salmon in their reasonably priced dinner
This is a small upscale grocery store with a small but quality selection of food and beverages as well as other household items
They have a good size deli area offering meats and cheese as well as pizza and other items
Although the flavor is second to none the beef fails  completely in juiciness and flavor
The pizza came out very quickly which made me wonder to begin with but the damn things were still somewhat cold
Unfortunately the food is good but not great
50 each additional topping which was quite good and I'm a pizza snob
The acoustics aren't the best and it can get pretty loud but my friend and I had the time and space to have a long leisurely conversation over some delicious food
I had the beef carpaccio and the risotto with artichokes off the happy hour menu and both were excellent
The menu is pretty standard for the type of food that it is but I personally find that most of the items are cooked with much more flavor than at some asian places
What Delux fails to copy however is the quality of the food and the high-end nature of the original
What is surprising about this brewery is their food is really excellent too
The pizzas were good but not what i expected when i hear thin crust
Bianco still tops the charts on pizza but for the lack of wait and quality of food ambiance and service i would definately recommend Cibo
It can be so hard to find delicious authentic Mexican Food
My family is always running around from sporting events to girls scouts to school activites but we still love good mexican food at a good price where we can get in and out quickly
I highly recommend the chicken meal we had
The impression I have of Jamaican food is that it has really strong flavors but I found the food here to be a little bland
Tiny little I guess that's redundant bar and grill that seems to have a regular following and serves simple yet tasty food at a decent price
The mozzarella was fresh the tomato sauce on the Margarita was tangy and smooth and the Chicken on the Pesto Pizza was moist and delicious
Good but not great food great desserts great atmosphere great for medium sized groups of friends who want to have a night out to catch up with each other's lives
We always wanted to go this place due to the fact that many other Hong Kong Chinese restaurants are really good and it seem like it was like a great authentic Chinese food place to go to
And last we ordered Seafood Chow fun it was slimy and seafood was chewy uncooked and no flavor what so ever
Overall the food is goodand I LOVE spicy Thai but when they ask you how spicy you want your food they are WAY OFF on their number system
Our meals were also amazing but we were going to skip dessert since we were so full
The orange chicken is wonderful lightly battered and deep fried with a flavorful sauce
A friend recommended Spinato's and we were in the mood for pizza so we went the day we got the recommendation
There are a number of good pizzas to be had in Chandler--probably the most well-represented category of above-average restaurant choices in our city--- in my opinion Spinato's can hold it's own among them
I will search for a Mexican rest that wants my business has quality food and charges more reasonably
The pizza was excellent and that is not easy to do with gluten free
The coffee is impeccable and the food is delicious
While I'm still sad that they took my favorite item off the menu the food was excellent
I cannot speak for Schlotzky's food though it smelled good but the Carvel's Ice Cream was fantastic
The food is great the service is good and the brownies are to die for
You won't find anything fancy here- the food is simple wholesome and tasty
The Food A very sparse menu I had the carne pizza which had GREAT thin crust but lacked much flavor
You won't have the heart to inform your mother that after tasting McGrath's bowl of deliciousness any pork dish she's ever prepared seems dry and flavorless
Another A+  Hats off to a great burger spot that has an incredible variety of good foods and quality ingredients
The fried chicken ribs and carnitas are all wonderful
When the food was brought out the orders were correct the temperature was excellent and it didn't take long to serve everyone
I had the blackened chicken pasta and it was a good sized portion good flavor and an all around descent meal for the price
We had a delicious and very reasonably priced wine Primitivo and three starters  to share the deviled eggs with caviar Swedish meatballs and the ahi tuna carpaccio
The deviled eggs and meatballs were tasty but the ahi tuna was out of this world
I liked the place and the food was good but it lacked personality and sometimes took quite a while
One dude truly spent 45 minutes explaining why Denny's was good food
Neither had ever heard of Pallatte pause sigh thank you Ed McHale but they were positive their cisco food was worthy of praise
We ordered the hard tacos  w/ shredded beef and that was excellent
We may give El Rico's a try again someday since they do have good shredded beef tacos
Give it a try food is good and service is fast
I had the Chicken Mint salad and it was a wonderful balance of flavors spice and heat highlighted by mint
Undaring dishes with expected flavors delivered witha reasonable price
Our food was excellent the service was exemplary and the entire experience made us feel like royalty
The sandwiches are piled with quality deli meats and cheeses and the 'gourmet list' included a choice of macaroni salad chips or potato salad all for $5
It consisted of an appetizer main course and dessert
But stuff does come around multiple times so next time I think I'll pace myself a bit more They pretty much offer standard sushi rolls nigiri pieces and Japanese appetizers
For those prices you get slightly smaller appetizers and the rolls have four pieces but it's still an amazing deal
I've been back once after this and the service and food was very good
All the food we had stuffed cabbage goulash and noodles and pierogies and sausage was excellent
There are a number of tasty food options here including their delicious sweet potato fries and the genius barbecue chicken nachos
You can go and wait hours at those hip pizzarias that cater to the $$$ but if you just want a great place to chill have a beer or a glass of vino and amazing pizza
The pizza which is sold by the HUGE slice is simply acceptable - not special not delectable not even excellent
it looked good when it came to the table but as soon as I took a bite I was very dissapointed we got 2 small pizzas first was a pizza with red sauce cheese and shrooms and the second was a white margherita pizza the red sauce has absolutely no flavor to it I mean NO flavor it tasted like water seriously
the white pizza was the better place of the two but still wasnt worth what we paid
My friend and I ordered the drunken noodles since everyone bragged about it tom yum hot pot and a beef salad
The Tom yum soup was flavorful maybe cause I like my food spicy and sour
As for the beef salad it was fresh but the meat could use a bit more flavor
We have been to this location several times including celebrations like Mother's day and my birthday and I chose it because the food and service are amazing
Even the kids menu has been good my kid has tried the cheeseburger and the chicken nuggets they all come with drink and dessertIf you want to go to a nice restaurant to have an excellent time and great food I recommend you this place is superb and the service is always friendly
Lunch is also a great deal as they serve smaller pizzas and wonderful panninis
mushrooms soup appetizer boudin blanc with white asparagus entree and fruit parfait dessert washed down with mimosa in a pleasant house on a side street with both indoor and outdoor dining available
Every bit of every chicken dish I have had here has been tender white and the good parts of the dark meat and so fresh the little boxes will honestly get a little too hot to handle at first
I enjoyed the food and the experience was a little to crazy for my family of four with two squirmy kids
All the other menu items are good if not great but as I say the eggplant is one of those dishes that makes me fantasize about it while I'm eating my wife's homemade cooking
We moved on to a chicken saltimbucca which was actually quite good
This was amazing food in an awesome atmosphere
These two slight issues were not enough to take away from the overall experience particularly the amazing food
The wings were so rubbery I could only eat 3 and that was tough I am not one to say this but for $20 bucks worth of food make it taste like
The meats are not very high quality in flavor or texture
I was so grossed out by the quality of the meat and honestly scared of getting food poisoning that I threw away the remainder of the food and walked out
He had the lemongrass chicken thing and I had beef and broccoli as recommended by other Yelpers
So skip the fakey meat and just cook good food -- not frozen propaganda nuggets
Service was good and our waitress recommended dished for us that was very helpful due to me beeing half blind
The wife had the Thai Tea de-lish was her response to bad that did not include free refills  I had the fresh brewed tea and started with the wings as an appetizer they were really good and that sauce was fantastic wife ordered the Thai Noodles  nice I had the yellow curry chicken and as a chef I must say I was not expecting the potato that  were sliced corrugated and the carrots were as well with a corrugated fine peeler and the sauce was real coconut milk and heavy whipping cream the chicken was fat free breast meat it's the little things that make a Great food spot and they have that here I forgot to even taste my wife's dish so I'm limited to speak on it but it looked really good too
Chandler Blvd a try for the most part the food was as good
We ordered the spinach and goat cheese croquettas good gambos al ajillo good the pollo colonial the star of the meal some other items and the brussel sprouts with thyme way TOO much vinegar drowning the sprouts and no thymeFor dessert we ordered the cheesecake with figs in a red wine sauce - this was amazing and I would return only to eat this and the pollo colonial
Good food great patio and friendly service; these are three Daily Dose highlights
Both times I've enjoyed the food and will definitely remember the Daily Dose when my tummy starts growling again
We ate there today and tried many of the items they are known for - onion rings had no flavor what-so-ever the barbeque chicken pizza was not good at all I had to actually douse it with barbeque sauce to even make it have a modicum of flavor the kids corn dogs were just like you would buy at the grocery store and my husbands double dogs tasted like the chili was burnt to a crisp
When we saw Ticoz we wanted one of each appetizer main course AND dessert
It's good and REAL Mexican food made quickly
The portions are insanely huge for the price you pay and well it's great quality Mexican food
Food aside what impressed me most about Roy's was the service
The food was very good eggs as ordered bacon was thick cut and largerye toast was good
If my food had been 'hot' I would have given 4 stars in spite of the long time in arriving
I enjoyed the vast variety of vegetarian dishes to select from
She had been here once before with less than desirable food but figured she'd give it one more shot
All the food was prepared and presented properly and in food that was to be hot was hot and cool was cool
but was pleasantly surprised to see they offered 'hot' food
The food was good pretty good sized portion and I thought it was a pretty good value but my wife and I liked ours
I was impressed  how quickly the food comes out and they were very good about refilling our chips & salsa and drinks
Another good choice would be the Sweet and Sour Chicken not as crunchy as the Orange Chicken but just as much flavor
Not a horrible place for lunch - their food is good - but their recent price increase and changes have pushed them over the edge of a place that's worth going to
Like i said the actual food is good which counts for something i suppose but it's not good enough
don't really like white meat chicken but the flavor was also lacking
I've seen good descriptions of the restaurant in the other reviews so I will just tell you about my food
The food is much better quality than what you pay for it but you gotta wait for it
The happy hour sushi and appetizers kobe burger are a good deal
The rolls are good for a landlocked state
Pizza and wings are their top sellers but next time I'm there I'd like to try the Hot Nino's Alive Roast Beef Sandwich and jalapeno mozzarella sticks
The mushrooms added so much flavor to an already delicious pizza
I guess I'll never know how wonderful the food is
The appetizers ware also great and described adequately in the menu and everyone except my uncle who ordered the lasagna and wasn't impressed was so happy by the end of the meal that we all indulged in either a specialty dessert coffee or the excellent dessert special Chocolate Soufle with vanilla ice cream which was flawless and had a great presentation
I tried adding hot sauce but it really didn't make the dish any better
I really want Au Petit Four to succeed but they need to overhaul the quality of their food and the attentiveness of their staff
With no customers to make them busy there is no excused for stingy cold food
The Orange Cake and Tres Leches were super delicious dessert
Food was still amazing and now the restaurant is also pretty great looking
The stench greatly affects the flavor of the food your PAYING CUSTOMERS eat yes the ones who also tip you
Very unique dish tasty and just overall enjoyable
The others had thai basil chicken the red curry which were good too
Plus it was reverse happy hour so it kinda defeated the purpose of the pizza but it was totally worth it
Reliably good food and reasonably priced considering location atmosphere and quality of food
Food My Mongolian Beef was very good
I asked for extra spicy and it still had less spice than any dish topped with hot salsa
I went there last weekend and sat at the bar ordered a fantastic martini amazing appetizers and super yummy pizza
Couple that with truly tasty food and the nice staff you got yourself a dynamo place to eat
All the good places in the food court have closed along w/ most of the autonomous units for mid-mall snacking have closed or become some lesser version of what they were
I love the pizza with the pulled pork it is SO delicious
Today I had a Hot Ham & Cheese on a kaiser roll with jalapeno lettuce avocado and side of love
The LB Paradise Toss salad burst with the flavors of spiced chicken mango red peppers and cilantro and came with a light refreshing lime vinaigrette
For dessert our server recommended the key lime pie only to come back and inform us they were out
& see how they are these daysLet's do the good first  These Sweet Tomatoes aka  Soup Plantation restaurants are properly managed which means that the food is fresh kept properly stocked everything is the right temperature & the staff is friendly
The not so good  Once you get past the salad line the rest of the food at Sweet Tomatoes is BLAH
Frankly I was annoyed to see this place fill up with lunch customers while similar Souper Salad right across the freeway is struggling to survive with much tastier hot food & a $3 lower price
As an avid foodie this is something that is always on my mind so when Chef Sean Currid of Cafe ZuZu at Scottsdale Arizona's Hotel Valley Ho invited me into his kitchen to observe Service firsthand I jumped at the opportunity
Walking through the kitchen earlier I had noticed a HUGE herb crusted prime rib roast preparing to spend a few hours in a hot oven this meat found it's way onto the next plate as a Prime Rib dip sandwich
Shaved nearly paper thin topped with melted cheese and placed atop a crusty baguette complimented by a rich flavorful jus and horseradish mayo this sandwich delivered far in excess of $3 worth of flavor
Tender Sautu00e9ed beef tips garlic roasted potatoes roasted root vegetables including beets parsnip and even a little Brussels sprout sneaked in I'd never have believed this would be one of my favorite vegetables all on a rich port wine reduction perfectly executed and absolutely delicious
50 went by too fast for me to divert and get my fork into but from the looks of it and after having sampled the previous dishes I'd bet it is worth a return visit
The food and coffee was good and my most prestigious critics my kids said it was better than their favorite place back home
The food is actually pretty good too if you need some sustanance
I am not an overboard foodie who likes bleu cheese on a hot dog
But if you like a little place where the service is good drinks are strong food is great and the atmosphere is spot on then this is a great place to hang
It's the realization that sometimes the best things in life are pretty simple cold beer good food and good friends in a slightly off kilter atmosphere
The food was good and my server was attentive and did a great job
Something about the fresh made noodles the flavorful mix of pork meat and broth and the slight bite of the chili paste was as we say in Hawaii Ono good
Their food is inexpensive fresh and tasty perfect for college students
I've only had their salsa very good so can't say much about the food but I've heard good things
And might I add their meat is of great quality representing the other 40% of the pie
For dessert we had a chocolate creation that was good but not quite as impressive as the rest of the meal
A full meal including rice a spring roll and soup WITH  a good tip is less than $12
The pizza crust made for a tasty spin on this classic sandwich
How do they get food of that quality to you - still warm with ALL the extra sides
Most of us are very familiar with Middle Eastern food so we had a pretty good idea of what to get and how things should taste
All of us mentioned how pleased we were with the food and the service and are definitely going to recommend this to others
One Liner Delicious food after getting a tatFood scale of 0-4 3
I enjoyed a few sips of the house sangria and am a fan of the sugared rim and quite enjoyed my chicken curry salad too
However the service was very good and the food was very tasty
We didn't wait more than 15 minutes for our food to be made and it came out hot and fresh and of course it was delicious
But it's easy for two people to share a medium pizza and an appetizer and get out for less than $30 which is pretty average for your typical dine-in experience
There is a bit of sticker shock if you order carry out three pizzas and two appetizers to go can run you $75But having said that it's worth it
Their hand-made pretzels are fantastic try the Garlic Parmesan and the pizza is most excellent-- I get what I always get to test the water pepperoni and mushroom and I was very impressed
I highly recommend giving it a shot if you're a fan of pizza
The food is delicious the desserts are sinful the drinks are amazing
BEST of all they're also open really late which is wonderful when you really don't want after-hours drive through food
the pizza when you bight into it is chewy and hot
The chocolate mousse and the chocolate chip cannoli are very good as well if you have room after the pizza
We also tried the spring rolls and they were very good as well
If you are in the downtown area and looking for good Thai food check it out
Like I said its not the most glamorous place but it does represent good Thai food
Its expensive for the food you receive but worth the novelty of it and the few pictures you leave with
Once our food arrived we were both surprised at how good the fresh spring roll was
We got a tuna spring roll and it was amazing
For my birthday dinner I enjoyed my usual dish
My wife really enjoyed her Evil Jungle Princess Chicken
It was a good 20 minutes between ordering lunch and the food being given to us
Most of the restaurants were chains or mediocre places that weren't offering any good food
You wouldn't guess it for a Mexican food place but the burger is tasty crunchy on the outside and plenty of avocado
I did find an appetizer that was strange for a sushi place it was lamb chops
The food here was good but nothing stood out and wowed me
Moved onto 3 pizzas  the Funghi the Smokey and the Margherita with sausage added and they were all sooo good
We also ordered the Trio chile relleno tamale and chicken burro- delicious
The food was absolutely incredible- we tried a bit of eveyrthing-- charcuterie cheese plates homemade pastas with very fresh seafood chicken caesar parmesan fries salad nicoise dessert still drooling-- everything was amazing
Also I find the lunch prices to be very reasonable considering the high quality of food and time-intensive preparation
I pretty much like everything on the menu but my absolute favs1 any of the tsoynamis2 drunken mushroom with mock chicken3 BBQ chicken sandwich4 mongolian bowl w/mock beefWho knew mock meat could be so tasty
I thought the chicken had a good flavor but was really dry
We ate everything so again the food was good the service was awful
The desserts were good the pot de creme was the best the rest of us got a 'tiramisu' which tasted like cookie dough ice cream
The egg rolls were the only half good item that I ate
Everything out of the 7+ dishes that I ate was not worth eating
As before the food was ho-hum at best the prices too high vs the product quality but the death blow to me was once again their customer service or shall I say lack of customer service
The food is good and doesn't fake the funk it is bar food in its most natural state greasy and tasty
The wine recommended was their chianti which tasted pretty bad they have a weird assortment of imported beers and like a couple other reviews the pizza had little flavor
We order a PESTO chicken pizza and we had to bite around on each piece to find the pesto no flavor a bit dry and the pizza was really late and warm - late and warm which means =  sat there for a while
The salad was better than the pizza and the wings were pretty good
Dessert menu looked good but we were stuffed
If the green chile burrito I ordered was filled with meat then maybe it would be worth $8
Wow who would of thought it would be so hard to find good sushi in the valley
Sunday brunch was great It was a perfect day to enjoy the good food a sangria and good companionship in the lovely outdoor setting
I prefer the meat dishes over the vegetarian options but that's not to suggest the latter isn't flavorful and fulfilling
They had tables set out where they were selling roast beef sandwiches I think with chips and a drink for 5 dollars and it was worth every penny
choose your Sandwich Personal Fav is #56 w/ Extra Meat Pick your Smoothie Personal Fav is Honeydew w/ Boba Drool at the other goodies & Pay
I have become addicted to the cajun with it's spicy chicken ham and cheesy goodness
Inconsistent service pacing and long waiting and once the temperature was off food was warm rather than hot
The lemon grass flavored beef skewers are great
I ordered the shredded beef burrito and it was quite good
The beef was of good quality but not that 'shredded' it was more like chunks of easily pulled apart beef
I enjoyed what I ate but I'm still left with the feeling that the food was missing something I don't know what
They do have pretty good snacks and dessert type food at the food stands which are everywhere
We had a FANTASTIC server Ashley who was really funny and very patient with us our party kept rolling in and was kind of indecisive when it came to their drinks and the food was REALLY good
Great vibe awesome wait staff great location incredible food wonderful drink selection and a cool patio area
However I seem to always go towards the filet along with any of their delicious side dishes
Whether you're on the go or you want a mellow atmosphere to read talk drink coffee make friends eat good food D'Lish is your new hang out
Hot dinner rolls arrived with a pesto/tomato dipping sauce that was excellent
If however you'd like to settle-in to your cozy corner table in a place you could easily be recognized as a regular and wrap yourself around some delicious food in an honest atmosphere this is it
It's in a perfect location prices are reasonable food quality is good; but the customer service is bad beyond belief
Sheila enjoyed the sushi both rolls that she said were good and sashimi which isn't her normal fare
The good thing about Majerle's is that minus the service food and cost it is a great place to watch sports
I highly recommend DelFalco's chicken pesto sandwich and pizza
The price was reasonable the food was good and the soda pop made it a nostalgic experience
So I found out I was going to be coming in to Scottsdale for a conference and my husband was anxious to find a place to try this sonoran hot dog we've heard so much about on food shows
They bring an actual shot of amaretto  Others in the party had stuffed fish crab legs and salmon
Their drunken noodles american hot and Pad Thai with Chicken also american hot please is just so delicious
The quality and quantity of the food has not changed at all
Chicken Katsu Good sometimes can get over-cooked
Beef Brisquit sandwich was not brisket it was chuck and it has TONS of fat on it the baked beans were crunchy and not good at all
But I would rather eat in a hole in the wall spot w/ tasty food
Great hotdogs exactly like you remember them Italian beefs that could possibly rival places in Chicago
memorable in a GOOD way food then I'm not going to be coming back
The food quality is only marginally better than Outback but the price is much higher -- more like an upscale steakhouse
Both of our dishes were delish I had the Linguini Lucina linguini and calamari and he had the Pork Saltimbocca pork prosciutto and cream cheese with penne pasta I cant wait to return and would recommend any one to try it out
My wife and I first experienced the Mellow Mushroom pizza bakers in North Carolina and were a little reluctant to visit their new operation in North Phoenix however were pleasantly surprised with how consistently good their pizza pie is
Enough about appetizers onto the pizza
Mellow Mushroom is definitely a chain restaurant however they stand far above the other chain pizza restaurants in the valley and they are definitely worth trying
The owner recommended the pizza since it was our first visit
it was so delicious and i am determined to replicate the dish at home
The way the food is served is strange they give you the cooked meat with the flavor sauce on the side
Disappointing if you are used to really good Chinese food
Some of  my suggestions for things to purchase are creme brulee from Torched Goodness a nice lunch from Truckin Good Food gluten free duck-fried french fries mmm the 2 ladies who sell hotdogs with kale sorry i don't know their names and a few of the hidden produce guys in there you should arrive early to get the best product
Good food shitty service horrible management
If you are in the Scottsdale area I would highly recommend stopping by for a cool sweet dessert
The pizza came as we enjoyed some of their great beers
It had so little chicken very little buffalo flavor and the crust was mushy in the center
We went across the lot to another restaurant and were treated to friendly service great food and good drinks at a real Happy Hour with happy people
5 stars for making gluttony feel so damn goodApparently the holiday dinner was not enough food for me because I woke up the next morning and felt the need to over-eat again
Where else can I get awesome buffet style food at prices that any good ol' pre-diabetic overeating and underpaid american can appreciate
THE MEAT  The reddish pastor is very tender and has some sweetness to its flavor
Things I like-Outdoor patio very nice-Food takes a little while to make that's how you know it's good-Pastor on everything-Corn tortillas
the service was amazing the food was even better
the menu is very cheap for the quantity and quality of food you're getting
tasted like pizza sauce I mean really how hard is good salsa
Every review talks about the good food but let's start elsewhere the bathrooms
We had the food delivered and I was beyond impressed
The meat was not chewy or processed it was crispy where it needed to be and had a really good flavor
If you're looking for your chinese food fix I would totally recommend this place
One friend had the chicken and dumplings which had a nice flavor
As for dessert we had that picked out before the appetizers
Lalibela is definitely an establishment for food connoisseurs; so if you unfortunately happen to be a good ol' fashioned American gosh darn it
requiring your plate of food super-saturated with salt submerged in boiling lard priorly frozen served in a bag or lacking any sort of flavor other than greasy; then this is not the place for you for all others a must
WE recommend getting one of the three-combination plates the vegetarian or the MEAT are both excellent during lunch hours only $7
Also as a side note their Ethiopian beer is surprisingly quite tasty; and it pairs well with the food
Think of this imagine for a second that if it was at all possible for a plate of delicious Indian cuisine to somehow mange reproduction with a full-of-flavor-and-spice plate of Persian cuisine with the ending result a sexy Ethiopian platter of food baby
Everyone likes to argue over what authentic mexican food is and people bitch about how this or that restaurant isn't authentic so it's not good
They use foods that absorb flavors well and they use whatever is available that they can afford
Authentic Mexican food isn't even that good or particularly good for you - if you spent some time deep in Mexico you would be shitting your intestines out 6 times a day for a month or two until you got used to it
Frank and Lupe's chicken was flavorless as was their cheese
Some places cook their beef in stuff for flavor and then just serve the beef while others cook the beef and then mix it with cooked veggies and stuff for flavor
The food was good very good compared to the delivery chinese I had become accustomed to lately
Their mushu beef was delicious despite the meat being a bit chewy and we tried the lobster curry which was was a hit and a miss
No but the food is good and I have never been let down from the numerous items we have had
It was the largest spring roll I have ever eaten and was delicious
The food was still tasty however I had the chicken mole DH had the chingalingas and the kids each tried a mexican choice off the kids' meals
Roka Akor features top-quality sushi outstanding service and some interesting cocktail all wrapped in a tastefully appointed airy dining room
5 stars but I decided to bump it up instead of bring it down because the food was really quite good
Words cannot describe it but this was the best tasting meat I've ever had so tender juicy melt in your mouth amzing flavor
Yasu even stepped out from behind the counter brought a small bowl of lemons and told us to just drip a bit on the cooking meat to flare up the charcoal and get more flavor from the smoke
Each roll had such unique flavor and distinction from every other place I've been
Red Bean/Banana spring rolls sounded good but with their opinion we also tried the new item green tea cheesecake fondue
Crumbled nuts and bananas on the tray just enhanced the flavor as this truly was a dessert I would not have wanted to miss
If you can stand eating among large families and battling traffic to refill your own drinks and condiment cups the Farm Grill is a good choice for the meat loving crowd
Food quality was above average and the prices are more than reasonable
Food Quality B+  -  Good breakfast food good job on soft scrambling the eggs and                                   French Toast
This is a wonderful restaurant  Last year we went to the OBS in Surprise AZ and what a disappointment the owner was very rude and the service just okay so I really didn't want to try another OBS in AZ but what a surprise the food was wonderful and the service was great
I noticed everyone else was drinking maybe that's what will keep this place going because I can't recommend the food or the cleanliness
My sister got a chicken tenders salad with honey mustard dressing and that was pretty good
My mom got catfish which turned out to be a deep fried fillet but it was still good
The ribs were sooo good the meat just fell off the bone and it was so juicy
The service was good and overall I think my family was happy with their food
Maybe we lucked out with good service and decent food
They also ran out of california rolls which come with the meal which is already a great deal without the rolls so they substituted two fried dumplings which were good
I kinda wished they put the beef on a bed of white raw onions but the cabbage was fine and the beef was really good anyway
how disappointed we are in the quality of food and the service but that person just doesn't seem to care
My food was pretty good - crab and shrimp with red sauce on pasta and I believe my husband and father in-law's food was also good
The food was good though and I'll be back for more and to see if it always stinks of something other than deli food
Seemed a bit steep but I don't mind paying for good food
What I got was a blackened beef hot dog a tasty bun and something akin to hormel chili
My friends and I don't venture out to this part of town too often but we were craving Mexican food and a quick search of Yelp on my phone brought up this place nearby with a generous amount of good reviews so we figured we'd give it a shot as well
-P One had the #7 Combo and as a look of disappointment struck him he said that the chicken was very moist but flavorless
Price For the hole in the wall look the way the meal was plated/served the food definitely doesn't look like the pictures they post on their website so don't expect fancy stuff and with the quality of the food you really wouldn't expect these plates to be well over $10
The place isn't inexpensive but you do get a lot of food for your $$$ so it's worth it
Our waitress was fantastic and the food was amazing as always
The appetizers the table shared as a group were the lobster spinach dip smoked chicken wings and onion rings
Healthy but great tasting food excellent customer service and great atmosphere
Their Kale salad is really good but the shrimp & goat cheese pizza is to die for
While the food was a little heavy on the EVOO it was also heavy on the whole roasted garlic and the flavors
Good food and a welcoming atmosphere at reasonable pricing that can appeal to a wide range of palates
The food was good but we were the only ones there so it was quiet and this was at noon
Ground lamb just has a better flavor note to it that beef doesn't bring to the table
Whoa my friend insisted we order this for our study night pizza that we ate at home amongst the books AMAZING
We ordered the signature pizza and garlic bread so so so good
Yeah it was a little pricey for a pizza but it is worth every penny
This was as good as any pernil asado I've ever had and while I can't attest to Fuego Bistro's recipe I can definitely say it tasted like a hunk of luscious meat that's been marinated overnight and roasted low and slow for 5 or 6 hours before landing on my plate
This dish was also really good and well cooked but I was more impressed with his side dishes--a highly addictive green chili cornbread casserole and maple chiliglazed carrots which were the best cooked carrots I've ever had
Dessert's often the highlight of a dinner out for me and while both were good in this case with the chocolate torte being my choice it doesn't bother me at all that the first and second courses were the stars of the meal
My husband and I agreed that this place could be really good as a concert venue that sells food and drink as it was a good place to see the show last night
Dimly lit cramped but nicely done interior with AMAZING FOOD
We also ordered the teriyaki chicken which by then we were SO full we barely touched it even though it was delicious
It was an all dark meat chicken not my fiance's favorite but it was still good
I highly recommend dealing with Josh and Krystina for Dish or DirecTV
Think Red Robin with but better food amazing upgrade of an atmosphere and less germs
This review is coming from a vegetarian but still great tasting FISH tasty SALADS and excellent POTATOES
If on the cusp of starvation this is the place because not only do you obtain a grip of tasty food; but it is also served in a desired rumble-of-the-stomach friendly pace
We recommend the jap chae fried glass noodles with beef and veggies the daeji bulgogi spicy bbq pork with rice and the tofu soup with spicy bean paste--the little side dishes are amazing
The meat has always been seasoned well with all of the condiments inside and the tortilla was fresh and hot
I highly recommend this place if you are in the area and can't decide which Mexican Fast Food joint to grab your meal from
Now the chili was good but the idea of having filet mignon meat is all marketing goodness
The grilled lemon chicken is amazing and some of their deserts pastries are amazing
+ No they are not supposed to be crunchy + No they are not supposed to have sour cream or cheese on them + If you think they are dry or need more flavor that is when you add hot sauce squeeze some lime on there or add in some spicy carrots or garnish with cilantro cabbage or radishes
The place looks like a dump anyway so I would recommend just getting your food to go
Went for happy hour and had the shrimp pizza a shrimp cocktail and a sauvignon blanc that I really enjoyed and of course no I did not make note of it -They've lowered their prices and they are definitely worth going over for dinner or happy hour or lunch -Initially the service started out really strong
Good food takes time and Malee's is most definetly very good - so allow them the time to prepare it
The BF liked the cucumber rolls I didn't try them The gyoza were clearly generic gyoza but at least this place had good sauce and they were crispy which was pleasant
I have never enjoyed a sushi roll mainly because I do not usually like the flavor of seaweed but it was a lot more subtle in this roll probably due to the deep fry and I really liked them
Food is above average quality and affordable
It's taken me a while to find an authentic tasty Thai food place in Arizona and now I have
There isn't Mediterranean food in all of SF that is anywhere near as good for 3x the price
My friend's sweet and spicy burger had more flavor but the meat was dry and overcooked
Service has been good every time I've gone but the average food just doesn't make up for it
Our food came out fast hot and delicious
The coffee is excellent they have an organic colombian a good selection of veggie friendly foods wi-fi a large outdoor patio and there is an extremely reasonably priced yoga studio on the premises which I visited for one of their intro classes and removed the kinks of several days of driving from my back
The meat was tender and flavorful with just enough heat and the tortilla was tender and rich
Like other places in town the food is American Bistro with good deals spendier items and always solid savory flavors
I was looking for a new spot for Chinese food and I had seen all the reviews on yelp were good so I had to give it a try
The Orange Chicken was chewy chicken with no flavor
My wife and I have been to this location twice in the past 6 months and the service and food quality have been top notch
The service was top notch and the food quality was perfect
The Asian Chicken salad was very tasty but a little shy on chicken and not very Asian
Well service was excellent the food was tasty and the ambiance was really quite lovely
I feel like this place caters to out of towners that have no idea what good mexican food should taste like
The chicken was cold as if made earlier which I'm cool with but wasn't heated to temperature problematic
The food was good although I was surprised that theyre catogrized as American food
I always got the rice instead of the french fries because it is sooo flavorful - tastes like they cook it with chicken stock and the golden raisins they add to it just makes it delish
And judging by my dish and the tastes I stole off my companions' all of them at The Good Egg are very good
Every time I have dined at Roy's I have ordered off the Prix Fixe menu which is a steal for such quality food
The seafood is excellent and my fiancee who doesn't care for a lot of seafood always finds something she loves
The sushi is a tad expensive but you get what you pay for - the quality is high
Well first off the sushi is ok but a major pet peeve of mine is when cold sushi is put on a hot plate and it makes it warm-ish
What is the deal Mexican food here so close to the border yet the flavor and colors of this food don't illustrate any thing but drab and boring
Pureed guacamole is not what I was expecting when I ordered it to accompany my Combo Grande of Chile Rellano and Chicken enchilada do not order the fideo way too soupy and it taste like watered down spaghetti O's not good
The food is a touch overpriced for Tempe but it's nice to sit and chat for awhile with an appetizer before the comedians come on stage
One minor flaw their fish sauce served with the Bun was not good
When you have a dish with such simple yet complex flavors that can't happen in such a basic broth
Of course I had to add the beef carpaccio appetizer which brought us up to $51 but none the less a good deal
Not sure a chicken and cheese sandwich is really worth $9
If they had some more authentic salsa to go with their foods I'd give them 5 stars - It's a little  more pricey than something like taco bell but you get much better quality food
When it shows up only a little warm or tepid it means a the soup wasn't hot enough when you placed in the meat or b frozen meat was dropped in my hot soup
I got the chicken skewers with peanut butter sauce as an appetizer and the pad thai for dinner and both were delicious I would also highly recommend the thai tea it's iced tea with a sweet cream in it
I believe this will become the new revolution amazing food out of high end food trucks
Our server Angela was wonderful even when I asked her to refrigerate the chocolate mousse cheesecake I had brought from the Cheescake Factory can't risk birthday dessert on an unknown and even brought extra plates and silver
Even beyond the food and the environment was Christopher's excellent customer service
One factor that I recognize and appreciate more than good food is customer service
All of the food and room service I ordered was filled with superb flavor and had good presentation
The hotel also has a botanical garden herb garden multiple lawns and it contains different food services
I highly recommend the ranchero pulled pork tacos and the sushi
Dad got grilled chicken sandwich which I will be having next time we stop in so obviously it was good and he got a side of fried okra and mac'n'cheese
There are lots of great comments here about their admittedly delicious breakfast burritos and other foodish Mexican food but the best part of El Sol in my opinion is the part in its name the bakery
Soup chicken &n rice was perfect temperature and had great flavor
Easter can be very difficult to find top quality food atmosphere and service but this place rocks
If you want the best food and a wonderful leisurely time go here
It's not bad but it doesn't have any wow factor so if you're trying to impress your date until food is served you won't hear wow from her/him My Foie Gras Torchon for an appetizer was amazing - highly recommended for foie gras lovers
She loves the Chicken Green Chile Salad which I tried once and was good
This annoys me too but like Tracy I keep going back because the food's good
The bar staff were chatty and friendly food was good and the beer selection was pretty great too
The food is high quality tasty and inexpensive
This is also coming from a Japanese girl In our most recent visit my boyfriend and I sat at the sushi bar and asked the chef for a recommendation
The food is all pretty good nothing outstanding nothing terrible
These folks have fantastic Happy Hour specials constantly actual good food a decent beer selection covered/misted patio with sports TVs and constant fantastic service
flavorless chicken crisp from a can celery
while the gravy tasted good i kinda like the option to drown my own food
restaurants like this cannot simply survive on this quality of food
GoodSushi - Sashimi Rolls Deep Fried Rolls Nigiri
We tried the meatballs a couple nights ago & they were really good
Everyone ordered something from the teppanyaki menu except my sis who opted for sashimi & a couple sushi rolls which she enjoyed
They use so much oil & butter yet the food was flavorless we had to use a lot of extra soy sauce & salt
There were a few people in our party who had never been before so I'm glad they got to experience it but when you compare the quality of the food to the price it just doesn't add up
Yes you get a show but I care more about my food tasting good than some tricks
Overall just a good balance of flavors going on with all their pizzas
The coffee is actually good and the artisan goods in the grocery are fun and tasty with some good food novelties as well
I would recommend it to anyone meat-eaters alike
The Food was delicious the drinks were well made and the service was spot-onI ordered the Jumbo Crispy Chimichanga I have a bit of a love affair with chimichanga's and this dish did not disappoint
Good Mexican food a in house bakery a small store and butcher shop
Burgers -- whether it be the cheeseburger or Hurricane Fish Sandwich -- are excellent
The crust is really what makes these pizzas good
The cheese and pepperoni pizzas are pretty standard but tasty
One small vacuum pump container for the whole restaurant--follow Star of India's example and do a big urn tea adds a lot to the food ;- Food was good but seemed like their timing needed some fine tuning
For me italian food is always a good choice
The sandwiches are great pizza is good and they sell wine
My main dish was a little less exciting than it looked in the menu description but still flavorful
i got an Omakase deluxe sushi combination which was one of Kabuki's recommended dishes
If  that's the fish they're serving the prices really need to reflect the quality
I will admit their hot food is pretty good
I haven't enjoyed such a wide array of flavors amazing Mexican style seafood outside of Mexico even in San Diego which comes close
The service is unusually good in a place like this and  the food comes out fast and delicious
Come to Haji's to be full and chat with some friends over good food
Lots of vegetarian choices and the pizza is really good
I want this pizza to be better than it is if they could change a few things it probably would be as good as they claim
Fresh Herbs mean just that FRESH but when they are put on the pizza before baking they shrivel up and dry out and lose all flavor
We also shared a corn dog and fries the food were very hot had to wait for them to cool down
That place is run with precision and the owner is not only very knowledgeable about their fresh good food he's one of the nicest guys I have ever met
Is the quality the greatest no its not but when you consider the concept for this place its a place for many people to be introduced to sushi to make it quick and make it affordable I think the quality lives up to anyone with reasonable expectations and for my meal to be $9 with a coke it was pretty reasonable also get the combo not just a soda soda is $1
I recommend the chicken burrito - it is filled with love & chicken
The food is better than average for a hotel but not great for a resort
The prawn and mango dish was light and tasty
Good food but the waitress got our order wrong even after I pointed to the item on the menu since she could not understand English
Food was good ambiance is nice but the service is slow
I recommend that you go as the food and atmosphere are pleasing  Just allow time for a leisurely lunch or dinner
Very casual and modest place all they care for is giving us good food
When I think of good middle-eastern food in Arizona Haji-Baba is what comes in my mind
Their price is very cheap compared to the quality of the food
The food was good but the service is the WORST
However considering how highly the restaurant obviously thinks of itself it really does the food isn't that good
- Italian Beef Sandwich Could use some Improvement - Maxwell Street Polish Dog Not Approved- French Fries As good as they get- Burgers  Have yet to try but they look like the one thing that this place does rightChicago Style Italian Beef sandwiches don't seem to have much competition in this town
The beef isn't bad but it seems to be lacking the full flavor of his competitors in town
The bread is a great selection the juice that the beef is cooked in seems rather watered down and again lacks flavor
I think the biggest draw about this place is the creative and tasty expanse of spring rolls that they offer
I recommend the pork belly buns as a must-have dish
The food is very good and plenty of options
My dish was barely luke warm and potatoes cold
Food As it was explained to us the food was Cuban/Latin with Asian flavors and prepared with Asian techniques
5 of us shared 2 appetizers 3 main dishes 2 sides and 1 huge dessert
for a $26 appetizer I expected the foodie angels to sing
The chicken was tender and flavorful and also thoroughly enjoyed the peanut sauce
The meat was very tender flavorful but this cut should be specified in the menu as most US diners are accustomed to pork loin
The other glowing reviews don't exaggerate about how good the food is
There is good variety with the food and everything is so flavorful
I recommend the gyro or the chicken shawarma
The service has always been so-so but the food beer and music have always been excellent
Most brewery's have either good beer or good food
Or should I say amazing beer and amazing food
The rice stayed warm the pork moist and really flavorful and the beef sweet and tender
Check out the Steak Cortez or the Chicken Poblano and tell me it's not tasty
Great deep dish Chicago-style pizza wonderful fresh salads and a great atmosphere make Nello's a local staple pizzeria
I got the beef bun with egg rolls and the meat was SO good
The greens that came with the dish were fresh and flavorful
Hidden away in southern Scottsdale this quaint little cafe is about as good as it gets when it comes to good ol' diner food
Great atmosphere friendly servers classic family owned diner decor and amazing food
There needs to be more because it really helps make this dish so delicious
The fresh mozzarella combined with the delicious marinara sauce and the very flavorful meatballs made for a wonderful pizza experience
Bottom line excellent pizza fair prices and it's better than Bianco's
The food is tasty enough although the item selection and presentation are akin to that found in college dorm cafeterias
It's a bowl of scalding hot soup full of noodles and meat
We stumbled upon this pizza place while walking around downtown waiting for The Australian Pink Floyd show BTW-they're amazing to start
There's only one stairwell without a lot of room so employees carry hot plates of food are running up and down while you try to stay out of their way
I'm a very indecisive person so this place isn't good for me- I dont know what the hell I want in a roll so I just ordered a Philly it was on par with the rolls you can grab at the grocery store deli
A friend once told me that the spiciness of a spicy sushi roll was invented to help disguise the flavor of fish that might not be so fresh
Our wives ordered Hu00fchner Chicken Schnitzel and of all things the gnocchi which was pretty darn good
I would love to go back tho this place the ambiance and the service were great and the food was amazing in my opinion
The food at Yogi's is certainly nothing to write home about but you can get a decent teriyaki bowl at a good price for lunch -- that's about it
Happily my girlfriend really enjoyed her foie gras stuffed chicken at least
Quality and service and food man we had some nasty times and stopped visiting
This is large floppy pizza and would win no contests but it does the trick and is worthy of regular trips
As a new place it's important to generate positive buzz with quality food/drink great service and pleasant atmosphere
Well the owner/founder/head chef will probably be personally handling your fish - Tony is a maestro in every way cultured in the East a fisherman by trade can literally HANDLE a fish and judge the grade/quality of the cut
Try their SERIOUS COLD sake collection - if you ask for hot jab your chopsticks in your ears and march your a$s over to Pei Wei --- because you shouldn't be doing sushi
Amazing value well rounded between soup salad a roll and nigiri
I was seriously afraid that I was going to get food poisoning I didn't thank goodness
I enjoyed my handmade ravioli with spinach and yummy cheese not fish yay
For five dollars you get a great large pizza with one topping and if you're into it a flavored crust
As far as the pizza goes it's REALLY REALLY GOOD
The toppings are also very fresh and flavorful and the cheese is generous and melty what else can one say about pizza cheese
So in summary if you're in the mood for some damn good pizza Big Jimmy's is hard to beat unless you're willing to spend a bunch more and do something like Spinato's which is better but Big Jimmy's will still hold it's own against them
I went there last night for Taco Tuesdays $1 to $2 tacos can't be beat and the tacos are so tasty I always order 3 the mahi crunchy fish and steak
The service was good maybe because I went on opening day or maybe it really is that good all the time - friendly employees and the food came out relatively quickly
They had a prix fixe menu of Lobster bisqueShrimp cocktail which they ran out of so they substituted the Coquilles St Jaques insteadBeef Wellington with chateaubriand sauceChocolate SouffleSounds delicious no
The pastry and spread around the beef was delicious though
However I was very disappointed that the burger and buns didn't have that smokey flavor the pizza's do
It's worth a trip to try it out and with grass fed beef and natural sodas it's better quality than most burger joints
If you want good food and atmosphere go to Cornish Pasty Company or even Fibber Magee's both just a few miles west
Our waiter was cool even if he did use a bit too much hair gel and made some good recommendations for drinks to be paired with the food
The food wasn't good I applaud their efforts at fusion but the combinations just didn't work
We always get the pizza slices with basil simply and tasty and the side of meatballs
With the assistance of Stephen we finally came to the filet and the pan fried chicken along with chips and guacamole for an appetizer
The credit card machine in the bar was down for the time we were waiting for our table chips and salsa was $7 and the food was not really good at all
Rereading my post I'm aware that my review may sound to be a negative one but I want to make it clear that I did enjoy the flavors of the dishes I tried
---I've had this Taste of Phoenix giftcard purchased through Costco good at restaurants such as Tapino Picazzo Gourmet Pizza Medizona and Little Rangoon since pre-Christmas so I decided to go for my first LRvisit last Friday
Thankfully the two menu items I ordered almost arrived simultaneously albeit after what I thought was a long wait for an app dish and soup 15 minutes for homemade soup I can understand but 15 minutes for an appetizer of four 4x1 skewers of grilled chicken skewers
I highly recommend the Spring Rolls - very fresh and tasty
But honestly if you love watching a game good beer and drink specials and want to nibble on some buffalo chicken dip this is your place
Now it should be understood that an Irish Pub that serves great Guinness will also have great pub food at least in America ironically it wasn't easy finding good food in Ireland
Fibber Magees is definitely a good destination for food and drink
Excellent quality fish but they serve you a huge piece which needs to be handled with a knife and fork
Very good ordered the horseradish as well excellent horseradish
The food was really good we got some cheese dip and guacamole dip also a plate of carne asada tacos which was yummy
Eh whatever the salsa was the real star of the show and I thought it was tasty; not too spicy pretty all around solid and I enjoyed the hell out of it before my food arrived
There is also a good amount of meat in their sandwiches and the bread is soft and fresh
The name itself sounds so good and decadent; chicken and waffles what a delicious combination of tastes and textures
Since it was late I didn't see the meat counter open but would assume good things are found there
My husband ordered the chicken which in the center had cold spots
People don't go to restaurants and hope for their food to be cold
While the food was delicious it was overpriced with mediocre service
The food was good but not enough to keep me coming back I ordered the pork fried rice and captain rolls
As much as I might enjoy chain eatery Chinese food its just not worth the risk for me to eat at a place that while touting if you get it with veggies and tofu its going to be VEGETARIAN and then have them mistakenly put meat in the bottom
The food isn't good enough to venture the annoyances of dealing with this place
Lemon chicken orzo soup=good enough to eat even on a hot day
The menu provides a nice selection but the food items are a bit overpriced for the quality but not by any means bad
The food was good but more importantly the staff was very polite friendly and attentive
The food and drinks are reasonably priced with a very good selection
I just love the simplicity of walking in and ordering and being able to sit and enjoy a casual and quick dining experience with good food at a great price
The food is fairly good but the ambiance is insanely great
The roasted corn which was rolled in some sort of cheese and hot sauce was just amazing; possibly the best roasted corn I've ever had
Best Greek food I had in Arizona and excellent entertainment
The dolma's were the best I've had their version of Babaganoush was very good and they had many lamb-based dishes
Also the chicken was no good but I don't really like chicken anyway
We ordered our pizza and drinks; the pizza was good but there were still flies all over the place
The only reason we went back to this restaurant was because the pizza was good
Our experience has been hit and miss; there are times they make the pizza good and there are times that the pizza is just ok
The pizza is so good and it never disappoints
I feel bad writing such a negative review given the friendliness of the staff and the food is a good value in terms of quantity but not quality but they really do need to seriously reconsider the product they are putting out and how it can be improved
They had a wine aisle with quite a few good reasonably priced choices and a meat aisle with plenty of sausages beef pork and chicken cuts
The meat prices were very good considering that they are comparable to other grocers and are still providing hormone and antibiotic free meats for which others are horribly overcharging
And I ordered the italian sausage pizza which is actually amazing
Duck pork turkey meatballs tomotoe soup shooters i forget what else but i do intend to go back and try some more - they were excellent
First the positives I wasn't expecting much but the food was actually pretty good
The carne asada and barbacoa tacos were very tasty and weren't heavy and greasy like a lot of Mexican food
Go to Lola's if you are ready for some conversation and good food
I very much enjoyed the food selections including Sugar Snap Peas Shasito Peppers Kimchi Scallops with Strawberry Seared Tuna  and Pork Belly
The buttermilk breading was just the right amount of crispiness and had a great flavor to complement the delicate taste of the catfish
The chicken fried steak was very good with tender pounded beef and crispy breading
there is a beef quesadilla that is excellent or the mucho macho burrito will definitely fill you up both for under $7
The risotto had a lot of diced vegetables and fruit in it - which was new for me in this dish and I was pleasantly surprised at how well all the flavors came together
I ordered the bbq steak over rice the food was good the portion was ok
If you want to experience not just good food a wonderful night out or a cozy venue - go to the Roaring Fork and get one of the best culinary experiences you can find in the valley
It was good food and good company from my sisters and the kids
The aimbiance was great and the food was amazing
the food was very good; we had a few appetizers
You'll probably be introduced to much of the bacteria of delicious real-Mexican street food
I don't like my spaghetti swimming in sauce but this was almost dry watered sauce was at the bottom of the dish It was HOT and the meatballs flavorful
The other appetizers were a joke typical Sysco or Shamrock foods frozen crap
Overall overprice and not worth it coming from an Asian who knows about Asian food
Osha serves excellent food and is just down the street from my apartment which is awesome because aside from the usual fast food chains there aren't a lot of great restaurants in the immediate area
we ordered the Half BBQ Chicken plate with hush puppies and coleslaw the BBQ brisket and pulled pork plate with baked beans and sweet potato fries and dad got hot wings that are smoked then grilled
the chicken and pork were great the fries and beans were good the hush puppies needed some kinda ayoli or ramuloude to dip in and the slaw had just the right kick that I would love to try again
Food was overall pretty good except one medium burger was rare and the other medium burger came with things that we asked to be left off
They have a good wine list I started with a chardonnay the Diamond T which pairs perfectly with seafood - a little pricey at $12
I have eaten at this big fat greeks before and after this mornings hellatious commute in on the 10 I thought maybe I should treat myself to some good food
I should mention that the food was excellent though
We shared a brick oven margarita pizza and the pork loin entree along with a glass of red wine and their signature dessert - a pastry filled with berries and mascarpone cheese served with hot chilly chocolate soup
I was impressed with the food the ambiance and the service - I look forward to going back again for one of their prix-fix menu events and for brunch
The pizza I ordered on the other hand was so good
Was impressed with how many children were in this restaurant including mine as it is crowded and upscale but the food was enjoyed by all and the service was accommodating
Then the Pizza well lets just say delicious
The fried rice was good he loved the crab puffs and I loved the egg rolls
The food was fresh and tasty atmosphere amazing
The quality is there in the beef but the bun sucks for that price
What I think bothers me about their food is just a lack of flavor
I honestly think the Executive Chef needs to beef up the flavors herbs spices etc
The food is amazing and doesn't leave a bloated feeling after eating as with the other mexican food restaurants in the valley
Hot dog combo pizza slice and an icee all for less than $5
The food was hot and tasty and served in a timely manner
A bit overpriced for the food but the ambiance and service made it worth it
Again people must understand that good things food come to those who wait
The time my wife and I went there was only a 20 minute wait so we strolled around downtown Phoenix visited the local organic grocer which I highly recommend and the time flew by
I usually get the same thing Southwest Chicken Sandwich It's too good to try something else
The chicken is full of flavor and the toppings are always fresh
Tommy V's is a delightful twist on old town dining where fine wines come with a surprisingly  refreshing price and food pairings  are always fresh and so delicious
Before any food arrived I was already impressed with chic wine carafes dark wood chopsticks and unique ultra-trendy flatware
The food was very good and the presentation of it was even better
The dessert menu obviously looked good as we were three people and ordered three desserts
Lots of Burger varieties and the food was tasty and came out pretty fast
So the chicken was really good especially with the mashed potatoes
The chicken salad and tuna salad sandwiches are tasty and of generous size
Since my fiance and I have never tried any Cambodian food we thought we'd try a good varietyJasmine Tea hot Good tea very floral and aromaticSpring Roll It was HUGE and similar to Vietnamese spring rolls
Pleah Beef Salad Never thought I'd ever eat or like beef in a salad but it wad a wonderfully clean and refreshing taste
So all-in-all we got out of there with 3 entrees an appetizer and dessert for under $30
The atmosphere is unique and the food is excellent
I wasn't impressed with this dish--definitely not what I was expecting crab dip to be
5 stars for food but maybe since I am in a good mood today and Taylor was a very cheerful and excellent waiter I am going with 4
Food was half-good my pork dip not the chips but the prices outside of happy-hour seemed a little high to me
The sushi even though creative lacks flavor as a whole the prices and ratings are too high and the food under delivers
Unfortunately it's extremely inconsistent and the food just wasn't that good
All of the quality was decent about what I'd expect for happy hour food but not up to snuff when I eat at a place with $30+ entrees on the menu
50 As for mom she had a pesto chicken pizza-smaller so it's perfect for one person to share if there are two of you plan on an appetizer or salad to share
Decent quality food at very reasonable prices
These dinners are great as they come with a lot of tasty Swedish foods you might not have tried before
This is an excellent place to go and have a feast of great dishes
It's tough to decide whether the food is worth the cost
The food itself was good I'm a sucker for biscuits and gravy
It happened to be pretty decent flavor nice serving and all in all a good dish
One last thing wait a little before eating your dish because the dish is hot
The pizza was tasty the cheesy bread was yum and the drinks were kept full
It is much overpriced and in my opinion the flavor and texture of the food was similar to what I would expect from any drive thru 'berto establishment
Nobody had any complaints as far as the food went the service was good and the atmosphere was nice
They serve an excellent dessert that's included with your meal
7 starsEve award wagyu pastrami--best pastrami ever sorry NYC delisCost to worth it rating 4 $150 for 2 including multiple glasses of wine shared app and dessert--quality of food is definitely worth that and have paid more for lesser mealsHighlights- Wagyu pastrami A-maz-ing
- Duck dish duck was good but the accompaniments were the show stoppers
The atmosphere was pleasant and the food was pretty good for the price but there was nothing that really jumped out at me
The sushi was good and fresh although they were out of octopus
The guy making the sushi was nice and spent a lot of time making the food look good
The meat is mushy and moist because of their sauce but it has pretty good flavor
It's a fun place to eat the service is real good and their food is not bad
The service was excellent our drinks were always full and the food timing was perfect
The beef was good and the broth itself really made the pho delicious
I also enjoyed the egg rolls but I will probably skip the spring roll next time
The food was pretty good not spectacular but tasty and filling
Ethiopian food doesn't quite break my top five favorite foods but it's pretty good and hey I love any restaurant that serves a lot of veg food
For a chain restaurant Fleming's does it right; nice decor impeccable food excellent service and over 100 different types of wine
Came to AZ for vacationing and was told this was the spot to go to for really good pizza
the common areas are beautiful and the food and libations are delicious
I usually prefer a thicker crust to my pizza but this place is a delicious exception
Our dinner companions split a burger and ordered an appetizer and dessert that they had gotten before and were joking about how they wanted to try something new but always like their favorites
I had the beef and it came with about 4 thin slices of overcooked meat a good amount of beansprouts and spinach and 3 small slices of carrots cut into flowers
The staff is sometimes friendly the food is sometimes good and I could do without the wild west theme
Actually the food especially the dinners are cafeteria quality canned green beans instant mashed potatoes tough meat
The food here is actually pretty good and for the price it's one of the better lunchtime deals on Mill
And hubby loves pretty much any of the chicken wraps with a side of the delicious corn chowder
I mean who doesn't like a good round of Gold Fish Racing
The Food  I was made suspicious by the atmosphere and so when I tasted the meat maybe I was jaded but I seemed to taste a charcoal flavor like a briquette or chemical propane like flavor coming through
I imagined them throwing the meat on a grill after removing it from a tub to heat it up--it wasn't too hot to handle and seemed heated up
Frankly I don't need anything but a plate and good meat to enjoy bbq
The nigiri sushi at Yasu is wonderful
Plenty of fishy goodness and some rice bursting out of the nori cone
The specialty rolls are good but there aren't many to choose from
The food I've had is fusion Irish and very good
The Beef and Guiness Boxty is heavy and delicious
The menu is your typical bar food but it's good
I go to lunch there at least a couple of times a week for the Caddyshack Basket 3 huge chicken fingers come with fries and toast and your choice of 2 sauces for dipping - however always looking for something good that's low-carb I get the Caddyshack Basket with no fries or toast
I don't eat meat so the fact that they have such a large variety of veggie choices makes it all the worth while for me
The food is amazing with different takes on some traditional dishes and several twists many people might not expect in a Mexican food restaurant
As far as fast Japanese food at lunch this is as good as it gets
Again the food was very tasty but the service was lacking today
The food is real good but items that are normally sides included with dinner
But my tummy is currently happy enough that I don't really care enough to knock it down to three stars-- and as a former industry person that's super good food
the prime rib dip looked so good on the menu but what showed up at my table was a weak dried up little sandwich with no flavor chewy overcooked meat and served on what was nothing more than a tiny hard oversized breadstick
Our foursome had the Bar Plate appetizer easily enough for 3-4 Carne thin crust pizza Pork Calabrese sandwich and a Chopped Salad big enough to feed several people
It was so good after the show at the Orpheum we went back asked for the same waitress and had dessert
Their sangria is delicious also  Some of my  favorite menu items Butternut Squash Ravioli Prime Rib Eggs Benedict Tacos anyVeggie DipChicken Nachos their salsa is great Panko Crusted CalamariCilantro Jalapeno & Edamame HummusChocolate Cake MMMmmm
Big selections of menu from appetizers to sushi to entrees and noodle dishes

Citizen Public House has excellent food and drinks
We had the Pork Belly Pastrami Mac & Cheese Smart Chicken and Coffee and Donuts - all were delicious

Otto's is such a good quality pizza and their other items are equally delicious whether it be calzones pastas or their desserts
*Stuffed Relleno - How can a spicy cheesy meaty thing NOT be good
I can get amazing fried chicken a huge flavorful waffle with warm syrup and butter and Kool-Aid in a Mason jar
There are a bunch of pizza places in Chicago that have amazing pizza and they all do it differently so there isn't just way one to make Chicago-style pizza but Spinato's came pretty damn close
Another had the fish and chips which I usually never try but tried there and they were good
So good that I went to another bar in Surprise and was pretty disappointed with their fish and chips
I am not sure what style Mexican food this is but it was really good and not loaded with the cheese
The crab cake- VERY good the spinach dip- also good but similar to most places and the seafood sampler- oysters and shrimp were good but the crab was obviously frozen and tasted horrible
The Asian chicken wrap is also very good
I read that the food here was so-so but I really enjoyed my meal
We decided to go again last night for dinner knowing that the food had to be better but we left pretty unsatisfied with the quality of the food and the care in preparation/presentation of the food
00 for both our meals and 2 sodas for that price I expect that they take more pride in the making of the food and at least make sure it is served hot
00 the fish is a little expensive but was served with a nice size piece of fish and the good serving of fries
The broth the chicken and the noodles are all very very tasty to me
Joe the Paisano has produced a restaurant that reflects his easy going attitude and dedication to high service and food quality
I love a good chicken biscuit and the one they serve has got honey butter on it as well
The chicken gyro was delicious and worth the price but the Greek fries were bitter soggy and awful
Second time i came in food is pretty expensive but its well worth it
Food was really good i got the half panini and soup of the day
We would all go back and we enjoyed our food
I have since been back many times and the food is good and the service is very warm and welcoming
The idea of the Cornish Pasty lends itself to a diverse palate and the desserts the beer selection even the coffee here is very good
My favorite dessert is the Carmel Apple Pasty with Vanilla Ice Cream which is very good
Not sure when they won best fish & chips but they're not very good
Good food friendly & attentive service clean restrooms and good location
The people were friendly the food was delicious
A typical outing to the Veggie House with my girlfriend  looks like this-Start with hot tea and vegetable soup-A small order of absolutely delicious spring rolls-Two entrees
I had no idea their food was this delicious
asparagus sweet corn cake with a hint of chorizo and a wonderfully prepared piece of fish
Partner and I ordered two appetizers shrimp and calamari one fresh spring roll one fried roll and one banh mi
It was good - not outstanding but a good spring roll
Furthermore she recommended that we go to Lolo's Chicken and Waffles to which I replied Hellz yes
It is not the most amazing food but it is still just what you are craving
The food on the other hand was not so good
It's quality food but I did feel a little taken
The all you can eat ribs good price but the ribs hardly have any meat on them
During down times one needs to excel in food quality and service and not take shortcuts
Wasn't very impressed with the food - the salsa for the chips tasted like ketchup and BBQ sauce and the fish tacos were just OK
It's refreshing to eat at a restaurant that clearly takes pride in the products they buy and the flavor of the food they serve
We ordered one of their pizzas really tasty and the hummus decent
There are several gourmet pizzas some non-raw fish sushi rolls and other miscellaneous appetizers all at great prices
The food is always good the service is always a little lackluster but without blame as those guys and gals bust their backends considering how busy the place is always and the prices are really fair especially considering portion sizes and happy hour specials
It's a no frills experience you go you wait but you wait because the food is good and fresh and doesn't leave you hungry in an hour like many other Chinese restaurants
There was a ton of chicken but they were pretty flavorless and didn't have enough other stuff like cheese and guac
The dessert was delicious and I especially liked the glazed pear topping
The breading has a great flavor to it; the chicken is nice and tender white meat
It is always fresh and you can taste the quality of the oil they fry the s/s chicken in
I would not recommend the sushi here; I wasn't feeling hungry one time and just got a California roll
Looking for a tasty bowl of chicken teriyaki
The chicken is slightly wood-fired in the flavor department & perfectly sauced with teriyaki
The service was good a lot of seating the menu was decent as well but both of our dishes we got were just okay
Overall good price good food Panda with guns
The buffalo was more gamey than normal beef and the balsamic vinegar was an excellent foil
The owner is a very very accommodating and polite woman and the sushi has been the best I have enjoyed locally
Good atmosphereVery well lit with tasteful decorCheap foodVegetarian friendlyWe had the veggie burrito which had potato beans grilled veggies and maybe cheese
My biggest gripe with Sports Pepper is that the food quality is very inconsistent
The steak and chicken are tough don't have much flavor and tend to have pieces with grissle
After living downtown a while now I had to come to think I'd never find a rebound for Haji Baba I grew despondent and longed for their market and cheap delicious food on the light rail rides that brought me to Haji Baba my mouth would water as I anticipated my falafel and hummus and favorite confections
The prime rib was in my opinion the best meat but also the lamb is quite good and more traditional
We shared a order of hummus for apps which was really good especially the pita bread and I ordered a Four Peaks cheeseburger with pepper jack cheese which came with beer battered fries while my friend got the 8th Street Ale chicken strips
I had the spicy teriyaki chicken with brown rice and I thought it was AMAZINGMy bf had the pulled pork and I tried it and thought it was better than most of the pulled pork we had in Hawaii though they don't carry poi
For dessert dive into the warm butter cake and good luck getting out
For a main course I enjoyed the Fish Tacos while the Seared Ahi Tacos and the Beef Enchiladas also graced our table
For desert our server recommended that we try THREE different desserts so we went with the Tres Leche kind of an oat-ish interpretation but good
A crunchy shell housed deliciously tender chicken and fresh lettuce and tomato on top
35 total will get you some good food and you'll leave stuffed and ready to pass out in the afternoon of your job
I really recommend eating at Babbo's if your in the mood for tasty pasta dishes
The pre-selected menu had good options and while nothing spectacular the food was still good
My steak was cooked to med-rare and didn't have the gamey flavor I sometimes associate with grass-fed beef so I was happy
The bad-rye bread as thick as my thumb rye bread should be thinlow fat  low quality corned beef that appeared to be previously frozen because of dark color but had added grease fat added to each side of each slice of meat that seemed to be mostly burger grease because of the remnants of burger I found in my sandwich and other assorted grease
My chicken was very good I liked the sauce that topped it it had papers onions and olives in a creamy dijon peanut sauce
If you go to Gallagher's expecting cold beers decent bar food friendly servers and a relaxed vibe - you'll have a great time
To eat I believe I had a combination with a beef taco and a chicken enchilada which was good
When I first moved to Arizona 11 years ago I missed good Japanese food
The combo chicken teriyaki with veggies is good
Granted I've only tried their spinach&artichoke dip and their fish&chips but golly both of those are DELICIOUS
It felt crowded and I didn't like that - but the food and the service was excellent
The chicken was a little on the dry side but I really liked the flavor
-rotisserie chicken enjoyed it with the green rice and paired with a great white wine
Why no fifth star-good portion for me for the chicken others might find it small; if so get the chicken/ribs combo-no sound on the tvs at the bar
I've been here a number of times and the food is always good
Cevapi = excellent although I'm not a fan of the raw onionsKebab = excellentPileci = excellentSirnica = excellentBaklava = sweet and deliciousI thought the food was very unique delicious and reasonably priced
They have a great bakery; the fancier desserts are definitely on the pricey end but there other baked goodies are great for breakfast like muffins and pastries and are very reasonably priced
I don't normally gravitate towards foods with nuts but this muffin is out-of-this-world delicious
They have pizza which is pretty good and they offer it by the slice
I've never had their hot food but they are supposed to have a pretty good pasta bar once a week where they make pasta to order
The pizza's were hot fired in the oven and just about the right size to feed one person
Over an hour to get food after ordering and when the food came the wings were less then Native quality
There are much better options for wings where the service and food quality is not this poor
TIPS-* Try their breakfast on Sat/Sun* If eating dinner order some of the veg NOSH and don't be afraid to get a couple to try the 3 pair is the best deal* Pizza's are all very good* The meat/cheese board also yummy* Extensive wine menu
Grimaldi's on Scottsdale Road is tasty crisp and reminds me of the great pizza from Philly
The FoodThe food was good a bit too much oil for my taste but not greasy in the slightest
We also ordered chicken with broccoli with a white sauce which was an enormous portion and again everyone enjoyed
Rounding out the feast was a roasted pork and chinese eggplant dish which was sweet and hot as well as a stir fried green bean plate
The food was delicious presented beautifully you would not expect that from a tiny place like thisThey have a couple of unusual beverages and I ordered pitchers for our table so everyone could try them if they wished to do so
The pizza is very good I have ate there a number of times since they have opened
I went for Sunday brunch with my sis but instead of ordering brunchesque-type food I ordered a burger because it just sounded so good
Had lunch here today It was great the food was great We had the Appetizer Trio Pasta Mardi Gras and the Mixed Seafood Grill
I would recommend Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen to anyone who likes Cajun food or Seafood there is so much to choose from and basically the server said we could change anything on the menu to have it made just the way we wanted
It's part of the experience - to spend time with someone whose company you enjoy and just relax in the lovely garden setting while eating wonderfully creative food
The second time the dessert had noticeably improved and was up to snuff with the rest of the wonderful meal
My dining partner reported his dish Curry Chicken was delicious too
And the Thai iced coffee is so damn good they should list it under desserts
Also the soup lacked all the meaty and shrimpy goodness I like in my hot/sour soups
* We split 3 other dishes and they were all excellent
ordered the chicken in which he said was pretty good
I mean the company I was with FABULOUS and the food was good
Try the volcano flamed - where else can you sear your own beef on a smokin' hot rock
From Foot-longs White Hots and Bratwurst to Hamburgers Corn dogs and Chicken
The food was good arrived quickly and the chef came around to several tables to see how everything was
I dont think there is really anything spectacular about this joint the food was good the menu was standard
That is not to say that the food isn't good
And while it still retains a wonderful atmosphere and good service I do have to agree with many recent reviewers that the prices are now out-of-line with the quality of the food
By the way some reviews have said things about the food being cold
Liberty Market is my favorite place to go for good coffee good food good people
I enjoy the atmosphere of the place and I love love love good Mediterranean food
They have a delicious dish with cauliflower in a yummy sauce
except in shakers Finally stopped into Sicily to get some pizza after seeing the photos on Yelp
I also tried a Chicken parmesan hero which was top notch containing nicely breaded cutlets nestled in a italian roll with plenty of tasty red sauce and a good dose of melted cheese on top which also had oregeno dusted in for effect
Tasty veggie hash but would've been better had they 86-ed the small bits of meat mixed in I'm a vegetarian
The food the ambiance the service it was all amazing
I'll probably go back eventually but if you're looking for a place to have good Mexican food skip Cien Agaves
Coffee is good food is fair and the service is genuine and welcoming
All dishes were fresh hot and served to us within 10 minutes of our order
If you are getting To Go or Pickup orders they do a nice job of using good quality boxes that keep the food protected and warm
The chocolate topping with the whipped cream tiramisu filling and oatmeal stout deliciousness makes this dessert almost feel like a sexxxy party in your mouth the flavor is fireworks good
The food was really good and who can complain with $2 beers and a nice patio
The table next to me ordered the poblano chicken and the baja burrito and they looked really good from my vantage point
La Condesa is located on 16th Street just north of McDowell in a neighborhood that's no stranger to tasty Mexican food including Tortas El Guero and the popular Barrio Cafe
With no shortage of good Mexican food how does a new place stand out
Stuffed with shredded chicken tomato onion and chipotle sauce the flavors were complex and each bite was sheer bliss
The Swedish called speeders you ain't getting this discount Euro Modern screw-together goodness
Lots of wonderful fresh foods to choose from including organics
We have had overall good food but twice have had cold food and once after 40 minutes they came to the table saying they realized they were out of what we ordered
With that being said I will eat here again because they have some excellent dishes steak fajitas and GREAT margaritas the problem is they are 10 bucks each
I loved it but while the pizzas are good sized - 12 they aren't very substantial and after finishing off a whole pizza myself I had a piece of the bruchetta and two more  pieces of pizza and still was filled
The beef was really good to much sauce though so ask for lite sauce The lo mien was ok needs something
the egg rolls tasted like they had pepper in them good with the sweet and sour sauce
I understand this isn't something they can really change but thought it was worth sharing the observation as eggs are key to most breakfast dishes
Their menu is vast  with many great choices on pizzas sandwiches salads appetizers burgers and some other entrees as well
Based on the food I'd recommend it regardless
I have experienced a steady decline in their food quality of late
Food was good though I agree that it could be considered overpriced but that was completely overshadowed by the horrible service
The booze is cheap and the food high quality
The ambience is fantastic the screen and sound are wonderful and the food is great
We got our dishes medium And spicy but neither had any flavor
Prices are expensive and the quality of food is not that good
My friend had the stuffed chicken which was OK his favorite but compared to the chops not good
It's embarassing how truly flavorless the food is here
Sure it's nice but I'd rather have them concentrating on making the food and making it good
Of course the food at Buca Di Beppo seems to be far beyond any point of return to tasting good
We sat outside and enjoyed a variety of food from the menu
39 wing days - but if you are gonna pay full price for a chicken wing at least you get your moneys worth here
Went to Lo Lo's on Monday and while I was impressed with the chicken the service was not great
First the good the chicken was moist and flavorful mac and cheese & home fries also very good
00 and they get a fairly good sized pizza I think it's their medium and a drink
The pizza was delicious as the teacher I got to make my own
The food was good we only had the appetizers and I love a place that has Stella on tap
In addition to meat and fish entrees the menu offers a wonderful vegetarian dish for each course which included choices like a potato saffron and parsnip soup and a salad that had fennel endive and olives
It's pricey but with it's slow-food focus and its creative meals it's one of those rare places that you feel is actually worth it
I've enjoyed a number of their sandwiches and found them to all be pretty good - granted how hard is it to screw up a grilled chicken breast or reuben
Most of the food was absolutely amazing although I found it to be heavy on the onions not a huge fan and some of it to be too spicy
The pizzas here are awesome and always piping hot
it is even good to dip the crust of your pizza in
The food was good the staff friendly and courteous
Tried it at Food Truck Fridays and man was it worth the wait and $
Haven't been to this location in a while but it had always been solid good food great service awesome beers
The food is creative fresh and generally delicious
The chicken kabobs ask for well done a little dried but brown and tasty with rice and a salad
Try the chicken roll ups tasty with a lil salsa
It has a good positive vibe to it and it's one of the few non-chain dessert spots in the area
if you're ever up for some artery-clogging good food
Instead of having the salad with the cold chicken ask them to substitute it with the hot grilled chicken sliced on top
I also spotted Maine lobster bisque on the online menu and had asked Matt if roux or * was used as a thickener if * then I couldn't have it but like most quality restaurants Wildfish uses only roux
I was happy to learn that afternoon that most if not all the seafood dishes could be adjusted either by leaving off one or more ingredients or by substituting a different sauce which many restaurants are unwilling to do it seems- something to do w/ quality control or vegetable side
The topic of desserts came up soon enough so for those with corn allergies you'll be happy to know that the Cinnamon-raisin bread pudding and Hot chocolate Godiva cake as well as the Hot apple & cinnamon cobbler minus the ice cream- it contains corn syrup and Creme brulee minus the cookies- they contain baking powder but don't worry he'll substitute fresh berries instead
Absolutely amazing food - ask the waiter/waitress for a mint strawberry smoothie with your food
You can order to-go style food in the lounge but the restaurant downstairs also has a market where you can buy a shisha & the flavored tobacco as well as some food
Now I know you don't go to a place called Chicago Red Hots to order Italian Beef your first time in
The food and service were great with large portions and a good selection of organic meant and fish
The menu has pizza salads two appetizers and two desserts
It was delicious one of the best pizza's I have tasted
It's a little odd to be stared at by a giant portrait of a mustached woman while eating such wonderful food
Still has a posterboard near the counter with bizarre letters and postcards from people verbally flagellating their pudendae about how awesome the place is and the food is still tasty
It's the type of place you go when you're craving some good greasy Mexican food and don't particularly mind the thought of getting mugged or having your car stolen
Dessert selection isn't very extensive but who cares when they served up the most amazing Banana Creme Pie
2nd the pizza tastes good the flavor i thought was there
They happened to have a fish fry that night and I happily enjoyed it
The dipping sauce for the rolls was quite good and unique
The food took a little while but it was worth it
I saw a sign that said they have whole lambs and they had tons of stuff like gallon Tahini tubs and cute little tea sets among all the food stuff that looked good too
Great selection of toppings and variety of pizzas HOWEVER it does you no good when you can't taste them with wet dough
The service was stellar and the food was good
So stop on in and enjoy great service and good food
It is rare when you can find a mall with outlet stores discount stores and pretty good entertainment and food to boot
I can overlook the BYOB which honestly I find annoying in a sushi/Japanese restaurant since I love an ice cold martini with raw fish and the sometimes attitudey service and even the ho-hum rolls offered nothing special really
The meat flavor is excellent - great marinade
Our guests thought the chicken fajitas were wonderful
I enjoyed the personal sized thin crust pizza and chicken noodle soup
My hubby loves the rotisserie chicken which he says has good flavor and moist
Seeing an absolutely packed restaurant at noon on a Sunday is definitely a good sign that the food will be well worth the wait
The sandwich was definitely tasty no foodgasm here but a good start to my morning
The food mainly bar fare is good but the chicken sandwich is terrific
However I was surprisingly pleased by the quality of the food
Old Chicago has a decent drink menu so if you feel like accompanying your pizza with an ice cold margarita or beer I promise you won't be disapponted
95 and included a delicious little chicken in coconut broth soup and an egg roll
Maybe it's just that Swaddee and Thai Lahna have such flavorful and authentic main dishes or maybe the chef was having an off day but my sister and I found both of our dishes curry and Pad See Ew to be pretty bland and really greasy
The chicken in my taco was the same good quality perfectly cooked perfectly seasoned
The carne asada meat was higher quality and cooked right a good amount of char to the meat without over-cooking it
After you pick up your favorite fruit drink head over to the grill for some carne asada street tacos but only order two because you'll want to save room for the seafood bar where you will find a deliciouso shrimp ceviche at a very reasonably price
We got some rolls to share some kind of deep fried dragon roll and a special shrimp roll they had that day with shrimp tempura crab and unagi both of which were pretty good
I usually don't even bother reviewing airport food because it's not worth the time
Let's just get this out of the way airport food is usually not that good
LaceyChipotle cream was hard-hitting like Dick Tracy Had a slurp of buffalo chiliBona fide good if only I had a WillyPortions are healthy not large and sillyDessert sampler was flavorful and dreamyMocha Macchiato was caramel and creamyMmmm Mmmm-Smile so big it's gleamyLunch menu less than 475 caloriesPrice points easy on your salaryEntrees change as often as Facebook galleriesWill have to come back for some moreTrying new things is never a boreEspecially if it helps my washboard
What I was able to interpret was that if I wanted to get a as in one veggie spring roll as an appetizer it would take twenty minutes
The portions on the food were generous; I definitely had enough left over to make a good-sized lunch the next day
When I try a new restaurant I pick a dish that I can get at almost any restaurant of that type eggplant parmesan at Italian places pastrami on rye at delis and so on since it's usually a good litmus test for the restaurant itself
In case you don't know which I'm assuming you don't a real mexican taco comes in a floppy yet thick delicious corn tortilla shell with meat cilantro and onions
I used to be stuck on the Chicken but now it's the steak and enchiladas- If it's in season be sure to have some of the cold vegetable salad- Escoveche or something close to that
This place is full of integrity and good food too
the place smelled wonderful upon walking in and everything tasted okay though not as fresh as I would have expected for the price but I was thrown off-guard by the plastic chairs and frozen fishstick-resembling appetizers
The 'strands' were good and the meatballs were juicy
Also they brought all of our food out at the same time which I didn't love because it made everything get cold before we got a chance to eat it
Roaring Fork's entire menu is a blend of comfort food and Southwestern flavors
The happy hour is moderately priced not cheap but given the quality and quantity of the food it's still a great value
The food here is very good I always enjoy the Lasagna the sandwiches are good as well but certain ones can be a bit oily
The chocolate and caramel fleur de sel tart is a testament to the aphrodisiac quality of fine food and it had me moaning at the table heedless of surrounding company who conveniently were also moaning with pleasure after sampling the four berry tart with vanilla gelato so at least I was in good company
In fact it might even be a better investment to go a nontraditional route and just skip right from the appetizers to the dessert course
Today has been a fun day so I thought going to True Food would be a good treat for Kathryn and maybe distract me from other events occuring recently
I hear their subs are tasty and the pizza smelled delish
While I was not hungover the latter form of chorizo was a pleasant surprise and of high quality which made this dish thoroughly enjoyable
Quite the opposite in that fresh quality ingredients are used and a lot of thought has gone into creating the dishes on the menu
The results are some unique dishes that reflect a deep understanding of food and how to combine the right ingredients to yield a complex sophisticated creation worthy of a discerning palate
5 stars because I have been there 5+ times can always recommend it and be thanked never had bad food
Good selection of made-from-scratch Italian food
They use almost like pulled jerk chicken rather than the whole breast that has been marinated in a marinara sauce tender and delicious
The service was good the food okay and half price appetizers at Happy Hour is always a nice bonus
Recently enjoyed a thali dinner which consists of papadum; choice of chutney mango or hot carrot; sambar tomato-based soup; raita yogurt-based soup with cucumbers and spices; daal curry-based soup consisting of lentils and spices; tamarind soup*; choice of entree; two pooris deep-fried bread puffs- I asked to substitute paratha- pan-fried wheat bread; basmati rice; and dessert one pc
This is reliable Mexican/American style food that is always tasty and has yet to disappoint
I felt that for the quality of food that you receive here the prices are reasonable
I've paid more at other places and received food that was far from the quality and freshness that you can enjoy here
I just had a pepperoni pizza and caesar salad but I have had the caesar salad pizza before and it is also really good
The food was incredibly savory--AMAZING
This is the best food I have had in a while so good
They have ready-made foods that are convenient and usuallygood at the counter by the fruits and vegetables section right as you enter and turn left
My friend and I went on a quest for some cheap but still good mexican food
and they have some pretty good sales once in awhile - unlike Whole Foods
The first thing worth mentioning is the adorably cute pizza slice shaped buzzers
My house special chicken was pretty good even though I just can't shake this feeling that the sauce tasted like something more suitable for Mongolian beef
I grew up in the Pacific Northwest and I KNOW what good seafood should taste like
So impressed with everything the freshness of the food the service the ambiance
The pizza -- now yuh gotta understand - I worked at Gino's Pizza on East McDowell before you were born -- was AMAZING
Love their soups and salads and their chicken walnut sandwiches are absolutely amazing
My favorite chicken plate is the Olympic Chicken which is grilled chicken breast with a really delicious black olive sauce
The Moroccan Chicken is also really good and maybe a little healthier with it's herbed breasts honey-yogurt sauce and side of carrots apple and spinach which is not cooked just shredded but surprisingly good
If you want rich flavor go for the Egyptian Chicken which is pan-fried in parmesan cheese and herbs
If you want spicy go for the Chicken Shushka which is more stew-like flavored with lots of paprika
Pita and house-made yogurt-cucumber sauce are still the perfect accompaniments and If you like spicy ask for the spicy green sauce - some kind of minced hot green peppers - the flavors match the gyros meat perfectly
My wife and daughter took me to Secreto's last night for Father's Day Dinner and we were all very impressed with the menu service and food
We had the Peppercorn Crust Burger blah Roasted Chicken Sandwich blah Roasted Sweet Potato fritters so so and scalloped potatoes left half on the plate they were so good
The crab cakes were great the cheese and fruit platter was pretty good Wifey had the beef tenderloin exceptional
None of the food that I ate was particularly very good
Overall it was excellent and I plan on going back especially if it involves happy hour cause the food looked good and the Old Fashioned was fabulous
We ordered the tortilla espanola patatas fritas some semi-spicy chicken dish and calamari which was all excellent
The wine the ambiance the service the FOOD - we had a wonderful and memorable dinner here
The reason I would not give them 4 stars is because the last time I went I asked for VERY hot and the dish was not
The meat was very tender and both elements were tasty but it was a very rich meal
The service was friendly everything was delicious & the meat was tender but I thought the portions should have been larger at almost $13 total
I don't really care how good the service is or how fun the atmosphere is if a restaurant doesn't have good food most other categories don't matter
The Pomegranate tea I had tasted very watered down and the Firecracker chicken I had which was highly recommended by the waitress tasted a lot like a frozen dinner over mildly overdone rice
Had a shredded chicken chimichanga enchilda style red sauce the last time we were there and it was amazing
However all meats sampled were very tasty
Thank you Fogo for a wonderful evening and Gabi for this unofficial meat up
The service is always good and the quality of the food is good for the price
They do have a snack bar with a good selection of food & snacks that are decently priced
The desserts are exactly as described on the menu however after a wonderful meal i was expecting something better
Same price but not nearly the same quality of food
I heard the huge Chicken Pot Pie was excellent but I didn't get the chance to try it
Which brings me to my next point you can create a burrito bowl with great protein and good carbohydrates black beans are better carbs than bread because they burn off slower which makes your body work harder for about 600 calories just ordering black beans no rice meat salsa & sour cream
The bread and pesto they give you to start is phenomenal the lamb meatballs are tender and delicious as was the tzatziki and the shrimp and risotto was perfect as well
The food is very good and reasonably priced
For starters try their spring rolls crunchy and delicious
The food was really tasty and quite flavorful
I think this place is a good hang out spot that has a wonderful and large beer selection and great food
I chose a hot beef dog as my dog selection here
The food was wonderful and the price was great
not only was your food one of the best places ive tried in arizona alone but the experience was well worth it
christopher again thank you for taking us in and not to mention the excellent food
Overall I really enjoyed the atmosphere & food here
Yes the food isn't bad and some of it is actually pretty good
Rest assured the food was fantastic but perhaps a bit spicy for my wife since she is not accustomed to hot foods
In any case the food was filling spicy and tasty
Other dishes enjoyed by our group include the tuna casserole and meatloaf
Oh and the food is fresh amazing and creative
Very good food and good value I'd say too
My chicken burrito which I enjoyed many hours later 30000 feet high somewhere over Chicago was surprisingly good
The food was good I had the lousiana inspired dish I can't remember the exact name
The food is really good and the drinks are strong so you feel like you are getting your moneys worth
The waiters were all really nice and we all enjoyed our food this is now one of our regular dining places
Service was good the venue was very cool and the food was quite good as well which is rare for wedding catering
Tried the seafood platter Clam strips were good coleslaw was fresh and not overly sweet; fries were fresh and didn't taste fishy; but the fish the fish is what will bring me back again & again
A few things I could never do without- Freshly made pesto as good as homemade- Wheat pizza dough- Cascade fresh yogurt- Fair trade and organic coffee by the pound and there's no douchebags grinding the disgusting flavored coffee in the organic grinder- Dr Praeger's veggie burgers- Sunflower multi-grain bread- Double ad WednesdayAdditionally Sunflower has scads of inexpensive store brand canned and boxed items that seem to increase every week
Overall good study spot and the food court in the mall is convenient for when you want a bite to eat D
The pizza was really good with the great wood fired flavor that you can only experience in a few spots such as Bianco and Mozza
Pro Good portions quick service TASTYCon Stingy on the red-eye gravyWe heard about Over Easy on the food Network and Guy's Triple D
I was told by plenty of uber-Thai food fans that this place was the bee's knees but I wasn't too impressed
*definition of soooo nice and helpful She answered all our questions regarding level of spiciness and confusion over which entrees included noodles or rice patiently and with a smile; suggested one of the most delicious fried banana/ice cream desserts I've ever had; and one time she realized we weren't finished with our beers when our tightly packaged food was place on the bar so she spent five minutes undoing the tie to poke holes in the to-go boxes so the steam could escape and not make our food sweaty
The food was really good my friend and a split a salad and a sandwich and it was just the right amount
There are plenty of other places that serve food that is just as good and isn't as snobby as this place
The pita is so big and filled with delicious meat I thought I was going to have leftovers but it was too delicious and I ate it all
My husband got a beef chimichanga and their flavored Ice Tea
Our food was served pretty fast and was hot
The chicken tasted fresh but the flavor needed a little boost of something can't put my finger on it
Would absolutely recommend this to anybody that likes fish tacos -- sooooo good
To sum it up -- good food good service and reasonable prices
We ordered a nice bottle of red wine the dolmeh for an appetizer Paul had the lamb kababs and I had the  Eden's grill chicken
Portions were large and we may end up splitting a lamb and chicken kabab in the future but the good news is we have left overs
CROSTATA their version of pizza BRUSCHETTONE knife & fork bruschetta warm fresh-pulled mozzarella all good but the lamb chops were kick-ass
The food pretty darn good - quite a surprise
I've been there on a few different occassions and the food has been fresh and delicious each time
The Calamari dish is also a small portion but has great flavor
Another good dish is the short rib sliders
I said it was a good idea but I did not want to spend near or over $100 to take the eight of us for a really nice high quality fast food meal
The drive through takes a little longer than these cooperate food factories but it definitely is worth the wait
I recommend the beef tacos or the enchilada platter it comes with an egg on top to help cool your mouth down
I went to lunch yesterday february 26th with a good family friend and I had the roasted chicken sandwich with the pasta salad and he had the Reuben I think
Great food will come back for that but hopefully next time we will have quality service to go along with their quality food
The house special won ton soup was pretty tasty and was loaded with a variety of fresh veggies as well as chicken pork and shrimp pieces
For main courses I went for the Veggie Korma J had the decomposed fish tacos Jeremy had the Steak Salad and Johanna enjoyed the chicken sandwich
And you know what each and every one of those weirdo meats are effing delicious
If they can make beef intestines taste delicious you bet your ass their traditional meat options like carnitas and pollo are equally as delectable
Typical bar fare with certain dishes spicy beer cheese fries that will stay with you and not in a good way
The staff and food are all good here and very cheap
We are all seniors and the food is very affordable and the food is good
The meat was very tender though a bit fatty but I didn't mind since it was very flavorful
This place is for people that appreciate good and unique food
I've been many many times and the service is always good the food is always consistently good and the drinks are not expensive and are potent - I like that
Just had lunch there - Friday about 1230 - had the chicken fried steak special - huge plate of deliciousness - they have 3 lunch specials everyday - Monday thru Friday
not an explanation of why we never got an appetizer after waiting 30 minutes and other people were getting food en mass and served before we did
The site was amazing and our guests are still raving about the food
The dish was greatly presented and the dish was good except the sauce was a little too sweet for my taste
We had started with an appetizer of  Barbacoa nachos of Texas beef brisket Memphis Pork Butt and Velveeta Love $8
It was a pizza with cheese and mushrooms and truffle and so tasty but the crust was too flimsy to hold the toppings but cutting it was awkward and the share plates were too small
The clay pot dishes are also worth a try - really good
I give it four stars because the food is good fresh fast and the service is friendly and quick
It was closing time but the food was still coming out of the kitchen for late customers and it too smelled good
On the other hand if you want honkin' gyros loaded with that delicious melange of meat sauce and fixin's you NEED to give this place a shot
The tab came up to ~$35 an eency bit steep for me for lunch as I probably could have had the same quality of food/service at the Jungle of Pita that is but nonetheless just as excellent and well worth another visit the next time I stop by Scott's and Dale's hood
I won't mention any specific food that we had because there wasn't anything really special good or bad worth mentioning
The foodReally what is there to say about hotel conference food other than blechhh
I have been here before and it has always been pretty good I usually get a half caesar salad and a cup of tortilla soup but have also tried the spring rolls the caeser sandwich pastas and some pizzas
My dish had a lot of flavor and I enjoyed it but it cost around 13$
So this is a good chain to go to when you just saw a movie or are shopping at dessert ridge but it is still a chain and isn't anything mind blowing
We had some of the apps The Trifecta Double Down and Crabmeat and Artichoke Dip and they were good
I toyed with the idea of 3 stars here because the service was attentive the cocktails were good and the food was at least passable
My expectations for this place  are Fast tasty and cheap food
Despite the beans we really enjoyed the food overall
Sandwiches fried chicken even a potato chip/onion dip appetizer
All the food was uniformly good but nothing was terribly original or different
The bread was soft and tasty and the chicken was ok
I have always been impressed with the quality of food that is placed in front of me
Bring your appetite and $15 and you will be full of delicious fried chicken soft and delish waffles and wonderfully cooked eggs
We had their butterfish tataki shishito peppers and tomato salad for appetizer all of which were very good
Tasting the fish I believe it as it was pretty good
For me Roka Akor is just a few good dishes away from being a 5 star restaurant
but its still good pizza no matter how you slice it
Food is pretty great I like the hot dogs the fish & chips and their mac & cheese is really good
burger with fries hot wings fish tacos beef taquitos etc
Staples - eggs milk cheese bread yogurt peanut butter and jelly tofu frozen fruits and vegetables hummus pasta and grains condiments baking items Clif bars bacon canned goods pizza dough crackers instant oatmeal frozen hash browns
Like I said before the Gyro had a generous portion of gyro meat and the meat was pretty tasty but it was lacking in the accoutrement that I prefer
we've sat at the tables couple of times and sushi bar once and have always received excellent service by our server and others who come by to pre-bust our tables
Al the sushi cheft is just absolutely wonderful
the  quality of the food is worth every dollar spent
I've tried a few of their dishes and all have been tasty
I recommend Sofrita to all for Puerto-Rican inspired food that doesn't follow rigid culinary rules
It shouldn't be that difficult for a restaurant to buy quality food prepare it and serve it simply with a smile
That's all i ask Friendly Service & Good Food
I'll be back soon with the hot summer weather I'm already thinking about Stingray Sushi again this week
The food itself is amazing at this location
It's dripping a little with the purest most wonderful olive oil I ain't tasted before and that bread roll I tell ya it's keeping fresh and crisp like it's just meant to be
Come here for some consistently good food knowing you are supporting a local business and don't get too upset when the staff downright sucks; it's not you
I was surprised that a Swedish/Canadian fusion restaurant had such good falafel; better than some middle eastern restaurants in town
Pulled pork and chicken are all good choices but beef brisket is so good
My nephew ordered the chicken panini and it was delicious but cost $7 because it comes with a salad
Good thing the food was too good to notice the slope after the first bite i even picked up my bowl holding it in hand at one point it was so delicious
I do have one structural issue with the sandwiches Mayo is good but french bread is generally a little stiff and chewy when you get the bigger sandwiches the mayo and bread causes the meat to slide out of the sandwich and that can cause a mess
I have had the ahi tuna the firecracker shrimp and the orange chicken and all were delicious
The service can be a bit slow at times but always friendly and the food is always hot and fresh
Really good Mexican food-not the touristy crap or the Scottsdaled up version
It means you get exactly the flavors you like delivered as a wonderful surprise dish
We had 3 rolls - spicy tuna very good hana roll very good and shrimp tempura roll very good
The fish was fresh and the portion sizes were good as well
That is some of the best Thai food I've ever enjoyed
Seeing as it is November and Thanksgiving is just around the corner we went with 'The Pilgrim' roasted turkey/chicken sweet potatoes grilled onions and stuffing and to see how they handle mainstream we also got the 'Royale With Cheese' - yes that is an amazing name
the crunchy and cool sweet yet sour salad was fabulouso and then our hot dish the tomatoes with brown rice were amazing
What is heartening though is that the food is good as well
I really enjoyed my  experience here and would recoomend it to those who love seafood and want an evening of fine dining
Prices are reasonable for the food appetizers $2-7 and dinners $10-20
We agreed that the pizza was good but nothing too special
The bill was less than $20 for the pizza appetizer a glass of wine and a glass of beer
The seafood was good but only so-so in their steak
Overall I think with the price of every dish average of $28-$30 per dish the quality of the food was average
Multiple times we have had amazing service food and a great atmosphere those were all dinners out
But you won't be disappointed with this place the food is consistently good every visit
The enchiladas were perfectly creamy and delicious and the seafood poblano relleno was the exact right amount of spicy
Try the jalapeu00f1o hummus for a great spin to a Greek dish and if you're really hungry I highly recommend any of their lavosh pizzas
within 5 more minutes we placed our order for chicken-fried steak dinners received our appetizers and then  our meals before we could make a dent in the soup and salad
Without a doubt though the best appetizer was the recommended dish from Best Food Ever on the Travel Channel
Unfortunately they did not have the recommended fontina stuffed meatloaf so I went with two other options
My last dish was the big recommendation from our waiter the Pine AZ skirt steak
Skirt steak was one of my favorite mom cooked dishes so I am a good judge
Great service nice decor and good food made for a memorable dinner
The portions one small plate and one smaller entree were just right and the prices very reasonable for the quality of the food
I recommend the half sandwich and soup unless you have a HUGHE appetite and can eat half a side of beef
99 for a pie at this place; but if you demand a better quality pizza give this place a try
Their cold cut sub has tons of meat and is SO much more substantial than what you get at Subway
All the dishes looked amazing and smelled mouthwatering good
My chicken came with rice and black beans a few plantain and tender well seasoned cabbage all excellent
The chicken was fall off the bone good flavorful with just the right amount of heat and just plain tasty
They also serve a variety of vegetarian dishes which look good to an omnivore such as myself
I could easily see eating here once a week lol as I love good Jamaican style food
I noticed that all the dishes were made with top quality local ingredients whenever possible
Came here for dinner while traveling on business; I like to check out local sushi places where I go and this one had pretty good reviews
Overall decent quality fish prices are rather high chefs are pleasant
There is such a selection of mexican food around here that is really really good
The one thing that is really delicious here is the biscuits with chipped beef gravy
Excellent pizza great service family environment in a beautiful setting
Just amazingly tasty simple pizza with quality ingredients made the right way in a brick oven
Well worth the wait - just like the stuffed pizza
The food was good and our waiter was nice but I'd rather spend a chunk of change and go all out at The Olive Garden
The food is so good and there is a great selection
Denny's and IHOP fail to stack up against Joe's and their amazing food and reasonable prices
The chicken friend steak itself was pretty good
In short Great food amazing portion size for the price 50's atmosphere CHORIZO GRAVY
My husband ordered the beef ribs and corn on the cob I have no idea what that cost but our final bill was almost $60 you sort that shit out because 'I can't math' very good
Our food came right away which was good
In comparison the husband's food looked pretty good as I looked on mournfully at his plate and looked back in disgust at mine
First let me say this this food was amazing
Funky lots of personality friendly service and good food at the restaurant
It is a must when family visits or just want good reliable Mexican food
No one flavor stands out and the seafood is chopped up small enough that you aren't going to get a mouthful of any one thing
The dirty rice is very good but the amount was pretty small for the dish
Cons *Food was unimpressive; not bad but certainly not good
As pure fast food this is a good place to check out
As a dinner entree we ordered the soft shell crab roll and let's just say I wasn't impressed
Don't get my 3 stars wrong the food IS AMAZING though I wish they'd serve anticuchos
But oh well I got my Peruvian food like I wanted and his Milano Chicken sandwich was huge around $7 and very very good
We told him we were going to T Cooks for dinner the next night and he recommended certain dishes and gave us more info about that restaurant/hotel
The white pizza is basil garlic ricotta and mozzarella and while the combination is simple the taste is very surprising in that the flavors are robust and fulfilling despite the lack of ingredients
There were three appetizer dinner and dessert choices
I stopped by yesterday with Lindsey F and was pleasantly surprised by all of the unique flavors of ice and custard to choose from Swedish Fish
The staff was a bit rude but the rolls were good enough to have a few
If you are looking for knock out sushi and the whole authentic Japanese experience I would not recommend coming here
But if you are looking for a decent deal and to have a drink and good enough sushi this is the place
I still think it is a pretty good place to eat Cantonese food
I like Chinese beef stew naunam over noodles and this dish was pretty good too
The service was blatantly awful the waiter was rude and only one dish was really good
We both had the beef brisket dinner and they were very good size
The meat had a smokey flavor and the Devil Spit BBQ sauce picked up a bottle only $2
Now I think Bobby Q's brisket is better quality meat but to be fair Famous Dave's is $5 less for the dinner than Bobby Q
The burger was delicious the chicken in the pesto chicken sandwich was cooked to perfection and the fries were awesome although the garlic fries had too much garlic for my taste
The very inexpensive sandwiches vary in quality I found the falafel to be really good the koubideh was OK and the beef shawarma was dry and lacking in flavor
For food quality I consider the nearby Cafe Istanbul to be a better choice; but for price this is the place to go
Second my chicken was ice cold in the center
Plus he said the meat was chewy and low quality
The owners/workers are friendly and the food is worth craving
Other items I've enjoyed that have me returning time after time are the spring rolls and the Pho
I wouldn't mind paying $8 for mall food if it was really good- Sarku Sbarro etc
I would recommend not getting this as the two food main food elements created one salty dish
The refreshments are good and food and drink prices are not inflated and more reasonable that those at the sports stadiums
If a restaurant has ceviche you know the food is good
The man who I assume was the maitre d' was incredibly knowledgeable of the food and background and I really enjoyed talking with him
i gave three stars because despite all the filth and the inappropriate hat i found my food to be delicious and at least seemingly very  fresh i had the burrito patron it was good stuff
Courtney at the drive through window is always pleasant and excited to provide the delicious goods and with the best menu variety in the fast-food game you can always find something to please the palate and the pocketbook
I love sitting at the sushi bar enjoying some good food and conversation
I highly recommend this place a because they give you options and b because their food is yummy
Don't let that freak you out because the food is good the service is good and the price is excellent
Despite the hole-ish nature the food is always good
There is still plenty of goodness in the food sans fish sauce
The food is wonderful the service spot on and the ambiance is first rate hipster   While I've eaten dinner here a couple of times my favorite experience was for brunch
I went with three guy friends and we couldn't believe how good the food was
What a lovely dinner at NOCA  not only is the food really tasty and fresh but the service is wonderful
The food was really good  the amuse bouche was
Plus 1 had the Halibut with a yummy sauce that was good yet I could quite place the reddish seasonings

Food was good and service was fine and more than reasonably prompt especially considering they were rather full
Bottom line Original Hamburger Works is the perfect place to go when you want a quality burger and fries at fast food prices with the luxury of a liquor license
The food overall was good The mussels were fantastic the mezzaluna was ok and the Margherita Pizza pizza was a little too salty but otherwise ok
*********** THE VALLEY'S GREATEST  ************             *********** 5 STARS *************       Every purveyor of Hot dogs Hamburgers and Italian Beef Sandwiches       in the Valley needs to MATCH THE CHC EXPERIENCE
Floridino's has many good attributes including their service their location and their innovative dishes
Floridino's has two delicious and unique dishes calzone and pizza muffins
The first are the Pizza Muffins an appetizer better described as pizza rolls
Maybe the food is worth having I don't know---and never will know either as I won't be back
The shaking beef entree was the best item on the menu though the tofu curry in the hot pot had outstanding flavor
The ahi tuna with mango and avocado was fresh and tasty and I particularly liked the spicy asian roll
The food is good the beer is cool the atmosphere is so-so
As for the food starting with the appetizers they are pretty good as well as unusual
Have something to drink and some appetizers and if you feel like staying and eating more the food is just right for that kind of night
I got a mix of non-raw sushi from Japan Express and all of it was tasty and fresh
Overall Bombay has good service a good location next to Whole Foods progressive menu items is moderately priced and has a good variety of items available for vegans and carnivores alike
We were both impressed with the food it was fresh and delicious
+The table was decorated for our anniversary with colorful heart confetti and we were brought a delicious complementary dessert of chocolate mousse in a chocolate cup and creme brulee
We chilangos ppl  from mexico city love TTT tortas tamales tacos and this place have the best flavor clean  with memorabilia from the city all around the place weekends you can enjoy a toquin music party enjoy the food for long time i will definitely recomend this place to all people who want to eat the real food from Mexico City
Also people are allowed to bring there dogs which is nice if people are good owners but I really don't want a shedding dog around to have his hair fly into my food
The service has always been great and the food is delicious - this will continue to be a family favorite
Food and drink aside any good cafe needs good atmosphere and this one blows everything I've seen out of the water
the ginger dish from the specialties is very good
This is a special place but not because the food is amazing
So this place is special because it is charming relaxing and full of good old fashioned comfort food in the old Tempe tradition
The service and food were just about as good as it gets
Recommend yellow tail and salmon nigiri / spicy ribbon rollTry Orion beer did you know the US versions of Kirin/Sapporo/Asahi are all NOT brewed in Japan
The food is pretty good especially good for vegan fare they've got a decent gluten free menu set up too
Since when do I pay $10 for $4 worth of food to not get served
Food was good and absolutely would recommend for a big outing large group or party
The brisket is smoked and it very tender the chicken is still juicy the pulled pork sandwiches while not the staple in Texas are still quite delicious
and for the last couple years it has been losing its once wonderful food and service qualities
Cold food is Unacceptable and owners lack of concern is a concern
and you used to always be able to request fresh hot items without them using the microwave to warm the food up
I ordered the Bufallo Chicken burger with blue cheese and that was delicious
Nice little shop with 20-30 nice imported cheeses which Krista offered to let us taste a few times and a good selection of cured meats and salumi's
Service  Excellent and I wonder if they're happy because they expect tips above and beyond what you're paying for the food
i was very impressed with the quality of their food espresso and cleanliness of their store
for those seeking quality food at reasonable prices this place is very hard to beat
The salad was fresh and the chicken amazingly tender and flavorful and the cilantro added to the lettuce gave it a nice flavor
Both guests with the tacos were impressed with their flavorful meat but disappointed with the size of them
I positively crave their fries sometimes and I swear I dream about these chicken roll appetizer thingies they have
There is free 3 hour time limit parking available in abundance and a free trolley service that loops around Old Town perfect for those painfully hot days
I tried a white pizza which I enjoyed and a pepperoni for the kids
Go here support these great people and enjoy amazing food
The two fish tacos were served in one dish and even though I ordered one for me and one for my dad I never got the pleasure of trying that delicious taco treat because my dad ate them both
Tacos Atoyac does not mess around when it comes to the taste and quality of their food
All were tasty but the tamale beef-machaca
I thought the food was great they had a garlic infused hollandaise sauce on the eggs benny and the asparagus and the enchiladas were quite tasty
I had little bites of other dishes my friends had and they were all really good especially this one pork dish I don't remember its name but it was a slow braised pork and it was amazing
To sum this up amazing food so amazing that it still gets a 4/5 after this terrible experience not so great service
The food was good lady complained that the spinach tasted sour/bad I thought it was good
I eat plenty of amazing pizza in Chicago but I am now in love with one more
The other thin crust pizza we had was equally as delicious and so were the salads
The food is  pretty good but I would suggest you get it to go for two reasons1 the place is a dump
Like I said the food is good but with these other things going on in the front of the house it makes me wonder what is going on in the back
+Lots of high-end designer stores such as LV Coach Neiman Marcus etc I don't shop at these places so I am indifferent to it but it's nice to see these stores in a smaller city+Glad to see Forever 21 and H&M +Decent food court on the lower level at least there's froyo if you're hot and want froyo
California scramble sans the chicken amazing
Wonderful pastrami accent but definitely didn't overwhelm the meat
The food is pretty good and is a good value
Usually order the Pablo Picaso Salad amazing and the Alfredo the Dark Pasta with Shredded Chicken
3 mini sandwiches w/ham cheese and a Cuban seasoned beef - oh so good - with a side of sweet potato fries
This pita came STUFFED with succulent tasty meat
I would take a bite and while enjoying the deliciousness that permeated my over-stuffed mouth contemplated what to do about the sauce on my fingers
I was pleasantly surprised when my meal came out the chicken sandwich was delicious and I was immediately happy I decided to go with the server's suggestion
That was the highlight of the eveningWhile waiting for the main dishes to arrive it got extremely cold in the restaurant
Seems like a long time but when you consider the freshness of your chicken/fish it's well worth it
My Girlfriend and and I shared the sampler platter which comes with 2 beef ribs 2 pork ribs 1 beef hot link 4oz chopped beef brisket 4 oz chopped pork sholder bread baked beans cole slaw and potato salad for $18
the secret to this slaw is to eat it with your meat on a sandwich I tryed it that way and the flavor profile really complemented the meat
i highly recommend the eggplant parm or meatball sandwiches with the house salad
The service was mediocre the dining area is always very loud and the food was not the quality I have had there in the past
Aside from the groceries that are present with your can goods spices fresh Asian vegetables and your selection of meats and seafood what should draw you in is the small display of cooked and prepared foods in the back
When ready and fresh are delicious and convenient to buy and take home to eat for dinner which will save you the time to prepare these Vietnamese dishes
It's the best sports bar food I've had in the area the booths are really comfortable and there are a ton of high quality HD TVs
Overall Blue 32 is a great place to come for good food and drinks while you're watching your favorite team
It tasted like boiled beef in a peanut sauce that was somehow laking the peanut flavor
Our hot tea was as authentic as it gets my wife's green tea was indeed green and earthy as it should be The food all looked good and there was a fantastic variety
Next time I'll be sure to bring cash to tip that guy for the tasty food he put out for us
The food is good the wine list is okay but as usual it's really just another chain restaurant
I just had the regular hot dog which was Vienna Beef good stuff but they also sell Italian andoulli brats polish sausage and even veggie dogs for our vegetarian friends we all have at least one right
Here's what we ordered- Spring rolls non-fried vietanmese style - Very good and included two large rolls with peanut dipping sauce
Came with hashbrowns and the food was tasty
I felt like I got a good amount of food for my $$
Great coffee shop featuring- tasty espresso - beans roasted on site- ample parking- ample seating indoor and out- free wifi - password 'titusblend'- good music and not so loud it keeps you from concentrating- friendly staff- open until 10- food menu but sandwiches only served until 3 - after that it's pastries cookies etc
The food was great drinks were yummy- I had a blue curacao martini that was so good
So we went back to try the deep dish and waited over 45 minutes for a table what a waste and after ordering and praying it was gonna be as amazing as everyone says it is it was
If you are looking for a quick bite and want quality food Vitamin T is a great choice
For dessert we had their creme brulee which came with a berry compote and nuts on top very very good
Each time we've been there the service has been great the place pretty clean and all of the dishes ordered have been either good or really great
The waiters were apathetic and the food was cold
The food was really good but on the pricey side
There was nothing really Arizona about it just good food
I've heard the soups are good and the desserts looked awesome but I'm not sure if I'll return
I'll hold back on the final star until I have a chance to sample their food but I still recommend it to anyone looking for a swank experience in downtown Phoenix
the dinner rolls are to die for and the kobe beef appetizer is perfect with the truffel oil
This little hole in the wall was recommended by the concierge at the Arizona Biltmore since we were looking for some authentic Mexican food
While Geisha-a-go-go is nowhere close to a hole in the wall they do serve damn good sushi
The rolls were all delicious and tasty although nothing I special but so far the best I've ever had since living here
The really good part of that dessert though was the coconut gelato which I found out they order from a local gelato shop
The guy who run's the place is wonderful-- we were there and the power went out from the storm and he just kept on making our food like there was nothing to it
Decent food good temp tastes like what it's supposed to sans hair ect deserves some credit
The Kobe burger is of course excellent but the asparagus salad with chicken is also a winner the chicken wings are just plain delicious and their specials are always a safe bet save for one unfortunate--and I hate to even call it this when it was some bastardized version--French onion soup
The food is pretty good quality and is very inexpensive which is great for a college student I also used to work 2nd shift and their prepare meals were a much yummier alternative for dinner than having a sandwich or gross frozen meal
I've rented a bike there and liked the guys working there - a guy nicknamed Fish helped me out and is a good guy
They are not near as cheap as fast food pizza joints but it's worth the price
Although a lower quantity of food the quality was high enough that it worked out
Mega Veggie was good but the potato pizza was outstanding
Husband's buffalo chicken ranch pizza was also pretty good
The 1st thing I asked aboutand the ENTIRE reason I suggested this place  was the AMAZING Cherry Bread pudding dessert I had the first time I went
For a world class restaurant I was disappointed even though the food was good
While it was still tasty I don't think it fair to review a place based on day-old cold pizza
I tried it anyway inspite of the title and I'm glad I did because the chicken was tender and really tasty unexpectedly
The Im-port mixed drink was very unique in flavor and almost sweet - reminiscent of a dessert port
I'll let it slide though because he was so good otherwise and brought us tons of other yummy food and drinks quickly after we placed the order and I applaud him for that on such a busy night the end of restaurant week this past Sunday
We settled on the appetizer beef ribs crispy chicken gingerroot style half portion and a crispy pork dish with green chiles and onions on a sizzling platter
The chicken was juicy and the sauce served with it added a delightful flavor
It comes with a fried egg on top and the meat is served crispy which gives it a somewhat sticky texture but it was delicious and full of flavor
My boyfriend enjoyed putting some of the sauce for the beef ribs on the pork as well
We had been once before and thoroughly enjoyed the food
Either way I'll be back and am looking forward to enjoying their food and wonderful clean restaurant
Relax in the loungey bar area and take advantage of the all-night happy hour tidbits sit at the sushi/robata bar and schmooze with the chefs and enjoy their recommendations or grab a private table and sit back for some pampering
The food we ordered and received was good and I'm sure the food we ordered but didn't receive would've been equally as good
I got the Korean spicy beef which was good others in my party got the Tempura which came with Lotus Root yum the ramen noodle bowl and yaki soba
Julio's Too is very reasonably priced and offers the same quality of food as the main restaurant
When I have a craving for Mexican food I usually lean towards Julio's because it is close to home fast and cheap but sometimes when I am really in the mood for some good beans I have to go somewhere else with better beans
We had called in advance to see if Chris could prepare a vegan meal a request he gladly obliged and we were welcomed warmly in various ways 1 A lovely greeting from Chris excited to meet the vegan with additional questions about how food can be prepared 2 prompt opening of our bottle of red to get us started 3 a cozy seat by the fire outside while he prepared appetizers
The food was fresh and delicious though I think he may have been timid and slightly insecure about not being able to cover anything on my plate with cheese
So regardless of the food which sounds odd because that's the main component of many of our reviews here his contagiously friendly personality openness and fervor for food were worth many more stars than this rating system will allow
This was totally baffling considering the level of food and drink quality associated with the Phoenician resort and the steakhouse itself
It was good chicken I have certainly had better other places
When the food came it was presented well on a big tray and everything looked good
Now a bourguignon should have cubed beef and the onions carrots and such should be cooked in the broth for over an hour infusing them with the flavors of the sauce
So if I say no does that mean I'm going to have to listen to him rave on about how good their food is and help me read their laminated over-produced menu
We had the brownie sundae for dessert and it was delicious
Either way the food had a good taste and a great price but just doesn't agree with my sensitive 'personality'; I guess
-/Alas I live to fight the good food fight in this ever lasting battle
The sauce on the ribs was not overpowering but did give some flavor highlights while allowing the beef's flavor to come through
our table enjoyed and sampled the veggie thai basil pasta burma gai my favorite dish of the night best curry i have had
i also enjoyed the j's teriyaki chicken and thai chow-mein
we also started with the chicken satay the peanut sauce was delicious
We ordered rattlesnake as an appetizer and it tasted like fried whitefish
The sauce on the meat was delicious and the seafood was well cooked as in tasty
We got their recommendation and ordered us some chicken tenders which I might add are only
Mamang had never experienced Greek cuisine before so this beautiful evening outdoor dining ambience- lighted palm trees waterfall- and tasty food was a perfect send-off for our gorgeous grandmother who was homesick living on US soil for the past six months
I often pick up some new type of noodle fried goodie or odd food that I can't get anywhere else in Phoenix except maybe Lee Lee's but I don't wanna drive way the ef out there
My food was great I started with the scallops for my appetizer they were almost perfectly pan seared and tasty
I highly recommend the Jerk Chicken if you like hot food
I just like the feeling of eating good food and not ending up a bloated beached whale
Even after I shared a Chocolate Monsoon Soynami for dessert I could still walk out the door feeling good about what I put into my body
They've got some good salads and they don't blink an eye when you start asking for more of this and less of that as they're putting them together but if they want more stars they're going to have to bring back that chicken or was it turkey sandwich with the chipotle aioli avocado and jicama slices
The rest of the food all looked tasty and well-portioned
I added a really good meatball made of ground beef only my pet peeve for a dollar and then was forced into the $1
So-so food extremely loud restaurant- it will take a while before I consider to give it a second shot
Sirloin Kobe Burger and the all Kobe Beef Hot Dog
They've done a good job of hanging doorknob flyers and having a guy stand out on Elliot Road waving a sign so they got my attention and I took the plunge and bought a pizza
It isn't the typical Pizza-Rut so-much-grease-it-fries crust but a good yeasty bread crust
I enjoyed chicken tenders and fries for $6
Rokerij is our never-fail for great food a relaxed cozy and unique experience just for two or for a group of good friends
Fish specials are always tasty with well paired seasoning chutney or sauces
The quality of the toppings is quite a bit higher than most of the pizza places around here
-good amount of bathrooms clean and no lines-gate/flight info is easy to find anywhere-stunning view of the landscape from the wall of windows at the end of Gate D-baggage area is clearly labeled and easy to navigate -good signage all over-there are tiny finches instead of rats hopping along on the floor looking for food At LaGuardia you're far more likely to find the latter
The food was amazing -- I can still taste those griddle cakes BUT the service left something to be desired more about that later
I know I know five minus two is three but I just couldn't bring the food rating that low It was THAT GOOD  In fact I think I'm heading out now for some of those griddle cakes
Do I really need another way to feed my addiction to cheesy beefy goodness
The happy hour prices make it affordable but the food quality still doesn't match the price
The tuna for the hot & spicy tuna roll and the lollipop was so over diced that it was actually mushy
last time I made Beef Wellingtons with them and were so impressed with their quality that I had to come back for another two
We enjoyed the Cajun Santa Fe and chicken avocado
The atmosphere is great food is good and deserts are tasty
the southwestern eggrolls burned the skin off the roof of my mouth and the boneless wings were sauceless and cold
It's a freaking chain but they do have decent food and good margaritas
I will have to go back and see what other meals they have but I think the food would be good
Good food is worth the wait; the mutton stew is not
3 The tater tots were delicious and a great side with my chicken caprese sandwich
While the price felt a little steep for the volume of food received the quality of the pizza as well as the AMAAAAAAAAZING AMAZING AMAZING FANTASTIC staff ultimately made the $20 I threw down feel like a value
My best man and I enjoyed a broccoli chicken pizza and like usual it was good
This is also the same woman that thought Mac-n-Cheese was a sandwich -_- anyways I enjoyed my food and you will too
Not so much because of the food which was ok not good or great
grilled chicken panini mahi mahi sandwich Haagen Dazs malts a few very good wines fun beer combinations
The spinach and artichoke dip is to die for I had the steak sandwich and my friend had the pizza with pasta on top of it - both were so so so good
Pretty reasonably priced and the food and wine is delicious
It's hard to choose what to get everything looks amazing but the hubby and I settled on the sopressata and ricotta pizza
Both paired wonderfully with the selected wines and the vegetables worked into both dishes in such a way that they both had a good clean flavor to both of them
I can also honestly say pretty much all the food is good well at least the appetizers and desserts
My biggest problem with my two choices yesterday and with every visit I've ever made here is there is just not much flavor to the food
I would highly recommend this place to anyone as we had a fabulous time and some great food
The waiter was very friendly and was good about checking on our table to see how our food was refills desserts etc
Good food nice atmosphere but nothing memorable
The roast beef sandwhich was good but the ambiance is what really did it for me
But their ripe produce tasty deserts just-chopped meats are definitely worth the trip; also within this repelling at first hub for commodities sits an eatery to the left from the entrance Al Hana the orgasm in your mouth
We recommend the Shafta or the Shwarma beef or chicken with the garlic sauce wow
For our entrees I had the hickory smoked baby back ribs good but not phenomenal and husband ordered the chorizo chicken- I am so glad he shared a bite with me because it was awesome
Their spice selections are standard and they have recipes for sauces on a board WAY high in the air I missed it until someone pointed me in the right direction but the grillers cook your food in a way that kind of creates a flavoring that is a melange of the other things cooking
My only complaint is that the food came out a bit cold
Friendly and fast service decent prices and good food
Other than the atmosphere the food is really good
I always order my food 'thai hot' and my little to-go box has a little smiley face on it
Good food reasonable price and a unique local business
Delicious food crafted with love from ingredients grown  milled and locally sourced by the chef/owner
Called Management later to complain about the low quality food and service
We really enjoyed the food except my lamp chops were so rare that it turned my stomach a bit
It was worth stopping - very good lamb vindaloo spice level 7 - packing some heat and a variety of other dishes that we tried
I got the bocca trio which had 3 different types of meat--that was pretty good
Without it it's just a completely flavorless pizza - even with the 3 meat toppings that we had ham sausage and pepperoni
My husband had the fish tacos which were good
and I must say I was very impressed with the menu selection and the quality of the food
We ordered the chicken wings as an appetizer and if I'd have known how good they were going to be
I ordered the curry 'thai hot' and though it didn't make me sweat and cry as I am prone to enjoying with Thai food it definitely had some substantial heat
Unfortunately I was unimpressed with the food
Yes they make a good michelada but the food itself is too fried has too much lard and just doesn't have much charm
Cliff notes- Cheap $1-2/plate- Fast It's ready-to-go and on a conveyor- Acceptable quality I'm here weekly and haven't gotten sick lolThis place is definitely good for what it is it being a budget-friendly sushi place that's great for a quick bite
This place has a business model based on selling in large volumes hence the low prices like wal-mart so they're gonna have to reduce costs somehow so-so quality food not-so-attentive staff and slightly smaller than average portions but it's still a solid bang-for-your-buck kinda place
I'm very picky when it comes to fish quality
This is a very unique dish if you like rich flavored sashimi
Even friends from Japan are surprised with the quality of their fish - especially for AZ
I think I liked the ambiance more than the food but the food was good too
India Garden's food is as good as the best ones we tried in LA
I had the Friggin Chicken which was friggin delicious
On my way out I stopped at the coffee bar for a latte which was much more bold and flavorful than your Fast Food Coffee variety; a great way to finish off my lunch
The Food and the atmosphere  are fantastic and all of the food we had was very good
Vincent's pizza is not bad but it's certainly not tasty enough to endure the shady business practices and poor service that accompany your meal
There are pizza joints all over town many can be found in this area that provide deliciously mouth-watering pizza served by courteous professional smiling faces
The pizza finally arrived fresh and rather tasty although simple and we made note of that
I had the grass-fed beef burger with feta sans bun and the famous sweet potato fries as a main and both were excellent
I enjoyed the pizza there but not sure if I would go out on a limb and say it was worth the wait
My GF BF and I have also ventured off the sushi menu and tried their shabu shabu swish swish Sunday night special and the most amazing Asian dish I have ever had called Gyu Don Nabe it's on the kitchen specials board
Tried Torched Goodness at Food Truck Fridays
I recommend at least checking this place out if you are tired of the same old bargain bag run of the meal selection of produce and meats
The jerk chicken and rice was very dry and lacked the grilled flavor that usually comes with Caribbean jerk chicken
Very personal service some good conversation and excellent food and wine
The quality of the food at Matt's is memorable for its flavor temperature and love which is clearly sprinkled generously on top of every buttery bite
I happen to think Phoenix food in general is pretty darn swell and in my white girl opinion I also happen to think that iKitchen's food is wonderfully delicious
Got their Taiwanese chicken and special vegetable soup and it was really good I just looked on their online menu I don't remember what this soup was called whatever it was it felt delicious and hearty and healthy feeling
- Server here is wonderful and always recommends dishes for us to try
The food at Someburros is on par with any good Mexican restaurant in the Valley but it is fast and inexpensive
I had the chicken and it was perfectly cooked with that great charred flavor that one would expect from a charbroiled preparation
I recently visited and while I thought my food was good the service was seriously lacking
If we were not having such a good time talking there was a group of us I am sure I would have been even more annoyed at how slow it was to get  our food out
I really enjoyed the the food here just like I remembered the night of the OYE
I am sitting here waiting for my food so I will give an update on how good this one is
But the food is absolutely as good as it gets
For mains hubby got a delicious pizza
I ate a seasonal pumpkin pasta dish which was a bit too al dente for my taste but still delicious
For dessert we shared the applesauce cake which was delicious
So for pros--Comfy chairs and thank god for that because the service was sloooooooow--Good food--Takes reservations--Has their own parking--Love the rollup doors for a fresh breeze--Quality cocktailsCons--Really ugly chairs and tables think Denny's ugly--Small portions--Really slow service in a half-empty restaurant
I went to a different location years ago and thought it was really good so came to this one and the food is not the greatest but not bad either
The excellent food does come at a high price $$$$
I'd still go back because the food was delicious but the billing mistake was a huge inconvenience
I thought the wine and food were fine the booth was a good spot
I was unable to eat my food that night as I wasn't feeling well but I can tell you that it's pretty good reheated the next day
the house hot sauce served in large red bottles is tasty -  ask for a bottle when you pick up your food
My daughter and I go here on a regular basis and the food is good
I was pleasantly surprised - the food was delicious
I'd like to give it another chance because the food was very good but I'm really hesitant
I like this place because it has a ton of stuff in such a small building - food for cats/dogs; toys; treats; pet supplies - you don't have to wander around a PetSmart or a PetCo when you have this place packed with things;  They are usually run by friendly high-school aged kids that amazingly know or have been well-trained on a lot about pet nutrition and the brands they carry
Prices are good too - we compared what we pay for our big bag of food to PetCo Petsmart doesn't even carry Solid Gold and we are paying less by buying it here and supporting a local business
They could have served it with a roll 1/2 the size and eased up on the amount of the apricots which totally masked the flavor
In the end that makes me slow down and appreciate my food a little more which is another good thing
Had Spiedini appetizer caprese salad house greens wise guy & marghuerita pizzas
The toasted buffalo chicken on parmesan oregano bread is excellent- make sure to add more buffalo sauce when building your sandwich
The service is excellent and efficient  We started with the egg rolls as an appetizer which were dee-lish-ous
It was pretty good food a little less sauce though on both dishes would have been preferred
I was walking downtown with some friends and happened to see Thai Elephant whose Tempe location is fairly good so I convinced one to go in and split a dish with me
I expect Mexican food to be what you find at your buddies grandma's house that's what makes it soooo good
There are two things that keep Maizie's from being five star in my book1 - It is so warm that I felt like I was having early onset menopause2 - They are in an unfortunate location if you are going northbound on Central because you have to flip a biatchHere are the things that make Maizie's pretty awesome1 - $3 Burger Night Monday2 - $3 Beers during HH3 - $5 Bruschetta that is freaking amazing4 - Awesome bathroom with tasty smelling orange lotion5 - Cool looking bar6 - Big open windows7 - Cool Aesthetics8 - Kung Fu Girl Riesling9 - Friendly accommodating staff especially for our large party10- Lot's of options for everything Food Wine BeerI really liked Maizie's a lot and I cannot wait to be back
Buono's pretty consistently delivers a good pizza
The meat toppings pepperoni sausage are delicious and have a nice spice
Yes I know it sounds weird but it is so good you will end up eating the entire pizza by yourself even if you tell yourself you're only gonna eat half
Price is pretty good maybe slightly pricey for breakfast i think the pizza is like $9 ish but completely worth it
I came here based off of a recommendation of one of my best friends and absolutely loved the Quattro Formaggi pizza; the gorgonzola cheese gave the pie a full-bodied flavor
The pizza is more new york style with decent toppings and a good med grade crust not too thick and not too thin that folds easily if desired
All the food is good but not fantastic given the prices
But if you are a trendy chic diner you should pass and try something fresher in ambiance and food but equally expensive think Scottsdale's overblown newer mega-restaurants which are the new Durant's except with Sushi or Asian Fusion or oversized Southwest flavored creations with names taken from Cactus varieties
the food was ready fast and like i said it was really really good
So overall it lives up to everything a dive should do--cheap good basic food
I honestly feel a bit bad giving Wildflower a three star rating but I'm honestly waiting for the time when I feel impressed with their food
the rest of the meal was good but the temp of everything was like it had come off the buffet we also like our Indian HOT so we ordered accordingly and there was NO heat in anything we got so they brought us some hot sauce to add to it and that was super mild as well  my dinner also came with dessert and coffee or tea I ordered tea but it never came and my dessert again was brought off the buffet
We saved enough room for dessert Bread pudding best ever  american neapolitan ice cream crazy good and birthday cake were our desserts The so-called birthday cake was a triple decker yellow cake with chocolate frosting
All of the flavors complimented each other 100% My boyfriend gave me a bite of the taco's he got and I must say the fish was exquisite
His chicken quesadilla was so flavorful with a spicy kick in the oh so tender chicken
Literally all of the food was brought out cold
We asked for medium but all three dishes were hot
It's nothing spectacular its just a good price and a lot of food
My steak was cooked to perfection and I felt that aside from the lack luster side dishes it was worth the money
The sauce on my chicken was also very thin - I've had Chicken Marsala before at other restaurants and the sauce was thick and flavorful
i wouldn't recommend this restaurant when there are so many others out there that have really good food
Now having been to a few more restaurants of all varieties I can unquestionably say that food here is not bad nor good but it's great if you're a six year old who doesn't know the difference
Ordered the appetizer sampler with -CROQUETAS DE JAMON PAPAS RELLENAS and meat empanadas
the food is delicious think deli simplicity quality ingredients and the atmosphere is comfortable and relaxing
As far as the food I've really only had the fried pickles which are amazing
Prices on drinks are great they have a good happy hour and I have never been disappointed by the food
The rolls are small and  shriveled the quality of the fish is mediocre not fresh but not fishy either
I love Sushi and this was pretty good sushi
We enjoyed a stroll throughout the property post entertainment dinner and drinks and I was impressed with the layout of the property and the many resort/spa options
I'd been there before a dozen times and the food was always good if not a little expensive
Starbucks and Wholefoods is a good mile down the road on Baseline
The fish was crispy and not at all greasy and the porotbellos had amazing flavor
There were so many other delicious looking options including a summer orange shrimp salad that I can't wait to go back for and the best part was that without even trying I managed to end up picking a fish taco made with sustainably farmed fish
I can tell that they use low quality meat chiken etc
The service was good and the pizza was fantastic
The thai pizza was good but had a tad too much of the sweet sauce
I explained how much I liked the gumbo and she let me try the sausage and chicken gumbo on the house and it too was also a tasty classic gumbo delight
Overall though we were definitely impressed with the food and would definitely return
For some reason EC Uno falls far short of EC Dos in terms of food quality
Anyway food was dry and far less flavorful than the meals we regularly get at EC Dos
The salsa is fresh the food is great and the staff seems like they actually care if you're having a good experience
I've been to local restaurants and gotten fish tacos that weren't as good as the ones at Rubio's
I think the consensus between most of them is that the food is good and the owner gives a good performance
The entire dish from the superb presentation to the tasty rice and beans to the incredible main dish with the sauce was perfect
Their favorite dishes- Mediterranean platter especially the eggplant dip- Veggie stir fry which is technically a side but really large enough to be a mainI had beef gyro both time and would thought it was good but I would have preferred lamb
knowledgeable server good atmosphere and sushi that melted in my mouth like butter
20 minutes later after everyone else in the restaurant except us was served that includes people that arrived well after us with similarly sized orders to boot the waitress hands out the appetizer chicken wings
Pretty good for leather but masquerading as beef is a bit harder
2 stars for the authenticity and quality of the food lack of chips prices not in line with the level of quality of the food and totally overdone vibe
At their prices for beer and food there's no way we could've stuck around for 6-7hours which is too bad because I think we had a god shot
My wife's sandwich was awesome it had a nice smoke flavor to it that kind of reminded me of meat cooked over a camp fire
Hubby ordered chicken torte aka sandwich which was good and spicy enough
I must say that I was impressed with both the soup itself along with the tender cuts of white meat chicken fresh mushrooms and whatever galangal shoots are
It was very flavorful not a huge dish but came with Calamari Rings Shrimp and fresh Clams with the Shell for effect
The dish was ordered Thai Hot and was topped with a plentiful amount of fresh sliced uncooked Jalapeno rings
The dish was of course served with a side of white rice to spoon the goods over before eating to make it a bit more filling
I can't tell you how many times I have walked into a Thai place in the area and been royally disappointed in the flavor and quality of the cheap food
The forbidden rice was really interesting and the whole dish was amazing
I did post photo's of the meal on Food Spotting
The food is good and healthy but I just wish they were a bit nicer when seating people
It was a full 40 minutes to get appetizers an hour until we got food
They have some tasty food and all of the wines I had were great and all of the many many others looked fantastic as well
While the beer is indeed cold and the food edible it boasts a menu so small you would assume it was owned by a Scottish expat
I would like to see organic produce/meats and wild fish/shrimp utilized in the cuisine but alas this is still a tasty healthy-ish place to eat
It is served with a great hot sauce and sweet moist dinner rolls
If you love a good catfish in cornmeal I dare you to find any better in this town without making it yourself
With a 4 star rating I was expecting 4 star quality food
The rice was also seasoned probably and tasted almost as good as back East Chinese food it just wasn't brown
Orange chicken was good but a little hard
If you go there and find certain foods you like it's probably worth the $5-$6 to go back and eat as much as you want of those particular foods
Skip the bad stuff and eat all of the good tasting foods
The tacos come in 3's and are quite tasty I recommend the fish
There are certain menu items appetizers burgers daily specials that are great and there are others fish & chips and the pizza that are just not good in my opinion
My best advise is find a few dishes you do like and stick with those  The beers here are good but not phenomenal; it would be nice to see 4 Peaks expand as a brewery with new beers
i guess i should be asking the more poignant question why is their food so effing good that i brave the elements and the parking and the waiting just to come here
pizza is a dream salads are heaven and the ice cream on a hot cookie is perfectly divine
Different than but every bit as good as fish tacos
I ordered the Caesar Salad for an appetizer and the chicken with gnocchi for my entree
The chicken while it was tasty left me hungry
For dessert we shared some kind of chocolate souffle cake with goat cheese but it was very dry and didn't have much flavor
His Pizza's are delicious try something different every time you will not be dissapointed
His place is small and cozy he does have some servers that can occasionally need a kick but the food and some good wine will erase that thought pretty quickly
Everything here is flavored so well and the dishes are delicious
The food was wonderful and the presentation was great
We ended up ordering several appetizers We got the sliders ok too much bread not enough meat & side of fries crab cakes 2 pieces average tasting  lettuce wraps grounded chicken with tofu tasty & the ahi tuna unusually served as a round pie good and super filling
Overall the service and food left us with a good stuffed feeling
So I finish my meal the cool bartender takes my bill and drops a free shot on the bar for me a vodka chocolate thing he calls dessert for me
It was all delicious and we all loved ours but my personal favs were Sergio's Pork Tenderloin and the Chicken Enchiladas
My meal the Chicken Enchiladas was technically an appetizer but it was SO much food overflowing with sauce and cheese I don't know how you would split this as an app and my recommendation is take it as an entree
It was a place we went all the time but lately not as often not because the food isn't excellent but because it is quite pricey
Go to the bar and have a pre dinner drinkeat in the bar if you can Order a good bottle of red and some meat
I thought the food was just as good and as I live in Tempe I will be frequenting that location
The food is amazing bbq pork is the way to go
Talk about making healthy food fun and tasty this place does just that
They have all kinds of foods including tacos and Thai dumplings which I had for an appetizer
The beef empanadas were very good; it's just shredded beef cooked up in puff pastry
I normally don't like to rag on a place but have been coming here for a while because the food is excellent
Amazing selection of stuff ethnic produce meats deli items bakery and ICE CREAM
The quality of fish is on par with most high end sushi places and they offer a full list of different Shochu which was a new expereince for me
It's not cheap but very good and goes well with the sushi
The menu is wonderful and creative with everything from tasty and healthy sandwiches and salads to decadent sinful desserts
These are fresher greens than I've gotten in most soul food places and the hottness was new as well
The chicken and cornbread arrived and the smokey saucy flavor poured out
Really great flavor but the chicken was a bit too dry for me
While we waited we finished the sides ate up the catfish which had an excellent breading and the fish was juicy tender then we ate the cornbread
The beef with broccoli and general's chicken weren't bad and even though the texture of the stuffed mushrooms and fried dumplings were off-putting the flavors were nice
Lastly the food is really really good
I reaaaally want to be on board this band wagon but I just can't find the flavor in the pizza
The quality of the food was true to Fago's high standards but the service was over-the-top-annoying
In my world along with food quality dining service is equally important if not more-so
The chicken parm sandwich and dinner are both equally good and the meatball sandwich deserves honorable mention as well
It's finger-searing hot a dripping mess of thin-sliced beef with grilled peppers onions and melting mozzarella cheese a satisfying handful of goodness that's begging for an extra dollop of hummus or garlic sauce to create a stream of perfect bites
An easy dish to prepare it contained fresh basil chiffonade that pushed it from good to great
This is not fine dining but the food quality comes close
My dish came with side of guajillo mashed potatoes - which look like a pile of mashed sweet potatoes - I personally wasn't a huge fan of the taste but as usual I'll finish my plate anyway The service was pretty good it was just a very laid back environment which I wasn't really expecting for some reason
Despite 3 hours this turned out to be a good spot for entertaining my out-of-town friend especially since she loves pizza and is highly susceptible to hype
I know I fully enjoyed the diablo pork emerald chicken and most important of all the jerked fried chicken
The dumplings and mu shu were tasty and traditional like I would get back home in NY but the orange chicken was different
Light and airy yet fantastically flavorful the quality of the coffee really makes this dish a reason to go back again and again
Add to this a nice selection of unusual dishes good assortment of vegetarian selections and yes even a daily Happy Hour
Crispy beer-battered and made with real fish and served with damn good fries
There are a lot of hassles to deal with when you eat here but the food and the brew make it worth it
In the reviews I remembered that the chicken salad sandwich got good reviews
I enjoyed a pork burrito stuffed with meat cabbage cheese rice and beans
When you're trying to think of places to take out of town guests particularly ones who are expecting good Mexican food because hey Arizona is close to Mexico take them to Barrio
The Parlor is a pretty place and the salad was outstanding but I wish you good luck with the pizza
I went here a little over a week ago with my uncle and aunt who are both from Japan born and raised and they were very impressed as well by the quality of the food and service
Hiro is modest in design but what it lacks there it makes up for in quality and integrity of the food and service
Anyways The food generally is pretty good DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU ORDER and be careful how you word it because YOU ARE GOING TO GET EXACTLY WHAT YOU ASK FOR
I also attended a wedding that was held here and all the food was delicious
The food was very good my cafe latte was fantastic
I would also recommend Bento Box A which includes Yakiniku Beef w/ Cabbage steamed rice/mixed veggies Teriyaki Chicken green salad w/ ginger dressing edamame and an egg roll
The service was excellent; my pizza was not
That might have been forgivable if the other things about the pizza were good but they weren't
Food was good service good and there were pretty people everywhere
I think their food is too small and not high quality enough for the prices they charge
This is the most amazing Whole Foods I have ever been to
The first time I went the hot food did not look appetizing
My second trip - I came here for lunch with a coworker who recommends this place for cheap affordable and good Chinese food
I couldn't decide what I wanted because the food just looks okay it didn't look appetizing in the hot food section
chock full of beefy cheesy spicy peppery goodness
Of course that life extension strategy will only work if the mob doesn't come after me with torches and pitchforks for writing that a good Chicago Italian Beef Sandwich is better than a Philly Cheesesteak
I mean the food was good but I guess they fail on presentation I mean it kind of reminded me of a hospital cafeteria and the bags of chips with your meal
I counted 88 food choices plus condiments & some standout items were the long tender salad asparagus spears Maraschino cherries delicious spare ribs & crispy fried chicken
Certain things didn't work for me including the gooey fried rice & I wasn't crazy about the seating setup but there were plenty of food choices available to build yourself a tasty meal in this busy place
When you're drunk the pizza here is pretty amazing and they have several varieties
I ordered the Beef Panang and it was AMAZING
When I'm looking for something a little more reserved and I want good sushi I go to Sakana
The portions are VERY generous the atmosphere is quiet and cozy the staff is happy and friendly and the focus is on good food not a cool image
We couldn't finish our food and it was just as delicious when we finished the leftovers the next day for lunch
Individually delicious but rarely do I feel that foods combined so well in my mouth as did the cod with the pickled onion and mustard
Sure it was pricey but for the quality of service the taste of the food the exquisite setting it was worth every penny and more
I grew up on Southern food and this place was not tasty at all
The pizza was very tasty -- there was some kind of cheese asiago or parm
I have been wanting to try Famous Dave's for a while now and finally got the chance to experience some wonderful food
Service was marvelous and food was worth every bite
The pizza very tasty we had the Stallion pizza - or the meat pizza
26 before tip for one pizza one appetizer and two sodas dinner for two
The food is wonderful-The Volcano Nachos are towering feasts of wonder and are made for more than one person to eat
ordered another shrimp dish which was wonderful
Although the chicken feet came out fresh since I waited 15 minutes for it it was not good
The food was delicious and you should expect nothing less
Seriously I would live here just for the gourmet goodies alone and then add the stellar menu of deelish goodies like croque madammes fig pizza creamy yummy oatmeal and a latte with liquid raw sugar
She enjoyed her brisket and my chicken was heavenly
Genuine upscale restaurant - good food service and ambiance
I usually order the fish but occasionally order two appetizers instead
this is a short trip for me as anyone who knows me will tell you I am willing to travel REALLY far for good food
My parents had salads and my mom had some eggplant dish and both of them were quite impressed as well
The food choices are typical for a salad buffet with lots of fresh cut veggies different cold pastas and other starches including a wild rice dish during my most recent visit
The soups are hearty and the hot items section include several breads pizza and tacos
A lot of good fresh cold or hot food for people on a budget
It but overall it was fantastic servers were attentive and very nice and the food was YUM and at a good price
The beef was very flavorful and while I ordered my burger medium it was slightly overcooked but still good
which was a good thing but the chicken itself was a bit chewy
Regardless I found this dish to be quite tasty though it won't be to everyone's liking
The potatoes were dry the dish was extremely oily and the flavor almost no kick
They also have some non-sushi appetizers on there
It was lightly seasoned leaving mostly a beef flavor then anything else
Now it had a good beef flavor so by no means complaining just like a bit more seasoning personally
But again thought it was good wasn't fishy and nice and sweet
Time elapsed for delivery of original aka cold pizza 100 minutes
he could have used a bit more food on his plate luckily we ordered a side of Green Chili Mac - very good
tried it and did NOT like it' *I did ask #3036 to recommend a white wine with my dish - he was a bit befuddled i don't think we use that word enough
I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who has never experienced Greek food and is willing to taste a different styled recipe from their original comfort zone
I don't really like Mexican food but when we want something cheap and fast this is a good option
I enjoyed a cioppino that was surprisingly delicate and loaded with tasty seafood
My wife had a perfectly cooked Yellowfin tuna steak that was rich and wonderfully flavored on its own but the soy- mirin broth was somewhat overpowering for the delicate fish
The food was pretty good we both got Chicken Giordano which was a little dry but had a good flavor to it
The dessert we had was amazing three flavors of creme brulee
Freddy's has good fast food burgers thin patties cooked hot and fast so that they carmelize slightly
The food was hit-n-miss but on the whole good
The beef was served with some melt in your mouth baby potatoes that were just excellent
The Big Unit is a 1 pound 22 inch long Vienna hot dog on a baguette roll
Unique restaurant and menu along with good food gives Cooperstown 4 stars
I've been going here for years - so I may be blinded by the nostalgia value but I think the food is of better quality than your typical chain
I was surprised at how much food they brought out and the quality
Overall we enjoyed the ambiance but were disappointed in the food
FOOD recommend the pretzels/mustard - the cooked kind
Nothing says love like cooking for someone and this place has the gadgets that'll help you convince people you barely like that you think they're the cat's pajamas because of how good your food will be
The base is traditionalBut they add ground chicken some of which is suspended in a delicious broth and some form delightful small dumplings that float amid carrot and peas
Unfortunately the food was not as good as the service and not worth the money
This place never ever runs out of goods food or liquor
The food is amazing I have never had a bad meal
I recently dropped by one of my favorite local family owned and operated restaurants to warm my belly with delicious hot food
Forget going to kitchy chains like Benihana or Sapporo where the show is more important than the food grilling it yourself using quality ingredients and truly becoming a part of the experience is where it's at
I just ate and smiled you have to order this dish and enjoy it to understand how good it really is
I hate using word like delicious to describe food because it doesnt really tell you anything about the experience but I will here because this mochi is a little weird fanciful and yes DELICIOUS
Haji Baba will give you way more food for about the same quality for $4 less
The food is excellent I also recommend the filet
The minimum is easy to meet with a drink and dessert - and worth every penny
I will be bringing my out-of-town guests here for good Mexican food
Everyone seemed to enjoy it both food and service were quite good
Being from NYC I know good pizza and they are awesome
The dip is a VERY cheesy dip with a creamy blue cheese base favored with hot sauce featuring large chunks of white meat chicken
The decor is really quite awesome and the food is pretty good
It's a small joint and sometimes takes awhile if the line is long but the awesome service & delicious food are well worth the wait
I ordered a slice of pizza and my husband ordered a calzone - they brought my pizza out 15 minutes before my husbands food was done so of course my pizza was cold by the time I started eating
On top of my pizza being cold it kind of tasted like puke
The sushi is super cheap and the food quality is pretty good
I wish they would open a branch downtown -- seems like we are missing a good by-the-slice walk up pizza joint downtown
The beef and the chicken items were good but I just don't like how they are little pieces that are still on the bone
Late night snacks sing to me of hot mashes of cheese meet and starch see burrito pizza shwarma and Jimmy John's cold quality which is so great and easy for lunch just doesn't cut the mustard on the chili-cheese fries
Both salads were tasty just make sure you ask about the fish sauce
It was my first time going to Buca and it's such a shame that I have to give it a thumbs down because the food was delicious
Just super tender meat great flavor and a melange of textures
Roast beef sandwich very good as was California Club
Chicken strips were very good and were real meat; not like the pressed chicken you get at other places
But I wanted to mention that their pizza is surprisingly good
Doro wat which is spicy chicken is amazing the lentil and cabbage dishes are awesome and
They also have a good sushi menu and a great sushi chef who is personable and pretty darn fast
Just when I thought I would never find good sushi in AZ and I have really really tried I walked into Hiro
The fish is fresh the edamame is warm and salty and the beer is cold
Don't get me wrong both places have cute quaint interiors delicious food and an atmosphere perfect for a romantic evening
Salt Cellar was an amazing seafood dinner that included both lobster and steak
I took my girlfriend for her birthday and she got the swordfish topped with mango which was also amazing
Some of the baked goods and foods were well done / thought out
Don't get me wrong the other food was good too but understand that I still think about the edamame 3 weeks removed
If memory serves it was very near 1030 at night not usually a time when you can find really well made delicious food of the non-drunken drive through everything is awesome variety
I've had the quail and some other dishes on a different occasion and everything really is delicious and incredibly well prepared
Let me start by saying it seems obvious that if you throw truffle butter on something the quality of that dish is likely to improve substantially
Still I give it 3 stars for good food good clientele nicely designed bar
I enjoyed the seafood grill Asian glazed salmon shrimp scampi and a jumbo-lump crab cake with Yukon gold mashed potatoes and asparagus
the prices have risen and the food quality had declined
Food is slightly on the pricey side but good
it's so good I would order this pizza to go and cuddle up on the couch while watching a tearjerker all by myself
On Oct 26th while visiting the area I made the unfortunate mistake of recommending we dine at Mimi's because of previously good food and service there
Prices were reasonable for this quality of food all dishes were artfully presented
The shrimp tasted a little over cooked but the broth it was so flavorful I wanted to bring the dish to my lips and tip back my head and slurp it all down
They have some snacks down at the counter but not hot food served to the rooms and no close location to get fast food
Lots of unusual rolls and the tempura is pretty good too
Don't skip the beef buns - and with the amazing prices I recommend trying a bunch of different items
The food here is very delicious and the atmosphere is very fun
The food was mediocre but I do have to say the potatoes and the tabouleh were both very good
Why not close down two of them and focus on putting out half the food - but make it REALLY good
Even after the Haboob and having a huge line they are able to quickly process cars faster than meat in a hot dog plant
Everything is pretty delicious but I've found that the dishes that you can also order at the Phoenix Loving Hut taste better and have bigger portions at that location than at this one
Let's start by disclosing that I grew up in New Orleans went to school in Lafayette home of the Ragin Cajuns and REALLY know good New Orleans/cajun food
That said I can truly say that Jennifer and the Flavors of Louisiana gang make cajun food as good as any you'll find in New Orleans--SERIOUSLY
The po-boys are spot on though the bread could be a little crustier and the chicken & andouille gumbo is even better than mine--and I assure you that's DAMN GOOD
I have no affiliation with the restaurant but wanted to post this as a review from someone who really knows New Orleans food and as a thank you to Jennifer and her crew for giving me a source for the best flavors in the World not just Louisiana
If you want the ONLY good cajun food in Phoenix treat yourself to Flavors of Louisiana
The veggie sandwich and Thai chicken wrap were both quite good although the Thai chicken wrap did taste more Chinese than Thai
Ate dinner there recently and had spring rolls appetizer and a wok entree
The prepared food bars are also delicious- they serve a dinner every night that promises a good meal but at a cost of $12-16 a plate
I haven't yet tried the sandwich/pizza bar but it smells good when i'm there
If you love sandwiches made from the most amazing biscuits-made on the property by the owner desserts that are decadent tea that soothes the soul this place is for you
The food is really good too my brother loves the chicken fried steak and I usually get some kind of pasta dish
The ticket prices and food prices were good compared to other parks i have been too
but the Chicken Rosemary Stake Rosemary and Cajan are wonderful too not to mention the Bangers & Mash and Shepard's Pie
The wedge salad was delicious the beef carpacio appetizer was awesome
Here's my issue- food quality and management
On my birthday they made me feel so special with a free dessert that said Happy 21st and a coupon for a free appetizer on my next visit
Foods I love the spicy shrimp and eggplant appetizer is to die for the caesar salad isn't too anchovy-tasting and the mushroom ravioli is my favorite dish
it was drenched in eel sauce and not only did this make it hard to eat with chop sticks but the flavor overpowered the roll
Again I had the red chili beef Indian taco and again it was delicious
Next we had the tomato pizza $6 I believe - the crust was excellent light and doughy but the pizza as a whole lacked flavor
Salmon $8 was a good deal but the fish quality was not as great as I'd expect from a place like this
Dessert $9 was darn good - tarte tatin a warm apple tart with a scoop of vanilla ice cream
Overall Christopher's is solidly good but it's been eclipsed by a new generation of superb Valley restaurants geared to our new foodie scene
It was clean it was well kept and the food was as I expected from my many visits to In-N-Out in California- tasty burger fresh-cut and slightly greasy fries and cold beverages
The service was less than average the food was hotter than the surface of the sun and the drinks were teeny tiny and didn't much taste like alcohol
I've found good pizza with no green olives and green olives with terrible pizza neither the combination I was looking for
Thanks La Bocca for consistent good food good values and good service
Two dings 1 sometimes the staff is standoffish and a little too cool; and 2 the baked goods are not very good
The food is tasty and they bring it to my house
my visits have not been met with consistency in the quality of their food
I would rather pay for good quality than quantity of food that other places dish out
Super atmosphere incredibly great service and delicious food
Yummy food at great prices an excellent location on Central & Camelback near Dutch Bros
The teriyaki beef/chicken and bulgolgi have great flavor I prefer the spicy versions
These are affordable dishes and excellent for a lunch of easy take-out dinner
I will go back because of the great low prices as well as the quality of the food
quality and side dish variety will improve with time
That said the food is freaking amazing
I appreciated at barrage of vegetarian Pasty options both more with veggies like the delicious balsamic portobello I had as well as with faux meat Quorn brand yum
Being veg it took a bit of time to tease out dishes that were meat free and still had flavor but we managed a decent array however I really want to go back and try some of the more exotic dishes and see if they can be made meat free
While the food is good they may have a bit less service than the number of tables need so don't expect white glove service
I sampled numerous dishes from the menu and found everything to be absolutely delicious
This place has some pretty damn good food it's different than anything else out there and it's definitely worth going back but I gave this place a few tries and I think it could use a little something
The food was pretty good though once served
Appetizers salads soups hot entrees sashimi and a boat full of sushi
However it is all worth it for the bocce ball court and the quality of their drinks and food
Quady Elysium Red Muscat Dessert Winepaired with chocolate pate with olive oil and sea salt Amazing likely our favorite item amongst the coursesI cannot give this place five stars due to our long wait time and the very small size of the portions versus the price
I've called and made numerous takeout orders and i'm never disappointed i'm not gonna say it's as good as eating there-cuz i don't think you can say that about anywhere but for sushi-it's as good as it gets
My slice of pizza was worse than Peter Piper Pizza and came out before the rest of the table's food by like 10 mins my friend's hot dog was horrible and the bun was stale and her mother's wrap didn't have very much turkey for being a turkey wrap
Wide selection of prepared food good for the most part see cons
I really recommend both places for good inexpensive food with enough to fill you up
So if you don't want to go on and on and just want to find a great place for spicy tuna roll with- Generous 8 piece portions -Fresh tuna  -Soft rice -Sushi Ken's own hot spice  -Tasty seaweed -Masago smelt row  -Extra wasabi and ginger on the side  -Reasonable and affordable cost of $8
My mom had the ham steak with red eye gravy and we enjoyed the food but I wouldn't say this dish wasn't anything special
normally I'm not a fan of white pizza but it was excellent
Service The food came out a bit haphazardly with the appetizer coming after the entree and preparation did not seem coordinated
FoodChicken lettuce wraps--tasty good portions however the sauce was too salty
Both orders with fries the fries were cold as well as the pasta dish
When we told her food was cold she was clearly confused and unsure what to do
A plate of delicious slices of beef and lamb carved off the rotisserie served with fresh toasted pita
Anyhow pretty good selection of food but on a weekday at noon there was no lunch menu
Pizzas looked great and I'd heard good things in the past
I tried their chicken lasagna and it was pretty good
And there's so much amazing Mexican food in the area why in God's name would you settle for blah
Only got to try the fried green chillies  awesome & the Mexican pizza  good happy hour munchie but looking to return soon and sample the menu some more
We went yesterday and had specials - a libation of gazpacho with beet instead of tomato as a base [surprisingly delicious and thirst quenching] - her filling take on a Spanish omelette and a pasta dish garnished with carmelized onion bleu cheese and crushed walnut - again suprisingly delicious
The traditional pizza was pretty darn good the sauce was probably some of the most perfect sauce I've had and there was enough cheese on there but not enough to make the pizza ridiculously oily
I thought the rest of the pizza was tasty but I had a hard time understanding the rough crust
The food was good the service was not so good
But I'm a foodie and I need flavor though I thought it's a bit on the bland side for my taste I'll instead rave about them being unique and not your 'ordinary' mex-restaurant
So they make good pizza but not very nice
The cheese plate was tasty and had a good variety but I was on the edge of picking up the radish plate and just licking it clean
The jidori chicken looked really good and my coworker enjoyed it but it was obvious he had some steak envy going on
From the spicy ranch with my delectable fried green tomatoes to my BLEU'S BRO BURGER with a flavorful Angus beef patty danish bleu cheese a toothsome applewood smoked bacon red onion tomato and iceberg lettuce
It's simply amazing how you can take a restaurant that has pretty good food decent ambiance and have the service people knock the rating from a four star to a two but indeed it happened tonight and it happened at Stingray
I usually get a hot pita either chicken or gyros and also yummy hummus
I think quality food takes time and I appreciate that process
The menu in my opinion is somewhat on the limited side but the food is pretty good and the prices aren't too bad for the amount of food you get
If you're driving through and don't want to wander off the freeway too far this restaurant might be worth the try if your current craving is for mexican food
The smokey pizza was very unique and wonderful - the olive tapenade really added such a nice touch - and I LOVE their crust thin throughout the middle crisp but chewy on the edges
I still don't know what I think of Thai food but I did eat the leftovers the next day and still enjoyed them
The chicken was dry and overcooked and the potatoes were cold
He checked back for payment two or three times while we were still enjoying our dessert - it was a chocholate cake with ice cream which was pretty good not worth the price but good
We were hungry for food and hotel staff gave us good recommendations for places to eat and knew directions to the local liquor stores too
Like the other Ranch Market's there is hot cheap eats to have and savor and a wonder selection of hispanic specialty products meats A whole chorizo section
They have an amazing variety of asian foods - sushi chinese dishes soups mongolian barbeque a huge salad bar desserts and best of all
This is old school Mexican food folks and it's about as good as it gets
The atmosphere is classic and I personally enjoyed it but it is not upscale  but then again Mexican food normally isn't
Chris and Kiefer were nicer than they needed to be and the food and wine was delicious and priced ridiculously well for what you get
The service is always great & the food is really goodnot as salty & overpriced as others in the area
the watering hole aka food court was enjoyable and they have my favorite hot dog on a stick
My wife and I had never eaten there We had been enticed to give it a shot after purchasing a deal chicken gift certificate
When the food finally did come it was cold
I spent year's in the restaurant business and I don't know which is the most disappointing - slow/cold food poor service or the inability to locate a manager
The sauce had spice to it but not so strong the flavor of the meat was concealed
They have several good dishes like the prime rib and the kobe steak and the shrimp and mussels
But the desserts looked amazing if only I saved room to try it all
Although they may not be as big as some of the Vegas buffets the quality of the food is above average compared to other buffets
They had some real good food that puts you in a great mood like the fondue pretzels hummus platter and sloppy joe sliders
I then noticed other guys getting red jade chicken in quesadilla form which also looked really good
My colleagues enjoyed their food too which is always key when carnivores and herbivores can both be satisfied with the same dining location
I had the chicken shawarma and it was delicious though the fries were definitely my favorite part
Requisite pho dishes are good and the fresh coconut soda drink is a delightfully refreshing
My boyfriend got the lasagna and I got the special which was various fish including shrimp and calamari and some of the most wonderfully done crispy fresh vegetables
This food is like a flavor explosion of spices your tongue has never met
It's fairly safe to say that they know what they're doing when it comes to tasty food
Or should it be the overall quality of the food everything tasted like soggy salty fat We mean how are you going to F up spinach dip
We understand the fact that it is bar food but if it is going to taste like that and be way over-priced for it's bar food quality do not waste your time unless you are already inebriated So lets review
Over-priced salty food Pete's Fish n Chips same quality; way cheaper3
Only go if your wasted because then you will not care about the quality of food or how much you paid for it  remember the horrible service or the fact that there is a gang of blubbering drunk idiots lowering expectations with future regrets
But if you come before or after the rush the service is always great the food is always delicious and the wait is always good
The food was very good and the Vindaloo had a serious kick to it so if you aren't into spicy curries you may want to have them tone it down
It's a good thing that the food here was decent; otherwise this place would have gotten zero stars
The boyfriend got garlic chicken and said it was good but for $10 he wanted more than just a tiny little amount
Don't waste time on the pita pizzas they are glorified cheese crisps which you can get accompanied by a good stiff margarita at Fez
Food feedbackApps ~ Sausage Sampler Bratwurst/Krakauerwurst served over a bed of homemade Sauerkraut is tasty

Food was pretty good but it took an hour to get it
I highly recommend the Flamingo Chicken
It's a simple dish but the sauce that is served with it is amazing
Now in this great atmosphere that they've created at TMI is a plethora of wonderful food and drinks
Sooooo I had heard great things about Truckin' Good Food and did lots of research on them before going to the Scottsdale Farmer's Market to stalk them
Both were Penne noodles which were bland as well as the chicken in the pasta carbonara there was a complete lack of flavor and the sauce seamed to be breaking up
My fiances Pasta Diavolo was nothing to write home about either the spicy tomato sauce was not spicy or flavorful and again the chicken was bland
I have to admit the chicken was very spicy I could definitely handle hotter - but I was impressed
The chopped beef made a delicious sandwich for the record a 1/2 lb of chopped beef makes 2 hefty sandwiches for less $ than most bbq joints charge for 1 but the star here was the lean brisket
They have a special that I love -  a croissant stuffed with rosemary lemon chicken with some sauce and OMG it is delicious
Very cheap cuts of chicken relying on oil and grease for flavor
No 'hey would you like something else' or 'perhaps I can get the chef to come out and recommend another dish
A tasty buffet that serves vegetarian and vegan dishes Udupi offers a great variety of curries starches and desserts that will please anyone that doesn't need to have meat at every meal
There was also a cold foods station with salads yogurt and sauces
I tried a little bit of each buffet hot item and enjoyed each dish
I enjoyed each dessert especially the ras malai which is a sweetened creamy paneer
That's fine by me because each time I go the food I get is delicious the veggies are cooked up masterfully and the flavors have some punch in a good way
There was no skimping on toppings or fishing through the greens for the goods every bite was magic in my mouth
They both seem to have their pros and cons which don't necessarily have to do with the food's flavor but more so personal preferences on texture price Blue Nile is a bit pricier than Lalibela and types of offerings Blue Nile seems to have a more extensive menu than Lalibela

PS  Anyone with insider info on my theory please offer clarificationThe bacon and sausage is amazing breakfast meaty goodness
After looking over the various noodle rice and ramen dishes along with the incredibly tempting flavors of smoothies cookies and cream green tea
As soon as I said orange chicken bowl I was shot down
The food everything on the menu is very good but in my mind two things stand out and they are as good as it gets in Phoenix
Initially we were drawn in because we were looking for a good Latte/Espresso but when we smelled the food we had to take a seat and order breakfast
The food was good and the place itself even better wish I was closer for Happy Hour
The Napoleon Dynamite roll and Chai High martini were especially tasty an odd combination perhaps but both were great
The squid salad was pretty bland and the Whoop Bass roll had a weird flavor to it
I highly recommend this restaurant for food drinks wine list and local residents
The food was very good I was very impressed
When you factor in the quality of the food he doesn't buy cheap shitty meat and the atmosphere Romy's one of the nicest store owners I've had the honor of meeting I can't rate them anything less than 5 stars
but always had it hot sort of as a substitute for rice in dishes where you'd use rice
the dressing and other ingredients in this dish are very cleverly combined look very nice on the plate and provide the double whammy of light and flavorful with savory and satisfying
The owners are wonderful and the food is FANTASTIC
I can't wait to go back soon to enjoy the patio and try all of the delicious food I was reading about on the menu and now in everyones reviews
Everything else was good its just always the food that seems to just
Even with these limitations the sandwiches are still good and appropriately priced Jersy Mikes is not Subway or Quiznos these sandwiches are of a  far better quality with fresh sliced meats and cheeses and fresh tasty veggies
'Iced Tea' - Bacardi Limon Lemon & Mint 'Wrath of McGrath' - A Shiner Bock Beer with a Shot of 100 Proof Smirnoff Jalapeno Vodka drizzled over it & a Squeeze of LimeFor an appetizer I tried the Cockles and Craw Fish with a roasted garlic butter sauce with kaffir lime
When I bit into a wedge of plastic while enjoying the appetizer the manager came to personally apologize and to offer us complimentary dessert as well as taking the Crawfish off the bill

The chicken is soooooooooooo good and the flauta is crispy deliciousness
The Chipotle Chicken Salad sandwich is super tasty
The store is clean the food is good and can be good for you and the service is never lacking
The first was good all around food seemed normal I don't stray far from a hamburger so no surprise there
Not that it is bad a bunch of sports stuff on the walls it is just a little plain and doesn't give off that good food vibe
This is the hey we know our food is so good we're going to give you some before you even buy it
The jerk chicken is quite spicy - in a very good way and the carnitas were packed with flavor
The chicken feta pita was messy to eat but delicious
I don't think I've had enough greek food to have a super dependable opinion of how it's prepared but I really enjoyed it
Ok maybe 3 1/2 stars but my overall eating experience at Euro Pizza Cafe was pretty good and I would go again
What I got; surprised and satisfied me; a good cut of fish reasonably breaded on an assortment of stir-fried/steamed veggies that were crunchy and good
There was also a lemon reduction sauce on the fish which I found to be tasty
In all the ambiance especially if your outdoors is great the food is good even admitting I'm not a big Italian cuisine fan and the prices are very reasonable meal + beer + tip = just over $20
Superb rolled tacos and sauce although I wish they had more meat inside their still darn good
I haven't ventured over to the pizza place yet as I can't fathom any meal worth waiting over 3 hours for
Shabu shabu in chandler is just plain crappy When my parents dragged me to this place I thought it would be another Asian hole in the wall place with unimpressive decor and ok to good food for cheap you know Asian parents
I incredibly enjoyed the herbal broth and it brought out what I love most about Asian food - a medley of complex yet delicate flavors and numerous spices
In your broth you have a series of aromatic spices such as anise along with some flavors you would see in Asian desserts - such an aesthetically pleasing and interesting mixture that goes very well
Beef tongue is one of those things that sound like you would never think to be good but then you fall in love with it
I also enjoyed the shabu shabu beef and ribeye
For those unfamiliar with Asian food for veggies I recommend bok choy enoki mushrooms and white mushrooms
We had the friend wontons w/ sweet and sour sauce for our appetizer spicy noodles and salt and pepper beef
I liked the first two dishes but the last one didn't have much flavor
the beef salad was good as well but I had better beef salad somewhere else
All in all decent food good service and I will definitely come back to this place
I ended up stacking them and handing them to her so we had room for dessert - birthday brownie delicious came with 4 spoons - we had to request more when she finally came back
I am reasonably certain that all their food is good but I probably will never know as the only two items I get EVERY time I go are their spring rolls and their Beef Pho Tai soup
Then we have the Pho Tai which seriously even  if I was a step away from death and sick with a cold I would still  drive to Totties to have instead of that crappy Campbells Chicken Noodle Soup
Their food has always been fresh flavorful plentiful and priced affordably
Some of my favorite things to get- Brisket Pulled Pork - you can't go wrong with this flavorful moist meat that is slow-cooked over pecan-wood
I have yet to try their root beer and their desserts but I can imagine they are both very tasty given than everything else has been enjoyable
OK the *only* con The line can get pretty long during 'popular hours' but good thing it runs fairly quick; Their salad sans meat is more white/yellow than green romaine and it's just a little on the boring side
That theme goes a long way here because while Mimi's offers good food it's not cheap and there is some trickery involved
That disappointment out of the way I have to say the food is good and it's creative
So apart from the gimmickry of the theme and the aroma box at the door this is a solid place to eat converse relax and get predictably good food at fair prices
I was in the mood for some sushi and hadn't been here in a long time but remembered good things so we popped in for some happy hour sushi and drinks on Friday
It was surprisingly tasty and very light which is lucky because the rest of our sushi was terrible
I would say that this was almost as good we tried the beef pho pork and eggroll noodle bowl and I had a Vietnamese iced coffee
I will say that the Shrimp Summer Roll appetizer was really tasty and light the jasmine rice that comes with the entrees is perfect and that Thai Pan's service is great
It was a $15 groupon for $35 worth of food a pretty good deal
For our main entree we ordered the seafood paella which was equally amazing if not better
The seafood was really fresh and I think more saffron would have drowned out other flavors
Overall the food here is amazing definitely worth going for
Although I Iove avacado's the lemon on that pizza was just a little too much for me the fallen angel was good with tasty fennel sausage but the padre took the cake
This was the only pizza that had no leftovers the prosciuto arugula fig and ricotta was a combination I had never tried but was absolutely delicious
The wine list is good not great  the food is good and yes it is cool the setting and all that shit
But I have to say that really turned out to be not a bad thing as our server was excellent the food was excellent and the wine was smooth and wondeful
Everyone was so friendly but more importantly the food was AMAZING
NO pizza on this planet is good enough for even 2 hours
We went across the walk way to The Rose and Crown sat right down and had wonderful beer and fish and chips
It is afterall the amazing shrinking meat
=- Their desserts while small are delicious
Seasons 52 is a wonderful concept and I love the fact that their food is healthy and proportioned the way us chubby Americans needs to eat
The experience earns the four stars but the food is not good enough to propel Cafe Monarch beyond that
I took a date here as we both heard good things about it and both of us were craving wine and pizza
I plan on giving it another shot and possibly order a different pizza with more toppings
They have pretty good pictures and descriptions of the food
food is served hot large portions and awesome margaritas with a wide variety of tequilas to choose from
a great little mexican place to hit up for some drinks and good food
I guess that means cultures may come and go but tacos they are forever and thank goodness because this place one heck of an bargain for such a great foodie experience
Another hot and sexy male waiter delivered our food and agin flirted with us
The place was stuffed to the brim on a Sunday night you had to find a place to stand and according to the nice lady in line behind me it's always like this The burgers are fresh better quality than most fast food restaurants & yes you get to pick your toppings but don't hate me
The food is delicious We even took some great pictures of how beautiful the food looked  servers are friendly and attentive and mood is awesome
Growing up in an Italian family back East I was privy to really good authentic Italian food
She also enjoyed her food but too found the temp off
My mate had a mixture of ground beef minced onions and seasoning skewered and grilled to perfectionon a bed of basmati rice he too enjoyed his food but again the temp was not as it should be
All of the food had good flavour and was enjoyed just not as hot as it should have been
The food is good and sitting on the patio with a margarita is great
We also had a tuna handroll and the Sun roll - non-baked scallops covered in sriracha sauce which both were simple but quite tasty
This pasta course was highlighted by a delicious white seven cheese ravioli complimented with a red sausage and marinara  pasta dish
I had the pork dish which came with jalapeno creamed corn and mashed potatoes good sides but my pork was boring with minimal flavor and dry
Wine and cocktails were good and most of the food was as well
Husband likes his meats prepared well done and he got well done every single time--not burnt--but still moist and delicious
Having the pairing did enhance the flavors of each dish
By the last 4 dishes  my tastebuds were so inebriated I don't think I quite got the full flavor of those dishes
The vermicelli was a bit on the cold side and slightly too al dente for this dish
It may not be the healthiest food but it sure is good
The food is pretty good but the coconut shrimp appetizer steals the menu
It was a bit too much food for me but it was delicious
Thankfully I had started out the night at Papago Brewing so I was in a somewhat amicable mood when a group of friends and I rolled into Longshots for Karaoke
I did not try any of the food and only stayed about an hour but nothing really made it seem worth going back to again
The decor is not exceptional and the utensils are plastic but the quality of food makes up for it
And I really enjoyed the generous side dishes
who would have guessed a boneless free range chicken would be soooooooooo delicious
We all ended up eating the chicken since we were all impressed by it
The wife and I have been poking and prodding through the menu from the burgers to the pizzas to the hot dogs to the sandwiches to the salads and yes all is good here
It wasn't much to go on but the food was good the service friendly and efficient and the everything was clean and neat
the sushi is good - not overwhelmingly fantastic but they do have a tasty fresh selection
It's fun the food is good and as I said before you can bring your own beer
The atmosphere was nice laid back and stylish but the food was not good
We ordered an appetizer and the food was just really mediocre
I mean I could have been eating super yummy spider rolls but instead I've been passing it up for the gourmet 7-11 spicy hot dogs on the same corner
the food is good for the price albeit a little pricey
Why oh why is it so hard to find good Chinese food in this town
They serve delicious food and give fantastic service
They have very good salads especially their Mediterranean Chicken with grilled chicken lettuce veggies roasted bell peppers etc with feta cheese and pine nuts
The same AWESOME/CHEAP food menu 2 & 3 bucks for several appetizers still applies
The quality of their bread and meats Boar's Head dressing and customer service is spectacular
After two hours of my time fifteen bucks in gas and thirty bucks worth of unedible deli food I can say that I won't be back
Food is par - I would recommend this place for drinks only
The food when it did finally arrive was good albeit a little bland in my case
Walking up to the door  I could smell wonderful food being made
I would love to come back & try the guacamole everyone raves about fish tacos & amazing sounding chocolate pudding
2 Food -- I had a patty melt which was juicy and quite delicious
It seemed like the parts and the sizes were right but somehow it didn't have the taste of good sushi
We did get appetizers and chicken fried rice as well
The dumplings were ok the egg rolls were nasty and the crab rangoons were good - but the sweet and sour sauce was somehow bland
As of now the menu is divided into Freddo and Caldo options and I made my meal of the Butterfish with a citrus glaze the Hamachi with black garlic and truffle oil and the Risotto which had a massive mushroom seared on top and kind of gross to think about but tasty nonetheless cock's comb
I was very hesitant because I like either sushi or well cooked fish but this was delicious and very different and so large that I took half home for breakfast the next day
All the food that I had was very good
Its not phenomenal food but is very good nonetheless
However if I'm ever in the area again I know you really can't miss with this place with it's great atmosphere excellent service and solid food selections
The food is always good and the drinks are among the best in the valley
The employees were extremely friendly and helpful at this location which was amazing to me because every other experience I've had with Whole Foods resulted in snobby pretentious employees
the Hawaiian Martini is great and wonderful choices on the food side we had spicy tuna roll
the corned beef is always good and surprisingly so is the grilled cheese
They need to go out and make room for people who actually care about putting out a good plate of food
Andrew's BBQ has unbelievably low prices for such delicious food
The meat was so soft and flavorful and just plain yummy
Cute little place inside people are always friendly and the food is delicious
There have been a couple times I've overheard people asking them for items you'd see at a Chinese food place - I'm sure they get it all the time and surprisingly they were nice about recommending dishes
=We order a ton of foodCrispy Tofu Tossed is salt and pepper seasoning served with peanut hoisin - Those little fried tofu squares were piping HOT
The Vietnamese vinaigrette dip AKA fish sauce was too sweet not enough fish flavor
Chicken Noodle Soup Pho Chicken Breast - Loved the soup base flavor but the soup was not HOT enough
We know this is Americanized Vietnamese food so we weren't look for authenticity or anything but great and very flavorful food
The hot links are juicy and spicy the beans are thick and have lots of meat in them and the corn is actually a large ear of corn that doesn't taste like the frozen kind
You know only good cheap food comes out of those places
Insalata Caprese - still doing pretty good though the mozarella and tomato weren't anything special more supermarket than artisanalMargherita Pizza - things go downhill from here
;For dessert we went with the recommendations of the waiter which was a chocolate-hazelnut tart and a seasonal mixed berry tart with poached pears
For a guy originally from Maryland who's had some pretty amazing seafood there was just too much wrong here to be given a second chance
For the price and the quality of food this makes it an easy choice to come to
The food was delicious and well presented
I had the crispy basil chicken which was flavourful as well and I tried my friends dishes which were excellent especially the curries
The service was as good as the food and atmosphere
I think this place would be suitable for a date celebration or when you just want good thai food
The chicken in my salad was delish but quality of the lettuce and the lack of other ingredients made it undesirable
The hamburgers and chicken sandwiches are huge and delicious
The hostess tries to figure out how to fit us inside since it was so hot outside and the manager comes and decides that they can get us a highchair sit us at the sushi bar  and have us park our stroller by the door
The avocado cilantro bacon and mango in the pico was a great combo and the bun was so good - they could sell those alone as rolls
Don't think i'll be going to a Hooters again for a while For an overpriced beer and hot girls I prefer going to a place like Tilted Kilt where at least the food is good
PJ packs the best food for dollar quality and quantity I know of in Phoenix
It is worth the wait if there is one but they pack their food in nice to go boxes so take out is also a solid option
I got a huge mound of gyro meat an excellent side salad some lemony roasted potatoes and a scoop of rice
The pretzel fondue and sampler are really good but the chicken fingers look like ET's fingers
For the Special you also get a pickle spear & a small cup of not-very-good macaroni salad & a small mint for dessert
On the positive side the waiter was very attentive quickly attempted to correct the corn-on-the-cob issue and offered a complimentary desert as compensation for the frozen ear of corn but considering the quality of food up to that point we passed on the free dessert to avoid additional disappointment
and the ownership takes a lot of pride in the quality of the food
The food is pretty good pretty greasy and heavy but I like that kind of breakfast
very different types of food offered all quite tasty
the dish was very tasty and delicious and was definitely overflowing with mushroom
For my meal I ordered the beef shawerma plate but was already full from the other goodies I brought most of it home
As other locations Trader Joes has a good selection of organic food items for really good prices
I was impressed with the good variety in the menu from salads to burgers pasta seafood and more
It was very tasty the crepes were great and the fish tasted good
Coming from the Northeast I know good fish
There's a variety of tapas such as jalapeno-bacon-wrapped shrimp as appetizers and the entrees are classics such as Delmonico steak chicken breast char and a seafood medley
We also enjoyed the chocolate romance for dessert
I thought the atmosphere was great the food was very good and I actually liked the BYOB
I agree that the food is a little pricey but I think it was very good
We had two appetizers Killer Chicken Quesadilla and Prosciutto Wrapped Mozzarella
We enjoyed happy hour prices and I had the Damn Good Roll which was good but not entirely deserving of its name
I ordered the Pork Belly Curry served in a homemade tomato based savory curry I have enjoyed ever since this curry is used as a base for many of the curry dishes
For dessert it was our lucky day as Elizabeth the owner had made her and her workers a special Sanwin Makin or semolina cake with durian normally it is made with raisins - delicious but an acquired taste for us Americans
There are many more authentic Burmese dishes on the menu but if you only try what might already be familiar to you you will not have mustered the courage to try something new and wonderful
Keep up the good work JJs but maybe add a little more meat to the veggie sandwich
The grilled meat smelled good although when does grilled meat not so I stepped up to their little table setup and surveyed a grill full of what looked like flattened chicken thighs and their menu sign which offered a limited selection from their regular menu $5 Chicken $7 Beef Short Ribsor $7 Meat Combo-all with white rice and macaroni salad
I won't lie or make anything up I'll just show anyone who steps up to order exactly how much food they can expect for their money and then they can decide if it's worth it instead of having to be surprised and disappointed like me
But oddly whenever we eat AT the restaurant the food is rave-ingly good
Enjoyed meeting Short Leash last night at Shady's when Brad tapped me on the shoulder and asked that I move my truck so that he could back the food truck in
First of all the food is consistently great and they always put a creative and delicious twist in their dishes
Where are they going to get local fish that's worth a damn
The food was every bit as good as we hoped
Now it takes more than just free drinks and food to appease my dissatisfaction so I have to give a huge shot out to Charles from the hospitality department - what an awesome manager
Despite having about as many restaurants per capita as is physically possible Old Town offers up a pretty meager selection of wine bars and good Mexican food but that's a topic for another time
Chicken was tasty but a bit overcooked
The hot dogs are all beef steamed and served on a steamed poppy seed bun with all the standard coney island accoutermentsIt is a coney island in everything but name
Cafe Villaggio is scrupulously clean the food is really pretty good and people running it are sweet as pie which they should immediately add to their menu to achieve lunchtime perfection
Pretty good food more of the combinations that make it
Jerk Chicken Fried Rice Also good and had nice crunch to it
Carnitas Quesadilla Really good not quite as good as the Jade Red Chicken but definately something I would order again
I didn't eat Pho I had a vermicelli dish so I can't talk about the quality of the Pho
This is just one stop in my many to find quality Vietnamese food in Phoenix
The food on the other hand was extremely overpriced contained small portions and lacked flavor in general
The food wasn't bad mind you but it just lacked flavor and that special umph to make you want to return
I'm more than happy to pay over a $100 a meal if the food is worth it but when you get Cheesecake factory quality food that is prices 3 times that amount
The Asian-Cuban appetizer was one egg roll split in half with some beef on the side
The food was perfectly good--except it was luke warm
I recommend all Whole Foods fans to try this place out and start saving a few bucks
My favorite appetizers are the avocado egg rolls and the sliders
Grilled shrimp club BBQ chicken pizza blackened chicken sandwich  chicken chipotle pasta chicken romano and chicken madeira are all REALLY good
Basically it's the only Japanese restaurant that I go to because I know I can get good satisfying food for a good price
Lovely decor spacey with lots of good food to choose from
The price is a little more then most of the fast food sandwich shops but well worth it
I ate at this Schlotzsky and the one in Scottsdale where I had a wonderful salad filled with meat and cheese
Bottom line I wanted brown rice and some chinese food and I got exactly what I wanted last night and it tasted good and nearby to me
My only complaint about Short Leash is that they don't follow me around town in the food cart which means I cannot eat delicious hot dog concoctions all day
this delicious convenient amazing food cart has VEGGIE DOGS
To be fair the food was alright but not worth the money and take my word for it I'm a chef
My dinner is always served hot and to my liking I would recommend this restaurant to anyone with a taste of Indian Food
We found the food service and ambiance to be excellent in all regards
We had chicken pesto flatbread and it was delicious
Anyways when you enter this Whole Foods be prepared for an amazing smell of all the fresh fruit they have laid out for you to peruse
The apples smell good even when you get them home and I have been trying to get hubs to eat an apple at his lunch for five years and even though he doesn't know where the apples come from he always always eats the ones from Whole Foods
And I'm not a huge wing person because I don't like fried food but I am pretty sure Mamma Mia's wings are baked and they are delicious
When I still ate meat their grilled pork chops over rice was sooo good
You're steps away from the light rail super close to good food and a few blocks from freeways
It has all the necessities and is good about bringing in new products but has the least WOW factor of all the Whole Foods stores
Buying good food is not just about the actual food
I require hot sauce with every morsel of food I eat
I hope to sit outside and enjoy delicious food and drinks with friends soon
The food is pretty good and the portions are definitely fillings
Rent a pool table order some food and drinks and you're good for hours
The food is very reasonably priced huge portions very fresh food and very very delicious
I have loved every dish here; no joke it's all belly pleasing goodness
Here are some of my favorites some have meat from before I was a vegetarian*the medchilada a giant burrito wrapped in lavosh no longer on menu but they still make them upon request at this location* the hummus I like half roasted red bell pepper and half cilantro jalapeno this explodes with flavor and is a great starter for non-hummus consumers* tsatziki they have the best tsatziki ever omg just the right amount of seasoning I could drink this stuff* gambas con ajo jumbo shrimp swimming in a delicious light red sauce served with a pesto cheese covered pita* MTB mozzarella tomato basil with evoo and balsamic huge slices and very fresh* grilled vegetable salad huge and covered in yummy veggies thought it would be weird to have hot veggies on a bed of salad but oh-no-sir this is sooo yummy
* Pesto lavash turkey wrap if you're not a fan of hot turkey swap it out for their scrumptious chicken* black bean burger mmmm mmmm mmmm
I like to get mine on their whole wheat bun the roasted red peppers and other toppings make this* glazed chicken lavosh pizza oh man this is what pizza should be about savory and sweet the caramelized onions are soooo good on this pizza
* chicken combo platter a bit of everything make your own pita sandwich mix and match flavors* fruit & cheese fantasia a great platter to share tons and tons of fresh fruit and lots of varieties of cheese served with a pita
The servers are friendly and knowledgeable and the food - well the food is amazing
I found the Sushi to be delicious as was the Mongolian BBQ which included shrimp lamb beef & chicken along with various veggies
I wish I could shop here all the time because they have my favorite types of food and the quality of their food selection is second to none
It had a great woody flavor that I didn't expect but I found to be really appropriate for the dish
It did however go extremely well with the chickenI really enjoyed my visit here and I hope to come back sometime soon
The beef was sliced thin but tough and chewy and totally lacked flavor
but Pei Wei and Pickup Sticks are about 10x better in terms of food quality and taste
Like I said I don't eat a lot of chain food - but even the Pei Wei at 7th ave and McDowell is way better in terms of food quality
Overall we enjoyed the food and would go back
We had breakfast here two days in a row if that is any indication of how good the food is
We were staying at Scottsdale Resort and I have come to realize after staying in numerous places that if you want a decent meal you do not eat hotel food
I'd like to come back & sooner than a few years because I know I've had good food here in the past
My dad appreciates good food and we had a feeling he'd like Coup Des Tartes so that's where we found ourselves on that particular Saturday night
My fish was cooked just perfectly and served with an amazing butternut squash risotto and some green beans too
Everyone enjoyed their meals and despite the fact that we were all pretty full we went ahead and ordered the mixed berry tart with four forks for dessert
What it lacks in ambiance although being next door to Trader Joe's in the Town & Country Shopping Center doesn't hurt anyone it makes up for with really friendly service and good food
Honestly speaking it's not the most mind-blowing Greek food I've ever had but Cyprus Pita is definitely good enough to go back again
The chicken was good ribs were not falling off the bone tender as I like then and brisket was okay
I got the chicken burger today it is pretty good
Juan's is in a older building and there's nothing fancy about the place but the food met and exceeded my expectations in flavor quantity and price
I had a Chile Rilleno and a Chicken Enchillda with retried beans and it was all delicious
I had the truffled mushroom pizza which is sautu00e9ed mushrooms roasted tomatoes goat cheese mozzarella fresh spinach lightly tossed in balsamic vinaigrette and a little white truffle oil for good measure
Despite the fact that the sushi bar stools are for midgets and they gave me a dirty wine glass it is quite possible that the sushi chefs at Celsius fed me the most wonderful sushi I've ever had in Phoenix
Overall I was impressed with the offerings of fresh sushi and robata grilled tidbits
The dish that really won me over was crab hot pot and the creamy rice was absolutely zoftik
Not great but good my burrito was better than my wife's entree some sort of fried dish
It's not fancy by any means but it has great food and is well worth the drive
Each table has eight different sauces that you can add to your meat and they really bring a whole new level of flavor out
Of course I did i was a blond fish out of water not a good combo
Our server was perfect she definitely knew sushi and had many great recommendations
But I'll admit the appetizers were serviceable we ordered crispy bruschetta bites cheese pizza and fried zucchini
Super nice staff great ambiance and the food was amazing
For food I went to enjoy slices at the two pizza restaurants just around the corner see reviewsAt the end of the game they switched some of the tvs over to 80s videos which is throughly enjoyed and started to do my signature Sexy Robot move to
Made to order sandwich mine tuna fish egg tomato avocado spinach provolone on wheat = so good
The well done beef in the pho is really tasty and tender and there is tons of it
Had gone to Willow House a few time a long time ago and enjoyed the atmosphere food art etc
Good amount of chicken shaved parm large homemade croutons and great dressing
I'm sure the rest of the dishes are just as flavorful
Having said that all the food was good
Normal prices would make it a little on the pricey side but it was good food
The food was pretty good scallop app was delicious but the overall atmosphere ruined the meal
We were finally seated and were provided with food-covered menus and a basket of chips and watery flavorless salsa
Joe wasn't six steps away before he was interrupted by a member of the waitstaff who informed him that what she needed was more important than delivering two setups to some first time customers so they could enjoy their ever increasingly cold food
For the ahem  upscale pricing the quality of the food should be absolutely superb
While the atmosphere is lovely and the service was very good the food was a huge disappointment
It was very saddening because we had heard such raving comments about the pastry chef and in fact the quality of the pastry--both in taste and texture--was pretty sub-par for a dessert that costs like 20 bucks
For a meal that essentially cost $100 per person the taste was AVERAGE and the overall quality of the food was horribly disappointing
Scott's Generation offers very good pseudo-Jewish food but for being unofficial in my mind it's pretty good
The toppings meat and bun were all top notch fresh and tasty tasty and I would definitely order it again
I wanted to buy a turkey fryer hand-turn meat grinder dehydrator cast iron skillet a bow and arrow set a 18 gauge pump shotgun along with other things
The family and I have a weekend breakfast there 1-2 x month and while the food is not fancy or especially memorable it is good and consistent
I don't know if it is just the first week excitement or if this is how it will always be but the welcoming demeanor of this place I have seen so far on top of good food at good prices will definitely keep me coming back
all 3 the meat was short on flavors had to scoop in the salsa to get something going on
My boyfriend's Beef Teriyaki Bowl was very simple rice and beef with sauce but was very tasty
Haiku Grill has a pretty extensive sushi and non-sushi menu and is a good alternative to Mill Ave
they also give you a goodly sized snickerdoodle cookie to munch on after you've gorged yourself on chinamex food
They had baked mussels one night as their local fish dish and they were AMAZING
Dragonfly combines what I like about Vietnamese food variety flavor price with what I like about a modern trendy restaurant good decor modern music attentive servers
I tried the Southwest Salad minus the chicken which was good
One menu describes the variety of dishes offered while another is a straight list of appetizers entrees & desserts
Having had very good Indian food in New York City and its environs the food here is on a par
Overall the food was good but nothing special
Worth a try and a place to watch for leading the way with community restaurants and natural organic foods
Their food is so good and so reliably good that it shouldn't be known as only a wrap restaurant
I like the little containers the food is delivered in and it always looks so clean and tight plus the food tastes just as good as it looks
I really appreciate when people making relatively cheap food make such an effort to make it look good too
I hope next time the service is better at Thai Basil because the food is very good
The food was really good and this is coming from a picky eater who is not a huge fan of Indian food
The ribs were small and didn't have a lot of meat on them - which wasn't really a bad thing because what meat was there really had no flavor whatsoever
My Husband really enjoyed his scallops but didn't like the coffee pot dessert
The quality of the food has gone down a little
That being said it's a cool concept and great crust- but the signature pizzas like the Greek end up feeling themed and lacking of soul and an intuitive fussing-over that they need to really be crack good
the food is still spectacular amazing things they can do with bread
the dessert is unimaginative and the coffee is horrible it takes acidic and cold
They will start opening on Sunday's soon where they'll serve fried chicken and other good stuff
The pupusa also came with some black refried bean side and some other side dish that I can't describe but was very good
Go to the Original Burrito Company because the food is amazing and the staff are sweet
Their nigiri salmon is delicious fresh and has no fishy taste
The best time to go is Happy Hour they have great sushi and appetizer deals
In the past we have tried the cheese plate appetizer the onion tart appetizer the Bree and pear appetizer and the Filet entree and a couple of their tart desserts
The food was pretty good and the service here is excellent
Yes they still have the awsome biscuits and their food is good
A really nice and friendly place to relax and enjoy affordable good Korean food
All the dishes were really good - the beef being most excellent
It's got plenty of tasty vegetarian dishes so those of you who don't do the animal won't be all depressed like you would walking into a Black Angus
I HIGHLY recommend you find this small restaurant and try the many fresh home made and tasty dishes
Husband and  I had the Scallop/Mediterre  Savory Crepe which was lovely  and the Jamon Frankekuchen --which translates loosely   tasty ham / pear pizza with crescent roll crust   super delicious
I did my Usual which was Fish Taco's that were very good
I have had the Beef Dip sandwich and it is quite tasty
If you are looking for traditional but yummy food then this is a good place to try
The food was good; the fellowship was great; and we will return
My husband loves the steak salad and my kids love the meatball appetizer and disco balls in the foyer
So overall if you're on a budget and want some good Chinese food go to Taste Of China
Now I've never had Chicago style thin crust pizza before this so I can't say how authentic it is but I can say that I don't really care because this place is too delicious to pass up
While it's true that it's not a traditional Banh Mi sandwich in several ways the most obvious of which is the fact that it comes on a soft sandwich roll instead of a baguette it was absolutely delicious
The fish was cooked perfectly and it was juicy fresh and flavorful
A chunky delicious cut of meat with a seared crust and a very perfect center
The food is delicious and buttery and fatty
The food isn't healthy to put it mildly but it's delicious
Good food usually means a considerable wait so just suck it up and go anyways
Most of the spicy dishes are also complimented by the nice floral flavor of ash berry also know as Szechuan peppercorn
Some people have complained about oil but when I have not ordered the spicy and hot the food has been less oily than most places
To be honest though you can get the same quality pizza at Cibo's in a tiny fraction of the time that it takes your name to move up one spot on the list
Pizza will never ever be worth a multi-hour wait for me
Anyways aside from the warm not hot food it tasted pretty good
There are two types of turkey sausage the smoked sauage that comes in a long link hot dog texture and the shorter links with a more ground beef texture and also apparently patties like they had here
I was really excited to try this place out and I'm certain that if my food was a little bit hotter it would be my favorite breakfast place
Its a shame it wasn't hot because I'd really like to come back here and try other breakfast items they have a really interesting sounding chicken fajita omelette
The food was good as always but I ran out of iced tea quick
The experience was so authentic it was like visiting Mexico again with the simple surroundings lack of pretensions and very tasty fresh food
The quality of the meats seafood and vegetable is clearly a cut above almost every other Mongolian Grill type establishment
I do not recommend cramming too much meat into your bowl -- a juvenile mistake I see made by kids with bad skin and future cardiac issues
The food had a nice flavor but wasn't very filling
Our food ended up being really good - including the alligator
The food was good but it's not always about the food
We waited 30 stinking minutes for our shrimp roll appetizers to come
The rolls were good but I wouldn't wait that long for them if I had known ahead of time
It had a pretty good beefy flavor but was too greasy
Here you go*  My husband works in procurement for a major hotel company buying fish and beef - he knows fresh fish
Many are local Valley chefs - chefs only eat where there is good fresh food
I am a fan of 'hot' foods with a bit of pep to them and Aunt Chilada's delivers on specific dishes ie there is plenty of other offerings if spicy is not your style
the pizza is really good and really light
They do have their own specialty pizzas that are worth a try hint hint the White Pizza
The corn chicken soup was hot and the won ton chips were a nice addition to the soup
I actually only had food at this place so can't comment on the drinks but I split their bbq burger with the BF and I thought it was really good
I'm still drooling thinking about this food it was so fresh and flavorful I couldn't stop eating
The rice was perfect the sauce was delicious and the chicken was fantastic
The spring rolls were just a tad under cooked but still good
The spinach pizza was extremely tasty the sauce and the cheese went hand in hand without overpowering the spinach
I haven't had one before so I went ahead and decided to try it at a place that had good pizza and the spaghetti calzone was a great compliment to the entrees
Good Mexican food in Tempe is very hard impossible
All in all I'm just happy to have an actual good mexican food place to go to in Tempe now
this was pretty tasty my only complaint would be that some of the pieces of beef were kind of fatty
So I would say for some quick Asian inspired food in a nice environment this would be a good option
Overall with a little effort into improving the ambiance and some little tweaks to the food it could be really good
I will say that i do trust that Pomegranate Cafe serves what they say they serve and the food was very high quality and very delicious
Cheap Beer Platters full of BBQ Meat Good Music and Basketball on the TV
Another place with friendly service amusing barfly regulars and good food
This was so much food and it was all good
The cornbread was sweet and had great texture; meat was tender and flavorful mac n cheese was rich and creamy
I had the salmon which I hadn't had before and it was good I don't usually get seafood in Phoenix
Carin had the pan-roasted chicken which is also quite good
As we walked up to it we noticed a very fishy smell - that's never a good sign at a fish restaurant
Not only are they good at making drinks and food - but they'll even recommend some good music for you to add to your itunes collection
Of course their food/drinks are pretty awesome too - I adore the mochas - Iced hot peppermint whatever-  it is always good
The food was really good from the bread with dipping sauce they start you with to the meal itself
The  chirashi bowl had a few kinds of fish chunks with some vegetables and it was good
I'm originally from NYC and you might call me a foodie so I set the bar fairly high and I'm not easily impressed but FEZ has earned my respect and I will be back
Otherwise Ticoz had great ambiance tasty food and drinks and was reasonable priced
I may just be trying to convince myself that pizza is good for you here but does thinner crust = less carbs
All their pizza's come topped with their home made mozzerella and I finished mine off with meatballs which seemed like a good idea at the time
They offer a variety of sandwiches salads baked goods and mesquite rotisserie chicken yum
I'm sorry to write that because by all accounts people who know good food love this restaurant
The shear quality and tastiness of the food make it impossible to rate this place less than 3 otherwise its a bunch of douchebaggery
Ham pork chop hot dog shredded chicken carne Asada and fried chicken and chicken fried steak  I think
ok so like the top half started out good but then I got grossed out with all the meat and then took off the fried chicken an chicken fried steak
The desserts are not bad either the chocolate dipped corn nuts over ice-cream and a shot of home made hot caramel
The food is wonderful the service is terrific
In addition to the burger the crab cakes are amazing - 100% crab meat and no filler/breadcrumbs
Food  The Prime Rib French Dip  was very good
Dessert Chocolate Soufflu00e9 Cake was very good
Food is yummy and drinks are just as good
I had the blackened fish which was good
Both times the food quality was just average
Maybe it's their execution but the flash frying of the basil just creates a bitter flavor that ruins the dish
Since it's already a well-established point that this place has delicious food at an excellent value I'll simply provide a few bulleted remarksGreat Original PaintingsSweet & fresh faced Guadalajaran transplant at counterAmazing Strawberry Salsa WTF -- who knew
Being from the Chicagoland area I have a great love for the Vienna beef hotdog which they serve at Luke's
The chili dog was delicious and made me realize how much I've missed Vienna beef
Their food was quite delicious the service was friendly and for that i would return and the only reason I give it 3 stars
The food is not worth the price the service is awful and there too many other options in the valley to choose from
It was a chefs special and it was the RED roll sooo frign good
First of all I thought this was just a pull up fast food joint with the paper sack that doubled as a tire shiner instead the inside was modern the food though rustic and true to its origins was tasty and simple and there was no drive thru
I enjoyed the Panang Curry with chicken and asked that they include zucchini and red peppers as well
We looked and looked and looked but I couldn't find the chicken fried steak and mashed potatoes which I consider health food and Carin looked in vain for some of her favorites or at least some salad dressing that wasn't essentially flavored water
It has good portions of ribs chicken pork and beef so you can sample from everything
The meat was flavorful and tender and you have several sauces to dress your tacos
He was very honest with us about his favorite dishes and had great recommendations for cocktails
The Biscuits and Gravy and Chicken fried Chicken are amazing some of the best I've ever had
The roll was also fluffy and delicious and BUTTERY
You can even add a shared appetizer and dessert for an additional $5
The main dishes were excellent and well prepared so we were all getting back to the happy spirit
The food is pretty good at Famous Dave's but it's far from the best
My wife and I shared a Hummus appetizer with Chicken Kabob plate
I love getting the teriyaki chicken in a quesadilla teriyaki sauce on the side and the jade chicken is good in ANYTHING
The layout of the store is great the food items all sounds amazing and I like the valet parking
Here's some suggestions*Starters*Tater TotsDeviled EggsWarm Mixed NutsCitrus OlivesRoasted BeetsHeirloom Tomato Salad Tasty but 3 slices was not worth the price*Main Dishes*Mac N CheesShort Ribs    The gravy boat dish is cool but the rib needs to be cut into smaller pieces*Dessert*Cheese Cake with Tortilla Ice Cream   I'm not the biggest fan of dairy but Tortilla Ice Cream is great
I had the hot and spicy fish hot my wife had the pad thai medium
The appetizer of thai eggrolls was delicious if meager
As bad as the service was the food is so stupid good that I'm giving four stars anyway
Do yourself a favor if you like Thai food give Siam Thai a shot
We arrived at the start to avoid parking chaos long food lines and of course to get first dibs on the goodies
As we waited for our food we watched the burrito go by and decided we'd have to come back and give that a try - it looked delicious and enough to split
Committing to that kind of drive time just to get some breakfast food it's gotta be good right
Our server wasn't excellent but the food was hot and tasty
Nevertheless I give them 4 starts because the food is about as good as a dog can get
The food except for the vegan pizza which is SO GOOD but kind of on the expensive side
Which is really a bummer because their vegan pizza is so good
Also this vegan pizza is amazing as always
At first we were stoked that it was so close to us and that during Happy Hour the sushi and appetizers were cheap good for the friends who aren't sushi fans
It looks like we'll be making the trek to a different sushi place Ra or Sapporos neither of which is as good as Celsius in terms of sushi but way better when it comes to customer service
The meat is exceedingly tasty and veggies fresh and crisp
Overall the food is tasty and healthy - grilled meats veggies & salad
The dishes as described had a lot potential and the presentation was nice but the quality was not up to par
If I'm feeling dangerous I'll hit the chicken panang equally as good
If I call in from Val Vista and 60E the food is piping hot and boxed by the time I pull in the parking lot
The savory crepes come with a delicious salad and it's a lot of food
I love when I'm so impressed by a non-food related business that I actually remember to write about it
The hubby and I got one dish from each category and everything was delicious and so nicely presented
00 for 1 beer and 2 vodka/soda and their food is tasty
Whether it's wings a burger or my wife's favorite buffalo chicken sandwich we've been consistently able to count on a quality meal from this place
5 stars because I thought the food was more beautiful than delicious
The desserts are not on the happy hour menu but they are definitely delicious
Indian restaurants are traditionally holes in the wall that serve food so tasty that you ignore some of the blatantly unhygenic details
The burgers are a big thumbs up huge and appear to be handformed from delicious beef like you would make on the grill at home the pannini's a big thumbs down
We ordered some pancakes with eggs and a side of corn beef hash upon the recommendation of the cashier
I guess it's might fault for not looking on the door but it's just almost a given in any modern food joints with the exception of say the Mexican hot dog carts you see around town
Overall the food is pretty flavorless and nothing worth making a trip out of your home for
I recently tweeted about having a craving for one of their amazing salads and was shortly informed via a tweet from them that they had a special going; Check in via Facebook places and snag an opportunity to get a free entree or pizza
They have some very creative dishes and they all taste good
The tents of other goods and foods and good foods see what I did there were awesome as well
Great AZ based restaurant chain that is growing and why not the food is very good
I would reccomend this place to just about anyone as long as you are in the mood for a delicious sandwich pizza or an awesome salad
Thai hot is their hottest setting just on the edge of perfect just needs a tiny more of a kick the tofu was ok not great but all in all a fantastic mood food was great and it was pretty fairly priced
Food tasted really good service was wonderful tables were clean
I jumped on it being an herbivore and was psyched that this place apparently has a whole smorgasbord of tasty food I can eat that is also healthy
Don't get me wrong I like Yolis and I would not hesitate to recommend it to people I know but I can not say that the food is 4 star
Don't get me wrong overall they have some tasty dishes but some others fall flat
The cowboy beans were hot and this dish was by far the best cowboy beans I've had in a long time
the meat was a little overcooked do to the deep frying of the shell but it was still good
Please request the avocado-tomatillo salsa and apply liberally to ALL food items - spicy and full of flavor
My friend ordered the fish tacos snapper and was thrilled with the flavor also loved the rice and beans
I had the chicken enchiladas and highly recommend the green sauce
Tandoori Chicken whole served sizzling with vegetables on top the chicken was drenched in oil which unfortunately took away from the flavor and added on to the heart burn
The hostess recommended the chicken tikki masala and perhaps we should have listened to her
Naan plain plain good and it also helped balance the very saucy main dishesChicken vindaloo ordered but not served
Wonderful Chinese food in Peoria albeit slightly Americanized
The grounds are beautiful the restaurants on the property had good food and I feel in love with the Salvatore Ferragamo Tuscan Soul scent of products they use
If you are looking for good authentic Mexican food this is the spot
So when they highly recommended Bianco we were looking forward to great pizza
We've had lots of good wood fired pizzas and this is not a requirement
Secondly we did have some really tasty dishes
I have had some not-so-memorable dishes too but nothing was ever bad and tonite was so good what the hell I'm going to give 'em 5 stars
1st off I just want to say that i do actually think the food here is pretty good tasting regardless of how brown the guac looks
the hot dog amazing I wish I could buy that brand and a grilled type beef sandwich which also was quite nice
I liked how the bar food was a bit different than say your average bar food no wings here and maybe that's a good thing
The very next day at 840am hubby and I drove 30 minutes to get to this place thinking it must be good to be featured in the Food Network show as if
We ordered our food and of coarse I had to try the caramel banana french toast that was highly recommended in DDD show  again we waited
Its food is always tasty and the coffee is scrumptious
The food is amazing especially if you are a vegetarian although I hear the meat combinations are very good too
I had a delicious chicken in black mole dish which was awesome
When done right sushi can be truly amazing
I am a fan of primarily sashimi not rolls but have heard good things about this place
I was surprised how impressed I was by the food and counter service
With 3 kids the eatery's we like are fast not fast food fast friendly fresh and good
The dessert featured 3 flavors and they were outstanding - mint chocolate chip banana toffee and salted carmel almond
Love the crust here too this is good simple pizza
It's nothing fancy and I wouldn't recommend this place for a date night or a night to impress anyone by ambiance but I have to admit that the food was fantastic
My mother-in-law go the salad with fresh grilled pineapple mango and chicken and it was delicious as well
The chips and salsa were pretty good I still prefer Aunt Chiladas but the service was quick the vibe was mellow and the food was tasty
I have eaten dinner here once fish and chips pretty dang good
So food is overall pretty good the night scene is just annoying in my opinion
It's not a big deal but would give it a better ambiance then a fork/knife wrapped in a paper napkin especially when you're dropping $20 per personNow for the good* The food is freaking AMAZING
That may not be saying that much as I don't eat pasta often and if I do it's usually Buca di Beppo or Olive Garden but this was some seriously good food
Pasta dishes are 4oz-6oz each and they recommend to pair it with a side or appetizer but really I didn't think it was necessary once the pasta dish arrived
I try to branch out and order new things but my favorite is actually an appetizer the Hummus with Grilled Chicken
The special chicken was initially pretty excellent
This is one of my favorite Chinese dishes in the world and we ordered it because one of the regulars waiting for take-out recommended it
I'm okay with overly sauced Chinese food but without any flavor and not thickened with cornstarch this was just a mess
Additionally the chicken tasted like it had been par-boiled before being stir-fried so it was tough flavorless and an unappetizing grey color
As I said at the beginning I am willing to wager that we should have ordered the fried rice which people seem to recommend but I don't believe we will be trying Wong's again as this food just isn't up to snuff
My halibut was delicious and my husbands chicken was just as good
OK guys and gals - this is it number one in the valleyNothing compares we have eaten the menu from top to bottom - its all 100% quality food
Overall the burgers were extremely flavorful and it was plenty of food for the money
The only downside is that beef patties were frozen and that takes away from some of the flavor
Having not had Chinese food in a while in a state that lacks any real great Chinese food we decided to give Wong's Place a shot
Suffice to say I have forsaken pizza chains due to the superb quality of the food at Slice of Sicily
I had a sampling of several different dishes shared between a group of 5 of us and all of them were tasty
Beef patties are good need a little more filling though
Listen we all know the food is ridiculously good no matter if you're sober drunk or whether it's day night or after you already ate somewhere else
I love that their ingredients are locally sourced which means that when I support this local business I'm essentially supporting all the other local purveyors of tasty foods as well
Though i like the food it is good I like the more traditional Mexican food
I had the Jamaican Jerk chicken which was hot and spicy and actually tasted the way that it does in Jamaica
Sounds like every other pasta dish in town but the flavors were exceptional
The freshness and quality of my dish was to die for
The hummus is great and the Chicken Tahook with garlic sauce is going to be the death of me in a good way  The food is in expensive we paid 15 bucks for a chicken tahook plate great chicken skewers served with pickles hummus pita and garlic sauce a chicken schwarma sandwich a small lamb meat pie small cheese pie and a large spinach pie
Plus there were a few good pizza comments so I'd say that the Z pizzas went over pretty well
Still the pizza was pretty good and the thin crust was great so I'm happy to give Z Pizza four stars; not the best pizza but nowhere near the worst
The food sometimes take a little while to arrive as well but it is worth waiting for - I love their french toast and their biscuit combo is great too
Of course there are the upfront price you pay for at the counter and then the back home price you pay for eating it =So there's all these optional questions to fill out along with the written interview saying things like Good for this and Good for that well it's really not good for anything except filling you up with stuff that resembles food while you're on a budget
Not in the mood for seafood but still enjoy good belly timber
You will definitely expect to pay accordingly for the quality flavor and love that is put into these amazing dishes
Everyone likes good Italian food but not everyone likes pretentious places like Carraba's or even that horrid Olive Garden
I like a good deep dish and Oregano's doesn't disappoint
Their appetizers drinks and sushi are all half off and there's a lot to choose from
All of the sushi I've tried so far has been fresh and tasty
A little sweeter than beef and it was so much more flavorful than any other red meat I eaten
We got a couple of different pizza's here and while the other one is not worth reviewing the roasted corn pizza topped with laura chenel goat cheese corn roasted tomatoes and basil was exquisite and would make even the tone deaf's taste buds sing
The pizza was tasty but definitely not as good as some others in the area
It might be one of those things like true food kitchen where you need to ask your server to guide you to the menu items that have good value for the price
For dessert pick from any of the delicious cookies or pastries at the counter
The hotel is also adding more modern amenities that are expected -- like individually controllable air conditioning units in each room
The waiter brought me a massive plate of deliciously tender chicken and just-right waffles and he did the same for my girlfriend she opted for unsmothered though
Will that iffy feeling in my stomach caused by the unholy union of gravy hot sauce chicken maple syrup waffles and coffee stop me from eating there
discussed hot dogs cinnamon rolls ice cream and drinks
employees start to cut back on the good offers not all stores but some started to hesitate when you ask for more meat/beans they bang the spoon a few more times to get just a little more beans or meat off
I did hear lots of goods things about Noca especially if you want to go and have fish
But after my Sunday experience I would not recommend Noca at all especially not on Sunday when they do have their Sunday Supper where you can only choose from 2-3 dishes and they charge you flat $35
Now do you get good quality and good food for that much money
It is about quality of food and experience and not how many plates can you throw in front of me
I did have fish and I must say It was great but when you sum everything up it's not worth it at all
The fish is so delicate it flakes apart easily with a fork and melts in your mouth releasing the flavors and sweetness of both the fish and miso marinade
4 Chilean sea bass this is another really delicate fish that had great flavor and served nicely seasoned sautu00e9d spinach
5 crunchy spicy tuna and avocado roll tuna and avocado with tempura flake crust6 spicy tuna and shrimp in rice paper roll I forget the actual name of it the rice paper gives this roll a unique and delicious flavor
The buffet is always well stocked with delicious fresh vegetables meats and cheeses but of course the real winner is the roasted meat that is carved at your table
Someone once told me that getting plain cheese pizza is the best way to judge whether or not a place actually has good pizza
says the people in here are not the classiest but the food is good enough to earn them four stars
There were plenty of food choices and all I tried were good
It's nice that they bring out the food to you and I have to say it was really good
One good thing was the food came out quick so once we were finally seated we were outta there quick
All in all we had a wonderful evening in a great atmosphere with great service and good food
The Taiwanese sesame oil chicken was a stewy concoction of slowly simmered dark meat chicken in a flavorful ginger-sesame broth
We started off with a seared grouper absolutely amazing next came 6 Japanese tapas which included a Kumamoto oyster with uni maguro tartar scallop roll everything was excellent
4th course they brought 2 personal grills to prepare some amazing American wagyu beef with mushrooms and asparagus
Final course was a quality sushi set my favorite was mackerel otoro and maguro was quality as well
Overall good flavors but not the greatest cuts of meats
The beef noodle soup is spicy and also uses preserved vegetables in the broth - flavorful but probably not for every ones taste
The beef wasn't tough but definitely wasn't tender; just seems like a lesser quality cut of beef
I felt like our waitress did a good job and I was actually shocked at how quickly some of the food came I am sure they are popular dishes that the kitchen makes in high volume but still - she did a good job of getting them to our table
I then enjoyed the fish tacos for dinner which were really tasty
I tried the red velvet cake for dessert and it was quite good
That said service was AMAZING guy brought out a sample of their chopped beef as well everyone was unfailingly polite that sweet tea seriously fantastic good sauce good smoke good BBQ
When one of our spa guests asked me yesterday where she could get a gluten-free pizza that tasted good I couldn't wait to tell her about True Foods
I decided to go w/a lunch option the grilled chicken sandwich and it was delicious
My favorite is the All Beef hot dog but they also serve hamburgers french fries onion rings milk shakes etc
Given the high quality of food and service at these prices this must be  the best bargain in town
- if you're not into the hand made pita or fresh of the block feta cheese it's younger brother Gyros comes with the same delicious lamb and beef gyros for about $3
but the dish that i had orecchiette alla puttanesca was a wonderful medley of veggies and herbs
i liked the limoncello cheesecake without absolutely loving it but it was good enough that i'd try something else from their dessert menu next time
not worth paying $16 for a pizza when the service is not worth it
I first had Cuban food at an awesome little restaurant in DC and it was amazing
The food at Tandoori Times is just more flavorful than it is at many other Indian restaurants in Phoenix and I believe the ingredients are of a better quality
The staff is always friendly and the food is always tasty
The Chorizo sausage is amazing but where they lost me was with the seafood
Its a small family run place that specializes in chicken tenders and that's about it but what they lack in menu diversity they make up in quality
Either in a salad on a sandwich made from buttery Texas toast or just on a plate alone the chicken tenders are moist and extremely delicious
I also would recommend their BBQ beef or Pork with rice marinated so deliciously
I can't say enough about how great of a happy hour spot this is other than in my pretentiousness about living central i will drive the half hour in awful traffic to partake in the coldest St Pauli Girl in the valley and eat amazingly delicious half-priced fresh seafood appetizers
That being said the food was excellent
I can't seem to remember names of our dishes but the eggs were very good with potatoes toasted sourdough bread orange juice and coffee
The corn pizza was also a generous portion and seemed quite good from the bite I got
Judging by the lack of food left on the plates in front of my dear husband and my sister I'd say the beef burgers must have been pretty darn good too
All in all Barrio Queen is in a fun location and the food makes it worth coming back
They were good but the classic starts at $20 and you don't get that much food
The second star was because the food was actually very good
I tried the Sushi once and came away unimpressed
Within a minute the tonkatsu order came out and it was cold; probably premade or something and the meat used was very very thin again so it was very dry
The meat itself was tender and flavorful but the crust was too flaky and bland
We live in Avondale we're willing to drive for a good breakfast and also pay a bit more for good food and good service
We came to the decision on 4 stars because the food was good but not out of this world
The sauce had no flavor the meatballs tasted like they were once frozen and there was a ridiculous amount of cheese on top like 3/4 of an inch thick
their single is like a double in California and an order of two types of bruschetta Tomato Mozzarella Basil Balsamic Reduction and the  Steak Gorgonzola Creamy Horseradish both of which were amazing
The Airport has lots of mini art galleries and great internet and the book stores do me right and the food choices are good for an airport
The servers were excellent and handled my gluten allergy easily offering suggestions and slight modifications to the dishes
Food's decent with reasonable prices for BBQ wings and more but the extra star comes from the variety of flavors you can get
Wow I never tried such delicious Hue style spicy beef noodle soup before
My best friend lives in AZ my friends and I stopped by this place and enjoyed surprisingly wonderful tasting pizza a must try
The food was really good and was better than similar tacos in CA
Food portions are huge so well worth your bang for your buck
Overall I really dug the atmosphere but the food left a good bit of room for improvement
We had a lot of fun here splitting the cheapest bottle of wine on the menu and enjoying some pretty good food
There are over 20 items to choose from and it comes with rice white fried or brown and a choice of either an eggroll fountain drink or soup egg drop wonton or hot & sour
There was a good amount of beef it in and the dish wasn't too salty as most places would serve
OK this isn't stellar mexican food but pretty darn good drinking snacks and they're cheap
The food was excellent but the downfall is the wait
However getting past that the food was very good
Dear Gyro PlateYour meaty goodness never ceases to amaze me smothered in tasty tzatziki that strangest word of words accompanied by your vegetarian friend Mr
Two stars because the food is always delicious but what the hell has happened to the service
The soup bars are wonderful as is the fish counter
The chicken bowl with lemongrass broth is amazing
We both had the Rajun Kajun chicken burger wonderful with just the right seasoning please thank the chef
My favorite here is the tomato and mozzarella sandwich and I generally believe that nothing can be good without meat
I do appreciate their 'healthy' options on the menu with calorie #s too and I do appreciate their salad bar that has a pretty good selection note that dessert is part of the salad bar
I thought the food was excellent the service was ridiculous
My advice to the Restaurant; you have a great food I'd recommend you also match it with great service
We hadCream cheese puffs - could have been better but I still ate themWonton Soup - Very good and really good crunchiesEgg Roll - I am not a huge eggroll person but was good for an eggrollShrimp Chow Mien - I loved this
Was a really big fan I hadn't ordered Matthew did and I ended up eating it allMongolian Beef - was good your standard Mongolian beefMu Shu Pork - Very good and something I noticed a couple days later usually the wrappers get hard and you can use to eat left overs the next day These wrappers were perfect 2 days laterI think in the end it probably depends what you like and what you order
I tried the ribs fall off the bones but sauce was too smokey and sweet - $21 ish bbq bacon burger with fries burger was nothing special and the fries were thin and crispy; meh - $12 french dip sandwich bread was soggy and meat was flavorless; meh - $12 WCG brownie blonde brownie with white and brown chocolate sauce topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream; meh - $7 and the banana cream pie home made granola crust that is crisp and not crunchy; meh - $7
My son has a weekly tutoring appointment in the same shopping center so when his Wednesday session rolled around this week I decided to check out Spitfire figuring a cold beer would beat waiting for a hour in the car outside
The service was fast friendly and -- again -- knowledgeable and able to make recommendations about the food
We had expected reasonably good bar food although the menu definitely showed some aspiration to better things
For entrees we chose the Diver Scallops with Asian Slaw and a White Soy Mushroom Sauce incredible the All-Natural Beef Bistro Tender cooked perfectly and the Green Tea Noodles with Miso Broth delicious and plentiful
Every dish we ordered was wonderful - lot's interesting ingredients on every dish that played well on the palette
I went back here on Sunday to watch some NFL games and had the same great service and pretty decent quality bar food
But a good place to bring a non-vegan if they're trepidatious  about trying veggie food
I love Whole Foods from their abundant selection of vegan and vegetarian options to their wonderful employees
Hot dogs burgers sausages turkey chicken roast beef fish veggie burgers cheese steaks wings salads fries onion rings shakes
The sub was good as the bread seemed fresh the meatballs were well sized and full of meat and not too much bread/filler
The meatballs and sauce were actually flavorful which is more than I can say for subway
I always order the appetizer sampler with my brother Spring roll egg rolls crab puff and fried shrimp and the variety of flavors was superb
So perhaps I'm attaching a little more magic to the experience than is totally merited but when we strip away the ambiance and charm of eating outside in January I'm still left with some delicious food
Where are the delicious unauthentic strips of white meat chicken
Well not maybe I definitely am but between the mijas and the cute little soups I felt very charmed by the man and woman working there and really really wanted to enjoy my food so I could write a big long review on Yelp about how wonderful their restaurant is
Neither my boyfriend or I really enjoyed either of our dishes
My dish was served cold which I wasn't expecting and seemed very flavorless to me
The man helping us suggested that I pour the bean substance on my dish to create a new flavor
The salmon and chicken did have wonderful flavor but it was just overcooked sadly
The fish was okay quality- definitely okay for the desert
I don't like that they stop serving food so early and only have baked goods especially when Green is closed
We ordered the bread with marinara as an appetizer and a pizza
The pizza is pretty good artisan style pizza but small portion for two
We were still hungry after an appetizer and pizza good lunch portions
Our bill came out to over $25 with an appetizer and pizza this didn't include tip and we didn't get any drinks
I would just as easily go to Grimaldi's or even NYPD for similar quality food for half the price
This is one of those friendly neighborhood restaurants with good prices & good food
The wood-burning pizza was really tasty for what is available in the far West Valley
The food was less than good with my Reuben looking like cafeteria food and my ceasar salad being basically lettuce burnt croutons and bottled dressing
What we ordered1 Pork Belly Pastrami2 Bacon Fat Popcorn3 The Original Chopped Salad4 Chicken & Waffles5  Burrata6  Grilled Halloumi Cheese7  Everything Bread Pudding8  A variety of cocktails including The PersianI highly recommend EVERYTHING listed above to order for the table
The Southwest Chicken salad was MORE than enough and was delicious as well as the macadamia nut cheese cake which was given to us on the house
There you can get loud enjoy your friends but have much better quality food
I saw someone complain about the price here on Yelp but we had dinner last night for 4 with a hot tea and a dessert for $50
Luckily I was not one of them as I ordered a fish entree that our server recommended
They explained the food is named after children-which I didn't really understand but who cares it was SUPER SUPER TASTY
I ordered #5 garlic chicken with onions and tomatoes the tomatoes were not really stewed more like they were baked with the chicken nothing really overpowered anything it was a great balance between all the flavors and on top of plain rice it was perfect
My friend ordered the Carnitas  on top of their version of fried rice which has meat in it -giving the rice a delicious flavor - just engulfed the plate in a matter of minutes it was THAT good
Highly recommend this place the items on the menu are extremely well thought out the prices are amazing for the food you get -5
I really enjoyed the juicy & natural flavors of the chicken
I've never had chicken empanada this good before
The green sauce on top was just enough to add some flavor without overpowering the dish
I got the fish taco on a soft tortilla rather than a hard shell & it was really delicious
Rolled Tacos- Crispy and fresh with a good amount of guacamole and cheese
The tacos have a good amount of meat inside
Beef Burrito Ground Beef- Very good ground beef
As far as cost is concerned  I think it is VERY reasonable considering the quality of the food and environment
I had the Caprese salad with thick slices of beautifully ripe and flavorful beefsteak tomato buffalo mozzarella fresh basil and a nice balsamic vinaigrette dressing
Food was good staff was ok they do need to update the menu discovered a minor mistake on something they no longer offer but we thought the prices were decent anyhow
But it was definitely quality white-meat chicken - and they gave you a large portion of it - for only $9 so you gotta give props to that
The spring rolls were crispy and delicious and came with a sweet-spicy dipping sauce
Thank you Arizona for providing me with some good sushi
I was so pleased with the quality of fish the flavor and texture of the rice and their prices are reasonable
No problem though because the food was worth the wait
The rest of the food is good but not exceptional
I have shopped at this one for about 2 years now andlove the high quality food items and reasonable prices and the couponsthat give you money back as well This one is very clean and has very great friendly help and great variety of items and some that you can onlyfind it the UK
Honestly I did not find the food to be very good at all
Ordered the Sonny Boy Tomato Sauce Fresh Mozzarella Salami Gaeta OlivesThe pizza is REALLY GOOD
For the appetizer 14 pizza and two drinks it was only $23
The food was amazing the staff was efficient friendly and attentive without being annoying and the desserts
The dishes came out piping hot to the table and I have to say I was sure surprised at the portion sizes
The lemon chicken was so crispy and perfectly cooked and the shrimp dish was absolutely delicious and a very ample portion
The dumplings were crispy and flavorful and the fried rice dish was something that I couldn't wait to delve into because it looked so good and different from most I've had at other restaurants
The meat was very tender and the red cabbage was delicious
During dessert our waitress who we learned was the owner's wife gave us all a free shot of their home made apple schnapps
then the scallop dish which was delicious with the risotto
I asked for a recommendation and ordered what looked like the easiest dish to make
The food was inventive delicious and packed with flavor and despite the full dining room it came out fast
We had the margherita and sonny boy pizzas- both excellent
If you like huevos rancheros and you like Italian food this would be a good choice
I will say that both times I have been there my order was taken completely wrong however it did no phase me becasuse their pizza is worth it
Besides the vegetarian burger the rest of their food is good
In Short Good food and beer at a reasonable price and a quirky atmosphere
The food was quite flavorful and the proportions were adequate
Highly recommend for fresh home cooked comfort food with a SW twist
The goodMost of the food is delicious
Usually these kind of dishes are heavy but this dish was very light but flavorful at the same time
Overall I would recommend this place if you are looking for a change of pace when it comes to Indian/Pakistani food and want something lighter but flavorful at the same time
Due to the terrible service we experienced I should give this place 1 star but the food was delicious so I'm giving it 2 stars
I will say my chicken tikka masala was absolutely delicious and is one of the best I have had in Arizona
The beef on this burger got a little lost with all the extras but it was still very good
The food at brunch was good but I don't think it really warranted the price tag
Great location love the service I've gotten from everyone here totally fast and friendly and Barro's pizza is a tasty favorite
Prices are good for getting smaller pizzas if you don't need to feed a large gathering and just want something for 2-3 people to enjoy at home
But what would an amazing environment be without equally amazing food
The food at Arcadia Farms is just as wonderful as the aura
The food is excellent and from what I can tell the set menu changes regularly
The food is worth the wait and the experience is certainly unique
We were impressed with the food & will consider coming back the location is far for us & it is a little pricey BUT MOSTLY WORTH IT
This is our go-to place for dolsot bibimbap korean stone bowl with veggies meat and rice mixed with some hot red sauce and some fresh relatively cheap sushi
The salad was great side pasta was good main dish Meatball Sub was forgotten
Meatballs were not cooked and sub some cold
The flavor of the food is good but I gave them enough chances and not one good experience =
Either way I'm not proof reading this and writing it on my iPod touch so I apologize if this review is not my best but overall I really like fresh and easy they have good quality foods not usually found in grocery stores are healthier than take out barely and great on a stay home Friday or weekend check it out you will find something you like or something good for lunch at work
Our sushi came out fast our server was always nearby and everything was tasty
The server recommended the chicken tikka and I went with that
I however still eat a steak every now and then and the fake meat here is pretty good
I had the chicken salad with miso dressing which was really tasty and a small bowl was plenty for me
The food is good although I have had better for less $ even without a deal
amazing little beef and onion filled dumplings covered in yogurt sauce a spicy orange sauce and dried mint
I don't eat a lot of red meat but those burgers looked delicious
With a 20 minute or so drive home the food wasn't exactly piping hot and the turkey jalapeno sausages we ordered had gotten quite cold and a bit rubbery
We usually get moo Shu chicken which is very flavorful
Yea its cool to see the huge burgers stacked with all the goodies and yes its fun to build your own burger and yes I did like the fact that they had Buffalo and Kobe Beef options but when they handed me my bill I wanted to mash what was left of my burger in their face
It sounded just meh but it was actually really good with lots of chicken surprisingly and other veggies like mushrooms bamboo onions etc
I am not a fish person but their fish tacos are delicious and they are different
It is sinfully delicious dessert that changes with the season but the peach and berry is my favorite
The thin crust pizzas are actually really good but light so if you have a serious appetite don't be surprised if it don't need a box to take home extra slices
But it is a little bit pricey for a burger so usually only go when I have have a groupon/deal chicken - but it is a good pit stop before a movie
Only one dish on the buffet line was remotely flavorful
I've had several things that were really good and I particularly remember liking their chicken salad
They have great prices on all Mexican food ingredients and some really good weekly specials
I had the personal sized pizza and it was excellent
It was good lots of chicken and was tasty
Quite good although I thought the plank made it awkward to share this dessert
The coffee is good I hear from my wife and the cinnamon roll is a real treat
Not the best cinnamon roll ever in a million years but a good 8
So we come from California where there is a lot of sushi to choose from and it is my favorite food so I have been searching for good sushi here this is not the place
A final word about the pricing - the quality of the food and its preparation were very good but the prices were well within reach for a nice dinner first courses $7-$9 entres starting at $15
The restaurant was open and inviting and the food smelled good
So to sum up the place is nice the service is good and the food is kinda bland
Their noodle dishes are really good and I liked the quality of the food and found it to be very tasty
I put their house made hot sauce/oil on my dishes but it still didn't really add heat though it did add some good flavor
It's young which appears to be a lot of recent graduates or people that just love good beer and good food
Carolina's Mexican Food is both authentic and delicious
My favorites are the bean and cheese burrito and the green corn tamale I'm a vegetarian so I can't provide feedback on the meat but I'm sure it's just as delicious
If you're looking for some cheap tasty Mexican food and you're in the downtown area I would definitely recommend Carolina's
So NOTE TO SUNS FANS This could be a very good place to watch a game while enjoying traditional bar food and a brewski or several
I think they had to kill 3 chickens for our appetizers alone
I got here to the NW Valley and had a hard time finding anywhere to get some rice and noodle dishes especially good take-out in my neighborhood
Bottom line  it's tasty Asian food at a decent price in an area that is lacking an Asian food presence
If you are missing some good Island food this is the best place we have found to get our fix
Based off of the decor service and the appetizer and dessert - NOCA gets my 5 stars
The waiters were beyond courteous yet not overly friendly and did a wonderful job explaining our dishes to us
I NEVER describe food like that but this was wonderful
As mentioned in other reviews the food is good but not amazing except for dessert
We orderedMedium pepperoni pizzaChild's chick stripsSmall salad6 hot wingsThe pizza was just ok
I got the broiled fish sandwich the other day and the lettuce was all soggy and the sauce was SO blah it was a very boring meal with very little flavor
The only reason this place get's three stars is because the hummus and chicken platter is really good
Have been coming here for a many years it is very well managed the food - all of it is in some way special even the cheeseburgers are oblong very tasty and served on matching poppy seed rolls
WHO KNEW THERE WAS GOOD FOOD IN ARIZONA
anyway the place isn't fancy but it is fresh and clean family owned and serves up some really good food
It didn't really matter though as the food was good
It has been quite the challenge to find good Chinese food in AZ
From the customer service to the quality of food we are never disappointed
My 5 year old loves the sesame chicken and their beef skewers are good
Everything is clean and ingredients in each dish are fresh and flavorful
I came her with coworkers for lunch and ordered the Chicken Souvlaki Platter which was simply wonderful
the chicken was grilled perfectly the potatoes were tender and flavorful the pita was warm and soft and even the greek salad was tasty which is saying a lot because I don't normally love greek salad
My coworkers ordered the Chicken Souvlaki Pita and the Chicken Salad as well and both enjoyed them a lot so really it seems like the food is pretty right-on
Tasty brews consistently good food and decent service has recently made this dim saloon style establishment a new haunt
Food portions are huge and recommended for sharing
I've heard the Bavarian pretzels are good and the pizzas looks great too
If you pass off average cuts of meat in good bread I can forgive you somewhat
I've heard the food is good and worth the price though I've only eaten a slice of prosciutto
The food finally came out and the chicken was hot and tasty BUT
On the second visit my chicken breast was was over cooked and dry but everything else was pretty good
I thanked them for the tip but I wouldn't have guessed that I needed to specify that I wanted a hot dish to be hot
I used to love this place but the quality of food and service has really gone down hill since when it first opened
I don't know if it was the food or the company but I had a fantastic time and have been with that very same boy for over 2 years now - Good first date choice Sean R
The restaurant is cozy dark and intimate and the food is amazing with killer prices
My favorite dishes are the Thai Basil with chicken or shrimp Garlic chicken or shrimp the Red Curry chicken and the Coconut soup soooo good
Good promotions amazing food served table side and all the sports games you can watch
The food and drinks are decent quality and moderately priced so in any other situation I'm sure it would've been three even four stars
The main entrance to the club is through a small smoking patio ringed by misters with a half dozen high tables roll out bar and on this particular night an ice block luge for taking shots
They have never messed up my order and their food is always hot and delicious upon arrival
Sushi dishes do not have any distinguishing factors and fish quality was low to acceptable
I tried the Italian Garden--it was quite tasty but needed a little less of the multiple sauces that were on it--and my husband had some roast beef selection with horseradish-flavored cheese
My number is called and I get my food from the window the ahi is not rare at all so over cooked the oinion rings are so greasy and are not good this guy bummed
Delicious Indian food and a great selection of vegetarian dishes
I LOVE the fact that each dish is mildly spiced and left up to the individual to customize the flavor depending on which sauces they choose
For the most part the food is good and have really never had an issue with it however I will say there isn't anything on the menu that is my favorite
The food is good but the prices are just too ridiculous
I'll save you from having to ask yourself this by telling you that the food is not good
Their sauce is great; and they serve it in heated containers so it doesn't get your food cold
The food is consistently good the prices are fair and people who run the place are very nice Gloria Lupe and Richard
Their food can get hot try the chips and salsa
I usually split a delicious chicken chimichanga with my wife
That being said I still expect my food to be made with decent ingredients to be flavorful and to be a good value for the money
By the time we found a seat at the counter our food was ready  about 5 minutes  I was impressed that they got it done so fast
The victuals are quality and if I might recommend the meatloaf sandwich
I'm not a big supporter of meatloaf but this particular dish was quite good
I told all my fellow foodies about my wonderful experience the innovative menu and all the little extras that made the meal a really special dining experience in Phoenix
I think I am able to overlook the fact that its really not an attractive room--the energy from the kitchen and the close tables add noise and excitement to the room but the art and lighting is ugly and now that its starting to look run down as well--there are too many new beautiful places in the city with equally good food and equally as pricey that are not in strip mall
One of my friends ordered their fish and he said it was tasteless and another had their teriyaki chicken and thought it was tasty
As far as the food the prices are cheap the menu is semi-a-la-carte and the the waffles are amazingly crisp and perfect

We also ended up splitting an order of chicken tacos which again were good but not remarkable
I was very exited for the creamed corn side dish and it was a little hot for me but was delicious and I ate it even though my nose was running from it
If your going for the food it's pretty good just don't go there looking for the best service
As for the pizza parts of the crust were burnt and overall the flavor left something to be desired
Since other patrons have raved about the pizza I would give it another chance but n based on this trip alone I wouldn't give a strong recommendation
We got the Las Vegas Roll which was not very good
They have fairly average but always tasty food and the service has always been great
The brisket was good even though my homemade is better   and the kaiser roll was excellent

The food is consistently good service is always good and the market is fun to browse in after a great meal
Aside from the fact that there's an In N Out right across the street this place is clearly in the same league as they both offer super greasy restaurant-quality burgers in a fast-food setting
The food at the Metrocenter location is consistently good however

I told him he must dump hot sauce all over that dish because there is nothing going on there
not sure if it's what we ordered or what but Flavors of Louisiana is way better if your craving Cajun food in the valley
Good food shouldn't depend on the chefs mood and here it doesn't
The second visit we had pizza it was good we were looking for deep dish which they don't make but it was good and great service
The bread was stuffed stuffed with meat the peppers and onions were good but the giadiniera made it
The cherry on top of this sundae was that our restaurant week flat price included a choice of one of three desserts and it was delicious
Went to Wildfish on a recommendation from a friend's father
I would have awarded 5 stars based on the excellent food if it were not for the server's lack of mentioning the prices listed at market value as we ordered
The food is good and some of my favorites are the green papaya salad Pad Thai and Suon Non
The chicken and dumplings was served in a big bowl and contained juicy pieces of chicken soft and squishy dumplings peas carrots celery and an extremely flavorful herb saffron cream sauce

The food is tasty I love how you can choose different breads besides your boring old bun
I told my fiance how good the burger was too bad for him he doesn't eat red meat and he was bummed
So I get it it's a casino buffet - nevertheless  a couple consistent points merit the five star rating for Eagles1 Creativity You can tell they're always trying little twists without compromising quality - their fish dishes on Friday are always pretty creative and tasty and I personally don't really like fish very much
the fish was good and they use cabage in their burritos which i love
Our goal was to relive our France vacation by eating the foods and flavors we loved
Food I reiterate THE FLATBREADS ARE AMAZING
Fortunately the place doesn't look like it has changed since We are the World was tearing up the pop charts and the food hasn't either in a good way
So we had a hot fudge sundae and key lime pie for dessert
They say that in space food doesn't have flavor so on the bright side for the cost of lunch it was like being in space
The rice in the burro had no flavor either I don't know if the food was props for movies or what
I'm usually not this difficult about food but I like hot food and always think of sandwiches as cold
I have found that the wine selection has a few good choices to complete the pizza or if you are a pizza and beer person the beer selection is average
I'm going to go ahead and put FEZ in the same category of dining as Carly's or Essence-the portions are smaller than average but the quality and taste of the food is outstanding
The food is at the lower end of the spectrum on quality considering the multitude of options
Although parking is always a little tough as it is everywhere in Old Town the food is definitely worth it
That being said I have to thank the owner and all of the staff for bringing such tasty food to the neighborhood
I would definitely recommend this place for good service quality food and cheap eats
As far as Pizza goes which is what we went for I was not that impressed
Obviously there are enough people who like gourmet pizza as this place has amazing reviews so I'm just one simple man
Beautiful ambiance wonderful service decent wine list and flavorful dishes
The chicken fried steak was good but nothing out of the ordinary
I have to say I have been very impressed with the food
My buddy did get the Southern Fried Fish and Chips Catfish and it looked pretty good and most everyone else at the table seemed satisfied with what they received and thats the only reason I gave the food any credit
Price - 2/5Based on the quality of the food I could have gone somewhere else and spend $20 for a ribeye and veggie skewer and been much happier
Then we had some chips and salsa -- if the salsa here is any indication of what the food tastes like then it gets good reviews from me
The kids gets fish and chips when we visit and from what i've sampled that is good too
-They need to 'clean' the place up a bit -The food at the restaurant isn't that good-The a/c is not good
The food is really good but the kitchen runs at a snail's pace
Thinly sliced roast beef roasted red peppers provolone baby arugula dijon mustard and a creamy horseradish just popped with flavor
The flavors of the dressing topped with the perfect seasoned and cooked chicken will most definitely keep you coming back
People can't really be going to the Pink Taco because they think the food is good
They probably even think that the food was amazing but that's only because they had 10 margaritas to go with their meal
Quite good but the food doesn't stand out too much from other pho places
I got the small size Chicken soup-based pho tasty and filling with a side of egg rolls
The people are very friendly and the food was tasty
The food was good but certainly not worth the price and although I will forgive many breaks of service when it is done deliberately I will not go back

I wouldn't call this amazing 5-star Thai food by any means but it does make for a fairly decent lunch option on this lame side of town
it was a three course meal appetizer entree and dessert
The food was fab we had lobster potstickers for an appetizer that were amazing and I had the shrimp for dinner and that was great as well
The breading was tasty and the chicken was fall of the bone tender
We went there for first time had good food and great service
It was a table tucked away in a corner which we felt would be good for keeping ambient noise to a minimumAfter scoping out some of the food at the other tables it was determined that a shared appetizer and two pizzas should have been enough for the three of us
Since Cibo makes their pizzas with those brick oven blisters on 'em this means that the remaining slices all had that watery charcoal flavor that tastes like the cooled-down grill you licked on a dare while drunk last Memorial Day
The mushrooms did a good job of hiding a lot of the issues mainly the sauce that the margherita pizza had
I can't recommend any one dish because all their dishes are diligently prepared and fresh
I also had the luck to be in the restaurant on a rare night that they gave their patrons a token good for free desserts for the rest of your life
And yes you will wait a tad longer than other places to get your food but it is worth it
They marinade the chicken in something wonderful it's so tender and flavorful and served with the best jalapeno ranch
Although the flavor of all the dishes weren't out of this world they were still good
The portions were just right 2 appetizers and 2 main dishes perfectly satisfy a dinner for 2
Both were extremely tasty with HUGE shrimp pieces of sausage or chicken or whatever was in it
If you can stand to spend about 20 bucks a person don't care about the calories and want some really good food and a lot of it come
Here's the deal- As far as food goes this place deserves 5 stars its inventive fresh Mexican food and always amazing
I have to say the food is excellent BUT the service is AWFUL
I hope this place cleans up their act in the kitchen because they cook some good food
However I was not impressed with the food
The Super Hero really lacked taste and I couldn't differentiate between the different flavored meats
I disagree with some of the other reviews that mention that the food was generally not good
Luc's is a destination for foodies like myself who appreciate some unusual yet delicious culinary creations
The food was good but not super memorable
As for the sushi it ia always fresh and delicious & you can count on getting some uni or toro freguently
Good pizza regardless-plus it's on my way home
As long as you can avoid the more ridiculous menu items the food is actually pretty excellent if somewhat pricey
I had the wedge salad which was crisp and fresh the moroccan lamb burger which I'd had last time and it was delicious as usual and their new creation the chicken  burger
A LOT of attention to detail's given by Asadero how can you go wrong when you order a half a chicken and as usual you're brought tortilla chips although from a bag they're great anyway salsa that's not exactly homemade but it IS good and a small bowl of their bean soup that's LOADED with great spices herbs and veggies mixed with a broth base
The cooked butterfish tataki melted in your mouth while the white asparagus and yuzu shallot dressing finished out the flavor
Tonight I had the Yellow Curry Chicken and it was very good
For dessert I recommend walking over to the Coldstone Cremery across the street and getting something with butterfinger bits and sprinkles
Overall not nearly the best sushi or ambiance around but not bad given the location and decent to good sushi
as we were in the mood for soul food and lolo's was closed we read reviews for this place and decided to give it a shot
The food is solid not the best I've ever had but the portions are generous it is fresh and it's good
We ordered a total of 5 pizza's 2 appetizers and 3 desserts for our party
I wasn't too hot on the idea of getting a piece of bread as a snack but once I bit into it I wanted to curl up with the roll that I got and sleep with it for days
The dry noodles and rice dishes are generous portions and very tasty
It was miserable so while the food was great and def worth repeated visits I can't take the heat so I'll sadly have to stay out of their kitchen
Their brisket is really really good and it's a huge amount of food
They have all the classic smoked fishes you'd expect at a Jewish Deli my personal favorite is sable; yes it is worth $40 a pound   Their whitefish salad is also really good it has large pieces of white fish in it and scallions
The pizza crust is super crunchy and has an amazing flavor cheese is nice and greasy and the toppings are good quality
If you are lucky enough to dine in the wings are even better and they will serve you these delicious pizza bread rolls
The pizza was most definitely not amazing stupendous or even particularly impressive
I do have to say the Roasted Jidori Chicken I had was TRULEY AMAZING and really was among the VERY BEST of chicken dishes I ever had out
For me desserts weren't worth the calories
So far I've had the Orange and Mandarin Chicken Vegetable Beef pepper sauce added cause I like it hot Chicken Fried Rice add Bean Sprouts Crab Angels Egg Rolls I love and Mongolian Beef
The food is good a little pricey for bar food but good nonetheless
My favorite things are the Poke appetizer seriously the BEST EVER sweet potato friends fish cakes and DR FUNK
On the Santa Cruz menu they have beef satay and ahi rice bowls that are amazing - I wish they were on this menu as well
For bar type of food the quality of the food is actually quite good
The service was awesome again the drinks were tasty and the food was excellent
In a town where big chains like Starbuck's & Pete's are covering pretty much every neighborhood here comes 32 Shea with a great variety of fresh coffees teas and delicious food
Some of my friends seemed to talk endlessly about how good of drunk food they have
When I asked the waitress for recommendations the menu is quite extensive she replied I don't really like mexican food but
The service was VERY slow knocking a star for that - albeit it was very busy that night but otherwise the food was great nice and tasty
The beef skewers had a very fishy flavor to them as if they were mixed with something fishy in the kitchen prior to being plated for us
Too bad as we love living here in Scottsdale but the food quality leaves a ton to be desired as of yet
Next up the food is excellent quality and at a decent price
I honestly can't tell you how good the prices were on beer but the food isn't bad
My wife and I had bruschetta for an appetizer and I had the trio sampler lasagna cheese manicotti and ravioli and the food was excellent
The vibe is truly authentic and the food is excellent
Some menu suggestionsGlazed Chicken Lavosh PizzaAny of their hummusFalafel appetizer or pitaBeef Gyro not available at Tempe locationSpinach QuesadillaChicken del SolChicken Tikka MasalaEnjoy
My fiance and I enjoyed our shredded beef tacos they weren't the greatest but they weren't the worst
When we got to our seats on the patio we all thought what a great night beautiful weather fun exciting place and we know the food is good at CB so it should be great here
Unfortunately when we left Mike and I said to each other that the food and the experience was not worth the drive or money we live by the Biltmore and if we wanted the food CB was a better bet
The flavors are mostly there the plating enhances the experience and visually adds to the food
The food is awesome-definitely worth the price but be prepared for the mediocre service
She made sure our glasses were never empty and our food was served hot
However if you ask me it's a sign of how GOOD the food was older people tend to have more $$ to spend on their meals and thus choose better ones
To find out for yourself just how good this place is walk in ask to be seated at the bar and ask your Itamae sushi chef Omakase onegaishimasu
The food is all about heat rather than flavorful taste
In order to really enjoy your burger you have to cut it in half to get some good food porn for your stomach
Went for the start of restaurant week and it was excellent started off with drinks at the bar tequilarito-I think and then dinner and dessert
I won for the entree dish though mom and dad had the sea bass and I ordered the skirt steak  totally amazing
The food is good a little pricy but decent
The food was okay but not worth the money
Then we were brought out some crusty old stale rolls that were cold and hard and I immediately sent them back and requested fresh ones
PJ knows that the food is good and the price is right
I stayed here a year ago and I frequently bring friends here for the great food at Gallo Blanco inside the hotel or for the free Flamenco on Wednesday nights
The food was of average quality and I've been to better with cheaper prices
Would not recommend this place  to anyone seeking good seafood
I ordered the sole which was good comfort food but there was nothing special about it
What I will say is the prices are pretty high and while the quality of the food is also high there is no wow factor nothing that stands out to me
Dessert was awesome - we just ordered simple hot fudge sundaes and the hot fudge is HOMEMADE - are you kidding me
It was cold and the meat tasted like hamburger meat
Being in the mood to try different things we noshed our way through the Crispy Calamari/Muc Chien Don  Fire Cracker Shrimp/Tom Chien Don continuing with tasty fresh spring rolls Tuna/Ca Thu Spider/Cua Chien and  Chicken/Ga Nuong
I was kind of hesitant because I thought it might be whole meatballs on a pizza but it was not and I am still dreaming of this pizza the flavors and the crust were amazing
I would definitely reorder everything includingShredded Pork w/ Garlic Sauce deliciousBlack Pepper Chicken w/ Scallions fabulousBlack Pepper Beef Chow Mein spicy
perfectly seasoned not too greasy delicious chunks of chicken breast scallions onions and cabbage
Unfortunately the pizza is overpriced and really not very good
Ted's offers regular foot long and all beef franks as well as Italian Polish and White Hot Sausages
True Food is worth it for the drinks alone
;- The food is great because it is healthy and they use all natural ingredients to flavor the food with way out there combinations but it is not a fusion type restaurant
The tinga is great with citrusy notes on top of slow cooked beef full of chorizo and onion flavor--don't worry the onion sweetens it up
Since I gave this restaurant a 3-star here are my justification or valid reasonsFirst the the not so good Roku sushi is sub-par in terms of their sushi rolls
It's not terrible but if you enjoy good quality and non pureed fish in your rolls then this is not the place for you
with the aforementioned the quality of food so so and the atmosphere excellent balances each other out
The sandwich with a small hot coffee ran a bit over $8 which isn't bad for local organic food
I was absolutely starving after a long plane ride so I ordered the chicken tacos guac and a plantain appetizer and it only took about 20 minutes to show up
The chicken tacos were really really good
Alright rant aside I had their red sangria not that great their first course grilled shrimp dish that had a really good avocado guacatillo sauce
I haven't had a full meal there but I've had a dessert which was good and service is attentive while being surprisingly unobtrusive
My mouth is watering right now just thinking about this amazing culmination of my two favorite foods
I first heard about Chino Bandito from Diner Drive-Ins and Dives Guy kind of good at find those amazing little hold in the wall mom and pop ghetto looking food heavens
Then they turn you loose to come up with any concoction you can imagine; Terriaki chicken and fried rice in a burrito carnitas over white rice sweet and sour chicken in a quesadilla with a side of re-fried beans emerald chicken chicken with this amazing pesto type sauce and black beans and rice
They also have the most delicious cookies for dessert
The food is good but a bit pricy - and nothing special really
For dessert we shared  freshly made 3 cheese cake with mix of fresh berries - it was light and oh so delicious
The food is the key to a good restaurant so it's going to drive my rating
All in the the service was good the food was good and the company was awesome
The hubby had a pasta dish which he thought was pretty good
Of course more cheesy deliciousness accompanied by dried shredded beef  pico de gallo and a few sliced limes
On one of my million visits the flavors of one of the dishes a rice dish that I can't recall now  didn't work for me but that is probably just me
I would not say it was the best pizza I've ever had not by a long shot but it was good enough to redeem the service so that I may try La Bocca out a second time
Atmosphere was excellent food was good service was sub par
The only reason I don't give it a five is a slight quality variation issue in some of there dishs
With delicious sauce amazing well done meats and amazing salads an original salads I would give it five stars but I am being picky
The food is always good but the chips seem to always taste stale
This place has it all good food great service local feel and charm and amazing prices
I had my first bite and was happy with my decision to copy my wife's choice -The food was pretty good my wife liked it and my little girl loved he sandwich
It was a large portion for the price and it was hot food
The big chunks of cheese and the perfectly sized and seasoned pepperoni have such an amazing flavor on the thin crust pizza
If you are here for some food and not to get wasted you're on your hour lunch break or you actually want to have a nice meal with people you enjoy I would not recommend going to the RA on Mill
You get Miso which I don't eat since they use fish *Tip for other vegetarians their Tempura sauce also contains fish uchi no salad good when made right I'll even order the full size as my entru00e9e sometimes rice a spinach gyoza a vegetable spring roll and your entru00e9e
Their spicy chicken teriyaki udon packs a punch and is nose sniffing hot
This place seems like a nice little neighborhood bar My buddy lives down the street and goes here a lot they didn't seem to have a lot for a beer selection compaired to some other Tavern's in the area but the appetizers and food are good
The food was good and I did enjoy my meal
Quick service good food; I'd go back and looking forward to it
As for the food the wings were very good
We walked away from the table to watch some of the live performance super entertaining and our waiter took the liberty of placing our food under the heat lamp so it didn't get cold AND put covers over our waters
If you're looking for delicious cups of goodness the cinnamon roll latte is to-die-for and fantastic followed by their killer french toast
But I was expecting something with good food like Fez and this just disappointed
Never before on the mainland have I had sushi that has made me stop and really and I mean REALLY savor the flavors
Run out of strip-mall a Korean Chef named Paul runs Yen Sushi & Sake Bar and creates some of the most interesting and delicious sushi I have had the pleasure of having
Delicious tea and free miso on top of an amazing atmosphere and an incredible chef have made Yen the ONLY sushi bar that I will continually come back to in Phoenix
They own a little wine bar adjacent that dishes out beer wine and appetizers to all those waiting to eat there
The roasted corn pizza was absolutely delicious
There was only one person at the table who ordered Sushi so it is not fair for me to rate the Sushi even though she said it was good
I have been on a macro platter kick but I was impressed with my lavosh chicken wrap
The food is sooo good  that I make this 30 mile trip once a week
I've been to Brazil over the past 7 years and visited numerous Brazilian restaurants and eaten in  Churrascaria barbeque style food; let me say that Val's Brazilian Restaurant offers the same quality and atmosphere as the restaurants of Brazil
I would recommend Val's Brazilian Restaurant if you like to have delicious Brazilian food and lots of fun
So if you want to have  some fun and good food go check out Val's Brazilian Restaurant and truly experience a taste of Brazil you will be greeted by many Brazilians working at the restaurant with not only a smile but asking how you like the food and music
The service was spot-on and the food quite good
Inside an enclosed MLB park good view of the game from the front row tables and decent food covered buy half the cost of your ticket; For the concept alone this should be a five no six star review
We ordered $60 worth of food and beverage and surprise still owed $18 at the end of the evening
They are also reasonably priced for a quick and tasty dessert
So wonderful to have a food option in Scottsdale other than the dime-a-dzn Coyote Ugly-type bars & poser sushi joints
Our server recommended 2-3 dishes per person
They all looked amazing  no meat for this girl so looky no touchy and he ended up taking the chicken home
The fish nice sized pieces of cod with a nice and crunchy coating was delicious
This place was simply meh especially given the huge amount of delicious mexican food places in AZ where you can get a kick ass margarita for a whole lot less than $10
Try Tia Rosas in Mesa for some excellent mexican food and margaritas worth their $8 and more in tequila
He also assumed that we were having trouble reading the menu because the quality of food was too good for our tastes
and maybe i'm just impartial to ethiopian food in general because there's never been an ethiopian meal that i haven't enjoyed
anyone else i've ever taken here eats meat and has ordered accordingly to their carnivorous tastes and enjoyed what they ordered
While the meat and chesse tasted really good the overall finish was somewhat dry
Lots of toppings and a good hearty crust without being all grease and bread and that's pretty impressive for a pizza with bacon and double cheese
The main course could be kobe beef cooked on your own hot ceramic plate or a cod slowly cooked with light spices
I guess I'm just one of those folks that doesn't need an expensive diner menu to feel that I am getting quality mexican food
$5  I had an enchilada dish and it was good
My boyfriend had a pasta dish and it was also good
Soo overall 5 stars for the tortillas 4 stars for the margaritas 3 stars for the service and 2 stars for the food quality vs
I had high hopes for this place after seeing it on the food network and hearing good reviews from coworkers
Fish quality was very good and very fresh
Another highlight and an exceedingly good value is the chirashi sushi
One good thing -- The place has a very wide variety of Japanese food not just sushi
For the last two days I've heard her on the phone to at least 3 different people raving about the amazing Mexican food she had on Saturday
Definitely recommend this spot for anyone that really enjoys spicy food
Hey thats close enough to fast food to be worth it
It kind of reminds me of LA's Urbano Pizza or a lot of these fancy gourmet pizzeria places but if you ask me if it is worth 2+ hours of wait time to get fancy pizza
While the service & pricing was fine we were not nearly so impressed with the quality of the food
We both felt it was just typical diner quality food
it's entertaining to write about food events hotels and all the rest of the yelp worthy universe as opposed to writing about money marketing software money technology legal issues money and mostly
They serve a decent cup of coffee have nice selection of breakfast pastries and breakfast food goodies
The food is just too much too mention but everything we had was tasty and the desserts were killer
Brimming with creative tasty dishes and wood-fired cooking know-how
It was not til the end of our dishes and appetizers that she asked if I wanted a refill and i desperately wanted one when i was eating my food and after eating a couple bites of the queso dip I thought i would love but hated
It's a little off-putting with its strip mall location but I've been coming here for years and the sushi is always awesome quality
I only ordered drinks but caught a glimpse of some of the food and peeked at a menu and the food looked and sounded good
I think that the huevos are pretty good but the biscuits and gravy leave a little to be desired or so say the meat eating friends of mine
I haven't tried any of their food items but he does get a muffin in the mornings which looked pretty good
will not fly with this airline again the ticketing/check-in counter open late so our flight was delayed the foods sucks an itty bitty taco for your lunch smaller than a hot pocket they bombard you serving with refreshments so their work  will be done earlier and can play with their phones on the back
I don't know what it is about the concept that placing ground beef inside a corn tortilla and frying it in a pan is a good thing
The broken rice was kind of dry but once you pour the fish sauce on it's good
I also do a lot of my own meat smoking and love the smells and flavors so I do have some background in it   I was terribly disappointed in this place
To me when  a sauce is to sweet your covering up to much of the meat flavor
I had the turkey pastrami sandwich which comes on a pretzel roll which from what I ate was delicious
While I was living in California I came to learn that there were a handful of good sandwich spots around that provided an excellent alternative to fast or cafeteria food
The second visit I tried another recommended dish the Lasagna Vegetariano only $10
The presentation of the dish was very nice and the dish overall was not extremely flavorful but considering it was vegetarian I thought it was very good
Our server was spot on with her recommends Hamachi Ceviche was fresh and light and the Cabo Blanco Roll was so good I ordered it twice
Lava Roll was good my friend erupted with praise for it
The service was wonderful the food was wonderful the bread and dipping sauce they bring out is wonderful
I have had the pleasure of hitting up The Main Ingredient for both food and drinks and have been impressed each time
The food menu is short but everything is generally tasty specifically the mac and cheese with the green chiles
I've also really enjoyed the picnic chicken sandwich which is enough to feet multiple people for a picnic
Today I enjoyed unlimited tossed Italian Salad a bowl of Pasta e Fagioli Soup a bowl of Zuppa Tuscana Soup a bowl of Chicken & Gnocchi Soup & several bread sticks
But I digressFor dessert I highly recommend the coconut ice cream with fried honey bananas
This place has super delicious and well-priced food
I ordered a gnocchi with chicken parmigiana and it was both filling and flavorful
I think this place would be great for lunch especially for the quality of the food and the price
The dumplings were flavorful but the meats-teriyaki chicken and beef ribs were barely luke-warm when they came out
It was totaly worth the short wait the food it always awsome and I'm glad to see this place getting the attention it deserves
I don't care how good the food looked like or how many people say its taste good with this rudeness and carelessness this store is worthless
My standard for crepes is from my favorite food truck Truckin' Good Food
But there is a difference between my fave Truckin' Good Food's crepes and Cupz and Crepes'
The fishy flavor I dislike was nowhere to be found in either of these dishes
The service was excellent and the food memorable
Great real gourmet Mexican food great atmosphere good service
The counter area is a good place to sit as you get to see the food prepared right in front of you and experience the hustle of the cafe
I will definitley be back for the wonderful food and spot on friendly service
So I can afford to eat out when the occasion calls for it I have at least two weeks worth of ramen dried meats & fruits and green tea stored up in my kitchen to hold me over on those week/ends I'm as broke as the ten commandments and can't go out and get my grub on
But you see run of the mill prepackaged imperishable foodstuffs are not enough to satiate my strange appetite and lifestyle; why can you imagine how much a fool I would look Jetta the self-proclaimed Prophetess of Fabulous were found in the possession of mere chicken-flavored top ramen and beef jerky
The aisles are packed with food you've never even thought of eating like prawn-flavored chips and chocolate-stuffed eggrolls
While college students and World of Warcrafters are breaking up  packets of the same old beef-flavored ramen you'll be drowning your taste buds in instant hot and sour soup and the fancier imported ramen the kind with three seasoning packets so you know it's classy
Even at lunch portions it's still a good amount of food
The menu is like a book there is so much to choose from rice dishes noodle dishes soups appetizers
My coworker and I settled on a red curry dish with chicken and I had a sweet & sour dish yeah it sounds trite but I was in the mood and it was so delicious
Not bad as the food here is typically pretty good
We ordered Hot and Sour Soup and Totties Pork Spring Rolls
Pros  The food was good but like I said overpriced
The cotton candy was fab and though the strawberry dessert was NOT my first choice it was truly delicious and I may go back JUST for that dish
and his food truck had a taste-off against Torched Goodness
I found them both to be equally good that day although Jeff was a little more generous w/ his frozen dessert sample compared to TG's thimble sample TG was out of the two flavors I wanted to try
Super clean super friendly great service and the food is delicious and cheap
I know some people will say that the quality suffers when you take it TO GO but seriously it's a 2 min drive and even if the food would have been slightly less disgusting 2 minutes earlier it still would have been disgusting
I tried just taking the meat and peppers out and eating them but they lacked any spice or flavor you would desire  and the meat was chewy and tasted like fat
Each slice of your pizza was a flavorful perfection
I've been 3 times and ordered the spicy chicken wrap and the pesto turkey lavosh wrap and a HUGE order of the jalapeno cilantro hummus TO-GO and ate it for the next 4 days at home and it stayed fresh and tasty
Overall the place is good but I would only go back if I am really craving Venezuelan food and don't feel like cooking it myself
Pronounced chocolate flavor not too salty with the just the right amount of bitterness from the unsweetened Mexican chocolate The chocolate blended with the grilled chicken flavor and the sweetness of the corn tortillas to produce an outstanding enchilada
Otherwise their carrot cake and key lime pie were pretty good and their food was good as well
Lightly toasted bread slightly sweet mustard mayo fresh veggies and the most beautiful sliced roast beef I have seen in a long time this sandwich was nothing short of awesome damn it was good
I do enjoy the food and think they have a good beer selection love the Sex Panther but again this place feels cold and unaccommodating
So we went back again last night to eat some good Mexican food and listen to live music
Her combo platter had a beef taco cheese enchilada rice beans and a nice size piece of the best flavored most tender skirt steak I've ever had in my entire life
As for the food it's not the best I have had but the quality was there
I had the following geisha roll which has ahi tataki cucumber lotus root cream cheese and red bell peppers osuimono a soup with ebi & japanese cucumber snow peas carrots w/ ginger in clear broth maguro tuna nigiri The roll was tasty and just the right size for enjoying in one large yet manageable bite
The food made it though oh man we had a GREAT meal the food was prepared so well full of flavor just perfect
The food was stellar from the gnocchi with sautu00e9ed asparagus and cherry tomatoes appetizer to the sea bass cioppino over angel hair pasta mine and the chicken breast with spinach/mozzarella in a cognac cream sauce hers
While the food is made to order it arrives at your table before you've had a chance to finish your soup - it's fresh and piping hot
The manager and people who work there are very hospitable and the food is consistently delicious
A staff member said that it was not good since they were missing a bartender out of pizza out of soup and short on staff
Though it's tapas you actually get a good bit of food in each item
Papa Christo's serves Vienna Beef brand hotdogs so of course those are delicious
I recommend there Buffalo Chicken nachos with melted blue cheese sauce
They have one with hot dogs one with what seems to be a beef like pot roast and for you veggies they have a nacho for you
The food was very good and I have no complaints about it I just suggest going on a different night as Saturday dinner at Chilli's is far from a quick bite to eat
The Carne Asada was very tasty in my street tacos the carnita and pastor meat were very tasty and tender
They also have quite a few desserts on the menu including a really delicious oreo shake
The food is good but nothing is outstanding
There's plenty deliciousness to find here even if your not in the mood for sushi or sashimi
So this place has amazing 5 star food but pretty dismal service
Definitely will go back because the food was just that good
The food included huge portions at fair prices and it helped that it was delicious
My short ribs were perfectly cooked full of flavor and enough to bring home for seconds factoring in dessert
The food is very good but certainly not the best
Sometimes I feel the food is too flavorful and not in a good way
I did just discover that Pita Jungle has a reverse happy hour on food and I enjoyed getting just about one of everything for about $20
The meat was flavorful the bun soft and they sported crisp veggies
The fries were skinny and crispy and had seasoned salt which brings me back to being a kid and getting fries at the food court in the mall good memories
Ordered a 14 chez pizza 18 hot wings 6 plain wings tons of ranch on the side
The cheese pizza came out hot and fresh
I paid peanuts for food that will last me a full day so while not amazing it was mos'def great value
Our favorites* Plato de carne basically a huge fajita plate with better meat--you get your choice of meat with grilled veggies beans & rice and tortillas* Chicken chimichanga their chicken is marinated and always fabulous and I'm a sucker for a good chimi* Salmon tacos big chunks of salmon white cheddar and homemade mango salsa--my wife's staple
If you're going to enjoy good food do it up right
A few months ago I would have given this store 5 stars but lately it's been more of a 2 star at best other than the quality of the meat department
All in all we were very pleasantly surprised by the high quality food and recipes as well as the great service at Riazzi's
Food was hot and delicious even at 3am however the service late at night isn't the best nor should anyone expect it to be it's 3am
I went this morning- waitress was nice food was speedy hot and delicious
I felt confident that the food and service would be pretty good
Honestly  I had a beef tostada and the flavor was unrecognizable and the beans were like paste
Food is good drinks are good and THEY HAVE COTTON CANDY along with a mechanical bull which is on my list to-do
The nachos with tandoori chicken were excellent and more than enough for two adults
the food is always good - love the Greek fries with the lemon-oregano sauce and the flaming Saganaki is very good too
The margaritas and the food were delicious
Now lets get down to business; The meat is great delicious tasting without even any BBQ sauce added
and chicken  and if you must know I don't care for any chicken but I'm sure thats good too
The food is very good but not gastronomically exciting
I can't help myself I always order seafood when I eat here and recommend the scallops
2 The food was cold and the waitress never came by to ask how it was so we could not tell her about it
3 When we flagged her down to comment on the cold food we were 75% finished so what was the point
She offered to replace it but I don't want more cold food
4 When we left the manager who was told about our cold food was the one who checked us out never asked how it was since he didn't want to hear about the complaint
There are still some helpful reps I don't wanna make blanket statements because I have been helped after finding the 1-2 people on that sales floor who can dish some quality service but the overwhelming trend at this place is just baaaaaaaad
White's going on 30 years but after looking up the phone number this afternoon to verify if they were open and still had fried chicken my wife started reading some of the reviews following a recent Food Network recommendation - I almost got cold feet
In these days of flash frozen prepared dishes that are uniform from visit to visit at chain restaurants this food is made in a tiny hot kitchen
I'd be happy if I didn't catch it just before dinner hit so I would have had some hot food choices but no luck
my homegirl got Garlic Vegetable with chicken Mild we both figured go weak on this one cause she's not a hot person
The food was good but our waiter was a little distracted - maybe because we were on the edge of the bar area and not in the direct line of fire
I really enjoyed the dishes and they were plated well
PH Tu00d4M C BT - Beef & Shrimp + Sriracha & Hoison hot sauces to top everything off because I love my Pho SPICY
I would love this dish in a small appetizer portion with a creamy polenta or some other starch
They seem to have a good wine collection and other food items other than pizza
All were good but the dessert was delectable
I can't believe the BF & I wasted 30 minutes of our time at this place waiting for our cold cut Ham Turkey & Provolone on sourdough & Pastrami on wheat roll sandwiches
I was hoping it was one of those type of places where the restaurant looks terrible but the food is amazing- I was wrong
I enjoyed a nice spring day in Scottsdale at the patio of Stingray Sushi
And their Golden Beauty which is a much less flavorful and less salty version of The International Vegetarian House's Lemongrass chicken tasted very
Good fraud protection They leave you with coupons and the food is already reasonably priced
I had the Passionfruit glazed chicken which while tasty barely had any chicken and for what it was priced way too high
My wife had the macadamia nut crusted mahi the fish was very good the brocolini cooked perfect but the mashed potatoes were pasty and had a bitter sour aftertaste
We enjoyed ourselves in spite of the food and service because we had each other
The problem is much deviation from the chicken bowl is not a good idea
The food is ok but not outstanding but I'm not impressed with the value
The flavor of the meat was good though it was too charred for my liking as if they hadn't been selling enough to keep them from overcooking no surprise
Generally speaking the food is constructed of quality ingredients presented in an appealing way and won't leave you hungry
DO NOT go to this restaurant if you are looking for a relaxing evening with good food
The prices are high for the quality of food that is served and it is apparant that the food is pre cooked and simply picked up in the kitchen and served immediately upon ordering
Super friendly staff consistently good food and great atmosphere are reasons I go back
for our own food we waited only a few minutes before we had piping hot tasty curry on our table
Pho Avina is a lovely casual little place for excellent Vietnamese food
In addition to Pho they serve other noodle rice noodle and saigon noodle and rice dishes as well as appetizers and salads
But I go to restaurants for quality food not high priced crap
Most places I goto that have a smaller menu I figure that it's due to them keeping it simple and as a result having really good food
My lunchmate had the Vegas roll which was good but not the best in town by a long shot think Hana and DozoThe dislikesI ordered the katsu
The buffet was a mixed-bag of good for the type food and phoning it in
The corn beef has is institutional and tasteless without assistance  the breakfast potatoes were not greasy  gravy was good enough to embarrass the biscuit
The food is delicious although a little on the spendy side in my opinion Think $7
plenty of spots in Oakland for some quality chicken and waffles
I wasn't thinking anything of these items when we ordered them just figured they would be standard bar food and would taste good with alcohol
I never thought i would rave about chicken strips but they were damn good
The fish and chips my boyfriend got were equally as good
I would not come back here, but the food isn't really worth the money in my opinion
5	Amazing, super fresh, beautifully prepared sushi at a very affordable price
I have been looking for sushi this good since I moved from Minnesota to Arizona
While there are many good sushi restaurants in Arizona, it seems a lot of them are more show than substance - by that I mean the fish is okay, but not of the highest quality
Kiku Sushi's uses fish of the highest quality and it shows in every serving
The service is wonderful, too, with knowledgeable servers who can suggest dishes to suit pretty much everyone
The $17 appetizer tower of sea food is well-worth its price that includes half lobster 2 oysters 2 jumbo shrimps 2 crab legs
Now I'm not one to like to eat fruit especially apple in my desserts but this was just so good
The service was good the food was good the price was good
Finding good authentic Chinese food is a bit of a challenge nowaday
The food at Elements is exceptional but you will pay for it which is to be expected for such quality and atmosphere
I would highly recommend this experience to impress that special someone in your life or close the big deal however it is important to note that Elements will remain one of the better dining experiences in the valley as long as they continue to focus on the quality of the food and those in the kitchen who prepare the dishes
Problem is the food was just not as good at least not this time
The employees are very friendly and accommodating and the food is delicious
If you're looking for some tasty Italian food and excellent service check out Babbo
The food is consistently good the service and atmosphere are top notch and it's in a great location but I can't seem to give them five stars
I'd like to see the food be a little spicier but it was nicely flavored other than that
It was quite fishy and I wasn't into the flavor too much
It's a delicious side dish of pearly Israeli couscous mixed with golden raisins pistachios chopped herbs in a creamy flavorful curry
My tasting was equally homey - chicken and rice and it was earth shatteringly good
I question why I bother going into my kitchen when such simple food can be made this good why do I bother to cook myself
The food was amazing - I had a bacon calzone that was STUFFED with cheese and then cannolis for desert - and the service was excellent
It might not be one of the most progressive or acclaimed culinary destinations in the Valley but this special pricing is a good deal for what you get and the food is great
Above all great atmosphere great food great service - HIGHLY recommend if you're in the mood for a lil southern cookin
I've ordered many salads sandwiches and burgers - and have always found the food surprisingly good
From appearance it doesn't look like that kind of place can put out such good food - but they do
with my meal I had the Vanilla-Peach Italian soda over vodkathe vanilla was far too strong it tasted as if there was Tuaca in there or some similar syrupy liqueur but I quite enjoyed the whole peach in the bottom of the glass on to dessert he had the chocolate layer cakevery very rich and decadent frosting and I ordered the strawberry creme brulee--absolutely mouthwatering
in other reviews I can't comment I have never eaten anything but sushi there and it has always been excellent fresh and carefully prepared
The food was pretty good but for a Sunday morning I think they were understaffed which translated into a frustrating visit
Not sure I'll go back since the food was good but the prices were average but high for the service we received
If I have to wait 20 minutes for a roll I'd rather get good sushi
I would feel comfortable bringing my parents and dates here as I was impressed with the overall feel of the resturant along with the excellent food good sized portions wide menu variety and cheap prices
The chicken was good but it was a very small meal
For the meat I chose the hot link sausage
Way over prices for the low quality food and poor service
friendly staff good fast service huge portions of delicious food and very reasonable prices
Excellent service reasonably priced full meal lunch specials with soup crab puff spring roll rice and main course for under $5 even the Shrimp dishes are under $6I'm going to check out the dinner there soon
I loved their Hot & Sour Soup and would recommend any of the Prawn lunch specials or the Cashew Chicken
The beef sandwich was delicious and the pork ribs were fantastic
The teppan is a little pricey the sushi is consistantly good they also offer the all you can eat sushi and the sake selection is ok very average
Sorry but I don't remember what I had but I just wasn't impressed and didn't get the feeling the seafood was really fresh
They do tone the spice levels down quite a bit though - which might be a good or bad thing depending on how spicy you like your food to be -I love this place and take all my non-Indian friends here whenever they crave Indian food
They offered a selection of Louisiana hot sauces to zip up your dish
The fish and shrimp were tender and delicious
I will definitely come back because the food was delicious
I grew up going to the locations in Chicago and am happy to say that the food quality and service is spot on in Scottsdale too
The food is delicious and I'm amazed at how they do Mexican food dishes even better than a lot of the Mexican food restaurants around town
$5 giant sized appetizers are big enough for a meal and so delicious - especially the calamari taquitos and avocado rolls
The pizza is good albeit too thick for a Chicago thin crust aficionado
All in all good but not spectacular enough to convert us to NY style pizza lovers and I would not return given the plethora of restaurants in this mall area
I chose the rollatini and it was so delicious
Our friends had the chicken Marsala and the veal parmigiana both which they proclaimed were excellent
they give you a pretty good portion of meat and peppers but the only thing that bothered me was how soggy the bread got from the juices
The place is very small with just about six tables but they are also short-handed on staff--be prepared for slow service and excellent food
The only downside is they are pricier than fast food burger places but since their product is better quality and cooked fresh I don't mind
but I liked the speed of getting a table on a BUSY Sunday the speed of the server and of the food coming out so I will give it a pretty good rating overall
99 for a very small portion of flavorless guac we had to add so much salt just to get any flavor out of it we ordered the chicken fajitas and it had about six  strips of very dry chicken on a bed of greasy onions and that's it veggie fajitas were onions and peppers a few mushrooms and a couple pieces of zucchini everything was so overcooked and caramelized it was just a greasy mess
last was dessert- it came with a slice of passionfruit cake not my thing a slice of a coconut type cake super good and a wedge of this very intense piece of chocolate that was totally my thing
For dessert we shared bread pudding - now who doesn't appreciate a good bread pudding
It is not the best Veggie food I have ever had and the service left a little to be desired but I enjoyed my meal and the decor of the restaurant
It had fake beef in it and was sweeter then normal Pho but was really really tasty
There were a lot of different dishes I wanted to try especially after all of the comments about the chicken being so good
I finally scolded the server and she brought a beer but never brought out napkins a manager never came and asked us if everything was ok the food runner was the only person responsive
They have tasty lunch foods to order and they will bring it to your lounge chairs
I was actually looking forward to the trip to Goodyear because I heard they had two regional foods from the two host teams - Bertman's Mustard a delicacy they only serve in the Cleveland Indian's Ballpark & Skyline Chili Dogs - from Cincinnati
The park the fans & the food make it feel like a real community team and even though Goodyear is a HAUL from Phoenix it was a great way to spend opening day
Considering there is an extreme lack of food options here in The Creek - Gallagher's definitely meets the need for1 - ICE COLD Beer2 - Quick / Casual FoodI'd prefer more food options outside of the 'chain restaurant' category
Excellent lunch menu with a few dozen options to choose from they specialize in hot and spicy foods but will make anything for you with no heat by request
They serve excellent fish dishes including lobster and crab which is killed and cooked to order
While the fish tacos were tasty and the norm the pork enchiladas blew anything else out of the water
As many people know this can be a good thing if the food the restaurant specializes in is amazing
It's pretty darned good for a fast food Japanese place in a mall
That's fine as it's worth the wait for fresh food
The food however was pretty decent - the chicken tenders were actually really good and the food was greasy but not so greasy that you're disgusted by it
Not cheap but considering the amount of food you could possibly get it's worth it
Not a place I would go to regularly but it's definitely worth checking out especially if you are a meat lover
The ribs came with a chicken schnitzel that had pretty much zero flavor at all
Maybe some of these people aren't interested in quality and just think food is food
Coming home from San Francisco this it's the only delicious thai food that comes close
The green curry special with avocados and chicken is to die for but it was a tad sweeter than I had expected so if recommend medium spiciness
Overall great people great service delicious food
The broth was very bland and tasted like it needed more beef flavor spices etc
Also The Pho had very little meat I couldn't believe that I paid 10 dollars for just a few slices of beef the meatball was tough and had no flavor and less than to be desired Needless to say I will never visit this place again
Various grilled artisan cheese sandwiches cold sandwichescheese and meat plates adorn the simple menu
Food is well prepared good proportions and the little shop is well decorated
I like hot food and I recommend medium you can taste your food and still get some gradual heat as you eat
Favorite dish is the Pad Thai my soon to be wife likes the hot and sour soup
Both really good but I think they used too much nuoc mam in the chicken wings
White backed it up with some amazing chicken and I don't know what previous reviewers were talking about with the sides because my grandma from North Carolina was in town and her and I both liked the red beans and macaroni salad
Also whoever said KFC has chicken as good and it's cheaper well keep going back to KFC and stay outta places like this cause you don't belong
I didn't even feel as guilty as I thought I would because it was clearly good quality meat
The crisp was tasty we had ordered chicken to it for some protein and loved it
The food was excellent and the ambiance is very nice
This is a very nice reasonably-priced Italian place with excellent food and great ambiance
I was shocked at the quality and the attention to detail that the chef and I believe owner paid to every roll he sent out to the dineing room
One of my friends recommended this place for a sushi spot in downtown Phoenix near the light rail
Doesn't matter if you come with a group or roll here solo this place serves up quality food at great prices
I wish they had more side dish options but the ones they have are very good
It is a diamond in the rough and it consistently transports me into a lively Irish pub filled with authentic decorations and very very good food and drinks
The problem is Tacos Atoyac does not deliver in food quality
The waittresses are awesome the food is amazing and I really can't say anything that hasn't already been said
I wish they'd coordinate to have one of the tasty food carts rolling around Phoenix to set up shop in the extra parking across the street-yum
Positives On the plus side we requested our food to be Thai Hot and they actually made it that way
The food was ok and the service was slow but the thing that got me was the use of Jalapeno in Thai food the flavor just wasn't right and when I asked for fresh Thai peppers I was given a pot with sliced jalapeno in fish sauce seemed like I was in a Mexican restaurant trying to do Thai food
Amazing food and amazing service makes for a spectacular evening out
Both the food and the location are good enough I will be back to try out some other items
I went to Old Town Tortilla Factory in Old Town Scottsdale which combines two of my favorite dining elements-a classy atmosphere with tasty Sonoran-influenced food the menu also has Native American influences too
Having disappointing service sort of made the beautiful surroundings a little less appealing but I would probably still go back because the food when it comes out correctly is so delicious
The food about as good as upscale bar food is going to get
They do passably good Cantonese barbeque and the stewed meats and on the go sections usually have good and tasty selections
The food is very good to excellent by airport standards
the sesame chicken was just odd delicious but odd - with the runny funny sauce being put on the side - this with no explanation from the hostess chick
Sum it - good Chinese food for a good price 15-25 per person not too far away and really good as leftovers
Their spring rolls are completely amazing
I usually get chicken with their delicious peanut sauce
If you opt for one of their soups their chicken noodle is quite good although it isn't at the top of my list for chicken noodle soups
At the mercy of some friend's food recommendations we cruised into delux on an idle Monday night
I like to have the raw beef served on the side so I can cook it myself in the hot broth
Amazingly I was shocked to find that the prices for food was not outrageous
The quality of the food made it a worthwhile visit though
I sampled through the other areas and enjoyed the oven baked pizza and mushroom ravioli
The asian chicken wings were explosions of flavor but  mexican style dishes did not seem too appetizing so I skipped them all together
THe desserts were reflective of the buffet in general some good others so so but I would have to recommend the gelato many many varieties
It's in a questionable area but for food this tasty I don't mind locking the car doors and windows
Classy great vibe and delicious food are some of the highlights to this charming little restaurant
We ordered at least 5 pizzas and everything was fresh and flavorful
we got spring rolls and Pho and some very  tasty drinks
I've never been delayed and the food selection during layovers is decent - I recommend the burrito place
I'm traveling cross-country with my parents from NYC and we were all really craving some yummy authentic Thai food Pam's Kitchen + Pongsri in NYC are both amazing and right up our alley
apple wood smoked bacon sliders sweet potato fries bbq chicken flatbread excellent
It's casual small and the food is really tasty
There are two elements that are crucial to making a good pizza and making a pizzeria stand out from the others The sauce and the crust
We ordered the pizza and when it was served it looked delicious
My friend who doesn't have a keen sense for good food said well maybe it wasn't in the oven long enough
Shame on Spinato's for being so cheap to serve pizza with dough that isn't nearly half the quality of Pizza Hut  I was dreaming of Pizza Hut the whole time I was eating their pizza
Some of the dishes at Pho Van are so good I pretty much just inhale them
But I didn't feel the food or drink were priced appropriately for the quality
A delicious locally owned restaurant that was featured on Food Network attached to a beautiful farm where they grow their vegetables plus an award winning cupcake/coffee shop and some of the coolest bathrooms I've ever seen
But they are speedy with getting the food and drinks out despite how busy it is so it's all good They have a great beer selection of course  If I do get a beer I always like their Peach beer
I wasn't impressed by the mystery fish
It is here where you will find delicious affordable sushi as well as other Japanese items
Ordering any of their sushi is always fresh and delicious
We arrived just after noon and there was a little it of a wait  but that is expected for good food  which was not the case
We ordered our favorite appetizer the Baked lobster and crab puffs  sad to say that they were very fishyand not up to par  we have had these many times in the past and are usualy amazing  but not this time
As far as the pho the choices are limited and the meat and broth doesn't have the traditional flavor
Friendly employees good food and decent prices
That something would include incorporating fresh ingredients and dough tossed in front of you after you order a pizza or calzone tasty arrangements the calzone was magnificient and very decent prices lunch for two w/tip was under $30 into a tiny but efficient establishment
Of course the food was good and the entertainment of the guy cooking
I love pizza this pizza was very very good
No beer no wine just really good pizza
The pizza came out piping hot and it was absolutely beautiful
The pizza was rich and so ridiculously flavorful
The ingredients are what really set this place apart from everyone else and the pizza is simply amazing
If you happen to frequent the hotel bar I would order their chicken fingers because they're to die for
The pizza was good I'm from Chicago's so my standards for pizza are crazy high and had a very thin cripsy crust
Chicken was flavorful but my piece was a tad dry in late afternoon
[Fortunate for Bloom the happy hour food menu is worth coming back for- we'll just know better to park ourselves at the bar like I usually do when I dine solo
The central kitchen design won me over with the open-flame grill surrounded by bar seating in full view and participation of the women-only chefs creating fresh simple yet uber-flavorful seasonal dishes
The pasta dish was talked up by our host and it was really just another tasty pasta dish
The servers and staff seemed to be very occupied with a fellow cute girl foodie/critic/industry insider sitting next to us and we got an unfortunate cold shoulder
I've been to a few different locations and I've always been impressed with the food & service
The sandwich could have used some more seasonings in the chicken salad but otherwise was prety good in a normal kind of good way
Haven't eaten in the middle of a mall food court in awhile very zoolike quality to that experience
too bad it was on my birthday - food was good but the service was deplorable so not going to rehash this too much apologies to my man and bro as I know they were also hoping for betterThe appetizers were by far the best thing - the entree's were good with red meat being the star
The food comes to the table piping hot the ingredients are fresher than fresh the flavors are delectable the whole place is clean
The food is basically above average pub-grub and an excellent value for Scottsdale
All in all I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone and if you're saying this is the best Mexican place you clearly haven't been anywhere other than Del Taco or some other crap fast food chain
I'm not sure if they know this but Food City actually makes some really good chips they could just buy rather then use those stale disks from
Consistency -- nice people excellent food reasonable prices wide selections of wines & soft drinks seating indoors - outdoors - upstairs
Over at my food blog you can see pictures of the dishes we ate 2 appetizers and 2 dishes the teriyaki tofu brown rice and Roasted Autumn Vegetables
It is OK and the beer was cold but the food is definitely mediocre
The chicken while slightly flavorful was dried out
The food is pricy for the quality - $20
Clearly the previous reviewer Paul either is completely void of any knowledge of food critique or he is incapable of enjoying a good meal
The garlic/horseradish spread is excellent
The meats were pretty good though you could taste they had been hanging out for a while
The quality of the pizza sauce and the cheese is GREAT and everything else is great as well
If you are used to thick greasy nasty low quality pizza this place is NOT for you
It's not the most amazing sushi i've had but it's predictable in the sense that it'll hit the spot every single time no matter what I choose to try
I've been going here for years but have noticed in the past year or so a decline in the overall quality of the food and the service
I told her that the pizza is normally better but this location isn't very good
My chicken tikka masala was absolutely perfect all buttery with tender chicken and a spiciness that was tasty and not overwhelming
The pizza came and was pretty darn good
I may go back to the good beer that they have and for a pizza but do yourself a favor and don't stray from the pizza
We got a really delicious beef carpacio that had little fried capers on it and dates stuffed with blue cheese that didn't work as well
ok maybe not because that was a hottttt little dish but
they were both good and i am not a big chicken sandwich fan
It isn't high quality food by any means but it is damn tasty
and there are lots of good reasons on their menu why they are still serving ono-licious Hawaiian style food
Not only was there food very good their service was incredible
If you're in on the west side during the day and want some cheap and delicious Mexican food give Pancho Taqueria a shot
The names of the dishes as well as the presentation of many are all good but they have tamed down their versions of these dishes to cater to a different crowd
The Chicken in the Pollo Fundido is more flavorful tender and juicy than any of their competitors such as Serrano's Garcia's etc
Their salads are delicious too and you can't beat their desserts with Nutella
I can't remember which specific pizza slices I had but I do remember that they were delicious Like everything else in downtown Phoenix there wasn't any other people in the restaurant
The Salumeria sandwich was assorted Italian lunch meats that were unusually mild for Italian meat and cheese that had little flavor
Because it is but inside they are serving delicious food
The food was great the service was great and I would for sure recommend it to anyone living in the area
the flavors were good though and if the pork hadn't been dry and if the potatoes were done I could see this dish being a solid choice* $25 for two vodka martini's on a Saturday afternoon
The food was delicious and the service was excellent
The figs and apricots looked wonderful but they're on my food allergy suspicion list and I did not want to risk ruining a great dinner experience with these two women at my side
We had a taste for some good New York style pizza and heard a Grimaldi's opened recently out east of us at the furthest reaches of the realm
They offer pizza tasty salads panini's and pastas
They have some very unique pizza flavors at Sauce
I have to admit Sauce was a bit over hyped but still the food is good and I really like the relaxed atmosphere
the bread pudding looked awesome too but I didn't get to try itI had this amazing fresh salad with chicken blue cheese avocado with a balsamic vinaigrette
FOODAlways hot fresh and higher quality than most mom & pop mexican hole-in-the-walls
With that being said it was really good pizza
I don't care for chain restaurant styled pizza but the three I ordered from them for myself and my boyfriend were good
Went here for happy hour with some coworkers and a few ordered food which smelled good though I'm not sure how it tasted I didn't hear any complaints
I was also super unimpressed with the food
This tasted as though it had been frozen for ages no flavor and very little amount of chicken
Volcano Beef - Nice touch on the sear it yourself hot rock
Food and drinks are excellent and Steve talks to everyone
Unfortunately the guilt was worse than the food was good
Buy a good fresh roll from the bakery and some cheese from the deli all can be done a Albertson's or AJ's
They even have a fried salmon skin roll which was very flavorful and not always available at every establishment
-Robata Grilled Lamb Cutlets - The dish had a very nice presentation and it just looks tasty
The staff was warmer and the food just as good
If you go here I definitely recommend the Orange Chicken
At Barrio Cafe our experience was with what appeared to be chicken breast that was cooked on the grill or in a pan and then tossed in a sort of sweet sauce with no hint of either chorizo or chipotle and it was completely missing the sweet reduced onion flavor
I think it's telling as you read these reviews you pretty much get the same subject through all of them good food good facilities TERRIBLE SERVICE
My mom's beef stew was hearty and served with a good sized piece of fry bread and was quite tasty
The food was great it was reasonably priced everyone at the table enjoyed their meals
All the food is very good however I will never return
I love sprouts this one doesn't have as good of a meat department so it isn't my first choice but more of a   go to  place cuz it's close
I really enjoyed a California roll the tepanyaki show and left overs
Delicious miso soup salad fried rice veggies chicken steak and shrimp
It's funny because if they just fixed their pizza they could really have a good thing - it's totally tucked away in this little corner by the fountain outdoor seating is avail in this tiny little strip mall with like zero competition for a two mile radius - local neighborhood people like me would totally get behind them but the pizza is just not that good sorry
My girlfriend got the chicken friend chicken and it was good and it was a huge portion as well but its not as good as the steak
I am beginning to think that run-down strip malls equipped with weird comic stores and nail salons point to good food nearby
The smell is very indicative of the food - standard inexpensive delicious Ethiopian cuisine complex flavors huge variety vegan friendly if not encouraging and utensil-less
I highly recommend as do employees the vegan combo - you can try 5 dishes with all the bread you want
I will admit the temperature of my food was a little colder than I prefer but I got over it
The price is nice and the food finger-lickin' good
My review is for people who understand and can appreciate good Indian food
But in my opinion the quality of food and the overall experience is worth the cost especially if you want a really memorable place to go for a special occasion
What else can I say but this place has some good food
The chicken had a nice flavor to it and you get tons of rice BUT *sigh* the rice was so mushy and wet I felt like it was made for a baby
u won't b paying 4 what the sushi is worth
The place itself is kind of small and run down but Asain restaurants aren't known for their perfect establishmentsThe chicken was good it cut into really big chunks though
The Service was great but the food not worth it
Food was pretty good although we just stuck with the happy hour menu
I enjoyed the veggie roll the most; the biggest of what we ordered it was crunchy and flavorful
Kobe beef sliders were delicious but seriously who messes up Kobe beef
My husband's Greek potatoes were delicious but his roasted chicken was waaaay overdone stringy and dry with rubbery skin
The meat was well seasoned and the jus made it good and messy
Customer Appreciation rolls are the full size rolls at most Japanese restaurants in California and tastes just as good if not better
the big piping hot platter of my food landed in front of me on the table
Along with the great service I thought the food here was delicious & they give you plenty of it
The fettuccine alfredo was actually very tasty but the spaghetti and meatballs was not good at all very overdone and burnt tasting
We'd eaten here before and enjoyed the food my husband's a Japanese American from California--i
They have several vegetarian pizzas with delicious toppings like BBQ tofu tempeh avocado etc
We ordered the Mega Veggie and it was very delicious and most certainly satisfied my pizza craving
Also the food is really overpriced for the quality and quantity
YR KIDDING ME and the food is amazing
On a side note I did end up getting food poisoning but I am unsure if it was the alcohol later or the food but I did end up on the toilet from 3am to later at our hotel room see my motel 6 review for a little more info
There is just not enough of it sometimes because the other foodies will agree that this place is worth it
They all look good but then I heard an angel and she steered my wicked eyes toward the holy grail of dishes
I've never been one to eat much dessert simply because I'm too darn full after a good meal to indulge on dessert
Which by the way pricing is fair and reasonable given the outstanding quality or food
Proof that you do not need food to be unhealthy for it to be tasty and satisfying
It had very little flavor I got the chipotle chicken cheesesteak and was made with some nasty processed chicken-ish stuff
The first course Butterfish was delicious served with a ginger sauce and  some veggies
The Pork Belly came next and this was by far my favorite dish just absolutely perfectly cooked and very flavorful
All of the sakes served to us were great and dessert was wonderful as well
And the quality of the food is MUCH higher than the mystery meat you'll get in your bowl of pho at some other places
Our server was attentive and we had other servers checking on us refilling water glasses bringing out food and just making sure we were having a good time
The atmosphere is very lively if that's what you're looking forNow to the food - good and reasonably priced
About 1 square inch of the center of my fish had the right buttery good soft flavor that should have been the entire fish
Food was very good and could see the Richardson's influence
Once again the fish we had was of mediocre quality at best
Maybe I'm just missing something here since it seems like the regular customers are able to command the best quality fish or at least it certainly looked a lot better than what we had but the fish just isn't all that fresh and the service is consistently lackluster
The point here is that not everyone is discerning regardless of whether they are eating their native fare and I find it difficult to believe that this would be considered a quality sushi restaurant among discerning Japanese diners given how much better quality sushi is available in the Valley
Our last visit to Hiro will be our last and for anyone looking to find fresh high quality sushi in Scottsdale I would highly recommend trying Yume at the Scottsdale Promenade
The burger was fantastic the pizza was pretty good also
We ordered some chicken egg rolls and when they finally came or they were amazing
Overall great service ambiance and most importantly good food
Their food are really cheap but are not worth it
I would highly recommend the pork shoulder tacos the chipotle grits so money and some type of dessert
The sliders were alright - the meat was tasty but the bread and lettuce left something to be desired
You can tell where the good food is because pork is not the only thing on the menu
I went with the emerald chicken which was AMAZING a jade chicken QUESADILLA and the pork fried rice
The jade chicken was that perfect sweet and I know it sounds weird but tasted really good in a cheese quesadilla just that right amount of crispy outside
the emerald chicken was amazingly well balanced
I could completely forgo the food and solely sip on that delicious drink
Their food is good to really good and I do think that most of the menu is over priced
Some other good aspects of Olive & Ivy are the outdoor patio great place to sip my Mojito and people watch sea bass or seared ahi tuna dishes I'll usual order one or the other and the service their wait staff is on top of their tables
However The shredded beef taco was AMAZING
It's just a classic shredded beef taco with the classic trimmings in a crunchy taco shell the shell seemed like it was fried very close to when I ate it yet wasn't oily and they didn't salt it but they must be doing something a little different because it was just too damn good
To sum up I will be back and definitely recommend this place but if you want to drink margaritas with some of those awesome shredded beef tacos I would stick to Happy Hour because the prices are pretty steep
I was very impressed both times by the ambiance the service and most importantly the food
Some Thai food is great for the first few bites but then you want a new flavor because it only has one bold flavor that tends to overwhelm
She was a little more impressed with her dish than I was mine
I expected standard greasy bar food but Holy Jesus it was AMAZING
The Macaroni and Cheese with Buffalo Chicken is also worth stopping in for
Food wise - the bruschetta impressed me alot actually the whole place did so I will definately be back
I have never cooked or eaten  lamb but my friends tell me it is a difficult meat to prepare so that it is not tough and that the lamb here is excellent
Okay let me give the rundownFood  awesomeService  first rate nice warm feels like homeAtmosphere  busy with people excited to be eating good foodWould I go again  I might go tomorrow
Ok so there really isnt any good new york style pizza around where we live so we gave this place a couple second chances
The pizza is starting to grow on me and now I look forward to grabbing a slice from Joe's because gosh darnit it really is pretty tasty
As for the garlic knots well those didnt get any tastier after a second try but this place is still worth going to just for the delicious nearly perfect new york style pizza
Definetely adds to the allure of the pizza when you know you can get a tasty cake to finish off your meal
Second Overall I give this place a Mmmmm tasty cheese pizza tastes yummy and make my tummy happy
Happily the Original Pancake House in Scottsdale AZ  about as original as Rays Pizza in NYC  delivers an extremely diverse and satisfying array of breakfast treats without the feeling you need a Penicillin shot after dining
It was loaded with goodies - avocado tomatoes feta cheese chicken and much more
A word of caution their concept of spicy can be different from yours if you are not used to hot food
Both were really good the pizza was a thin  crisp in spots crust
after that we had the calamari which were under cook and the fish taco which were not bad but it needed more sauce or maybe a more flavorful sauce it was a lillte dry
I would give the Food an A+ for consistency and qualityI would give the service an A- as there is always room for improvement when you're dealing with different people and personalities**the Recession Plate for July = DELICIOUS
The burrito although tasty was mostly meat
I'm a huge fan of their seafood crepe because it is delicious
I had the garlic/mushroom/kale pizza a combo I wouldn't have thought of putting on a pizza yet it was delicious
The food is always good in my experience but when I go I usually choose to eat outside since inside is so dark and you can't really get up to go to the bathroom without knocking something off someone's table or putting your a** in their face
I do expect for the price to reflect the quality of food and service
If you want the ambiance with a similar lounge feel but a much better quality of food go to Postinos
The food was very good hot and served quickly
This is greasy comfort food -- and good greasy comfort food at that -- but that's just too pricey for greasy comfort food especially in this type of setting
But the food has been consistently good and is a regular spot on our office lunch rotation
I had a shredded beef taco and a green chili tamale again not impressed
I do admit it was pretty tasty and the meat was very flavorful
There were dishes I didn't care for but most of the thinks I have eaten there were quite good
The food is pretty good but it's all about the beer
The only possible negatives were that my Kir Royal raspberry with sparkling wine was not as tasty as I would have liked and we had a couple of people who don't eat pork and in certain dishes such as the Egg Strada they could not swap out the pork for chicken sausage because they were already mixed the quesadilla was swap friendly just fyi
I've had some bad experiences with animal friendly baked items in the past see overly dry and tough but the cookies brownies muffins and dessert bread at Desert Roots are excellent
The food is tasty reasonably priced and they have a decent selection of beers
Usually if the food is delicious I can shrug off the bad service the fact that I still patronize Cornish Pasty makes this evident but I think I hit my breaking point today when a female employee rudely told my friend that we couldn't get the food items on the happy hour special as takeout and that we would be charged full price if we wanted to order anything on said menu
Was told they are about to roll out a different seasonal flavor every week
We tried the gyro meat and the chicken shwarma - both of which were delicious
My one friend raved about how delicious the meatloaf was and the other said his hamburger was perfectly cooked hot pink in the middle
The Mexican food here has the tastes of Sonora and is full of flavor
Bottom line this restaurant serves good Mexican food the portions are huge and is inexpensive
50 hot dog and soda or the pizza slices or whatever else it is that you desire from the usual choices
Items like an all natural hot dog gooey grilled cheese savory tomato soup bacon wrapped dates and a few other dishes should keep everyone's taste buds happy
The food at Beaver Choice Scandinavian Bistro is delicious; a little unusual but easily understood
But if you go equipped with the five items mentioned above you'll have some excellent food
The music is really chill the decor is top notch and the food and drinks are very good
If fried chicken remains absolutely delicious even after all that you know you've got some special stuff
But chicken THIS good and I mean specifically THIS chicken that is THIS good
In each experience I've had with it the chicken is THAT good
But if you have any sense of what good food is you'll love this place anyway
My mom ordered a falafel sandwich she's a vegetarian most of the time dad started in on his shwarma sandwich the beef was shredded and tasted like machaca; very flavorful
an odd little tasty cake i know it has a name but I'm too lazy to search for it that had seasoned ground beef sandwich between layers of a slightly sweet wheat cake
The meat was amazingly seasoned but the wrapping was that sweet dough
Our fish was amazing and the Poke was to die for
That review made me think that the New Times might need a new food critic as clearly the current one is lacking in good taste
The Poke appetizer has been my favorite but the fish cevice was just as good
It combined so many wonderful flavors and is now my new favorite dish at Hula's
If you want a great place with a fabulous atmosphere awesome beers they have Drifter on tap and amazing food go to Hula's
We just moved to Scottsdale AZ from California and had not yet found a good sushi place
I came here for brunch because I heard it was good and I always thought there food was ok
The waitress brought free shots to make up for the bad food
Food we had the pretzel fondue for an appetizer which was a nice treat because I don't order fondue often
/ Irvine area I've been craving good beef noodle
My friend and I tried and shared a variety of dishes from the foie to a delicious simple salad to this incredible asian fish dish all the way to the most gorgeous chocolate souffle
The ham egg and swiss sandwich is decent and comes on a tasty ciabatta roll
The fish quality could be better but I'm giving it a pass because it is Arizona far from the sea less seafood consumptionQuite pricey though 12
I got my veggie platter again with the 4 dishes being Fried Okra Mac & cheese 2 Eggs/Cheese & Onions and I cant remember what else but I remember feeling amazing bout it  Oh wait did i eat waffles ah well I cant remember
My sandwiches are always consistent here and I haven't encountered any problems yet as far as food quality goes
Shane's is usually our go-to bbq place because the food is pretty good it comes out pretty quickly and the service is always friendly
Overall Shane's is a really great place to bring the whole family for some good food
The food was good and what you'd expect
Their spring rolls are ridiculously good and I think the spicy mustard might just be the cure for the common cold
The flavors were spot on and the colors in the dish were nice and vibrant
Beckett's achieved a neighborhood feel-good joint  that was rustic and casual; however the high-end service did not meet the expectations of the food
I found the food lacking in flavor and pizazz
We also ordered a fish entree and short rib entree which lacked major flavor and disappointing to the palate
They normally load on the toppings pretty well not skimping nor overloading but when you just buy a slice toppings never stick onto the pizza and here they seems to just sadly lay on top of a delicious slice
Rimrock Bar & Grille is not a place I would ever seek out but safe and decent food for a hotel restaurant
This place has good food but all of the sauces taste the same
We have found the food at X-Tapa to be very good with a few hit or miss items Guacamole is sub par
Friends have taken us to the Glendale Mellow Mushroom several times and it was always prety good pizza
I had the Summer Salad with chicken apples grapes pecans and blue cheese toast which was good but with way too much greens and the toast was a tad soggy
The baguette beef  au jus and sweet potato fries were great the regular fries were nothing special and a little cold but we got two huge portions instead of one so we couldn't complain
The grilled shrimp and tilapia on the platter were good but the fried fish and shrimp were what I've come to expect from Claim Jumper - fair
For some reason if you call in a to go order the food is not nearly as good
Food is delicious and service is ridiculously good
the food and cocktails are excellent the service is as good as anywhere in town the room itself is both comfortable and sophisticated overlooking scenic Scottsdale Rd
The result is an interesting menu and top notch execution where even the Club Sandwich and Pomme Frites both have interesting and subtle notes where everything is made with fresh local ingredients and obvious care and attention to detailNo kidding even the chicken wing appetizer is spectacular
I have always ordered the same dish chicken fried chicken which is delicious except for some reason the gravy tastes a bit off can't explain it
The potatoes were cooked perfectly and the dish had good chunks of ham
Which left me pizza happy but not worth the 2 hour wait
There was even enough Polipo sauce left over after our Funghi pizza to sop up with the wonderful pizza crust
On a busy busy Friday night the bar service was great beer was cold antipasti everything it should be great pizza & a sweet ending
My wife suggested I toss out the leftovers but I wasn't about to chuck $43 worth of food
My search for good local Chinese food continues - so far China Bamboo on 16th is the best but still not that great
There are certainly other seafood places with better quality service and food for less expensive definitley not worth the $$$
Good beer list good food great location if you live downtown
Food was good but a fantastic wine list with a great variety to pick from
The rolls are a nice smaller size tasty and you never know what might be the the mix
I'm here all the time and I love the sandwiches pizza salad bar hot food bar butternut squash enchilada's vegetarian stir fry's tamale's and everything that they keep in the deli case
Food was pretty good if you like your tuna sandwich with 1-inch chucks of solid tuna
They have a great menu selection of Hot Dogs ALL beef too
I got an all beef hot dog with fries and a coke
We also had a nice brown pag chicken sandwich and a side of mac and cheese which is almost always too ironic for me but it was very tasty
The chicken was drenched in sauce hiding the flavor
We ordered the stuffed mushrooms stuffed with meat of course as an appetizer the bauernplatte combo a GIANT BEER a one liter mug of their darkest the Optimator and for dessert a slice of black forest cake
The chicken strips are awesome the salads are good and never wilted or over dressed the fish and chips are on par the fries are always good; you can't beat anything for the price and the atmosphere
Casey Moore's is charming cheap serves above average bar food and essentially is an all around quality bar in the middle of Tempe
I'd have to give it a third try for dinner but I definitely like the decor and found the food to be good
Very good with pearschicken pistachios and gorgonzola cheese
While the food isn't the best I've had its pretty darn good and its reasonably priced
The meats are good if you hit it early and they're GREAT if you hit it late
I believe the ingredients were/are top quality with Tilamahook Cheeses and Boar's Head Brand meats and cheeses being advertised and served
Needless to say I was very impressed with the service as well as the food
The breakfast area is a bit small so it doesn't take much to get crowded and the food is pretty much the standard Hampton Inn breakfast - cold pastries fruit milk juice coffee cold hard boiled eggs a pancake station and maybe some scrambled egg crumbs and fried breakfast potatoes
I decided to visit Hunan Express again a couple of weeks ago and I'm disappointed and sad to report that the quality of food here has changed
50 appetizer and the Hunan Special Chicken $7
Although the Hunan special chicken is good it's not as tasty as it used to be
Because it serves truckers and travelers right cooking all dishes all the time and good service have been well-taught
food is rich small portions that are not cheap and service started good and went to the crapper
Atami is authentic JAPANESE sushi and it is oh so tasty and reasonably priced
The food portions are large but the quality is just ok
Spicy crispy full of flavor accompanied by crunchy egg roll and wontons
I had the MOST delish food and wine at this hot new Restaurant & Lounge/Bar I can't believe it was the very FIRST night of their soft opening
My mouth watered with anticipation as I saw the wonderful presentation of the food
And the food the appetizers salads and pizzas are outstanding
I totally should have went for thai hot seeing as i asked for some sriracha on the side and dumped it all over my food The place was very cute modern and was not loud so i was actually able to hold a great conversation on my date
Some of our treats included shrimp shumai chicken and shrimp crispy spring rolls pork spare ribs with black bean sauce basically just a serving of pork fat with some bone in it but incredibly tasty taro cakes sharkfin dumplings and several others
he seriously dominates all the other sushi joints in the area probably because he's from the bay and we know what good food is
It is so hard to believe how healthy the food is as it is delicious and filling
Another time I split a flatbread and got the spicy tuna sushi - and that was excellent as well
As it always is the food was excellent and the portions were very generous
But the food is the MOST amazing food in the WORLD perhaps
After standing and tracking my bagel on the next visit I noticed that it was sitting in this food line after leaving the toaster getting cold
These at least were supposed to be some of the guys behind it so we thought of course the food would be delicious and the menu would be original
It had a gamey flavor to the meat and the bun described as 'Artesinal' on the menu had the taste and consistency of the butt ends of a loaf of Wonder bread
Maybe it was meant to cover up the gamey flavor of the meat I don't know but you couldn't taste much else
I enjoyed my fish burger but not my fries
The Pad Thai was flavorful the Bombay Curry was an assortment of veggies in a creamy yellow curry and the Chicken Panang was chicken in a kaffir lime curry with carrots and bell peppers
We thought the Wise Guy pizza a white pizza was over powering with flavor and thin crust
Delicious pizza especially when straight from the oven versus takeout - crust is thin and chewy
The sausage used for the pizza is very good
Also the chairs are hard - but that doesn't matter much when the food is good
I will have to say the quality of food was better than expected I got the chili and cheese crisp
I know you have a small location and Friday is busy but let me enjoy the good food that you serve instead of trying to turn a table
---------tl;dr Good food good service poor reservation management from hostesses and uncomfortable waiting area
The key here is Jim has all the dishes you expect and he does them all excellently with huge portions and fairly reasonable prices
Sometimes when restaurants open 2nd or even 3rd locations they have a hard time keeping the food quality and service consistent so I was worried about that on my first visit
The servers were all very nice and friendly and the quality of food was just as fresh and delicious as I remember it being at their Tempe location
If you're unsure about what to get I would recommend getting something with chicken in it your frist time in
The flavor and texture is consistent with that of real chicken
If I don't want to wait in a line there are many other breakfast places that offer good consistent food without a wait
The menu is pretty standard like most of Thai restaurants the price is definitely good for the amount of the food they offer
My friend had the Pad Se Ew wide flat noodles stir fry with meat and veggies which was pretty good and also a big plate too
I definitely will go back to check out more of the menu as I found a few of the noodle dishes seem to be good
He ordered the meatloaf & was unimpressed and thought it was pre-made from sysco his green beans were nuked to death and were the texture of old shoe leather
I figured the $8  price tag would yield a high end very good dish
Masteros & Flemings serve theirs for $5 and are both very good Mac & cheese dishes
When our main dish arrived blackened halibut and stuffed lobster it was Delicious but once again she attempted to speed us through that as well
Salt Cellar only gets two stars because their food was delicious
The appetizers all look amazing and I've order fish bites thai fish cakes and sweet potato fries
Windsor is one of the best spots in Phoenix if you are looking for amazing food great drinks awesome atmosphere and possibly the best staff there is
I had the pork sandwich and it was more than enough food and was so good
where can you get AMAZING italian food fabulous friendly service reasonable prices great wine AND an extremely talented pianist
Coming from San Francisco where there are a lot of good pizza places I thought that the pizza was good but I wasn't impressed
They have a restaurant attached to it for your convenience with excellent food
This was good but really extra cheesy for me but if you like cheesy food then this meal might be for you
It's completely worth paying a little bit more for their really good food
But with food I know what I like and I don't want to mess up a good thing
I'm not a breakfast person at all; however my french toast with homemade chicken sausage was excellent
Between a sloppy tostada with tons of fatty dark meat chicken and an overcooked carne asada California burrito I just wasn't impressed
not a fan of hot dogs BUT the food that is served at The Side Door goes much further than just hot dogs
The meatbalsl were delicious but the tomato sauce seemed very bland
I've only ever eaten sushi here but they have a lot of other menu items that I would like to try at some point but I always turn to the sushi as it has always been good and fresh
The food was prepared expertly and served very hot
And because it wasn't hiding behind a lot of seasoning I could taste that this was quality beef
I love Mimosas wonderful company and good food
The ingredients are fairly high quality and fresh and the food is executed just about perfectly
They cook up hearty and delicious food that would appeal to everyone
If you have friends or family in town from a place without a big Mexican food presence Los Dos Molinos is a good option for showing them some of the great traditional cuisine we are so lucky to have in the Valley of the Sun
Food took a bit but we had good conversation flowing so it wasn't a problem
But the fried fish with the gravy was just so not good
There are still comfort food options like Beef Stroganoff or more current ones like the pan seared escolar soooo good
not as good as the others BUT i loved how the meat was soo smokey that it makes up for it
While the lunch special PRICE is good the food is not
I had the Brisket Torta  actually i think it had me thinly sliced  tender beef that literally melted on my tongue that was lightly drenched in a mild yet flavorful BBq type sauce that sat atop coleslaw that added a cool crispness to the hot soft beef
Their personal size pizza is loaded with cheese and toppings and is good to split as an appetizer or order and devour by yourself
NOTE Happy Hour has 1/2 price pizza and other appetizers in the bar
Their cheese pizza is so good we order it every Friday night for dinner and trust me my husband is some kind of cheese pizza connoisseur
Yes very good and lots of great little side dishes to mix in with your entree
The twelve-ingredient streetwalker's pantry dish has anchovies in it but since its description didn't put me to sleep I gave it a shot dead fish and all
My turkey sandwich on rye was grilled and was very meaty and cheesy in a good way
Started out with the beef carpaccio which was really good but just a little bit too salty
We finished with some kind of passionfruit mousse dessert that was SO good
If you want good food and drinks this is a good place to go just be sure to sit far far away from the bar
I ordered my usual pho tai bo vien with goi coun spring rolls as anappetizer
The basil was freshthe meat was of good quality and quantity
One of my roller lifters seized for no apparent reason and ended up doing some custom girding on my cam this is not good
Nice selection of toppings and specialty pizzas I recommend the hot wing pizza
The food is good and for the most part the service is great
Been to a few different locations and the pizza is always excellent
I've also had their Italian beef also excellent
My wife ordered the chicken fried steak and it was VERY good
The last time I ate here though everything was a disaster- the quality of the food was enough to make someone sick
The food is always fresh and good and the service is super friendly for an Asian joint if you know what I mean -=o Watching the chef make the fresh noodles in the window is pretty cool
The food here is good but it's not the best i've ever tasted
I plucked each delicious little morsel of meat off that froggy femur with delight
I am starving and want some good football food
Perfect way to eat good Italian food - al fresco
Green provides all sorts of different menu items They have rice and noodles bowls with mock meats and tofu salads burgers and sandwiches mini pizzas and delicious Soynamis which are their soy based ice cream delicious They have specials as well so you may want to follow them on twitter or like them on facebook
Messy but it is so satisfying and almost creepy on how well it imitates a real chicken sandwich but it's guiltfree and deliciously crafted
I have had one of their noodle bowls with mock beef and sweet and sour flavor but it was not as filling as their sandwiches
For a brunch munch Cantina Laredo delivers a tasty Mexican food punch
As dubious as a lure sounds the food was delicious
The tasty food really knocked my taste buds out of my tongue
However we actually thought the chicken had more flavor
I've gone here a lot this summer and the service was always good and the food pretty consistent
The food came out soon after - big portion and all very tasty although I have to admit the chicken itself was a little bland but the cream cheese sauce and loads of salsa was a saving grace
Basically the night was perfect but the food specifically the appetizer and the fish were just not great
Second time around We scored an awesome parking spot in the front there were seats inside and the food was pretty good
The hot-pressed tuna had too much pepper but the desserts were oh-so-good
So go check out Nicks Deli and let them make some delicious food for you
Overall though I was very satisfied with the meal though Olive & Ivy can get pretty pricey for average-quality food
The good news for Tiny's is that they have changed the model all the previous occupants were basically fast food hamburger type places
For not being a big fish eater I thought it was nicely cooked and just the right amount of flavor
We ordered a couple plates of sushi which was flavorful and tasty
Chicken Boti consisted of perfectly spiced and marinated chunks of chicken breast served over a non-greasy flavorful basmati rice mixture
From fall through spring the Greenbelt is the best place for a bike ride jog rollerblade Frisbee golf or just some good old people watching
This one was the best in service and quality/preparation of the food well worth straying off of Bell Rd
My favorite dish is the pescado buccanero which is a sinfully delicious white fish fillet probably fresh tillapia because they ran out one night
It's fairly good pizza I think but I don't think it was particularly cheap just average prices
The food is good and reasonably priced but not worth the hour wait for cooking plus the 1-4 hr wait just to be seated
I've also tried the Doctor's Ordered eggs dish which surprisingly flavorful for something that is considered healthy and the Huevos Rancheros which is good but too heavy for me
I don't know what a bad boy favorite even means but it has to be good especially since I've had his food and was quite impressed
Mom's terminology makes me want to invoke the word 'fiendishly good' for anything delightful
Flavorless beans dry chicken that was closer to jerky and a tortilla that seemed to change colors at the bottom
My favorites were the chicken burrito fish tacos darn good with the white sauce on them and the quesadilla with green chilies
We also did dessert I did the marscapone cheesecake and it was amazing
There was a standard selection of typical dishes from tasty samosas to tandoori chicken and chicken tikka
The food is amazing and whoever thought of this idea is genius
The delicious dish of Thai thin rice noodles sautu00e9ed with garlic sauce yellow onion carrots broccoli cabbage basil and bean sprouts was the perfect size
Anyways the pizza was  very flavorful so much so that I could not stop eating it
Food is still good but the service and ambiance went down hill
Again the food was good but you get a lot less of it for the price
- the chicken satay appetizer- pad thaithe chicken was just ok but it the peanut sauce had the flavor and consistency of peanut butter heated in oil
a big pile of noodles with little or no flavor except a sweetness that had a hint of the sauteed peanut butter from the chicken satay
the chicken was flavorless clumps as were the tofu
Despite the rocky start the food arrived and it was very good
They have a good wine selection and delicious food
I went to Roberto's 3 or 4 of times the food is pretty good nothing amazing though
I recommend either the antipasto or the cheese dish as both are very good
We're back in Phoenix this weekend ready for some good food and after seeing this place on Man vs
For a hotel restaurant there is a surprising amount of flavor in their dishes
I was not impressed however  with the styrofoam food boxes dine-in meals  served that way styrofoam cups and plastic forks and knives
4 Star - Food - Better than anything I've had in Arizona but not as good as several meals I've had in Portland/NYC/San Diego etc
The coffee is good food is great and staff friendly
Great service the food is amazing and tastes like home - every time
Nice and piping hot with tender thinly sliced beef and tons of noodles
Their spring rolls are pretty good too but I can never get myself to order anything but pho
The food I had here for the yelp event wasn't very good or very well prepared
Seems a little high for a fast-food quality meal
I think this taco with the fish cooked properly could be good
I mentioned it a few times and I was taking photos of all the food she brought out
It's standard tasty Chinese food and the menu is HUGE
I ordered a grilled chicken burger with sweet potato fries and it was surprisingly delicious
Also you can have more bread and dessert for free if you have and of your cheesy or chocolatey goodness left

Given the low prices and good quality of the food it is reasonable not to expect a great ambiance
My family eats here about once a month and the food is always delicious
The room food and TV entertainment were a it expensive but I'm sure most higher end hotels in Scottsdale are the same
You don't go to TMI to be wowwed by a splendid dinner - you go here to kick it with your pals in a cozy-swank environment with good beers and a cut-above average bar food
Overall I would stick to the pizza but know that it's worth it
I found the food to be very good but a bit pricey
I didn't get to try any of their desserts but everything on the dessert menu sounded delicious
A while ago the words hot dog and food truck would have made me cringe
Short Leash is a food truck that offers gourmet hot dogs sausages and brats all from a local vendor - Schreiner's Sausages
Also a long line indicates how good the food is
Food Dinner There's these dishes that are on sale right now for less than $10 and most of them are clay pot dishes which are DELICIOUS
the chicken is good and the sides are killer - collard greens candied yams - even the cornbread is on point
although the food is good and unique to the area which is frankly why i don't mind paying for it they're VERY proud of what they serve
She had a seafood pasta dish which I tried and that was delicious
I have yet to have any beverages from the bar but I'm sure that based on the quality of their food the drinks are amazing as well

My food was not very good and actually made me a little sick
While I am partial to good hole-in-wall Mexican food I was pleased to find a nice alternative to tacos and chimichangas
As I walked over to the restaurant I got giddy inside thinking that I would be welcomed by absolutely amazing down home soul food that I have experienced in Harlem Houston St
Maybe my taste buds are a little too snobby but like I said I have had amazing soul food in other places not just the South
I must say that the black eyed peas and corn bread were pretty good but the cabbage lacked lots of flavor and so did the fried chicken
Also the fried chicken was very salty but lacked flavor which to me is a little oxymoronic
I will go over and try Lo-Los Chicken and Waffles soon and hopefully there I will find delicious soul food that I left behind on the East Coast in New Jersey NY and Philly
Carne Asada is meh and the fish taco is not nearly close to good ones that I have had
The food Nobuo prepared was so delicious and all the guests enjoyed
Much to my surprise everyone couldn't say enough good things about the food
has good food like most I've tried but truly stands out for their fantastic customer service
What I didn't get is why to put so much stuff in a good dish
Spicy or not the flavor combinations they have which you can customize with what type of meat/fish/tofu you want are mouthwatering
As someone who LOVES Thai food I can really appreciate a good Pad Thai and Wild Thaiger's is my favorite hands down
Their other dishes are consistently good as well
I love Chicken Satay but most places only offer it as an appetizer with a few skimpy chicken strips
Wild Thaiger on the other hand has a filling Peanut Chicken lunch as well as a Peanut Passion dinner both drenched in their delicious peanut sauce
The Thai dishes are amazing and fairly authentic
Be forewarned that if you order dishes extra hot you'll not be able to taste anything else after the first dish
They have quality ingredients great customer service and overall good food
Yes it is quality food but I feel like compared to some other places their prices may be a bit steep for what you get
Our favorite food items are the crunchy roll the tofu pad thai the udon noodle soup the tempura plate and the surprisingly good tofu steak with mushroom sauce
the food except for the soup never seems to make it out of the kitchen as fast - and therefore be as hot - as it should
If you want a good new taste and amazing food Chino is a good new place to try
The food here was pretty good thoughthey had Chinese broccoli walnut shrimpdeep fried battered fish spring rolls that were good and not greasy fried chicken which was good and the pork pot pot stickers were very good also
Every single dish  was very well crafted with multiple layers of flavor and texture but they were very simple when it came to ingredients
Za'atar is a simple Middle Eastern spice blend that adds a great flavor to most things it is put on and it brought the eggplant dish together
Bacon is really a wonderful thing to see when looking at the description of a pasta dish  that already had butternut and creme fraiche
The chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside
As you can imagine it can get quite loud at times but I dining with good food live sports and interesting people is more than one could bargain for
Dark atmosphere good food good variety of wine
They have the bomb diggity Starbucks with my Starbucks peoples they have a good deli good meat department great bakery dope wine selection and just generally kick the crap out of every other grocery store I go to
$60 per person don't chock get's you unlimited amount of fresh shell fish Belgian Waffles Pancakes and typical breakfast items the most amazing Filet Mignon taco's petite filets shrimp scampi unbelievable crab cakes lamb chops a huge spread of cheeses and dried fruits and finally an entire room dedicated to your sweet tooth
They might be good with a different sauce but apparently there are two options meat and really freaking spicy
Our food arrived steaming hot all at once incredible for a party of 13
I wish I could recommend a favorite dish but my favorite is whatever I ordered during my last visit
Poolside menu  Kobe beef burger with fries and the tri-colored tortilla chips with guacamole were both very tasty
Sure a couple of the waitresses are brain damaged but the food is good and you get a frequent diner card with every  sixth or tenth meal free
It is affordable it is welcoming and the food is delicious
If you want good cheap food here's a place to go
The food here I thought was really really good and for the price you can't beat it
It doesn't hold a candle to the menu service and quality of food found in the Surprise restaurant
To start with we had a delicious plate of cheese and meats from the anti pasta menu along side with some marinated olives and bread w/ olive oil
All of our dinner plates were delicious; fried chicken w/ mashed tatters & biscuits skin on chicken was a little on the salty side but very crunchy salmon w/ apple and rice grilled cheese sliderswho could mess those up
The kale salad was delicious on the side of the Brown Bag Chicken Sandwich
The Hot & Sour Soup wasn't very good & there were no regular lettuce salad items although there was a Chinese salad dish something like cole slaw that was ok
The couple running things were nice but the food just wasn't very good
However the veggie food they do have is excellent
The meatballs were also delicious and had a very different marinara sauce than what was on the pizza
I ordered the Filet Mignon I'm a picky meat eater so filets are usually a good safe bet for me and a Caesar Salad I ordered this because I thought an older classic steakhouse would make an older classic Caesar
We had amazing wine and food and I cannot wait to come back for happy hour
This past Saturday We went to the lodge at about midnight for some late night snacks we ordered $30 worth of food and drinks
Forget the quality of the food the employees are scary enough
The services matches the quality of the food as well
Why is it so hard to find good pizza in Phoenix
I'm sure eating here is probably not the best thing for me but theres something fun about getting good food that I cannot pass up
Minus 1 star for small portions minus 1 star for dollar value minus 1 star for nothing too creative or tasty about the food
They do a good job with their version of Green Chile Beef and the beans are pretty good
Lot s of Chick-fil-a stores around and all have the same food which is very good
The wings are meaty I recommend the oriental
Their menu includes appetizers flatbread sandwiches soups and salads burgers entrees and a small dessert selection
Their fish is fried and tastes delicious especially with malt vinegar drizzled generously on top
1 I have had better hummus2 I hate when the sides that come with the entree are better than the entree itself- this happened here3 I enjoyed the wine more than the food and when my tummy is not happy well
I enjoyed a thali dinner with butter chicken rice pickles mmm my spicy favorite veggies and dessert of gulab jamunfor about $10
Blackened Chicken Penne - Amazing and slightly spicy
The blackened chicken penne was worth ordering again this also comes in the 2 for $24 deal but is blackened sirloin
When i'm sick I want spicy hot asian food
Very blandBeef & Broccoli was surprisingly good--but it wasn't mine so boo hoo moving onSteamed rice--average
Thank god I can at least get a fairly tasty chain fast food meal that isn't horribly unhealthy while I watch another square mile of our precious desert get bulldozed
Last time I was there the menu was a lot smaller I am happy to see a great variety and food looked delicious
Chose George's special and we decided to get some fresh hot italian sausage from the meat counter along with some fresh parm to take home for dinner
It's nothing super-special just good food good service excellent prices
Beef kabobs had some flavor but were a bit dry
Chicken tikka and chile chicken were tasty
Good cauliflower dish beef meatballs were bland and as many have said - the naan is more like a sauteed fluffy pita bread
I am a Southern California native I KNOW good sushi and this is by far the best place in Tempe to go
For dinner I had the tacos which were under the appetizers section and I'm not sure why because it's certainly a meal's worth of food for one person
We were there on a night when the chef's mom was in town and so they had a special menu of Lebanese dishes that sounded delicious
I also got the prosciutto mac and cheese who can say no to salty meaty cheesy things which was also amazing
The food is a score- its almost impossible to make this meal unhealthy and yet it is packed with flavor
Who can resist a trio of piping hot tasty meatballs Veal/Pork/Beef soaking in a savory red marinara sauce topped with grated parm and served with warm Foccaccia Bread
Chicken Beef Shrimp and Veggie skewers 2 of each served with two delicious sauces
Each were good but the AHI and Chicken Salad were my favorites; AHI being the top
The mall is not always the best place to find good food but Wildflower is a hidden gem in the Chandler Fashion Mall serving up fresh good food that's moderately priced
Still filling and still a masterful medley of flavors and ingredients not often found in food at chain restaurants
and while the flavors blended well it had the distinct taste that freezer-burned baked goods have and that was enough to put me off of ever ordering dessert from them again
Mott St Meat PizzaThis was DELICIOUS
If you want good sushi in a comfortable & fun setting than I would suggest Shogun
They have two things I really like good food and Coke products
The beef was flavorfull and tender and not one piece had that vein or fat that you get in many sandwiches
Being from Chicago I'll eat food standing up at a counter in a modified garage if the food is good
If your disappointed you have no Idea what good food should taste like
The owners are wonderful and the food is delicious
All in all Chen & Wok is a great deal for amazing food
We had a mushroom truffle flatbread - excellent arugula salad - good beef and brie sandwich - very good
The register hottie knew what was in the food
Prices are ok but there are so many good independent restaurants in the area that there is just no good excuse for bad food
The food was pretty tasty but the pizza and pasta were pretty small
For me no cheese and sub black beans instead of potatoesAlso they give A LOT of food I usually can't quite finish the whole burrito by myself so you get a bang for your buck um FINALLY an airport restaurant that doesn't follow the code of shitty and overpricedAlso the coffee has a nice flavor not the normal burnt black that I actually LOVE and it comes in one of those taller glass mugs I would prefer a regular mug but I guess it makes it look nicer
For all the times we have visited we've never tried a pizza too many other really good options to choose I guess
We had the Plantain Avocado Spring Rolls for an appetizer
The Jerk Chicken Off the Grill was delicious
It was one of the most flavorful juiciest tender chicken dinners I've had
I tried to dislike the food but it's good
The food is good but I'm getting tired of the piss poor service
The duck egg rolls tasted prefab and completely not worth the calories
They seemed to have great deals on the sushi and assorted typical appetizers gyoza edamame pork egg rolls
Don't get me wrong the food was good but I wished I got something else
The meat was juicy seasonings subtle and sides delicious
I love the way they make simple recipes like grilled chicken and bread budding worth those extra $$On the flip side it was rather too dull when we went there on a Friday night and the bugs never seem to let go of me
Ok technically this is not Mexican food it's spanish and puerto rican food but has a lot of the same kinds of spices and is WAY WAY WAY good
It is too bad though because the food is very good
The food was not particularly good on our last visit there and the service was rude and not helpful at all
Cold appetizer of radish salad and edamame in sesame sauce2
Two chawanmushi one cold flavored with fish and house made ikura one hot flavored with foie gras
I ordered the large chicken and beef lunch special and received a hot fresh delicious and filling lunch that met my expectations
One minor complaint was the teriyaki beef  it was good and tender but seemed to lack a certain character in its flavor probably because the grill it was cooked on was still so new
The sushi was pretty standard and very fresh but no different from any other decent sushi place as far as quality goes
For the price there are other places that one could go to for the same quality of sushi and sashimi
The prices were reasonable and the food and service were amazing
I think outback is one of those chains where somehow they fool people into thinking their food is good but in reality it isn't
So interestingly enough I was reading the reviews that the food was good or great but the service was terrible
The food could have been a lot better I mean the soup was almost cold and the pasta flavor was very bland but our waitress she was a delight
For an appetizer we ordered the chicken tacos
The services matches the quality of the food as well
As for the food it was definitely worth 3+ stars except for the main chicken pesto dish
I did love the appetizer 1 white bean soup with side of bread with asiago cheese appetizer 2 barley and poached shrimp w/ sweet asian chili sauce and one of the main dishes pork tenderloin with a sweet chutney/hint of curry sauce and asparagus
I'm from New York so you can bet the firs thing I asked everyone when I moved to Phoenix was where should I get some good pizza
There's a good selection of beer and wine and an almost impossible-to-choose-from selection of pizzas
Perfect crust topped with the perfect combination of delicious meats cheeses and veggies galore
Your favorite part of the meal might be the pizza or it might be the ambiance hard to decide between the cozy outside with live music and fire pit or the quaint inside that boasts everything downtown Phoenix is good at
Very tasty and her side dish of potato salad was just as good
Other staff members that came by to serve the appetizers were not very helpful just in a hurry to drop off the food and rush off
I've eaten here several times - the sushi has been excellent every time
I find it difficult loving places that are in strip centers with grocery stores next door - just doesn't really scream fine dining - but it is a comfortable laid back environment and I would easily recommend it for grabbing a casual sushi/japanese dinner
The sushi and the tempura has all been excellent no rushing to get you out with good wait service there's even a TV above the bar to keep track of the latest bball games
The best ones are always in the last place you'd expect to find a sushi spot let alone a good one
It's been around a long time and let me just say how pleased I am that other people recognize good sushi when they find it here
Also for those of you into monkfish liver the portions here are breathtaking high-quality slabs  just like the sashimi
Proper sushi this isn't but for the best fish-flavored potato chip you'll ever eat give it a try
I'm so happy I did becausea it's always great to see Thomasb service was better than ever - Brian was our server and David brought our food out when it cameand c I tried 3 menu items that I hadn't tried before and enjoyed all of them
We replied with a big It's Excellent as I stuffed food in my mouth
The food was delicious and they had tons of healthy options
The chicken lo mien looked great as well and the husband enjoyed it so much he's now hating himself for eating more than he should have and curled up in a big stuffed ball
Even the delicious nutritious teriyaki chicken bowl brimming with sprouts veggies and quinoa was only posing as Mr
Oh how I missed the fresh ingredients the whole foods the homemade flavor in every bite
Now typically restaurants overcook the chicken drying it out but this was extremely moist and a delightfully tasty creation
Wonderful food excellent service great atmosphere
The meat is delicious it's served on a tasty ciabatta bun and the fries are WAY better than any fast food fries that's for sure
However if you want to taste some of the best black beans in the world coupled with some incredible Jerk Fried Rice to match beautifully with tastylicious Jade Red Chicken- this is the place
Yes I agree the food it a little on the high side but for me it's worth it
When I got home the food was not even hot
One dish was actually any good regardless while the other was terrible
You cold order sushi pad thai burgers and fries
I keep coming back because the food is just pretty darn good
They have a good menu with pretty fresh food and good sandwiches
The fries that came with my food were actually pretty good and the iced tea was huge so I didn't run out when the waitress never returned
LOVE THEM- the food is great and unique - you probably haven't had anything like it and you need to change that- I don't know what a beaver has to do with anything but he's cute so who cares- Don't let the weird plaza scare you the place is great and you should definitely eat in to get the full experience crazy how good the food is becoming in this weird plaza - Ted's Papaya wow
Desserts-Seasonal pumpkin cheesecake very fluffy with a rare naturally fresh pumpkin flavor one of the best of its kind-French white chocolate bread pudding loved the spongy texture and the smooth silky blend of sauces drizzled all over-White chocolate brownie unique and has my stamp of approval as wellOther dishes-Blackened mahi topped with crab meat and tomato creole sauce I don't usually like blackened fish but this one was thoroughly enjoyed-Israeli couscous unexpectedly delicious and with the aggressive rate at which I fed myself I might as well have sniffed the couscous grainsService-Very good-Our waiter put stars in my eyes after giving us that heavenly pumpkin cheesecake for free since I couldn't decide on a dessert or 5
The meat was tender and marinated well the pico was tasty with a little spice and the tortilla was perfect and didn't break like they usually do
The staff was very nice and there was even a worker who would quality check the food before bringing it out to the customers
As good as the butterfish is I loved the lobster
Service=5 Ambiance=5 Quality/Taste of Food= 5 StarsI greatly look forward to going back
As for the food it's good but nothing outstanding
Of course I would never tout Papa John's as the best pizza in town or anything but hey it is/was cheap and pretty good
I wasn't very impressed party due to the food but mostly because of the BEYOND RUDE service I received
The price was definitely reasonable the owners showed up to hand out the pops and answer questions and everyone enjoyed the dessert
The pizza was good though it seemed lukewarm when it was served
I of course recommend the pesto-style pizza
The food was good but I think for the quantity of food you get it's a little overpriced I know some are going to disagree and say it's about quality not quantity and I agree with that to an extent
Food was cooked perfectly and flavorful and all I can say is come hungry because they aren't stingy with the portions
My nem nuong quon was brought by some cold sore yielding individual who overcharged me by about 50 cents for my rolls and the ice guy who seemed like he owned the restaurant acted like a dick when I ordered
Amazing place amazing food amazing service
After ordering our food the cold becomes a bit much
The food is delicious plus they have TVs everywhere
I'm picky on Mexican food and find theirs to be good
I wish there were more sports bars like this -- good Mexican food and lots of sports on TV
They have a nice little cafe there with some pretty good food
Both dishes are very simple and served with sauces that are full of flavor
For those who loves sashimi but would also like to get a dish that is more filling I highly recommend their Bara Chirashi bowl
I highly recommend this place to sushi and sashimi lovers who looks for something different
Nice modern ambiance in the restaurant good selection of pastas pizzas wine martinis and other drinks in the menu
Chicken Alla Vodka was good too and they gave us a good portion of chicken
Insanely good food paired with top-notch service ambiance and the loveliest hostess
Amazing servers really know their business and can recommend wine pairings and their favorite dishes
The people at Rollerz are amazingly nice
The smoothies are sweet and sugary however and lean more toward the category of milkshake dessert than the desired must-over-dose-on-vitamin-C-NOW goodness
The food was good and the feel of the restaurant was good
I'm not sure about the quality of food since we didn't even make it to a table
The board app with white beans olives italian meats toasted bread and so forth - all very good
This place is good and the sushi is cheap
These are creative and all sounded good but we had the April roll
Beautiful place great rooms amazing service delicious food relaxing spa and a ton of cool activities
The food they served was really good -- one of the best buffets I've ever had
All the meat was very tender and tasted delicious
I got an opportunity to eat really good BBQ Chicken sausage a hybrid chicken-pork dish and several seafood items from the buffet tray
The quality of food is very similar from what my red-meat eating friends tell me
The restaurant was clean and the food was pretty good but overall not a satisfying experience
Food-wise I recommend their mahi tacos and the queso fundido
This location has great service  good food
Overall I wasn't overwhelmingly impressed with the pizza I had at Sauce
A girl in line recommended the caesar salad pizza
Authentic quality Mexican food for dirt cheap anyone in the area should definitely check it out
Had a taste of my bro's 1/2 pound bacon cheeseburger and the meat was so tasty
I hated going to Coldstone and other places where they controlled how much was in my ice cream
It had a lot going on in this dish but for some reason it still lacked flavor
Overall the food was good and the service was peachy
Chinese takeout + taqueria + some extra flavors thrown in =Basically your imagination is the limit Jerk chicken burrito with an egg foo young quesadilla with Cuban refried black beans and fried rice
My food was terrible mostly because it was cold
Both said food was ot terrible mostly at least it was hot
We were not charged for my meal since I didn't eat it but for two lunches ordered off the lunch menu our bill came to $40 which I think is high especially considering the quality of food
Also noteworthy at Maizie's are the pizzas
I was recommended the braised beef tacos and the enchilada for the wife
I was quite surprised about her liking the food since she's picky when it comes to veg food flavors
I would also recommend the brucetta chicken pasta and the sizzling chicken plate something or other
Hot salsaDaily special enchiladas spicy with an egg on top which may sound odd to some but it really worked on this dishSon-in-law got the burro
Very friendly service delicious food and cheap prices
The staff was great service was excellent and the food was spectacular
After sampling a bit of this and that I did find some dishes that I really enjoyed
I also thought the many varieties of chicken dishes were good especially the kabobs
I'm a vegetarian and can't vouch for the meat dishes but the couscous with red sauce is wonderful as are the other vegetarian options
Good variety of menu food calamari chicken poppers etc
With friendly wait staff good prices and fantastic food you can't go wrong
I prefer to skip the buffet as I like my food XXXX-Indian-hot but I have never been disappointed at dinner
Bang for the Buck 2/5- I believe there are better places in Phx that have more creative dishes just as high quality food and good service
Food Quality 5/5- this is the standout here
food quality is very very goodFood Quantity 3/5 - small portions for the price
Food Flavor 4/5- they do very well in this area
Order goes 10 minutes  later appetizers come out and 1hr later yes i realize it takes awhile to get food out especially 8 dishes our dinner comes or i think it is our dinner
The meals are always good and I don't always order my favorite I bounce around the menu to see how there other dishes taste as well and haven't been disappointed yet
00 and great so if your ever in Chandler and want some good Mexican food Arriba's is wuts sup
Presented along with the carnitas the El Rey Vasito de Elote is apparently a signature dish and as much as one may find it hard to see corn as a signature this is pretty darn good
Described on the menu as sweet grilled corn in a cup topped with butter mayo aged cotija cheese tapatio salsa cilantro & lime at a cost of $5 what made the dish really shine was mostly the corn and the cotija - sweet savory and smoky at once with just a bit of acid to meld all the flavors
Beginning first with the rice pudding - a small bowl of relatively standard white rice with hints of cinnamon and orange subsequently dotted with golden raisins and curls of cinnamon plus reportedly Vanilla Kahlua sauce it would be hard to find a less flavorful dish containing such ingredients and with the rice cold and clumpy all I could do was wonder if I'd received the previous night's leftovers - a suspicion more or less confirmed when I tried the three milk cake a dense and dry pound cake parfait made palatable only by the berries and most certainly not by the cream I can only guess came from a ready-whip can
Not one to complain except in the setting of egregious service or truly disastrous food I sat for a while with desserts unfinished watching the game still pondering how I'd spent so much on so little that impressed
five of us from the office went out to celebrate a new client contract and Rosita's is close to the office - the margarita's were good the service was good the food was good and the chips and salsa were good
the shredded beef chimichanga I had was as good as Macayo's where the price is 25% higher
That included miso soup teriyaki chicken little bit of salad I didn't need any more rice 2 California rolls they were OK & 2 other little goodies maybe wontons
The food menu isn't huge - but we enjoyed our turkey sandwich
Overall I gave it a 4 because I was not impressed with the food but the service the price and the cleanliness/ambience of the place was wonderful
There are many places out here that are really not that great but because growing up these poor bastards had no good food are way over-rated at this point
This is a great family restaurant and the food was good to boot
Fabulous customer service and delicious food
It was decent food but not anything amazing at all
The teriyaki chicken was wayyyy super tasty I would get that again if we go back
From Felmmings to Del Frisco's to Elway's in Denver and a quality piece of beef is at last some compensation for the cost
I wouldn't call the pizza at Pizzaria Bianco the best in the world country or even my personal experience; nor would I call it worth a 2-3 hour wait
I like the food here everything is fresh and where can you go to get a good cafeteria service
Good choices for light meals tomato basil soup is super yummy love the Salad Nicoise with Salman pizza for the kids creme brulee for dessert
The lemon shrimp app was pretty good -- a cold shrimp dish which we weren't expecting since it didn't say that on the menu
The meat was good and it wasn't too greasy or running
Good food nice crowd and friendly service
I had the bbq pork sandwich and the meat was amazing
The burritos are excellent as well and are medium in size again they don't serve the super XXXL burritos here which is fine with me because I don't like the food baby feeling I get after eating one of those bad boys
The food was good and I really enjoyed it but I agree that most of the stuff I had I could have made myself
They are perfectly attentive to your needs and the food is wonderful
The food was good and I ate breakfast there twice during my stay it was quick hot and one block from my hotel
the hostess was very nice and took the time to explain the different sushis and the waiter made sure I had a beverage while I waited for my food which was excellent
The first two times my partner and I were alone but we took friends to the brunch telling them how great was the location and good was the food not expecting what happened
The food ranges from better than good to very good
So if you're looking for good food at a great location making the slightly high prices acceptable and you don't care that much about correct menus good service or managers that give a care Local Breeze would be a good choice for you
As others have mentioned the food is good not great
The pizza has delicious thin crust due to the type of oven they have
The food is pretty good and they are super quick when it come to take out
My wife and I came here for dinner and the food was very tasty
I had the Chicken sandwich and this was amazing the moment it hit my mouth
Overall my catfish was pretty good mine did have butter/garlic and was cooked fairly well not LA catfish but what do you expect in a desert
Next our entrees- Chicken cubano for me-the chicken was pretty good but the onions on top were kind of sweet and just didnt work for me a person who adores onions 99
Because it took about an hour for me to get my food - and when it came it wasn't worth the wait
March 12 2011 Tonight my girlfriend and I went to the Havana Cafe on Bell Road expecting a casual dinner with good food and good service
The food was good but everything else was VERY disappointing and frustrating
The food is really good the wine is really well priced the beer list is interesting enough for beer lovers or novices and the patio is great for dining with children
Gram had the meatloaf and ate about 3/4 and then decided it wasn't as good as it used to be
All of them had unique and bold flavors - you could taste that the marinade had really absorbed into the meats
Albeit the flavor and texture of the meats was grand it did not taste fresh
great for groups and having good conversation but next time i will have my pizza delivered and enjoy the taste and forget the company
My wife enjoyed the flavorful Jambalaya and brought half of it home; while I ate half of my 'two meat platter' made of rib tips and baby back ribs
They also have a very good seafood selection
The food is very good kind of a modern take on comfort food
The brown bag chicken sandwich had a lot of flavor and the mac and cheese is done really well just the amount of flavor and creaminess
Well crafted tasty food in non-american portions
The food is excellent and the service is divine
I had the pleasure of trying the ahi tuna the salmon the butter fish and the short ribs each of them distinctly different and each of them excellent
I have eaten a fair amount of Caribbean food and I while I thought this place was good for Phoenix I was not all that impressed
Most of the food was tasty but the vegetable sides that came with the meals were just cabbage and simple peppers WTF
DO ITWe purchased items to make Yellow Curry Sushi Crab Puffs and enough snacks and flavored Sake and Wine to have a party
In a way the place combines an almost fast food set up with fine quality meat
and I have to say this one was pretty good for a fast food restaurant
The meat in it deserves an A+ I got mine medium rare delicious and juicy
I like my burgers to be large packed with flavors from the meat and other ingredients
I will have to change my mind about this place - the curry is wonderful and their tandoori chicken is just barely made on this side of heaven
I will recommend Royal Taj to anyone who wants good Indian food
The meat was very tender the refried beans tasted homemade the tortillas were tasty
The dinner menu includes 9 amazing and skillfully prepared Prime Seafood entrees numerous Prime Steaks that melt in your mouth along with a Berkshire Double Pork Chop  and  a double breast of chicken which can all be accompanied by luscious sauces and seafood
My younger Sis had the Pizza/Tarte with bacon thyme and onions it was very very very good
D&E has decent food and a very good burger combo but the place does toy with the menu a lot
I asked my friend how was his food and he said it was pretty good
As for my dish I thought it lacked big flavors
Good thing is I work directly across the street from there and work with many clients and I make sure I tell everyone how gross their food and  service is
Again the pizza isn't the attraction  its just something nice to snack on while you listen to and watch this amazing machine
We thought the food was excellent for the price
Scale of 1-10 single visit5 Food5 *Drinks*6 Service8 Atmosphere6 ValueI'll go back because it had a quirky-factor that I liked and b/c I need to try a burger to really gauge the food but there were no drink specials sorry cheap domestics doesn't cut it and my overpriced Frito Chili Pie wasn't good
Luckily the deep fried bacon wrapped hot dogs saved the Food score a bit
Visiting Mom in Scottsdale I was looking for a good slice of pizza
The pizza is quite good; nice char on the thin hand tossed crust hearty sauce  buffalo mozzarella and fresh toppings
Pho with brisket is super yummy AND the eggrolls are delicious
It's truly a gem hidden in one of the most obscure centers the food is good and the service is excellent
I did make sure to put enough red rooster hot sauce on the chicken to kill a small horse so I may have been eating my own tongue and not realized it
I enjoyed the quaint setting friendly service and especially the meal that brings together a variety of foods that you normally wouldn't create in your own kitchen
Food was decent I had the mozz panini which was very tasty but both my friend's paninis which had more ingredients than mine were boring as dirt
and as I bitch about constantly it is HARD to find good Mexican food in Phoenix and Ajo Al's was a bit of a disappointment
A little pricey but if you love yourself a good Chicago-style italian beef hot dog or polish then Luke's is the place for you
It's nothing against them though he's a total freak of nature when it comes to spicy food and I've never seen him think something was hot enough
50 Good thing we weren't hungry as the dish size was smaller than we expected but did have 7 shrimps
Dish was OK and the broth not meant to be a full soup was excellent
The meat also was lagging in flavor and a little dry
While there was lots of meat the quality of the burger was very average
The meat section is awesome -- great quality meat at good prices including organic grass-fed beef
You'll roll out of there but who cares when there is so much good ballpark food to choose from
Distinguishing factor they have a little dessert stand smack dab in front of you when you enter the hotel
The chicken was cooked well and was flavorful
If you are looking for really high quality food you probably won't come here as the price is pretty steep for just decent western food
You feel like your eating a beefy burger because of all the flavor but it's really not that much meat
The food was good too and they serve a breakfast menu till 1030
Never tried anything but the pizza but I'm guessing its good as well
Every single time they were rude to us but it was worth it for the delicious chicken gorditas
The meal started with the artichoke appetizer followed by a pasta dish followed by a peppered ribeye and then concluded with a chocolate dessert
The winners at Don and Charlie's are the calamari as an appetizer the cheesy au gratin potatoes as a side the bbq ribs as an entree and the cru00e8me brulee as a dessert
Great food good atmosphere and just an all around fun dining experience give Don and Charlie's five stars
The food here is good standard Chinese take-out
I've since tried it at other places and it didn't come close to the flavor and texture of the dish at sushi roku
the wine selection is good the atmosphere is charming and delightful and the food is amazing delicious and so very reasonably priced
seriously one of the best places in PHX to get drinks food and quality times with good friends
Pei Wei is a good not so fast version of fast food
knowing that there wasn't much open nearby and hearing the rumbling in our stomachs the boyfriend suggested that we hit up Hsin for some tasty spicy chicken
tasty chicken water chestnuts peppers bamboo and an extremely large helping of broccoli made it an extremely filling tasty and not so bad for you meal
they have your typical pub cold and hot sandwiches like buffalo chicken sandwich and Philly cheesesteak
Thai Iced Tea- a must to quench spicy Thai food Panang Curry- flavorful over ricePad Thai-  not the best I've had but goodPapaya Salad- tasty but not our favorite Shallow Sea- delicious seafood dish scented with lemon grass in a light broth worth a tryWait staff was very attentive and the owner/chef even came out to inquire about our meal
The yellowtail was so fresh and the spice just gave it flavor but did not overpower the fish at all
This place delivers quality food with great service
This is not authentic Mexican food but with that being said there are some good things to be eaten here like the chicken tacos
I am totally impressed with their brilliant food and service
They let you choose what kind of meat you like and how hot/spicy you want the food
They messed up the eggs and had to bring them separate but other than that we had GREAT service with a smile and the food was worth the price
At first I was a bit skeptical since the entire menu was on my placemat but once we all ordered and I tasted their pizza it was absolutely amazing
Service was great atmosphere was wonderful and some of the best pizza I have ever had
I love the chicken and adore the side dishes of rice and beans which are seasoned in a unique way and accompanied with the most delicious and fattening hand made tortillas
This review is based on the sushi portion of this restaurant so perhaps I would need to update this review if I ever return to Narai for the Thai portion of their menu although that will be highly doubtful as I interpret skunky fishy tasting sushi to be indicative of the overall quality of everything that the restaurant serves
It's not where I go for good sushi by any means but the quality is not too bad compared to local sushi joints and it's about half the price in half the time
--The miso soup was disappointing and some of the fish wasn't cut properly but it's most likely because they're cutting corners for costI wouldn't call it McDonalds quality sushi as the person below did but I might equate this to the McDonalds of Sushi
It has a great atmosphere good drinks and good food
Anyway the pizzas were actually really good
If you can handle the heat I highly recommend these dishes
This dish is really hot at times Hatch Chicken Especial - Chicken guisado with diced green Hatch chiles jalapeu00f1o cream cheese and green sauce covered with shredded cheese
The food was delicious service quick and very courteous and the portions were filling
No worries though the food makes it all good
The food came out real quick and was steaming hot
I loved it because it was not only a great brew house but it also offered deliciously consistent food that was served by a friendly staff
The Kobe burgers and the fish and chips were to die for and the micro IPA and other brew delights were as good if not better than the micro brews in Portland OR
You are a micro brew with delicious beer that once boasted fantastic food
Excellent lunch specials here; $4 buys you two slices of pizza and a drink
SO good I wouldve licked the dish they were served in if I wasnt so full afterwards
A good friend used to live nearby and has a weak spot for Mexican food
He gauges overall quality by the salsa though and will choose amazing salsa and mediocre food over mediocre salsa and amazing food
I really have mixed feelings about this place because the food is quite good but really overpriced for the portion size
Amazing job Lindsey Yelp & Tanzy This was one of the best events for this year the moment my plus 1 and I walked in we were greeted with a flute of champagne and when we were seated the wine was free flowingOur server Jill was amazing answered all our questions offered great wine pairings to go with our food made sure our water/soda cup was never empty very personable and you can tell she enjoyed her job told us when we come back which we will to ask for her and she will be our server I am all for that
My +1 and I were little late but when we got there the appetizers where already out on the table we got to indulge in calamari house made mozzarella beef capriccio which by the way was OMG DELISH
Daily lunch specials like Italian Beef Sandwiches and Friday Fish Fry are both excellent choices
If you work in the area give them a try for lunch it's a great little family run neighborhood business serving good food
I ordered it with the sauce on the side which was definitely a good idea as it was pure sesame and chili oils and the spice and oil would have swamped the delicate flavor of the fish itself
The biscuits and gravy also come recommended as a second best dish
They have tons of tv's decent food and a pretty good beer selection
And when you're back here it doesn't really matter all that much how *good* the food is
We had checked online and found that we could eat the Hummus appetizer $7 and the 9 Margherita pizza sans cheese $10
Both were good but seemed a little lacking in the amount of food given for the price
I went to this place based on reviews and either I have really good taste buds or the other reviews were written by people who haven't experienced great food before
The food is definitely worth the horrible service I received
The crepe was crispy on the outside and the smoked Scottish salmon has a slight saltiness to it bringing out the flavor of the dish
Unlike some of the other bouillabaise they didn't overdo the tomato in the sauce and had a very creamy soup making the dish light but flavorful
The variety of herbs brought out the natural flavors of the seafood
Overall I had good service and lovely experience on the food
I got an Italian Sausage a Bratwurst a White Hot and a jumbo All Beef Hot Dog
White Hot-  Its a mix of veal pork and beef
Jumbo Beef Dog-  This one I got topped with mustard onions relish and their hot sauce
For vegans vegetarians or meat-eaters this is definitely the place to go if you want hearty food a good cider or beer and a hip place to eat
It took forever to place an order it took forever for the food to come out and parts of the meal were cold coffee cups sat empty even after soulless promises of refills
The service and friendliness is still very good but the food yesterday was mediocre at best
I don't know if we just had a one time bad experience but the food was not very good
The meat was essentially lumps of fat and the prices were outrageous in comparison to the quality
I can say this the food was delicious and fresh
Apart from that near-death dining experience the food was delicious and the service was attentive
Thought I would give them a second try and had the bbq chicken pizza which was completely burnt on all the edges but the rest was really good
Hot dogs were the best food I have had there
But for the most part they offer several wonderful dishes on the lighter side with loads of fresh grilled seafood chicken and veggies
By the end of it you don't know if the food was actually worth the wait or if your drool was simply some sort of Pavlovian response to being deprived of nutrition for hours on end
I believe this is a not a chain and you can tell by the quality of the food
We started with the plantain and avacado spring rolls I really liked that wonton was baked and not deep fried the presentation was nice the mango chutney was fresh but the rolls themselves lacked flavor
The chef/owner came out and asked us how we enjoyed our meal and explained his philosophy behind the food
Big kid very much enjoyed the fish and chips
The steam room Swedish showers aromatherapy room the hot tubs
The food is pretty reasonably priced and GOOD
Fantastic bread not tooooo horseradish-y and really tender tasty roast beef
I definitely recommend this place if you want to try dishes you can't find elsewhere
The carne asada tacos meat was a bit tough and cold
The pork taco was pretty good and the meat was tender
but the quality of the meats doesn't seem that great
My server showed my how to wrap the hot and crispy egg rolls in a piece of crunchy cool iceburg with pickled carrot and onion and dip it into the sweet fish sauce with added spicy red pepper sauce
Lesson #1 unlike Thai food Vietmanese food is typically not spicy hot
But in either case this time I decided to pick up a pizza to take back to the hotel room with me
I like fru fru pizzas with the oddball ingredient combinations etc so this looked right up my alley however I couldn't really find a good combination of toppings
I did a little customization and 10 minutes later I was on the way back to the hotel room with Gelato and Pizza
Unfortunately by the time I got back to my hotel room which was no more than a mile or two away 5 minutes tops the pizza was soggy
They use a special bread Challah maybe which in my opinion really makes the dish delicious
I requested one and she returned with a hot beer glass straight out of the dish washer
My wife ordered the french onion soup and I the Fish and Chips since no Pub is Worth its weight in ale if it can't produce adequate Fish and Chips; for it is a Brit Pub staple and I judge all Pubs by their Fish and Chips
After what seemed like an eternity our food arrived and it was definitely not worth the wait
I've never had a negative experience and all of the dishes are decedent though the quality has definitely improved over time
The chai is wonderful and the chicken tikka masala has a subtle tandoori flavor
My friend had the seafood enchilada and said it was very good also
The food is pretty standard bar/pub good
I've had their burgers I've had their pizza chicken fingers chicken rolls - all of it decent but not exciting or exceptionally good
It was a good place but there is no meat so if that what you are looking for you should go elsewhere
We left our email addresses for an invitation to a Grand Opening party and the food was good but a little pricey as expected for a restaurant in this area
It seems kind of funny to me that both in Seattle and Phoenix you have to wait in line for half an hour for good Mexican food
The first time we sat in the regular section and ordered sushi which was  well-prepared and tasty
Admittedly I am not a sushi expert but if it tastes good and doesn't fall apart I'm happy
I highly recommend it if you want to try sushi or the teppanyaki experience
I love to sit on the patio of Postino and enjoy the enclosed outdoor area sit and munch of delicious food
You can custom create your own rolls which I have yet to find at other sushi places and every roll I've had on the menu is amazing
I've also had some of their main dishes aside from sushi and those are delicious too
While I was impressed with the presentation of the food and the entire place the food itself the part I truly prize was no bueno
They had a lot of food options there and I did try Olive and Ivy which had a really good breakfast muffin sandwich that had avocado in it
The pizza was tasty but for $16 I thought it was a bit pricey
And they don't have any coupons on the site either - the pizzas are outrageously expensive and just not worth it when you can get far better quality from Bronco Billy's or even Papa Jomino's
Wok-Fired Chicken and Lettuce Wrap was really good but everything else was blah
Chicken marsala was dry and didn't have a simple marsala sauce not a good choice on my part but I figured it's a simple dish so would be a safe item
Their food is pretty good although one of my friends complained that almost every dish came with bacon which she found gross
My favorite is their absolutely AMAZING baked mac N cheese dish with spicy pepperjack cheese and bread crumbs on top for only $5 portion is small
Anyone who has read some of my other reviews knows that a good mac N cheese dish qualifies a whole extra star all on its own
Overall good food decent service kinda spendy but fun
The other food was pretty good but the service just killed it overall
I come from New York where we believe we invented all good food but especially the bagel and pizza but that's another story
All that aside the food here is really good
I am not sure what was going on but felt like he just threw the food in unmade and non tasty
If you haven't done the whole revolving sushi thing I recommend checking it out
However I will say if your with a big group of friends who wanna get a quick sushi fix for lunch this is an excellent option
Hot & sour soup crab rangoons fried rice general tso's chicken szechwan shrimp and a rice based desert that I forget the name of
Hottie throws me a curve ball by texting me during a layover to state I'm craving Indian food
The food is standard and tastes good but it isn't fantastic
I could not believe how tasty the meat was
The food and the prices are still amazing
Now Pho Thanh has plenty of space for all of its patrons to enjoy a hot bowl of the best beef pho in the valley
It is lacking in atmosphere but I'll give that up for consistently good food
The owner was fantabulous the staff were fantabulous the food was fantabulous the company was AMAZING
The food isn't good either and they stop serving anything cooked even a grilled cheese - simplest creation known to man pretty early
This place has amazing chicken flautas
I had the Swedish massage today - I needed it because my shoulders and back have been sore lately so I really enjoyed it
My mom much preferred her hot stone treatment and says she will not get another Swedish massage
All in all if you have some deep muscle issues go Swedish otherwise go hot stone
Try some of the tasty spa food before 3 pm - you will be glad
My other dish was ok and the papadums were good and the rice and Naan bread were good so I won't go below 3 stars but - quite frankly my meal wasn't a 3 star meal
I was also invited to what I thought was complimentary food and appetizers
With that in mind the food is still good and the drinks are fairly reasonable
So far I've tried only the traditional Italian crust pizza at Rosatis and I found it to be very good
Dough-5 stars   Sauce-5 stars   Cheese-5 stars   My friend has been telling me to try this pizza for a while now and he to is from MA so he knows my flavor profiles pretty much better than anyone
The food was flavorless the beet salad was right out of a can
Special recommendations  The calamari spicy tuna rolls california rolls ask for no mayo on them and the fish tacos
Just a bun a good sized patty of ground beef cheese lettuce and a slice of tomato
We tried the Yassa Chicken the Jerk Chicken with Jolof Rice the Curried Chicken and the Curried Goat the last was my personal favorite and they were all delicious
For dessert we had the Pof Pofs sweet dumplings and they were equally delicious
If you need to order food for a group this is a very good and affordable option
I tried the adobe chicken and Pancit and I was impressed
The chicken is seasoned well and the skin holds most of the flavor good thing you have plain rice just in case the sodium is overwhelming on the skin to even the flavor out
I also enjoyed the Pancit at $8 a dish and very large
I would of enjoyed more meat in it but the noodles and rice was overflowing the dish
the only aspect of this amazing bar that isn't so amazing is the food is only so-so
the beer bits are a little bland and the pizza while very tasty didn't really leave an impression on me
I had the goat curry and it was very good - meat & vegetables alike
There was a  - the word diversity keeps coming back to me here - diverse set of distinct flavors in the dish that remained distinct and yet made for a very pleasing combination
You can't go wrong with great beer and good food
This place serves a lot of Italian food and seafood plus all the familiar appetizers and desserts
The food was generally good but the side salad was warm and slightly wilted
I ordered the Jerk Chicken Salad - it packed a lot of flavor
the hostess was really nice she checked on us a few times during the meal and was very helpful in recommending food
Excellent food if you know what to expect steaks burgers cowboy fare
I ordered Tiramisu for dessert and it was AMAZING
It was tempura battered the chicken and it was so crispy and the sauce was excellent
Chicken avacado broccolini bean sprouts and a very delicious brown sauce
I was not expecting the food here to be as good as it was but if they have been in buisiness as long as they have they must b doing  something right
I am sure the food was good but the experience and management was so bad that I can't go back
5/5 but the cheese was a 5/5 since you could definitely tell that the cheese was high quality- something most pizza places skimp out on
They doughy faux Jew food they have here just dulls the senses and makes a person forget the amazing deliciousness that we enjoy back in the real Jew food world of the east
My husband described it as perfectly good Irish corned beef
The food all tasted very fresh and amazing and you could tell a lot of thought was put into every detail
The rice was a bit too sticky and I would have enjoyed it more if there was more meat in the middle
The wait staff and the owners are always very friendly and helpful and the food although nothing fancy is always good
I have always loved the food but have never actually been in I tried it once when someone got take out from there for an event BUT that all changed last Thursday when my wonderful hubs threw me a fab surprise birthday bash at a private room there
the room was great spacious yet cozy the food was DELICIOUS as expected
The current owner had a pizza joint on Maui and came in and proceeded to not change the menu or the kitchen staff who are AMAZING but actually dropped the prices on a few things
The bread here is amazing pre-dinner as well as pizza dough I think they make their own pasta & mozzarella on site
The food was good as well I had the BBQ sandwich with fries and drunkin apples
Ok all that being said I ordered a chicken parmisan hero which was pretty good
The food was with one small exception very tasty and impressed us
My dish had mashed potatoes which are not a delicacy by any means but instead a good measure of how well a restaurant does the simple things
Choosing to just go with it I opened up my side dishes and the yams were good
Rock and roll memorabilia is plastered everywhere here with a terriic amount of Alice Cooper posters gold and platinum records photos paintings guitars and other stuff representing his Hall of Fame career plastered throughout
Not just a regular hot dog but 22 inches of Vienna Beef destruction loaded with chili onions jalapenos sauerkraut relish tomatoes cheese sauce shredded cheddar and bacon along with a bunch of crispy fries
Had a great time here and the food was pretty good
Alexander's in the midwest but it doesn't matter because the food is amazing
Food is amazing though and I will frequent this place often
the quality and portion of the food for the  happy hour prices were impressive compared to other happy hours that try to do the same
If you're looking for simple and delicious pizza and wings then you have found the place
The pizza is thin yet floppy the toppings are great try the sausage it's sliced like pepperoni the wings are crispy and the sauce is nice and hot
it's going to be fresh unique and delicious food
There are also other entrees including a tasty garden pasta and lemon chicken
We actually had two people serving us and received wonderful recommendations and information on the food and wine
Now that I have grown this is a prime place to shop for my own culinary needs such as pastas cold cuts pizza toppings sauces and even hommade pizza dough just waiting to be thawed and used to make your own delicious pizzas
I can't remember the brand but it's got veggies delicious white meat with a lot of flavor rice and sauce
The chicken was covered in a ketchup flavored BBQ sauce
BBQ is offered on weekends - AMAZING food
Picked up the following dishes Chinese Broccoli-- best dish hereShrimp dumplings not har gow-- bland wrapper was not done right  Rice noodles w/ shrimp-- wrapper was too thick flavorless sauce was also blahTofu w/ shrimp-- tofu was good but shrimp stuffing left alot to be desired Sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves
-- overcooked only had a big piece of dry pork  All of the dishes lacked flavor
Not a whole fish as I was expecting and only about 6 good sized pieces but lawd haveth mercy it was phenoms
and i eat a lot of hashService is a bit slow HOWEVER when the food tastes this good you understand why its slow
after seeing the staff i understand why the service may be a bit slower but its still good food and awesome people
so maybe they arent the most professional but what they do is make damn good food
For a chain restaurant Gordon Biersch knows how to bang out some damn good food
I am so happy I made the trek because the food was very very good
I would also recommend the Fontina burger and the chicken fingers
I would strongly recommend to anyone wanting asian food avoid this place like the plague
We started with the Plantain Avocado Spring Rolls which we both enjoyed
She had the Curried Chicken and Dumpling and thought it was good but not great
I had the Jerk Chicken off the Grill and thought it was fantastic; the spice was considerable but delicious
We thought the portions were just right and I feel the price of the Jerk Chicken off the Grill dish to be very reasonable considering the quality
This is not to say the food wasn't good or the service was bad it just didn't stand out to me
I would say all in all the food was good but not great
Still the prices are good and the food is great
Food was kinda pricey but definitely delicious
We hadn't planned on ordering any food but decided to go with a cheese plate after our server gave us a good sales pitch
The portion was very large and I wound up sharing partly because it was so good but also because it was a big plate of food
Fun atmosphere good food and large portions
The employees are very friendly and the food is really good
Pizza this good is hard to find in other cities unless you are on the East Coast or maybe LA
It's even hard to find good NY style pizza in Chicago
Three dishes were cold as in sitting-30-minutes cold
98 South under the old ownership was a good place to go for solid American food
I wasn't expecting great Japanese food in Phoenix but I thought Sushi Roku would be a good bet since it's part of a group that has restaurants in SoCal and Vegas
My gang thought it had closed one night and were super sad when we went to the location in Tempe not realizing until we read the sign on the door that it had relocated--but it's good enough to remain our only sushi haunt despite its location being less convenient now
The food is good the atmosphere is nice
So the pizza was good but I had ordered a cup of soup and it was still cold
Typical overly fried or sauced or cheesed gross generic Mexican food with no flavor or personality
not worth $26 to meFor an entree I got the the original combo or whateverIt came with small portions of ahi salmon and butterfishThey were all very good but not $26 good
I guess I just wasn't too impressed with the food for the money spent
we ordered three dishes and an appetizer to share between her  my bf and myself and we stilll brought food home and I dont think we spent over $30 bucks for all that food
+++ and some dudes but all very nice and good serviceFood- decent- it didn't give me poo-cano and they use a lot of cheese which is never a bad thing unless you are my Dr
The hot weather in AZ would make me want ice cream for dessert everyday - I mean what is better than a warm summer night sitting outside with the breeze in your hair and a spoon in one hand scarfing down a sundae
4  The burger meat is good in flavor but the burger lacks seasoning
People want GOOD bar food in a sports bar
love the atmosphere food is OK beer was cold price is a little high for what you get menu is too big quality of food is OK
prices are decent for scottsdale food was good service was attentive since it was so quiet  - as the hours passed it got more and more crowed
nothing beats comfort food you're welcome to use that Cracker Barrel for a small fee -Although the Breakfast was amazing it was also recommended to us to try the Meatloaf and Mashed Potatoes on our next trip so I can't wait
The food looked tasty the salads looked pretty and green except when they weren't supposed to be green ie
The food at this location is consistently good & the portions are generous
Visiting this wonderful restaurant is like visiting Rocky Point Mexico only the food is even better here
Egg potatoes meat and cheese in a fresh tortilla make these burritos worth coming back for again
The pizza isn't the cheapest but the portions are equal parts huge and delicious
The food is actually very good even though the building look like it has been there since the 1800's
It actually reminds me of Greasy Tony's RIP in that it doesn't look inviting but the food is really good
The food is reasonably priced but is worth it
Tired and slighty hungover we gave it a shot and were pleasantly surprised with the food
I thought the food was good and the service was very good
I had never had Ethiopian food but we went out with vegetarian friends who recommended it and we're always game for something new
I decided to pass on the meat dishes and go veggie like our friends did and we had a wonderful array of stews
We just got the cheese for our first time because if a place has good CHEESE pizza all of the rest of their pizza will be good
The first thing that should alert you is when the owner 25-year-old son of a Las Vegas casino mogul says that there's no good Mexican food in Phoenix
Frozen low quality fish overcooked low quality rice poor kitchen prep and even worse quality control
Good and friendly service but food tastes like it's been frozen and heated in microwave
A little hot but very flavorful and the meat was well-trimmed and devoid of excessive fat and other non-edible parts
The food is pretty good and unlike most dishes that I've had elsewhere
Room for Improvement Although the quality of the food seemed decent the flavor wasn't anything to brag about
I got one carne asada and one carnitas taco and both meats were reasonably good
The food was AMAZING the service was phenomenal and all the staff was extremely warm and friendly
The chicken was nicely grilled but still moist and tender and the assortment of roasted vegetables was surprisingly diverse and tasty
The dessert was HUGEand very richVery good though
I would recommend if only for after dinner drinks and dessert
The mushroom sauce on the chicken schnitzel was so good
The Swedish meatballs were very flavorful
I like that you can choose up to 4 sides with each dish so that you can get a good taste for all the different items on the menu
It was your average chinese buffet selection with nothing really standing out as outstanding well except the mushroom chicken that was pretty good
The food wasn't the best food I've ever tasted but it was still worth the experience
The Chicken Yellow Curry my go-to dish at new Thai restaurants was very delicious and everyone was very pleased with their choices
They have a pretty large food menu for a brewery but is still pretty typical bar food so I'm not sure how good it is
Sitting outside under the stars waiting for our pizza was amazing
The deep dish pizza is ridiculously good but my favorite part of the meal was the cookie pizza
I ate so much food that I needed to unbutton my pants afterward but it was so worth it
The sauce that came with the dish was delicate and flavorful
All around an extremely worth while stop for anyone who loves Italian deli food Do not pass on the candy that comes with the meal
I had the Chilaquiles Verdes and boy-oh-boy was this dish tasty
Both of my burgers I love food had soggy buns and were not very good at all
So I guess my only suggestion is ditch the Greek change your name to The Patio and your customers won't compare your tasty food to something its not
We ended up eating our appetizer as dessert -after- our entree since the entree itself wasnt warm to begin with and didnt want it to cool any further while we ate our appetizers
To top it off our server must have noticed that we already had dessert in the form of appetizers and dropped the check at our table without asking whether we wanted dessert
An out-of-the-way joint with good food good atmosphere and good services without the Scottsdale attitude
For my entree I had the chopped salad with chicken which was recommended as the most popular
It used to be a friendly happy family atmosphere with good food awesome service and bubbly fizzy soda
Instead of one with appetizers salads sandwiches/burgers entrees and desserts they instead now have a lunch and dinner menu
This location though is woefully inconsistent in both food quality and service
Ever since this location has been open I have been disappointed that one week food quality is great but then the next time food is either under or over cooked
Look elsewhere if you want good quality Chicken Wings Wingstop #1 Buffalo Wild Wings #2 or any other Native New Yorker
Other than the wait which was expected the food was delicious
So long and short I have to believe is that you should communicate with the waitstaff as to what you enjoy in a pizza without presuming that it comes with things we take for granted like a good red sauce
You won't find any plain sandwich flavors here and the pizza choices looked pretty interesting too
I enjoyed a pizza while my friends ordered a sandwich each
That said the food was tasty the prices reasonable and the atmosphere is wonderful at Cibo
later her roll shows up and it was 2 pathetic pieces thata weren't worth $6
I know good down home service and food and this is it
Some Dogfish Head Stone or some imports would be delicious additions but it's not like you can't go anywhere else and get it
We had their fish fillets in black bean sauce hot and sour soup and kung pao eggplant
I just wish the rice was better quality but it's still a great place to get good Szechwan food
All bread is baked constantly served warm and w/ a small amount of quality meat and cheese
Come down off of your high horse and enjoy some good food
and even though my meat was nuked it did have some good flavor
I certainly will not go here again no matter how good the food
For a fast food Mexican Food joint I have to say this one is pretty tasty
If you don't catch them when they are busy you don't always get the freshest ingredients as in sometimes I have had stale chips or the meat wasn't as good as it usually is
The chicken enchiladas are very popular here and it is probably because the chicken is smoked/roasted beforehand so it has a nice flavor
The quality of the food is consistent and tasty
It's a great little fast food place with pretty good portions
The rice served with it is a little dry and it's no bueno to eat dry food and spicy food together but still delicious overall
I ordered a hot sub the chipotle Philly chicken cheesesteak or something to that effect and my fiance ordered a turkey & provolone
I expected my hot sub to be full of flavor and spice but instead it was just a chicken sub with peppers a bit too much cheese and not much in the way of the chipotle mayo that should have been on it
Their food is good bar food and the service was quick and efficient
I was fairly jealous but my shrimp kisra flat bread pizza was obscenely good with lobster sauce wilted spinach and parmesan cheese
Friends from Cave Creek area were craving for some good  Chinese food and this is where we took them last night or took us since they paid for dinner
Nothing fancy but good American Chinese staple such as Mongolian Beef Orange Chicken Stir Fried Chinese Broccolli Seafood Chowmein and Walnut Shrimp
We liked China KIng's Dim Sum much better but enjoyed the food off the menu at Phoenix more
Crispy 'meaty' thick cut potatoes that are full of flavor
It was a touch on the sweeter side but I enjoyed it  even though I have had more favorable foie dishes
It looked like a good dish but the butter sauce that covers it was so over salted we could barely taste the pork inside
Another dish that came highly recommended was the bacon wrapped meatloaf
Prices are extremely low and the food is good
They sell some pretty strange fair food - I mean I can't even imagine eating fried butter but I did have a fried Reese's Peanut Butter Cup which was pretty good
Best of all Ted's is probably the cheapest place one can get a hamburger/hot dog/other meat + fries + coke meal
I am not vegan by any means but i do love a more icy texture and less/no creaminess when i have a cold dessert
We also got 2 breads--the Onion Naan so soft almost moist in a good way and FULL of onions and the Chicken Naanfull of tandoori-cooked chicken and infused with a smoky almost barbecue flavor---wow
Stuffed mushrooms were good the taco combo plate- Great Mexico City style tacos and I'm a huge critic of Mexican food and these were actually very good
the pizza was really good and I got to try 5 different kinds
Still waiting for some quality food in the laveen area
Bottom line until they get their act together come here for dessert and go to Paradise Cafe for good sandwiches and salads
The food is absolutely amazing; probably the best Mexican food I've ever had
I have to admit that I don't venture off to many other Mexican restaurants because their food is so good
The chicken was tender and juicy; the ham and cheese inside was bursting with flavor and the sides dishes were all fresh and delicious
Although the food was amazing they were practically falling into their plates from exhaustion
My mom and I got takeout so we could eat at our hotel- we're bad tourists and when our food came out the bartender carried our food out
Got a call from a friend today asking for a Vietnamese food recommendation in Phoenix
Just had to yelp-it because I'm craving Vietnamese food and glad to see all the photos
However I know when food tastes good and I know when it tastes fresh and FnB provides both in spades
I'm glad that there is a good pizza place close by to my new home
And the flavor on the dough on the pizza was tasty
The kids picked off most of the toppings but we enjoyed everything on the pizza
We even had leftovers for Saturday night dinner and the wings and pizza were just as good reheated
The wait is long and might only be worth it if you can't get similar style pizza elsewhere
Friendly staff good food and beer are enough to make you overlook this
Good pizza toppings you can get wine by the glass
Ok so he wasn't enthused about it before but that all changed once he got a taste of the beef brisket and hot bbq sauce
Pet Food Depot has a great selection of dog food and the staff is amazingly helpful and knowledgeable about the various foods
BTW while the restaurant is good for kids unless your child is able to eat spicy food - I don't recommend it
I would definitely recommend it based on it's historical significance; however if you're looking for great all-around seafood experience you may want to consider some of the other notable seafood restaurants around the valley
Everything was tasty and fresh but the flavors were definitely in line with traditional Seafood dishes
Not that this is a bad thing - I guess I have just become more comfortable with seafood dishes that have something extra regarding flavor
I really enjoyed the airport location because I travel a lot and have found often times you don't find good food at airports
I've tried a few of the pastas and they are all great my fav is the Chicken & broccoli pasta delicious
It hit the spot as hangover food and i have to say that the Kung Pao Veggies were DELICIOUS as they were diced up and mixed with almonds
Being veg I can sometimes get shafted by just eggs and toast dishes or the occasional bland omlette but this dish was so flavorful and full of deliciously chopped veggies I know I saw some potatoes cauliflower bell pepper and green onion to name a few
You know it's good when that's your primary source of food for lunch
I've been super picky lately about food when I eat out which stems from the fact that I've been cooking a lot at home and I'm damn good-toot toot that's my own horn so maybe it's just me but I thought it was really fatty and didn't offer much meat
The mushroom dish was good but I was expecting a lot more after reading all these reviews
Overall my food experience here was excellent and I'll be coming back
Otherwise head in for lunch or dinner and you can score some seriously good food off their wood fire heavy menu
Ok the five stars is for the margherita pizza- wonderfully fresh and mild mozzarella combined with perfectly flavored sauce not too much or too little and fresh basil
Other things worth noting I had a slice of the onion pizza and I didn't like it as much- it had no sauce rendering it a little dry for my taste
Our waiter wasn't the best but I don't really care that much because I'm in heaven with delicious brick oven pizza
So if you appreciate the fine nuances of a good brick oven pizza definitely check this out
The Food it was good not spectacular no oooing and aaaahing over every bite
This is as good as it gets for the Phoenix Valley Brings authentic feel with its service design and especially food
Sure the food is pretty good service is fairly quick and the people seem nice enough but I have no idea how this place can function as a restaurant
Oh and the food is tasty because Matt obviously makes no attempt to make this stuff healthy
However upon getting the food I was less than impressed for a place that prides themselves to the point of putting their product in their business name
I also like munching down on the pizza subs the bread on those are just as good as the crust
I ordered the beef noodle soup which was so good
The food is pretty good with mock grass grazer type substitute which was part of the appeal and sparked my question of if you can't eat something because you have a particular thought for the furry and cute why try the mock with the same name
With enough sriracha sambal and fish sauce you make just about anything taste good enough to eat
It's not so much that it's flavorless food here it's just funky
The appetizer sampler platter was nothing but from the box frozen selections most likely created by some giant corporation in Nebraska and intended for the frozen food section at your local grocery store
The food is excellent the prices are rich and it's a great place to loiter
My main dish was the seafood enchilada which was pretty on point but not as good as the one at Blue Adobe
That creamy chicken stuff was soooo good sorry dont remember what it was called and I had this other kind of chicken stir fry stuff that was REALLY super excellent It was called pan something  The pork dish was good too it had greenbeans in it and their veggies are cooked just right
Two of us had meatballs sliders OK tasting but cold
Roka Akor Hamachi Serrano Chili Roll - my new favorite sushi roll everVeggies - the mushrooms and corn are very tasty

My side salad greek was huge and yummy and my pizza was good
My husbands pizza was also delicious according to him If you want a place you don't have to wait at fight for seating and get great lunch specials
From hair parlor to pizza parlor -- I found The Parlor to be a unique high-quality restaurant and a welcome addition to my Phoenix neighborhood
From the fluffy perfectly baked naans to the rich curries with cuts of meat that remind one of what meat is supposed to be like I've enjoyed everything I've tried here
I particularly recommend the Beef Achari which was the first thing I tried there; I do want to try a biryani and see how that it so watch this space for updates
The food is always bad cold cooked or served wrong despite the easy order
My dish was good I would order it again but the pasta was a little over cooked
The waitress openly admitted she had not tried most of the food and had trouble recommending any dishes note to servers
you only get 4 and for the price it was not worth it-the mongolian beef tasted like donkey
We enjoyed an entree salad the trout and a couple of very tasty desserts
Plus a deli with hot food and every kind of sandwich you want
The pizza was freshly baked not freshly made by hand and the cheese was delicious
The fish tasted like it had been soaked in grease and had no flavor the soup tasted like someone just threw tomatoes in the blender and there was just nothing good about the place
A few things to try don't know the official name but description should help waitress out are the lamb hot bowl stuffed duck their mellon soup actually cooked in a mellon and very tasty and the fried breaded fish
Every dish was truly delicious and we left full and very satisfied unlike some tasting menus
The food here is pretty good too the spinach dip is tasty and so are most of the other apps
The ingredients and food quality are always excellent
The menu is excellent most of the dishes are targeted to sail past the mundane competition but the serving sizes leave much to be desired
When you order the pizza you can order two flavors half and half
I'm not much of a fish person but I would smack my mama for some Flavors of Louisiana fried catfish
It disappointed me that they didn't serve the rice with the dish but it was worth the $2
During the day my lunchtime experience was decently price however the food is mediocre in flavor
I've had pretty much every meatless item on the menu and everything is good
Okay let me first admit that going to Lee Lee's is a cultural food experience like none other in that they have their dry goods shelves broken down by country so if you are looking for say staples or delicacies found in the Philippines you can follow the signs to that area and half the fun of Lee Lees is just looking at all of the different food stuffs and wondering what one could make
Bottom line for anyone who is a bit of a foodie Lee Lees will be an experience and worth checking out
I actually couldn't resist ordering a role with grilled chicken as I wasn't feeling fish and the overwhelming flavor was of burnt breast
I was born and raised in South Philly the birth place of the cheese steak hoagies and all foods that will eventualy clog your arteries or at the very leat be well worth the self induced heart burn mmmm
I find their food good but a little overpriced
- and their hot food bar is always pretty inventive with a few great typicals
With the slogan of breakfast lunch and bacon I would expect the restaurant to have multiple interesting and fun dishes with a focus on quality bacon
I strongly recommend that the owner check out some good bacon focused meat companies such as Broadbent who has an amazing dry-cured bacon
Also the pickles they put on the burger are awesome - instead of chips they use the sandwich stackers which ensure that you get a bit of pickle in every bite Overall we enjoyed the food and atmosphere for a later-night laid back dinner and would return - 4 stars
I had the chicken pesto pasty and it was wonderful
My bosses have been there before and have always wanted to try the peanut butter and jelly pasty - so we all split it as dessert and it was so good

They had pretty good beer and the pizza was greasy but tasty
Tender flavorful meat STUFFED in a pita with fresh veggies
From the Pork osobucco to the burger to the veg dishes I've had everything has been good

There's also a bakery case with various desserts go for the sfogliatelle and cannoli they are excellent
I was very satisfied with my spicy szchewaun chicken that came with zucchini peppers and water chestnuts and was even more impressed by the delicious lo mein on the side
Seafood is always a good choice and my roommate swears by their chicken parm
Most recently I had an appetizer of crab cakes which were delicious and a chef-special scallop dish
I also recommended getting a dessert try the Tiramisu or the cheese cake
The prices are also phenomenal for the quality of pizza
If there was any downside to this amazing restaurant it is that the wings are just your basic wings not bad but now WOW like the pizza is
Nothing is ever exactly the same as the city it originated from but this is dang good pizza
I have been a loyal Don and Charlie's customer since the mid 80's and the changes in the pricing platter size and overall quality of food is mind blowing

The flannel corned beef hash and potatoes was delicious and pancakes are pretty good too
From the margaritas made with premium tequilas and fresh squeezed juices to the flavorful meats tacos and ceviches this place is a must go to for Mexican Food
Being a native to AZ I'm super picky about where I'll good Mexican food and Distrito hits a home run in my opinion
It's cheap food and the parfaits are good for only a buck
I have tried several other dishes here so here are my other recommendations  Chicken salad sandwich - huge and just a downright good sammich Chicken club salad - This is the hubs fav salad
Totally a man's salad with fried chicken bacon avocado cheese and make sure to order with lots of ranch dressing to clog your arteries even furtherRigatony Bolognese - For not being an italian restaurant this dish was still amazing
Order with the mashed potatoes very good consistency and flavor and the baked beans dip the chicken in the beans
A few other things worthy of mention Maryland crab cakes full of crab and the apple relish served with it is fresh and a really good accompanyment and the creamy chicken noodle soup only served one day a week but this is the best chicken noodle soup Ive ever had and I really dont like chicken noodle soup
As soon as our waiter discovered we were not going to order an $80 bottle of wine or a $60 seafood appetizer he disappeared into thin air
I've also had their pizza which is also pretty good
I thought it would be a chill place to go chat and grub on tasty food
The food was good but the experience in general started out daunting and Estelle was a champion
Phoenix has some absolutely amazing Italian pizza joints
The staff is great and the pizza is delicious
I give it a 5 for value for this price point the food is amazing and for overall experience the decor is nice and travel books about cambodia are on most tables are a neat touch
Food Spring roll good& egg roll top notch; the Baiynchaiv crepesat first bland but once we played with the side -delicious- so here is a hint we took the mintand cilantro and wrapped it in the lettuce and dipped that in the sauce and ate it with the crepe and the Katheaw Cha flat wide noodles with beef and shrimp the beef is very tender- delicious; grilled corn crazy fun and a perfect finish
I like that they have free music shows sometimes and the food is good not the best food ever but good
I got the carne asada burrito and I liked the flavor but the meat pieces were a little too small and it was a little too beany BUT I enjoyed it
Now the food; simple menu; but I got the speciality the Zinburger but got mushrooms instead of grilled onion; delicious - it was cooked to perfection
Our other friend who only eats fish had the Ahi Sandwich; really enjoyed it
very affordable given the quality and portions of the food
excellent drinks order the coconut water and it is srved in a real coconut that you can scope the meat out of and the two piece musical outfit added great music to chill but definetly not overwhelm
The bread was delicious the sauce had a great kick and the chicken was plentiful
The staff is friendly the place is clean and the food is good
I love this place and can't wait to go back in the beautiful warm weather to sit on their patio and languish over another delicious pizza
At LAMP they don't over-sauce the red pizzas so you get to taste all the flavors of the toppings
Great place to go to enjoy some good food bar foods and drinks
I had a full size BBQ chicken salad and all I could think-even after the second dousing of hot sauce was Ehh
The good news is he isn't full of it all the food has been great that I've tried
They cook their food to order so it is definitely not Chipotle fast thats what makes it so good
Crab Stuffed Shrimp were excellent; extra large shrimp were grilled then topped with sweet crab meat panko bread crumbs and a lime finish
The pizza is delicious and uniquely made; good enough that locals might order it for take-out to bring home for guests at a party
All in all they have a good selection of food for pretty good prices and the beer and wine selections treated us well
The food is simply the most authentic that I can get The Fried Rice -- if you like spicy -- make sure to get it med-to-very hot
The food is super greasy and I never feel good when I leave but I'm not going there for the food - I love the united and random screams and shouts and I will continue to put my stomach through the ringer just to be a part of all the commotion
I got the Flaming Tuna Roll and Broadway Roll and both were fresh and full of flavor
Yet somehow Gallo Blanco located within the Clarendon Hotel in Central Phoenix manages to pull off all of these things with an inviting atmosphere great food for a very fair price a great lunch for $10 and a recurring local customer base i
Not only is the food delicious but it is cheap too
they clean it cut it up grill it throw some lettuce and homemade salsa on it and it's a taco about 30 minutes after it quit swimmingThose are pretty good fish taco's
Food is very homemade American cafe/deli style with good burgers
I had a hard time deciding what to order so it was good we were all together to sample each others dishes
We ate our days worth  Dont worry kids did eat light dinner We decided we could not leave without trying dessert
I very much enjoyed the mesquite-laced chicken and dumplings
I will definitely go and try other dishes though it's good enough to not let that stop me
I had the pulled pork sandwich - the meat was tender and flavorful and the toasted bun was fresh and delicious
My husband had the barbeque sample platter he really enjoyed the brisket and the pulled pork - the chicken was good but required some extra sauce to make the hint of dryness go away
We make the best darn ribs at home so it's hard to impress us with ribs but these were really good - meat fell off the bone and they were tasty
The seafood department looked very good
We ordered beef brisket pork belly and kalbi which was served with green onion/lettuce salad and around 15 side dishes which were very tasty
Keep in mind I like to play it safe with cheese quesadillas nachos without meat and of course the much loved bean and cheese burrito but the food has always been pretty tasty
Prices are pretty cheap too and like another reviewer mentioned the food is a bit greasy but it sure is tasty
They have good specials and a tasty meat sauce
It was a Sunday afternoon 1ish hubby and i woke up way late lol and we wanted some good breakfast food
The BFF enjoyed his beef & chicken combo which doesn't surprise me since he's very easy to please when it comes to food
I'm not going to write a long discourse but the food was excellent
So you end up getting $35 worth of food/drinks for about $20-25 with tip
I also had the Famous tortilla soup which was very good with wonton chips on top and also tried my dining partner's white chili which was made with chicken
I was so impressed with the quality of the food considering the place was packed with a gagillion people all ordering sushi at once
I have been back a few times since and would highly recommend sitting at the sushi bar
Keep in mind you might have to wait a bit between dishes but Roy's is definitely worth it
Although the brothy cioppino came with mussels scallops and shrimp its flavor paled in comparison to the meatloaf
The meatloaf's braised mushroom sauce and perfectly grilled meat made each bite sinfully good
Don't forget to leave room for this amazing dessert
Quality Coffee Free WiFiDrinks offered in real dishes not just to go cupsComfy seating as well and great work spacesYummy baked goods***extra points for fresh organic fruit being offered***While I'm not a regular here this is clearly the spot of the neighborhood locals
The food was delicious though despite the weird setting
And the pizza we ordered was pretty amazing
A re fill on a glass of my iced tea which I set in purppose at the edge of the table empty while staff kept going by acting like it they were very busy also we waited a long time to get our check the food was good overallMy experience at the Frank Lloyd Wright location was very much rewarding and pleasant the staff was very joyfull and attentive to detailfrom the moment we enter the door we were welcome and seated promply by the host and told that Tony will be our waiter which he did an amazing job starting by introducing himself and accomodating us with anything we needed our glasses of iced tea were NEVER empty and check on us in a timely matter I end up taking food home and a container for my iced tea provided by Tony over all service was EXCELLENT Tony you are awesome we will be back again for sure
This location has no citrus besides lime so keep that in mind if you want something in your beer or waterFor our food choices we went withspicy wontons - great flavor and like other mentioned could use more filling - but definitely worth eatingsesame tofu - great light batter good sauceslime mint beef - not something i would do again - not bad but not carpaccioshrimp wrapped in bacon - how could that not be good
wasabi soy chicken breast - amazingly moist great sauces
It's fairly salty and greasy and has a distinct flavor over other pizza places in the Valley
He was great with describing the food and how spicy and offered his recommendations
Tuna roll was so-so tuna shrimp tempura roll was standard and not bad yellowtail was actually pretty darn good
The first thing I thought of when I heard of Chino Bandido nearly 10 years ago was that Chinese-Mexican food does not seem like a good mix
Overall the food is good but the atmosphere is lacking
not a cheap burger but they are super tasty Fries were awesome alsoThe last time we went we ordered just the Chicken Nachos and the Tuna Tartar
So overall the duck dish was pretty good but didn't blow my socks off
The meat was tasty sauce was lightly sweet yummmm~+Great serviceCons-Music was not so good and during our three hours there were at least 5 songs probably repeated 3 times
The chicken wings are also great they use Frank's Red Hot sauce
It was meaty moist flavorful and downright grubtastic
The Thai sausage had great flavor but in my opinion could have been spicier but I love spicy foods
If you're feeling lunch-y you can head over to the LGO pizzaria and try the Gladiator which has delicious sausage from Schreiner's Sausage the best in Phoenix
I highly recommend this restaurant especially for some hearty food after a hike on Camelback mountain
The food was mediocre the service terrible and the prices far too high for this lack of quality
The onion rings were boring the frys were boring the chicken nuggets were boring the fish was good and tarter sauce was great
The grilled dishes and the hot stone-bowl rice/egg dish bibimbap come from the kitchen sizzling violently so there's a bit of theater when these dishes are served
Delicious hot steamy falling-out-everywhere chicken
The service has always been good and the food is relatively inexpensive
The meat sampler I had was tasty and it was easier to turn down the cornbread since it looked rather dry
My pizza was fuhgetta 'bout it delicious and perfectly made
ive had dinner here a few times as well and i always find it a great value for the level of service and quality of food
The side dishes which some are included in the Happy Hour are very tasty
The food was fresh non-greasy and delicious
The service is incredibly attentive the atmosphere is rustic/casual-chic and the food is both delicious and reasonably priced
Although the toppings on this pizza were delicious the highlight was really in the dough
I've always thought that what really sets Bianco's pizzas apart from everyone else was the quality and texture of the crust
I find the freshness of their seafood and the pastas pretty amazing
the meat was tender and flavorful like my mamas
They have the usual kid menu with good choices for fruit veggies and everything ranging from mini-corn dogs to pizza
I had the fish tacos which were messy and the salsa verde was finger licking good
It is not fancy but the food quality was very good and the prices reasonable
The ambiance inside the restaurant and the plating of the food is amazing which gave me high expectations of what was to come
The spring rolls albeit look amazing unfortunately do not taste that way
I had the barbeque chicken and my husband had a beef dish with asparagus both were excellent we also ordered a #74 which we took home with us
The springs rolls were good but a little bland
It wasn't spicy at all but it tasted good in comparison to my dish
I ate a Chicken Quesadilla that was perfectly spiced and paired nicely with my virgin margaritas but Spouse was less thrilled about his Lime Chicken Sandwich that he called just ok I'm good with words he's got the looks
Being from Chicago and the fact that I LOVE italian beef sandwiches I've been on the hunt for something worthy since I moved to Arizona about a year ago
I prefer to order my beef dry with extra cheese a side of beef juice and a side of hot peppers
I am a dessert junkie and loved the addition of cotton candy as a pre dessert--it was delicious and fun
Our food came out a good 35-40 minutes after we ordered
Sadly two meals were completely missing in action and the two of us that ordered fajitas which came out of the kitchen very cool not even the slightest bit of heat from the iron skillet or the meat had to wait at least 10 minutes for their tortillas so they couldn't even eat what was at the table which was getting cold
My aunt and uncle think that the place hired a new head chef or something because since they're regulars the food this time around was definitely not worth the bill
Thank goodness for yelp because it has just introduced me to a wonderful love of middle eastern food for CHEAP
The pork belly appetizer was one of my favorite dishes
The radish and ginger was an excellent component to the tuna
The grilled beef tenderloin was excellent and luckily Julie our waitress suggested some sauces for the beef
The Chilean Sea Bass was a nice light protein with a great mi so broth that added a nice flavor to the meat
The food was excellent and the service very friendly and attentive
Unfortunately having tried both variations of their Burger The Delux and The Standard I did discover that the flavor of the Delux comes from the accompaniments and NOT the beef
This comes to light with the Standard as without onions it does lack the beefy flavor one expects from an extraordinary Hamburger
I should have been because the food was AMAZING
My food comes out cold overcooked and overall very bland
It was tasty and actually way too much food
The quality of a location's food seem to be inversely related to the establishments' relationship with children; the more welcome children are the more disgusting the over-glorified snack bar
I'm fairly sure they only purchase food after it's been rejected by the public school system's cafeteria workers due to substandard quality
hmm well at least the food should be good
maybe they were scarce on meat but the slider patties were the size of silver dollars tasty but small
talk about some quality meat dining experience
I personally enjoyed every rack of meat they brought in front of us the chicken was so so but
Good healthy food but it a little expensive for a family
I really like the grilled vegetables and a must is the three hummus with chicken appetizer
Not great not healthy but tasty in that I really want cheap greasy Americanized Chinese food the way I remember eating it in 1985 in suburban Wisconsin sort of way
25 you can get a cup of pretty tasty soup an egg roll wonton and a main dish fried tofu and veggies for me but my friend had the kung pao veggies and they were also good
That's a fair and true statement and given that the food is very good factoring in everything quality of food service atmosphere you get what you pay for but I'm going to give extra credit because this place keeps it real and doesn't try too hard unlike other places
I recall the food was good and the portion size was just right
During our several visits to this location we've had good service excellent people-watching and tasty food
However the quality of the food was just okay
Overall the food was yummy and the atmosphere and service very good
Both the service and the food were excellent
The good part about Teharu is that it is decent quality sushi nothing special for SUPER CHEAP
If you still have room for dessert I highly recommend their pizza cookie
As far as the food I got a bacon cheeseburger that was just not very good
The food is always top notch aside from one busy Saturday night the service has always been pretty good the drinks are strong and you cannot beat the environment
My friend who got the Chicken Parm let me take a little sample sacrifice for the good of a Yelper and I would give it two major thumbs up
The food was good and though I might have had issue with the portion size that could be me just being a large man wanting more of a good thing
Italian food is very easy to make and who could deny Lady and the Tramp as a wonderful representation of Italian romance
Pita Jungle actually makes healthy food taste good which I didnt think was possible
Overall the presentation was good portion size was good service was ok food was ok
I have yet to try their Antipasti platters where you can choose your meats cheeses vegetables and snacks but I heard it is amazing as well
Add that to a delicious meat patty with cheese and lettuce and you have got a killer combo
Besides the delicious food there are other things that keep us coming back to Culinary Dropout
I would love to be able to review the food / drinks for this 'Hot' Spot however I can't
Based on the other reviews it looks like the food is pretty good - but I can say that the management team they have in there is horrible
For the record we did have an excellent meal at CIBO Pizza the night before we were poisoned
I had the pizza and salad the first time and really enjoyed it
Our food came out quick and hot and yummy
Jeff  owner does a fantastic job at not only running a great business but also with the quality of food he prepares for customers and excellent customer service and catering as well
You won't be disappointed in this charming restaurant with quality food and service
After reading all the other yelp reviews I feel almost embarrassed to say that I thought the fish here was extremely fresh and delicious and that I enjoyed all the dishes we ordered
The fun staff more than made up for the 3 star food though and many insisted on getting their own photos with me
But I figured if the food was good we would give it a try anyway
Hubby had the meat lover's scramble which was also tasty - but he was quite jealous of my glorious sandwich
The food was average decent chips good spice level greasy cheese
I like them way more than Panda Express they have huge portions and their food is more flavorful than Panda
Everything I've had here is great; I highly recommend the California salad add chicken; balsamic dressing
The entire thing see photo barely fit into their small pizza box so unless your famished like I was then your looking at tomorrow's lunch also
2 stars for the good food but shitty portions and veteran servers
Won Ton soup was tasty egg roll was not greasy and the shrimp with snow peas had tons of shrimp and snow peas that were cooked perfectly
In the past the food and atmosphere were wonderful
However the taste and quality of the food was just so so
Great place if you are on a budget and starving however if you want quality sushi and willing to pay for it I would look elsewhere
Though I wasn't hungry had eaten on the plane all the food looked wonderful
The food while good missed the mark just a bit
There was nothing flavorful or tasty in that dish
The carrot cake cheesecake dessert was moist and the cheesecake topping was good
The meat was very gristle ridden and almost flavorless
They should strive to be like Charlies in the Atlanta airport and less like an greedy food vendor who doesn't care about quality
The sandwich was OK decent meat really boring baguette and a relatively tasty dressing
I should have backed out when they charged the two of us ten dollars to go on the tour but I had a romantic image of strolling through olive groves and being treated to delicious little olive snacks
The salads soups entree's and pizza are consistently good and the atmosphere is lovely
Even though they use farmed-raised salmon in their salads and the entree it is cooked in a way and with sufficient spices that it tastes pretty good and isn't fishy
All of the salads are wonderful and the pizza is pretty darned good
Some of the desserts look better than they actually are but the brownies are rich and wonderful and the cakes are pretty yummy too
But I will not be waiting for more than 45 min for a table the food just isn't THAT good and life is too short
Shiromi Carpaccio - This dish was excellent
I have so many favorite items but here are few must-tries chicken lettuce wraps I'd been eating these here looooong before so-called fusion joints like PF Chang's had them on their menu sizzling rice chicken sesame chicken Desert Jade chow mein honey-dipped chicken wings any one of their delicious soups
A server should be aware of various dietary needs not all but the most popular certainly and be able to recommend dishes that suit them without missing a beat
She began hesitantly recommending dishes but she was totally unsure as to what was actually in them
We ended up leaving to go to a restaurant that has a good selection of food for everyone and we were happier for it
Filly-B's bathrooms are of questionable cleanliness and the decor is reminiscent of a time when yellow and brown were the shizzle-nit yes I did just say that but that doesn't change the fact that it is dang good food for when you've been out at a
Being the nice Jewish girl that I am I love good Jewish food
Finding this place was the closest thing I could get to good home cooked Jewish food
Truckin' Good Food is by far my favorite part of the Ahwatukee Farmers Market
If you're looking for a classy place with great dinner dishes then this place is highly recommended just please dress accordingly and don't try wearing a hat not allowed
The prosciutto fig and goat cheese pizza was amazing
There food is good but nothing to write home about
The food is pretty good or I was buzzed
The Greek salads with or without meat are wonderful
Overall the flavor of the food wasn't bad but just executed very poorly
Unfortunately the punch card doesn't do much good when the food isn't appealing enough for us to make a return trip
The presentation was very good and the food was delicious
But I still enjoyed it because the food is really good for a bar
Homemade gelato Pascucci coffee and now delicious salads panini and wood-fired pizzas
Seriously the quality of the ingredients in both the salad and the pizza was evident
The place is big and comfy and well over 100 food choices Everything i tried here was very good
The price was good for the quality of food
I went back to my hotel about 3 hours later I had the 2nd worste food poisoning
It's a beautiful restaurant with good food great service and an excellent bar
Limited selection along with low quality of food does not make me a happy person or a satisfied customer
I know that many folks are anti-chain and although Paradise is a chain restaurant their service and food have always been consistently good in my experience
My soup came out piping hot with tons of chicken and shrimp and herbs
I will go back as the food was really good I will just remember to avoid the bathroom next time
We ordered the breakfast burrito banana nutella crepes and the simple breakfast I can't remember what it was technically called - eggs bacon toast The breakfast burrito was a good size and came with a little dish of salsa - I felt it definitely needed the salsa to complete the flavors of the dish the burrito was a little bland but the ingredients were all good The banana nutella crepes were yummy it is hard to complain about nutella for breakfast and the eggs/bacon/toast dish did it's job
The only downer food-wise was the blueberry scone it was a bit dry and not super flavorful
Now perhaps it is one of those places that proudly does NOT encourage children in fact there is actually a sign on the back porch that says unattended children will be given espresso and a kitten which is good natured but still pointed   Anyhow it was a nice spot very picturesque with yummy food and coffee and we will likely go back - perhaps with out of town guests  and when we can leave our peanut with sitters so that we won't have to stress about seating for him
The standards of sesame chicken orange chk fried rice veg spring rolls were all fresh and tasty
The first few times I enjoyed it; the portions were large enough for me to save for another meal and there'd be a lot of chicken to accompany the salad
This place is more of a sit down restaurant with great service and good food
I ordered the mushroom burger which was actually pretty good really rich beef flavor but not worth 12 dollars in my opinion
The chief personally stopped by our table to make sure we enjoyed our food
My favorite appetizer was the roasted chestnut soup and for the main dish the best at the table was the beef short ribs
juicy burgers tasty chicken thick bacon and a kinda sketchy condiment bar with lots o' fun stuff to class up your burger with
My favorite dish is their Dol Sot Bi Bim Bop for the flavor and the price
They do come out with some pretty good bapchan side dishes
Had a good variety of drinks and food and their specialty house drinks were what we tried and they were good
Had dessert which was really good recommend checking that out
75 the service kind of sucks or they could have made 5 stars but because the food was so good i give them 4
I was excited because they rave about how good the food is and the drinks are cheap
the buffet was set outside on the patio where it was freezing so the food was cold and gross
Why would you put uncovered hot dishes outside
I guess starving students are less likely to notice cold food
Makes me wonder how their regular quality and care to food temps is
Service is top notch and the food is the best quality I've found in the state and beyond
In addition to the complimentary bread bowl which comes with my favorite pretzel rolls in town my fave appetizers are their oysters calamari and seafood tower if you're with a group
The tortillas were soft but not soggy the meat was smokey and tender and packed with flavor
A group of friends and I sat at the bar and had good service great wine they have a very eclectic wine list and the food was AMAZING
The food is just as good actually so far a bit more consistent once in a while I got something at Chandler that wasn't as good as I'm used too but so far San Tan hasn't disappointed
granted you probably shouldn't order steak at a pizza joint right I on the other hand went with what they should be good at pizza
I know that may seem stupid but if you know how to cook or  eat good food then you know what I'm talking about
If waiting for two hours for good pizza isn't your thing then drive alittle northwest of Bianco and go to Cibo
Almost never a wait and still really good pizza pie
They have a great little menu here and you get good food for a great price
Seemingly dozens of line cooks doubling as servers seemingly dozens of taps serving wonderful fermented grains and the meat fish and veggie pies - my island ancestors never had it so good
And with the company of my wife I have made an effort to try and flavor every pizza establishment in the valley
The results have been outstanding and the experiences  worth writing in my pizza diaries
We all have different tastes and preferences  so when it comes to choosing the best pizza we try to stick with originality in flavor and  the consistency of its dough
an Italian eatery where local wines are flavored and where people come to have a great time with friends and eat home made dishes Friendly charming and warm Cibo  makes you feel at home eating with your mamma
The owner seemed like a nice guy and the service and food were always good
I LOVE this meat so tender and has outstanding flavor
My husband had the Barbacoa tacos and we were not as impressed with this particular meat choice
I was not at all impressed with this dessert
Every bit as good as the overhyped Pizzaria Biancoand no 3 hour wait
Had a very good mushroom and pancetta pizza and a strawberry and gorgonzola salad
Good food good wine happy staff reasonably priced
Hasian Hot + AsianI love hot Asian food and when you come to unPhogettable that's what you will get
Definitely worth going to and worth the wait to at least try it once but I don't see myself going back anytime soon to get my pizza fix
Most of the food here is decent the eggplant and tofu is a good dish with a side of brown rice
it's pretty much a dessert but I can't help but recommend it as an addition to whatever else you may try here no matter what time of the day it is
Overall Scratch is pretty reasonable for the quality of food you're getting at least for the breakfast menu we had
Good break from the usual Mexican chinese pizza etc
Chicken loses some of its crispiness smothered in gravy but that's a worthwhile trade off
the only reason i even come to this one instead of the one at 32nd & cactus which is just as far from my current house is the food quality is better here i have never really had a 'good' experience here but it's sorta what to expect
Food's good drinks are expensive crowd watching is awesome
As with Roka Akor this place had great style in the decor but the food just was not very good
Both of the sauces were flavorful and balanced but none of the flavors penetrated the meats in the curries
The search continues for good Indian food in my hood
Service was friendly but I don't think the food was worth the cost
The lobster was good however there was hardly any meat
Also I've had inconsistent quality of food and helpfulness of staff on different occasions
The fajitas are excellent I suggest going with chicken or shrimp
But the noise level was just fine the service was very professional and quick but not TOO quick and our food was good
I ordered the beet and citrus salad which was very good except for the parsley which seemed to overwhelm the entire dish and the ravioli of goat cheese tomato and sweet corn
But I do think this is a great fun place to come for dinner with good food and great drinks
Happy hour is a great deal with half off all appetizers 5 dollars for any burger and fries on Mondays after 4pm to close and a stellar menu of comfort food that's still inventive
The chicken pita was good but the garlic potatoes lacked garlic taste to me
Their food is always very good and the drinks never disappoint
Sometimes when you want good food you are going to pay a little bit extra
I really enjoyed the pork taco and loved the fishcakes
Their chicken sa tay and spring rolls are really good as well
We entrusted the quality of our meal to the word of Chris and the small sample we tasted because in my mind the ingredients had no business being together in one dish
Try it if you're in the area and want for the most part feel-good food
I heard the Cinnamon Rolls are amazing-- and as they should be they're 330 calories per serving and one roll is 2 servings
I would eat here every day if I could =]Thanks for the wonderful food and great service
We ordered the Seafood Platter as an appetizer and it was very good
I give this place 4 stars because I haven't tried much of their food but I'm sure it's good and it tends to be super busy every time I stop by which slows the service
The combo of top notch service delicious food and a fab atmosphere has made me an official fan of this place
All the traditional ceviche flavors made it into this dish but the jicama was a delicious and crisp addition to the dish
All in all a nice experience with really good food
The sesame chicken is good the appetizer sampler plate is more than enough food as well
There are no flavor options for the chicken they just come in plain flavor
The chicken tasted pretty darn good - another star
Now once we ordered the food was good and the waitress was on point and by this time they had a 1/4 full house
While you chew on that sentence let me just say the pizza is good
The primary flavor of the sauce it was served just reminded me of canned sweet and sour sauce with fish sauce thrown in for good measure
and it's Sunday MorningFoodI had their mushroomcheddar and scallions Omlette and it was delicious
The meatballs were home made and delicious
Great food good value a really nice place to kick back eat and relax
I had the Chicken Chimi which was excellent
We got the ox-tail my favorite of the meats very tender the goat curry very good too and interesting and the jerk chicken very spicy which was good a little dry otherwise
I also had a Green Corn Tamale A LACarte because that is one of my staple foods and I could get that I thought was a good barometer on a place by ordering this
The food is delicious and the portions are definitely sharing-sized
Had a crispy chicken sandwich pretty tasty a medium burger with cheese and bacon curly fries OK and great onion rings
Food took about an hour about 4 other parties and wasn't great decent at best and of course not worth the amount of money they charge
But honestly I just wasn't that impressed with the $19 pizza I received
It's never too crowded it's never too loud and the food is always good
I didn't see the bathrooms and couldn't comment on that but the food was all  good; first place in a long time the hamburger didn't taste like it had been frozen and microwaved my daughter said it was like at home the Reuben was the size I expected except the herb rye made it better than usual the salad was fresh and they actually had French dressing and the club sandwich was huge it will be dinner later
And while the food is typical of most sports grills burgers sandwiches and fried appetizers for example it's a great place to unwind or to escape the Phoenix heat
Consensus was the food was good and we will probably return
The menu had great choices and our server was extremely helpful with recommendations from appetizers to full meals steak fish & even vegetarian dishes
I highly recommend the chicken lettuce wraps even though this is a Mexican food place they were AMAZING
My friend devoured his pasta in less than 5 minutes and I shortly followed suit with my delicious cheese pizza
There are very few places to eat near the Capitol but La Canasta not only provides a place for a bite to eat but some good food as well
I don't like veggies so I generally stick to the red chili beef burrito which is very good
The service is excellent and the food is good as always
This place is definitely worth a try great ambiance for dates and good food
Prior to zooming on over to Freddy's I just had a small cup of gelato at Angel Sweet prior to that I just finished up a great and filling meal at Big Buddha in Surprise RIGHT AFTER eating sooo much food at Surprise Stadium during the A's and Royals spring training game some sort of bbq sandwich french fries ice cream hot dog etc
Sweets are one thing but a good 'ol greasy savory thing of meat is definitely more appealing to me in the first place
Oh and also they have one order pick-up for the desserty custards and a separate one for the hot food
I like Indulge because the burgers are cooked perfect to taste the meat is very tasty and most importantly there are so many different ways to design your burger that you can never run out of creative ways to make one
The Food - antipasto and focaccia on par with Pizzeria Bianco excellent seafood/crudo and some of the best meatballs and meatloaf in town - all in manageable portions2
Very good offerings and dishes were also flavorful
We ordered the shrimp hot and sour soup white fish 2 orders of the bacon wrapped mint shrimp 2 orders of the sesame tofu napa rolls papaya mango salad vegetable eggrolls lemongrass soy soba noodles and oyster mushrooms
I have been to modern steak more than a handful of times and the food is very good
Their tortelli is delicious the Kobe burger is great and the soups and side dishes are delicious
Dessert was gussied up in looks but was so unsatisfying on the tongue like sweetened whipped canola with pumpkin flavor
The food was hot chicken tasted fresh I think I have made similar at home though
They make seriously delicious Thai tea spring rolls and pumpkin curry
Our meals were exactly as ordered many choices at Cracker Barrel and the food was hot
It was good but I think I am starting to lean toward not being a fan of BBQ pizza the sauce it just too much for me on a pizza
Got it as take out and the food was packed nicely in trays as opposed to the good old chinese box  with a few pieces of meat and 10oz of sauce in them
The appetizers were also half price we tried the sliders crab cakes and chicken quesadilla none of the appetizers were any good we ended up trying a bite and leaving the rest
Everything was delicious as always - the honey hot wings the pizza and the house salad but it was so nice to include an enormous piece of tiramisu perfect to share and we did not ask for it
THANK YOU Upper Crust your consistency in providing not only excellent food but top of the line service will keep us coming back again and again
The seafood gumbo was terrific- very flavorful but not thick and gloopy
That IS a good sign of a good sushi place
I had enjoyed a Roy's Trio [Hibachi Salmon Blackened Ahi and Misoyaki Butterfish with steamed rice and baby bok choy] with a Flirtini on the side
The butterfish supplied an explosion of flavor where I literally closed my eyes during that first bite
They have a rather large menu mostly burgers and sandwiches accompanied by the typical fried appetizer type foods - think mozzarella sticks fried zucchini and mushrooms chili cheese fries the whole bit
Both lunch boat and duet came w/ many components but Mom and I only truly enjoyed the salad the chicken it was good although I couldn't eat much of it the salmon sashimi and the runaway hit beef julienne both off of the boat
The pizza is good old fashioned east coast style
The inside reminds me of the good ol pizza and sub shops that i used to frequent back east
No annoying fast food atmosphereno having to talk to waiters if you're not in the moodjust good quality pizza from a well run establishment
I have only had the pizza so far because it's soooo good
This place is wonderful -- great drink and food menu
I'm looking forward to my next meal at D'licious Dishes because I know it will be - wait for it - delicious
I devoured that amazing dessert with spectacular speed
and the AZ Eggrolls a bit on the greasy side but very tasty and perfect for happy hour
And by judging how delicious the food is it most certainly is
If you aren't in a good mood then don't talk and just get my food
I will tell whoever takes the time to read this review* that the food at this place is 5 star quality
With that said do not be so inclined to not attend this restaurant because the food here really is good
Good service along with good food can't ask for much more than that
It's new and lovely but with all the wonderful Mediterranean food we've grown to expect and love from Pita Jungle
The food is a wonderful fusion of classic/southwest and it is all as healthy as it can be come on how healthy can sausage and loads of butter be
The pizza was not as good as the Scottsdale site
I was very impressed with the large dessert selection that they have; including my favorite tri color cookies
Each bite is infused with Iowa blue cheese and applewood smoked bacon and these flavors enhance rather than overpower the beef
My food arrived cold and the biscuits were hard but the gravy was pretty tasty and I liked the fact that each biscuit had a piece of sausage on it so I had some sausage in every bite
He ate most of his food with no complaints so I think he enjoyed it but he didn't have too many positive things to say either
Although most of these places offer Chicken Tikki Masala & Tandoori Chicken these two dishes here were just amazingly good
It might have been my favorite Tandoori Chicken ever anywhere; so moist juicy & full of flavor
But what's the point of good sauce on rubbish food
The chicken wings were ok but honestly get an A for effort considered they were made without being fried tons of awful polyunsaturated fats vegetable oil The greek salad was very fresh and tasty and the girlfriend I was with really enjoyed her pizza
It was fairly busy for lunch but our appetizers and entree did take quite awhile to come out to the table hence the 4 starsI really do not like pizza at all so I am not much of a critic when it comes to the perfect slice but am very much looking forward to going back to sample more salads and pastas
Pros --  The food is actually really good for pub food
Very good baba hummus felafel pizza veggie burgers Mediterranean platter and lentil salad
I thought the service was very good and a few of the dishes had a lot of flavor
I definitely enjoyed the beef tenderloin and the jack daniel's pecan pie
Overall there were a lot of good things I did try but to me my first and second course should be excellent and the dessert should not be by far  the best course I had
Ok Maggiano's is pretty weak in food and flavor
My beef and broccoli had a nice sauce not what I'm used to at my neighborhood place but quite flavorful without being anything fancy
I'm probably a green rookie when it comes to good curry chicken having only experienced a few places' offerings
Second the food at the Olive Tree is as good as or better than all of the Mediterranean sitdown restaurants I have ever eaten
Because we had to order $50 worth of food with our restaurant
I don't know if the meat on this gyro were made in house but it was excellent
Postscript  The market has a huge selection of mediterranean foods and spices at very good prices
My companion had the duck and while she certainly enjoyed the dish she found the duck slightly fatty
A few chuckles an hour wait sitting in uncomfortable seats in a too warm room with bad food and drinks is NOT worth the $100 or so we spent on the evening
The appetizers that we had were gyoza tuna tempura roll and the calamari
For dessert I also got this amazing coconut caramel flan I totally recommend it if your a coconut fan
The paneer tiki is a wonderful dish as is the saag paneer as they both have amazing paneer cheese with a wonderful flavor and perfect texture
Price well worth the quality especially for a foodie that practically lives at the farmers markets
I've been here several times since my review and have had nothing short of great service huge meals and delicious food
Just a truck load of meat that is hot and fresh and tasty
But if you want a quiet atmosphere with family ran business and some good Thai food
I was not impressed with the cut roll choices; seriously do ALL rolls have to have cream cheese in them
We opted instead for some pot stickers which I admit were very good the crab cakes which were solid but nothing to get in a tizzy about a roll which I can't remember now because it was that forgettable and some yellowtail sashimi that was decent
the pizza is just as good salads and desserts are better atmosphere is better and the longest I've ever waited there was an hour
My girlfriend loves the Philly roll the Vegas roll is one of the better ones I've had and the Damn Good roll is something unique
Unfortunately the times I've been there the food wasn't so good
while their food remains consistently delicious
It is a bottomless plate of BBQ goodness starting with salads ribs smoked brisket smoked chicken and some side dishes
As a big fan of good fresh seafood and never having had a recommendation to eat here I was a bit skeptical when one of my friends chose this restaurant
Next time when I want good seafood I will just head back to Bluewater Grill despite the drive
Maybe it's because I've been to more really good sushi places since then but something just isn't working for me
If you're new to sushi or like the more basic rolls California anything with 'krab'; if your first consideration is the quality of the happy hour prices; or if you feel it's just not 'in' without heavy house music in the background by all means give it a shot
I always get the chicken focatta which is amazing
the frozen mini pizzas are pretty good
I was immediately impressed when I saw the wood-fired pizza oven
The pizza had really excellent flavor and I was very impressed with the quality of the meatballs
The other dishes and appetizers were really expensive so we didn't get anything else
But it was damn good unique Italian interpretations heads and shoulders above what passes for most pizza these days
dd or cab itI don't know how the food is now but years ago I had a seafood appetizers there and it made me violently ill and I haven't had it since
The burger is worth it for five bucks on Monday the fries are awesome the drink specials are mediocre the atmosphere I found a bit stuffy and unfriendly the menu is all over the place with no solid direction or theme and the totally modern contempo art deco bullshit bathrooms make me roll my eyes while I pee
I can appreciate some hip little lounges where people go out to be seen and maybe pretend that the food is amazing; but The Vig is like the douche bag dude you see driving a BMW with his top down even though it's 6 a
The Chicken salad was good finely chopped chicken pineapple and slivers of almond  and a bit of mayo
It's a little expensive to eat here I think but the food is just so tasty
This is my go to dish on a  hot summers day my mouth is watering right now just thinking about the cool crisp deliciousness
The spring roll were amazing probably some of the best I have had in the valley
The sesame chicken was GOOD still crispy somehow and white meat really sticky
I enjoyed it even if it seemed more like a crispy honey chicken to me
The fried fish was also good they had some tartar sauce at the end of the line
No one loved their meal and a couple peoples food came out cold mine was not smoking hot but definitely edible
can't beat healthy tasty food and fabulous service
The meat quality was not great in fact the majority of my beef was just cartilage
But with noodles so good I didn't look to having meat to distract me
I read a review on this place by Arizona Republic food critic Howard Seftel and it sounded so good I had to check it out for myself
The rest of my inlaws were mixed on their reviews of dishes lobster Mac - okay fish and chips - pretty good steak tacos - no
Prices have remained high but food quality and atmosphere have taken a major tumble
The risotto could have been a bit more flavorful but it was a good mild side to the spicy fish
My wife had the chicken street tacos and they were pretty good also
Give yourself some time if you eat at Carly's because the service can be on the slow side but the food is worth the wait
For dinner we had the crab stuffed chicken which was very good and the Bolognese with Ricotta Dumplings
This dish was amazingly good - unfortunately it had been removed from the menu for some reason by the time we got back for our second visit
Have tried a few other dishes including the chicken and dumplings which were pretty good
Overall the food and drinks are ok but the service and ambience make this a place i commonly recommend to checkout
I had the bone in Fillet and it was AMAZING my girlfriend had the Arctic Char and it was great we split a side of sautu00e9ed mushrooms that were very good and huge quantity and the drinks and dessert were great
Like i said - i didn't walk away thinking any of the food was bad or gross except for the tzatziki but i didn't walk away impressed either
The manager came over and gave a whole spiel about how they've had a really tough time finding quality organic antibiotic-free chicken breasts that are reasonably priced so that's why they're serving this awful thing
My lunch experience today was so over-the-top wonderful and the food was so freaking perfect not even cynical and possibly silly personal philosophies can make scale down my praise
I would not recommend Armitage for the horrible customer service and mediocre food
This was recommended to me by a friend and so I went and tried the chicken katsu bento
I was less than impressed with the treatment of the roll so I won't be getting anything from their sushi menu again
The Cajun-inspired fried chicken is juicy with a crispy skin and just-right flavorings
The new owner's added sushi which is made to order is fresh and very tasty
The chicken is moist and tender with a nice smoky teriyaki flavor
The food was quite good they actually had real grilled focaccia and this garlic cream butter that was delicious
I wasn't expecting the Broasted Chicken could be so awesome it wasn't greasy at all and you could still taste the flavor of the meat even it's fried
I had the lunch Spicy Noodles with chicken and it was just as good as anything I've had at the Tempe location
I could stay with one star but the thin crust for a pizza is worth a 2nd star
The last time I came to this place was over 5 years ago and they had good food and good service
I forget the name of the pizza I ordered but like I said PAINFULLY good
It's a pretty good date spot and the prices are reasonable especially considering the caliber of the food they serve
The food is amazing here and I can't complain about one thing
So Rokerij I will give you another shot as we love your food and atmosphere but we hope you will pay attention to your service and really make this an unforgettable dining experience
Desserts were good but looked better than they tasted
The food amazing and the atmosphere makes you feel like a million bucks or 6 hehe
If you can live with the just okay food the rest of it makes Salty worth the trip
For dessert we ordered the Churros which were amazing
The food is anything but fast food quality
I've been here numerous times and the pizza is always delicious
The food is oh so tasty homemade tortillas are addictive
I often stop halfway through consuming my 1/2 pound chicken fajitas with extra seasoning to thank the heavens for the food before me becuase it's THAT good
I usually always get a seafood noodle dish Nagasaki Sara Udon or Yaki Udon and am always delighted at the flavors and large portions
The sushi nigiri is pretty standard-- I highly recommend the binnaga if only for that savory fried garlic topping and the spicy hotate [scallop]
For rolls the Hawaii roll particularly stands out and the Blue Moonlight's pretty good
Overall I'd definitely recommend Sapporos if you're in the mood for a non-casual sushi-filled meal
Ive been hearing from numerous friends that Short Leash Dogs serve amazing food but Ive always missed them
I don't know what the chicken was marinated in but was so juicy and flavorful; it tasted entirely different than any other Greek Kabob I've had
I also tried some of the beef kabob and would highly recommend that as well
Maybe they will iron out some of they service issues the food is still good although the menu is a bit tired - or I may just be tired of it
The big difference to me between Goldie's and Zipps is the quality of food and sometimes the service
I like consistency fresh flavorful foods and nice people in a relaxed setting
5 stars for the food but we'd be back for more good times on the outdoor back patio
Though the staff was very friendly and I can dig the cute gal at the counter   Let's talk about the food mmmmm the pull pork sandwich is amazingly awesome
I have tasted the chicken schwarma sandwich again another tasty delight on the menu
The fish was cooked perfectly and had great flavor
The seafood was overrun by mayo and had no flavor
If you'v visited different regions in Mexico besides Baja Rocky Point and Cancun you'll appreciate the regional dishes at this restaurant and the inventive use of ingredients and crazy flavors
We were surprised by the quality and quantity of the children's spaghetti with meat sauce
Husband nearly inhaled the sausage pizza and the one slice I managed to steal from him was full of flavor
It had sage and a very slight drizzle of balsamic - a great compliment to the other flavors of the pizza
The Potato/Blue cheese/Pancetta pizza was also good but not quite as spectacular as the first one
The donuts for dessert were pretty good as well
several times and the food has been consistently good
Prices are a little high for comparable food at regular joints but you pay for better food quality and fresh ingredients
As for the food it was light fresh and delicious
For me I ate a ton - appetizers entree and dessert and I never really felt full like I would had I devoured a regular restaurant meal
The hot tea fresh food and a relaxing atmosphere were a great way to finish what was a long day at the office earlier
The place is clean the food is good the prices are reasonable specials appear to be a daily thing here and the service is pleasant and quick
I liked the inside decor I liked the fact that they have photos of the rolls that you can order
the rolls were good the seats were comfortable
My favorites were the grilled squid salad warm and so tasty the mahi mahi tacos and the plantain with black bean side dish
I live really close to Cafe Wasabi and I had heard good things about the restaurant from friends so I was hoping CW could be my go-to neighborhood sushi place
I tried the breakfast once the hot food was eh and you're better off driving to Denny's for some cheap eats
In all I wasn't all that impressed but the menu showed promise and perhaps next time I'll be a little more adventurous in my selection as long is isn't just thrown on the plate because going out isn't all about the food it's the experience as well
I had the spinach artichoke chicken flatbread pizza as an aussie-tizer and it was AMAZING
The food was outstanding as ever 10 oz Strips are delicious and the perfect size
Each time I've enjoyed the flavor of the meat Pork and Chicken but the sauce and the sides just kill it for me
Overall the meat is very good and would be the only thing that I would order
Actually I don't mind spending money if the food is worth it in fact my favorite local seafood restaurant is Wildfish not inexpensive
Even at good restaurants my food was at least comparable in quality
Since I travel a lot and love spicy food I frequently try to search out unique and tasty places
You come here for good food at a decent price with no signifigant hassle
The pizza looked delicious but we're saving it for dinner
Their sandwich bread is a little artisan for my taste artisan translates to dry and stale as far as I'm concerned but they use quality meats and cheeses
It was pretty flavorful but the meatballs were far from what I'm used to
Bottom line is this place is in an area you would expect to find some good cheap authentic tacos but what you get is some beautiful delicious food and great ambiance
It is one of a few gastro pubs in the Scottsdale area and the food is consistently good
- the salsa that came with the chips tasted generic and canned- the menudo was a quarter chunk of a potato half of a carrot cut in two and some blobs of flavorless beef- the mexican pizza was soggy and chewy no not in a good way- the green corn tamale covered in chilli sauce is the only thing that made me think the kitchen can be betterLa Fonda Del Sol is a place that I pass by a lot
The Chicken Katsu is delicious tender & juicy on the inside & crunchy on the outside
we both agree that this isn't the highest quality food but man you get one hell of a plate lunch here
I've enjoyed picnics the way too go the food is not that great and it's expensive birthday parties and scavenger hunts here
The dessert was a Chocolate Espresso cake also very good
All the food was cold and was NOT FRESH at all
Service is great and fast and food is delicious
I think the price was a little high but I would rather pay more for good quality food than buy something off the dollar menu these days
Since I am in Arizona I thought I'd get some quality Mexican food
Others had bucatini think a thick spaghetti with a little bite with meatballs - simple and delicious
Its worth the parking headaches and the food is top notch
I like all of their pizza combos and think they are all worth trying
All-in-all a good place and worth your time if you like a thinner floppy pizza with high quality toppings
The meat used in the burger is fresh and high quality and they cook it to your specification
The brisket was likely my favorite followed by the pulled pork and chicken then the ribs which weren't amazing but still good
Service is usually pretty good although the last time I went and brought friends our waitress was all over the place and we waited a long time for our food
I like the Kang Keo Wang a mix of chicken you choose which meat and vegetables in a delicious green curry sauce
Each dish was flavorful and my fish was cooked to perfection
They have a good variety of food on their menu so there is something to suit every taste
Things you might not know about ZuZu- most ingredients sourced locally- much of the produce is organic and bought seasonally from local farms- 95% of everything made from scratch in the kitchen including their awesome dinner rolls- pei mussels flown in fresh 3 times a weekSeriously seriously good place
Also everything is extremely high quality from the fresh produce all the way to the awesome desserts
It's great tasting pizza with delicious sauce fresh toppings and thin crusts that do not leave you bloated with dough
Great flavor in the meat tender and juicy and enough slaw on top to give it a a nice tang and add texture
Simple words Food is absolutely delicious but the water is horrible
This could have been a five star experience but I still give it 4 stars for great service and excellent flavors of food
The flavors went deep into my grilled fish and I felt like I was eating nothing but flavors
My friend's beef dish was tender juicy and full of wonderful flavors
The presentation was beautiful and the food tasted just as good
The fish was delicious and I loved the fresh combination of avocado cabbage and sauce a perfect compliment to the 90+ heat outside
The service has always been good and the food has always appeared quickly after ordering
Sorry Joe today was a huge disappointment I took our friends from pennsylvania here today for breakfast telling them how great your establishment is we went and ordered and had a seat our breakfast came in a reasonable amount of time unfortunately to start with I ordered the sausage gravy and got the two turkey sausages not a big deal but my guests egg were barley warm so she sent them back to be rewarmed as they took her eggs I took a bite of my eggs to find them the same as well as the potatoes so when the wait person returned with the rewarmed and now a bit dry eggs I sent my breAkfast  back and waited a good 5minutes for my breakfast to return put down in front of me and watched the waitress scoot away briskly just to find the eggs and potatoes still the same temp as when I sent them back and now the sausage gravy she brought me earlier had cooled down  the guy next to us was going through the same issues after he sent his dish back he got up about 7or 8minutes later to go find where his breakfast had disappeared to
this place has some seriously tasty pizza
I picked up a pizza from here the other day and it was very good it was a saucy pizza which is the way I prefer it and the sauce was very flavorful a little sweet but not too sweet
The chicken was a tender as could be and the flavor was out of this world
the burgers are phenomenal the beefs are amazing
For the price and the amount of food you get it's a pretty good deal
I think the chicken was good and everything else on it was good but once I bite into it and I tasted the texture and flavor of the pear I was confused
We found the food to be delicious [roasted eggplant oregano chicken caprese sandwich a glass of malbec]; the server was knowledgeable courteous and professional
The appetizers were well portioned I got the sweet potato fries and the others got calamri and other fishy foods that I don't eat
The salmon was so delicious I ended up ordering the Swedish cured salmon sandwich complete with a sweet dill mustard dressing
I have to be honest here - I wasn't that impressed with the food
As a good excuse to support a local business and try a new dish without putting a big dent in my wallet I gave Cafe Afify a visit and ordered the special-- a meat patty w/ some sort of brown sauce and a side of rice
Hubby surprised me with a happy hour outing recently and we landed on a stool at Durant's bar mid-week where we enjoyed the finest blended Old Fashions delicious beef sliders packed with pickles on a pretzel bun and fried mushrooms that are like nothing you've ever tasted before I know you're thinking but they're just fried mushrooms
The Crab Louie salad is what you expect as is the Chicken Caesar the French Dip is amazing rivals Houston's and save room for the Strawberry Shortcake which is just enormous and looks boring but somehow you inhale it all
I've however never had an aversion to pungent seafood aromas so it's all good with me
I've always had a thing for grocery stores the aisles and aisles of food shiny jars of canned goods fresh produce boxes of sugary cereals frozen delicacies
I am eager to cook savory Asian dishes at home now I all I need is to find a really good cookbook and buy a wok
They have a great menu with fair prices and a good amount of food to fill just about anyone up
I don't always have time to blow 20 minutes on my lunch to go here but when I do I always get really good food
Their red chili is rich with chunks of beef combine that with their delicious beans wrapped in a tortilla that's large enough to be a baby blanket topped with enchilada sauce cheese and scallions and you have a meal that good enough to slap your nana over
no they dont have delivery but the food is definitely worth the effort of take out or dine in
But we always order fried tofu with special sauce delicious silken tofu with an extremely light batter and a sweet/spicy dipping sauce steamed fish sauteed snow pea leaves salt and pepper pan fried shrimp
If you want expensive and good pizza there are many good alternatives
I did enjoy my dinner the food was better than good
I got a side order of beef  taco which was good
And that says a lot cuz I can handle a lot of hot food
All I can think of is how treatfully delicious their larger-than-life muffins are how scrumptious their cookies are and how wonderfully filling their selections like the tuna melt and wood fire pizza are
Whether I'm in the mood for a cup of coffee a full breakfast lunch an afternoon snack a sweet tooth craving a delicious pizza or a bottle of wine; LGO is my go-to spot
There truly is something magical about a small bundle of fried chicken and a short stack of waffles drowning in a sea of syrup butter and a little hot sauce
I didn't get to try any of their other stuff although literally everything on the menu sounded delicious but then again what soul food dish doesn't
I went in for a lunch and other than a kid's birthday party there weren't many people there so I didn't have any of the long waits or loud guest that apparently plague this location but I don't know if that would have affected my opinion because the food was just too good
We had refills before asking cold beer and plenty if yummy food
I know it is a bar and the food was good but there wasn't much for someone who wants healthy fare
The food is good but the cafeteria style service doesn't help when you're paying $10 for a pastrami sandwich and $7 for a kosher Hebrew National
To hate this place based on the quality of the food is like hating McDonalds - you know what you're gonna get so you can't really hold it to a higher standard
The portions and quality of food and presentation has changed within the last five or six months
It's good food and your standard Arizona-style fare
We were given good service good drinks and good food
The staff has improved as has the quality of food
The meat was cooked close to correctly but lacked any real flavor
The food is unbelievable worth what they are asking
It's a good intro to Vietnamese flavors and without the food poisoning hehe
The only reason this place gets three stars from me is because the food is pretty darn good
1 a pizza chain that will remain unnamed finally opened up shop and started delivering to our neck of the woods and 2 we discovered a gourmet organic pizza restaurant that really delivers the flavor I was hoping to find at Grimaldi's
Overall the food was good the staff was friendly the place was very clean and locals must like it too because there was a steady stream of people picking up orders
A little pricey for my tastes but wonderful food
-good service-wine list-full bar indoor/outdoor-patio-valetBoth times I have been there I ordered and Iced Cafe Mocha to go for the stroll home
I had the Pesto Chicken Sandwich and wow I was impressed
Good luck to anyone wanting to be served and wanting clean food

I am giving them a so so rating because the service is usual less than good and the food is not the best
Ken had a homemade-meatball  sub with more of that good marinara and some provolone
The slaw on the New Yorkers was delicious as was my whole wheat sub roll
Other food items available Hebrew National hot dogs in several styles $2
I don't know how Dennis and Steve manage to turn out food of this quality for so little money but I surely do hope they continue and prosper
This pizza is quite filling and if you want something that wont weight you down like kim kardashian's backside then i highly suggest the good ole Margherita pizza which comes mozarella and basil
It's pretty basic but it doesn't really matter how simple food is as long as the ingredients are fresh and it tastes good
We tried the chopped salad the stuffed mushrooms and the veal meatball appetizers
What this place does not have is good transportation within the different and spread out areas like a trolley or golf carts etc
But I'm learning that while those are their strengths it's the flavor of the food that's lacking
Don't get me wrong the food is not bad by any means it's ok or good but it's not great
Too bad too because it mostly covered up the flavor of what appeared to be  a nice smoky meat and left a sticky sweet aftertaste instead of nice smoky BBQ
The food runner took away or forks as he cleared the appetizer plates and delivered the sandwiches but did not come with new so we had to flag down our server and wait for forks as lunch cooled
And on my third trip I went for the hot dog and it was outstanding  Have yet to be disappointed by the food at Freddy's
'  She says We are not serving any hot food tonight and any of the sushi that contains tempura a fried breading is not available however edamame and miso soup are still available
The current restaurant is not a laid back family friendly and yet a bar all at once restaurant that serves an unending array of crazy good sandwiches/salads/etc - the current decor is pretentious and the food matches that
It's nothing that exciting from an ambiance perspective but the food is good not great it does the trick and won't break the bank
Its a bit more on the expensive side for Chinese food but you have to understand that I usually demand cheap good eats but overall I think the food is worth the slight premium
I recommend the French style beef cubes snow pea leaves and walnut shrimp
And the service is a bit lackluster but the food is what you go for and the food is good
Start off with a Dos Equis Amber get some nachosthis vegetarian WILL eat the niblets of chicken in them nachos cuz it's just that tasty and kick back
Albiet the food tastes good just when I go out for Thai I am looking for some spicy food
Cherry roll i do it without sauce octopus anything with their eels i love the quality of salmon as well
There are so many good places to get Greek food in Phoenix
Too bad the food was not good enough to get me to return
The food here is typical bland and uninspired which is sometimes good when you just don't want any surprises
The margaritas were of questionable quality I learned to stick to the Dos Equis and the food was meh
The bread beef and melting cheese was good and the Au Jus sauce has flavor
Salsa and Chips - Flavorless and in short supply as we waited for our mealService - Slow on refills of drinks and in food delivery - Isn't Mexican supposed to be quick
Yes the wait for the food was a good 15 minutes
The meat was juicy tender and seasoned perfectly and the tzasiki was amazing- complemented the meat beautifully
The restaurant it self is big and very well decorated and the food was good
The trays that stood out the most were Keema MatarChicken Makhnisome kind of potato and cabbage dish and the naan was very good as well
For those who don't eat hamburgers or hot dogs there are decent chicken and vegetarian options including portabellas; as far as I can tell the menu online doesn't show page 2 of the menu which has these options
Sonora chicken sandwich is particularly good; buns are quality and hold together well
The waffles are amazing I believe they have a bit of cinnamon in them and the friend chicken is goodness in your mouth
I keep going back so that's got to say something however there aren't many other options in Central Phoenix so that doesn't hold a TON of weight per se  I've been going here off and since they opened and the food is pretty good
The rolls are average nothing to write home about by home I mean Seattle so I guess I could be a bit bias  Overall this place is pretty good for the area but it is a bit on the high-price side
We finally have found a place with delicious creative sushi
This was my favorite experience of all time because Alan educated us on the different type of rolls he was making the types of fish and their descriptions and even how to select a good avocado at the grocery
Their bleu cheese chips buffalo chicken foccacia and tenderloin sandwich are also good
I did try their ribs and chicken combo once and it was pretty good but I'm not fond of their pizzas
The food was great our guests were able to go to the regular hotel bar in stead of our cash bar for drinks credit card users and we received a free suite for our wedding night
Thank you once again to Schreiner's for the wonderful meat products
Happy hour prices are good rolls are cheap but not worth the service tradeoff
The food is fresh local if not directly from the farm and very good
I've eaten all the veg items they've happily eliminated meat from anything I asked and everything is good
The food is slow and average on a good day
The crab wontons chicken lettuce wraps and dynamite shrimp are my favorite appetizers
I don't eat sushi but damn do I love to drink copious amounts of alcohol oftentimes mixed with other types of alcohol to create delicious alcoholic concoctions in my belly
Manager Rebecca is especially hospitable and drops by our table every so often to inquire about our days and the quality of our dishes
At Poppa Maize you can actually customize that tri-flavored tin into a gift that your foodie receiver is sure to appreciate
If you are a middle aged person who has a family skip this place even though the food is good
That being said when I want to find some great produce and a good butcher shop selection of meat I head to Sprout's
I actually enjoyed my grilled cheese basically a cheeseburger with everything but the meat and those strangely addicting fries I really couldn't stop eating
The menu suggests putting hot sauce and maple syrup on the chicken and waffles
I've also had the fish sandwich and a salad here and they were just as high quality and wonderful as their burgers and fries
Now I've been rather hungry from a good wet Italian Beef and I wasn't disappointed at all
Will I return sure will especially when a craving for good wet Italian Beef returns I will have to try something else on the menu sometime but the IB is what they are famous for and I can see why
unless I can't pull myself away from the wafting scent of Panda Express Orange Chicken but that is another reviewTheir chicken walnut salad sandwich is my favorite served on a delicious honey wheat bread
We had the recommended chicken skewers hawaiian sauce plus mangos/pineapples--TASTY the beef egg roll I'd pass on this
a weird mixture of flavors and textures and the fried rice my favorite of the three--you could taste the wok-fried flavor and the mixture of meats veggies rice and seasonings was actually quite perfect
4 stars for good relaxing atmosphere great service good tropical drinks and good food
I can't understand how anyone could like Red lobster if you know what good seafood is
I was born and grew up with family from Baltimore Maryland where good seafood is what the city is about
I was excited to try it as I love seafood but my food just was not good
We had the bruschettas listed in my last review but subbed the tomato one for the pepper-crusted steak and horseradish so good
The restaurant was packed but there wasn't really a wait and it never effected the quality of the service and I have to say the food was pretty tasty
It seemed mildly pricey for the portions but the food was definitely good
Cheap good food drew me in and I'm a sucker for fish tacos
50 but well worth it with all the meat that's piled on there
the cons a the meatball is too small and lacked flavor
Owner  the food is not that great   I feel like nothing had ANY flavor whatsoever and every time I've eaten there I've waited for about an hour for my food
the food is good but because they are always so over crowded and busy their service is extremely slow
So together you got a bland mushy eggroll wrapped in a flavorless wonton wrapping
Los Sombreros is hip and fun with a great bar wonderful tequila and a nice outside seating area combined with some of best food I have tasted
I had a Salmon BLT which was unreasonably good since it was Arizona and I was eating fish
The service was very slow and when our food finally arrived half of our group was given a cold meal
;We started off with the king crab appetizer and a cold beef tenderloin that had a killer spicy ponzu sauce -- awesome presentation and both very impressive
We also had the lotus on fire roll and it was HOT
All in all I would recommend this place if you are going for sushi and having a good time in a cool atmosphere
Before I forget the table bread basket seeded dinner rolls and lavosh was good especially the seeded rolls
The high grade fish was seared perfectly the guacamole was good as was the pico
The chopped salad was good but the main meatloaf entree tasted like spotted donkey
Their food is all island inspired with a hearty collection for seafood based appetizers pupus and mains as well as some other island inspired selections such as Duke's Luau Pork Plate
Our food was well flavored especially my wife's fish tacos
Not my normal stop I usually go for fattening and strong flavors  Great place to have some pasta pizza and wings
I tried two appetizers to get the ball rolling
I also tried the homemade meatball appetizer
The food here is tasty the service has always been friendly even the bouncers that garner so many complaints
I decided on the Short Rib Barbacoa tacos because of the amazing short rib dish at Fuego Bistro; they were fantastic
Everything from the brisket to the pulled pork and even the BBQ egg roll appetizer thingy's thingy is the technical name were all tasty and gone before they knew what happened
on the other hand the chicken is quite tasty
I'm a fan and GOODBYE to all the other fast mexican food
It is a normal breakfast place with a lot of good choices for breakfast and cheap for the amount of food you get
Not because the non-red meat items aren't good but really why bother
I have tried the one on Bell road for lunch and they maintained the comfort food quality and huge quantities at a great price
The salsa is indeed quite good and the chicken tacos while a little on the greasy side are worth the trip
Other things you can eat from thererotisserie chicken--still the best I've foundfrench feta cheese--creamy and delicioustheir kirkland whole grain bread--no hf corn syrup and 5g of fiber per sliceall of the meals in the back that you just throw in the oventheir pecanstheir strawberriestheir winestheir kirkland vodkatheir buttercream cakes OMGtheir big ass bags of mexican cheese blendsetc
The food was just ok but it was worth it for the atmosphere
Amazing food local artist theater and the final procession
No Fish Called WandaBy The RueWhat's there not to like about Wanda's I have the hot's for that chick LaFondaKip rides the bus doesn't drive a HondaAnd Shelby takes a bath with Rhonda
My friend went with the southwest chicken clubIt came on sourdough and wasn't a subThey don't serve beer it isn't a pubJust a good place that makes good grub
I have enjoyed many different dishes here
Estimates say that the pizza industry is worth somewhere around $30 billion dollars annually with over 60000 pizzerias in the U
I was actually surprised as to how good the pizza really is here
They said no because theyre flavors were expertly paired and the dishes were already made
The bartender brought me out to menu items that I did not order and tried to convince me that i ordered them The spring rolls could have been good if the plantains were actually sweet
Otherwise the food was really good - bacon wrapped dates flatbreads ravioli served family style beet salad and hummus
I know a friend who told me that he didn't like the food here but as for me contrary to what he told me when I tried it for the first time with my family I found out it was quite good
I think my brothers and everyone else also enjoyed the food here
I don't remember the names of dishes that we ordered but I just remembered they were nice tasty and hot and filled me up till I was so full I could not walk anymore
Los Olivos is an absolute fun place to eat some good Mexican food yummy salsa and well prepared Margaritas
It's not one of those commercial Sysco Foods brand stuff but home made and very good
also every bite of fish I tried was dry except for the cold fish selection
I only tried one  beef meat that came fresh from the cook unloading it on the buffet so I grabbed it and it was fresh and cooked nice  but not flavored well
The best hot meat I tried was the dark chicken the only one that was actually good
For what I paid the food was quite good and plentiful
Maybe it was the beer light reflecting off the gases of Jupiter but this was not a tasty cut of meat
The peppered crust was there to overpower and make up for the lack of tasty beef
We had the parm & Garlic pretzels Hummus and meatball appetizers
-crab cake appetizer-caesar and wedge salad- hong king style sea bass- bbq trout- crab fried rice- asparagus- truffled mac and cheeseThe crab cake was more meat than filler
The skin was perfectly crisp the fish still moist and very flavorful
I haven't seen this dish since vacationing in Hawaii and it was rediculously good
For an entree I had this creamy coconut tofu dish which was savory and equally as tasty as the edamame
On a more positive note I will say that the Food was good and delivered to my table timely
The food here is good not outstanding
there is a Cold Stone directly next door for dessert
I always get the vegetarian sandwich and it's delicious but my mom always opts for the roast beef and she absolutely loves that
And if you like dessert get the chocolate or carrot cake- they're both excellent
It took quite a while for our food to come out but it was really good when it arrived
The quality of the pizza is disappointing when compared to the quality of their sandwiches
However the pizza is still great as well as affordable and the atmosphere at this place is even better at night especailly on an amazing night like last Friday
The food held its integrity in the packaging and was 95% as good as if I was sitting on the Pita Jungle patio enjoying it with a glass of wine and about to head to the Gelato Spot for dessert
The food was good though and maybe I just came on an off day
I ordered the chicken curry mild which had a lot of flavor and even a little bit
Anyway the food that did come out was hot tasty and abundant
Both dishes were incredibly good and satisfying but not too much for a workday lunch
This place has an awesome vibe to it great food and wine and good service
I'm always searching for quality food at a fair price for lunch
But the food really is wonderful--what I have had so far so it's worth it
that's the only possible explanation I can logically think of to wrap my head around how Mexican food can be this good
There are tons of treats for the people who don't cook Asian food or high-quality imported needs for those who do
It was not glopful of mayonnaise the chicken was flavorful the bread was scrumptious and I do not use that term lightly
Then one Sunday morning we were watching one of those Top 10 Hot Dog shows on the Food Network or Travel Channel
The meat melts in your mouth the flavors yes I've had them more than once are distinct for each
I usually alternate between two dishes when I eat there- I've had the Suro Watt which is chickpeas in some kind of sauce really good and Begerdan eggplant with bell peppers
It was really tasty - even if it was made with beef instead of lamb
How the staff behind the line can pump out delicious dishes like the best pad thai I've ever had present each plate in something resembling high art and not explode despite a fast-food pace is beyond my meager understanding
Of course we only tried a sampling of their dishes but I'll bet that everything is delicious
Tender pieces of stewed carrots and beef grace the rich and complex flavors of the dark and tasty brew
For food like this a little shady is worth the drive
I come here too often to write a unbiased review   It is good food great service 80 percent of the time and just a great place to bring friends family and out of town folks to
I had their chicken tortilla soup and it was good
I hear good things about their burgers too if you got a sweet tooth check out their bread pudding for dessert
It is the personality of the owner that shines through the great flavorful food
Yes I am somewhat addicted to this place but it's easy to understand why and I am confident that it will become one of your favorite restaurants to savor a delicious artisan pizza
I had been looking forward to getting to Iruna and experiencing what I thought would be an experience to all the good food service and times once had at Sol Y Sombra
The food was good - some dishes were great and some were not good at all
Overall I didn't hate it; but I will not be back again since there are other Mexican joints closer to my house that have the same boring food so it really is not worth the drive for me
Fast food is fast food and it's never good or healthy
Because it was concert night we only order appetizer and a meatball soup which I absolutely love
If you are a fan of Vietnamese delicacies I would recommend that dish
Salads were good Pizza was good if a little rubbery
I enjoyed the beer and the food was average but definitely homemade so I would say the quality is good a little bland but nbd instead of ketchup we got some tomato blend
This might be forgivable if the food was amazing but it wasn't
We finished our appetizer not what I expected- a little soggy but tasty and our party was still waiting for their food
The menu is tasty enough but this is a place for bar food and not necessarily a special trip for dinner
and if its to expensive go eat somewhere else thats in your budget and stop ranking on a place that serves good fresh quality food
maybe its just that your to use to eating sandwiches from subway and pizza from dominoes and sucking back some cold keystones
It was pretty oily but isn't that what makes food so good
The food was filling not really expensive and tasty to my tastebuds
All the foodstuff I ordered was correct and delicious but the pricing and convenience factor are so awful I can not recommend this place
The food was really good and so I started with the 3 but as I wrote the review I became increasingly angry with the pricing and closing time attitude
I really enjoy Paradise Bakery but since Panera Bread took them over it has lost its charm and the quality of the food offered has been reduced to the Chain food that Panera sells
The special Smashfries tasted like good pizza
But on top of their delicious mojito selection the food was simply the best
My only comment after this amazing meal would be this - All of the food was amazing but I probably shouldn't have started with the Lobster Civiche
Food garlic bread was dry minestrone was fabulous dressing on salad was tasty too
Oh and as fast food goes its pretty good
I had their  Cinnamon  roll French toast and thought it was delicious
it was so good that even if I went again I'd seriously consider getting it again despite the fact that my friend rattled off at least 5 other dishes that she said were equally as delicious
I also tried my friend's chicken enchiladas which were good but which I personally thought didn't hold a candle to the tastiness of my pork
For dessert we went all-out with the churros and I can honestly and without any hesitation say that I've never had a churro that delicious in my life
- Taco I subbed black beans in for the meat and overall it was a good taco
Staff took fantastic care of us and the food was tangy and tasty
Food what I've had was good though the grilled cheese is a little overpriced
The food is good though limited and I'm not a huge fan of them now outsourcing their baked goods
The food was good though I like the southwest seasoning that you can put on it
The food here is as quality as I've had with mexican
Save room for dessert because the Mexican chocolate cream pie is simply amazing
But the pizza is so good it almost makes up for it
The soup salad and chicken are all excellent but the fried rice is the absolute best
If you like teppen yaki and don't want to deal with the bland food they serve at Benihana definitely give this place a shot
Now I am not a small appetite and it may be because the food is super good but the only downfall is the size of the tacos
You will find 8-10 entree dishes + salads chutney and desert waiting for you that has all been consistently fresh hot well prepared and thankfully light on the heavy cream that all Indian places pour into every dish to make the um
My smoked salmon starter lacked flavor and pizzaz
It was just not the quality of fish a 5-star restaurant should be presenting
The food is really good and they don't just have desserts
I forgot- they also have dessert panini's that looked amazing too
We ordered pasta meat loaf and pork chops which were all really good and the portions were really hearty
This is a family owned local establishment with a long history of good food and excellent service
Ran back to try the chicken Wow I am not really a white meat person but it was warm tender juicy and flavorful
My tip-off should have been the Guy Who Saw Me Reading The Menu and came outside to tell me the food was good
I've tried many dishes here and they are all so good
Some friends ordered food and they said it was good but i only tasted the potatoes yummy
good salmon is much too subtle to be paired with a sweetness of dessert proportions
The BF went and picked up food from PF changs tonight because we had a gift card and I still can't go out due to coldy fluish yuck disease
Food is good atmosphere comfortable service decent price reasonable
Madai is a wonderful fish that I rarely get to have but then it was overly smothered in oils and other sauces and hid the flavor of the fish
I almost wanted to give this place three stars for it's shortcomings but it was such good quality fish preparation and service that I couldn't deny it another
As far as cost- you can get out of there for $40 for 2 and have a good meal or you can get the higher end dishes which will run you a bit more
Be ready to take your cholesterol pills because this place doesn't hold back on the fatty substances and such but the food is good for what it is
The Buffalo Chicken triangle thingy appetizer was different and tasty
Tucked away on the side a seemingly endless strip mall Little Sicily is truly a hidden gem and definitely worth a try if you're craving pizza in its purest form
Nice atmosphere and good service but there is better Italian food to be found in Gilbert
Fortunately we were with friends so the food quality was only secondary to the quality of the evening
Service is kind of odd but I really don't care because the food is amazing
On every occasion that I have been here the food has sounded amazing but always ended up being slightly above average
Their meat choices are pork beef chicken and hot links
They also have a couple side dishes that are worth trying the cowbro beans and potato salad
I tend to gravitate to Indian restaurants that offer excellent lunch buffets as it gives you the opportunity to sample multiple dishes
The relish really shouldn't be any sweeter as it too runs the risk of overpowering the flavor of the meat
Also I'm knocking off a star for service and food quality/selection actually I'm knocking off two since when I gave my original review of five stars I was an overzealous early yelper without a definitive rating system
Also for the quality/creativity the food is about $2 above the price point it should be and for my preferences the variety/options is really lacking
The staff is always pleasant the food is tasty and better than the usual hot dog or greasy burger that you find a lot of places although not up to Silverleaf etc
We had numerous orders of their sliders veggie and meat filled very tasty
The scene ambiance service and quality of food is top notch
The food was good our server was on the ball and no problems parking
There were both sweet peppers and hot peppers with the Italian meats - AMAZING
Mmmmm delicious boiled meat has been said by no one ever
Visiting these spots is a celebration in pizza that's going to feel like a worthy experience for any pizza head
I've had the Japanese bbq pork with egg over rice dish I think that's what it's called and while I didn't have high expectations for it it was surprisingly good
Servers are friendly and generally are attentive but this place is way too overrated because of the food quality
My wife had a trout dish that she thought as alright but she really liked the green chile and pork appetizer
Service was very attentive and the prices were reasonable considering the quality and portions of the food
The food has always been good I have tried quite a few dishes here and have always been very happy
Excellent service comfortable atmosphere--I can't wait to come back and try one of their signature mac and cheese dishes
Snobby waiters/waitressesRidiculous wait timesDelicious PizzaService is an important part of a dining experience but it's not everything hence why they only lose 1 star from me
This is something I've done a number of times and the pizza is just as good to go as it is served directly to your table
Hummus was good and the Greek salad is my new favorite  we also split the combo plate the chicken shwarma was hands down the best I have ever had and should be dipped in the oh so amazing tazilki sauce  The chicken kabob should not be missed  husband had gyros and he was moaning a little inappropriately while eating them
You have to love the food - I've had an excellent quesadilla shrimp and pesto and a great burgerCarolina burger with BBQ sauce that's out of this world and loved every bite
Food Even before we get to the meal the chips and salsa was amazing
I usually like the halibut ceviche or white fish ceviche but I was quite surprised how yummy this was with the tangy flavors I love in ceviche
The fish tacos were very light and flavorful
Food was Ok never saw the wine pairings so we bought our own which was good decent selections
Sundays are a great day to go not real busy so food and service are good
I think the price was $300 for 2 hours and included a small plate of appetizers and a sushi platter
The menu is pretty simple pizzas paninis pastas and salads and all are pretty good
Some of the salads can be pretty bland but the pizza and paninis are pretty good just not fantastic
Despite the risk of get a bit of bad luck when ordering on average the food is very good
I'd love to see some bison and lamb added to the chili menu but the beef is pretty tasty the way they serve it up
I really liked my BBQ 1/2 Chicken the potato salad was great mac and cheese were to die for and the corn bread was dessert worthy
We were far too stuffed to try dessert but I can only imagine how good that would have been
The food is pretty good but the service gets pretty slow when they get crowded
I love myself a good slice of fish or some wholesome chicken like the next guy
The mock meatballs tasted more like falafel than meat however the sauce and earlobe pasta was amazing
So with that said two dishes tried both tasted AMAZING
For food the guys split the Green Chile Stew appetizer T had the one and only salad on the menu hopefully they will add another option for that in the future and I chose to start with a side of their roasted vegetables
We were all way too stuffed for dessert although the warm sticky toffee pudding sounds pretty amazing
Very good food here I probably will only come back once or twice a year though cause it's such naughty food
drown yourself in alcohol;   slices is only tolerable if thoroughly drunk otherwise thoughts like i wonder how long these have been sitting out under those heat lamps for or why is my pizza cold or why does this taste strange will pop into your head ruining your meal
Ok the bacon is good and it brings out the beef
The place was lively and the sushi that kept passing by me looked amazing
The presentation of everything was very nice and the sushi chefs made the ambiance very fun and authentic as they took shots with some sushi bar diners
I'm not going to say I'm a sushi expert but I have had some pretty amazing sushi in Chicago Honolulu and Vegas
The food was just ok but definitely not worth the price
Now they just need a guacamole made table side or one that tastes good Overall the food is great the service is mediocre never outstanding but the food makes up for it
HERE'S THE TRUTH the owner PIERRE yes that's right the most French name any Frenchman could have is from Lyons France that's right the culinary capital and is passionate about good food
They have a new FRENCH chef who makes amazing and authentic French food
The food is good not like insanely good but good This time I ordered the Greek Salad which was very flavorful and filling
Fish meat veggies - all were prepared well not overcooked or overflavored
Have been looking for some higher quality fish than what I'm used to getting in old town so I decided to venture a bit north and check out sushi brokers I had heard nothing but positive reviews
I was not disappointed the sushi was very creative the fish was really fresh I was pleased with the presentation flavors and textures it was nice having good sushi since there seems to be far less quality establishments these days
The sushi is always good and the prices are fair
Over all great value good food relaxing atmosphere
The chicken was watery literally - I cut into the burrito and water oozed out - gross and didn't have much flavor
Nice beer list friendly and attentive staff good food cool vibe everything about this place is great
Nice big room comfy bed great smelling Bliss products in the bathroom good yummy food
We did as another reviewer recommended and after giving our server some guidelines allowed the chef and owner to send us whatever they wanted from the sushi bar and kitchen
All of the sushi was very fresh and some of the dishes were as creative as they were delicious
I recommend this restaurant for a special occasion for any sushi lover and for any occasion for the diner who can both appreciate and afford fine sushi
As for the quality of the food the sandwiches were both a little heavier on the mayonnaise than we cared for them to be but were fairly tasty
Definitely recommend the happy hour tacos and the mango rolls
I thought the pricing was on par with every good sushi place that I have been too
They could use some decor & the chairs make the little hashmarks if you're wearing shorts but you won't even notice because the food is THAT good
The drinks selection is good the food is a little better than regular bar food
You sit in a fun environment order drinks and food from the menu and just have a good time with friends
Select appetizers and main dishes from a comprehensinve menu
Fun-looking place and good service but it is about the food after all
He explained that the chicken was best eaten with sauce and proceeded to squirt syrup and hot sauce in the plate
so they don't feel like idiots for waiting that long for pizza that is good but not THAT good
Those are some hot roasted green chiles and I love the beef filling and the duck option
The food is excellent and the prices are reasonable and the dude at the counter keeps the line moving; I had the delicious Philly Cheese Steak wrapped in a gyro and topped with onions greenpeppers and cheese not that horid cheese whiz
Their daily specials are worth taking advantage of when you can and their food is pretty tasty when you're hungry and just need to chow
Don't let the shack-like appearance of this place fool you - it's damn good mexican food
I wish I could upload a photo of the hot dogs and potatoes they recently provided as the MAIN DISH for a meeting I attended there
To be quick and to the point the service was good but the food was absolutely garbage
}Bison Burger not my choice but hubby enjoyed the changeI was in love with my Panang Chicken Curry Bowl
The amount of food you get is amazing and a small entree can surely be shared by 2 people so don't let the prices scare you
This is pretty good Italian food served just like your grandmother would have done
The place is called The While Chocolate Grill so the dessert has to be good
The bread pudding and banana desserts were really good
I've had wonderful short ribs; fantastic duck; sweet scallops; tried Jerusalem artichokes for the first time in a lovely soup; had to-die-for desserts and phenomenal cheese plates
But other than that this was one tasty pizza
Personally I recommend the Italian Beef sandwich with mozzarella and sweet and hot peppers in lieu of the signature Chicago-dog
Any hack who has had one can emulate the Chicago Hot Dog but it takes a special touch to get the Italian Beef sammich just right
The service was good no complaints but they were out of the dish I wanted to order  which was also their most popular dish
The food was good enough and the service was great and decor- beautiful
Belgian pizza is actually good other than the pizzas the food is BOGUS
If the food was as good as say 4 Peaks this would be a 5 star review
My husband ordered the Smoked Salmon Hash which promised an impressive array of fresh ingredients and flavors but in actuality looked and tasted like canned fish mixed with fried potato chunks
He loved the Reuben its flavor quality and quantity of meat etc
All the food was hot fresh and full of flavor
He enjoyed the taste of the shredded beef
I have had as good a pizza in many places
We were waited on quickly and got our food hot and a respectable time
Fresh ingredients and well put together dishes definitely makes this restaurant a place for foodies as well as anyone who just wants a good meal
This place is a great combination of authentic quality food at a good price
I think that Sushi Eye charges a fair price for some tasty food and excellent customer service over all
But I guess it was a good thing there was no one out there because I was reciting muscle and muscle movements out loud while Alice-ma rolled about in the grass
The service is basically OK and i have never had a n issue with them but the food would more than make up for any impolite server as once the burger arrives its just me and the deliciousness in the room
The food was very good and the service was just as good
We opted to order dessert and the mousse tower was delicious
+1 Fast service+1 Good portions for both the pastas and pizzas+1 Chicken broccoli pasta lasagna and the extra bread on the side
I am really impressed by their business last week we got two regular subs when we got home we noticed that it seemed to be lacking in meat and the cheese was non-existent on one and paper thin on the other
I personally love their hot chicken sandwich with balsalmic dressing melted cheese and seasoned chicken grilled onions
Having a strong hankering for some cheap American-ized Mexican food we went here on a Sunday afternoon is hopes that La Fonda would be a lady and put out something good
I guess we just ordered the wrong dish because neither of us were exceptionally impressed
The soup comes out piping hot and certainly does not skimp on the tender chicken
Not to mention our family foodie db's SIL Christine T recommended this restaurant
We also got the BBQ pork appetizer with Rice Paper which was nice we caould make our own spring rolls
standby rated downward b/c food was decent not raveworthy
I walked out of SCRATCH having enjoyed fresh organic hand made food
This is a very nice place with fresh homemade food including salads pizzas and yummy baked goods
Just had a bday dinner here last night and the food was amazing
The juicy sliced meat with a bit of smoked bacon flavor on a bed of parsnip puree hmm heaven
either the chicken smothered in gravy and onions or the honey hot wings with their fresh fries
this place is not a place to go if ur watching ur weight but its delicious and very much comfort food I only go to places I love or that have been recommended to me I dont play around
Far and away South Chandler's best sushi and tempura and their miso soup is wonderful too
Speaking of which the lunch special combinations sushi and tempura for instance are not only a great value but are amazingly fresh and tasty with the sushi prepared while you wait never in advance
My wife enjoyed her meal but I'm pretty picky when I experience the same style of food that I've had before YC's in particular
About half way through my burrito I realized there was little chopped up bits of hot dog in the meat mix
I may give it one more go 'round with a steak burrito but my recommendation is to avoid the chicken
The other appetizer was a shrimp tempura roll which was average at best then came the main course
The flavor was good but this was the first piece of fish I have ever had that couldn't be eaten because of sinews running through it
Please go here ONLY for the food and for the fact that I don't want this gem to close down from the lack of knowledge about this place's goodness before I have a chance to get back there
All in all it was a good portion of food and it came with a drink and was a pretty good value
Although we all enjoyed our food for the most part we all decided we would not return
For good food I can put up with a lot
I get to PHX about 6X a year and I am ALWAYS craving good food like what they are SUPPOSED to serve at Barrio Cafe
The chicken tenders were breaded and had that nice crunch and with the addition of the honey hot wing sauce were a real treat
Which sucks because the food was pretty good and the atmoshpere 'like way phun dude'
The delicious taste of a spring roll from the hot food bar
My general first impressions- Awesome outdoor patio and live music- Good Sunday HH 1/2 price bottles of wine- Food was ok- Kind of a cool hipster crowdSo first off we had a couple of bottles of decent wine
i think people are blinded by the hype of what people say and if you actually taste the food you know that it isn't good
The pizza was suprisingly good actually or maybe we were just very hungry
I was with a party of four and two people both ordered beef burgers and really enjoyed their meal
The food is still the same and still just as amazing as it always is
All of the food was good and they were very nice in accommodating my special order
I had the fried chicken and it was lightly drizzled with honey and quite delicious
In addition to how good everything tastes not just my fave btw the food is priced right
I'm sad to say that I stopped in there today and found that apparently now Delicious Dishes is running Petit Fromage and Lara is no longer involved
The meats are simmered over many hours to perfect flavor and temperature
The beans were good but the Spanish Rice wasn't as good as I make & while the tamale had plenty of meat in it it was pretty blah tasting
Moved here 6 mos ago from the SF Bay Area and was really disappointed in the lack of tasty food don;t get me wrong - I love my new desert home but it takes a while to find new favorites
I had a hankering for a good noodle dish last week and happened upon this gem of a thai joint
I loved the fried catfish - not greasy but flaky and tasty
I've been to the brew house a handful of times and the food is consistently good
Since I don't eat meat I can only attest to how good the beer and the veggie wrap is
We started out with appetizers including meatballs Italian nachos and a wedge salad for the table
The meatballs were actually pretty good and my girlfriend also enjoyed her wedge salad
Altogether I hope no one else makes the mistake of going to this place and expecting the good food that people here have written about
The menu is rather large and maybe that's why they are having a hard time keeping the food at a high quality
It has been quite the task trying to find good Chinese food around here
The food was very good especially considering this is a chain restaurant
It's clean with nice atmosphere great service and good food
But there is some good food inside the place
They had a small sushi section and the sushi was very tasty
The wonton soup i had was very hot and good it had most of your typical trays with a couple of different twists on some like the stuffed clams were huge and and they had some good solethat thet called snow fish
Other than that the food and drinks were amazing
I rarely order vegetarian food when I am out but I got a little taste of it and it was very flavorful
The service was slow but I'm always happy to wait if the food is good
I don't cook and even I was impressed by their big selection of cheese meat pasta wine and sauces to buy
Since leaving New York six and a half years ago I have been in search of good Chinese Food
I knew that  a great  Asian market was next door as well and these things were the first things that signaled to me that I was probably going to get good food
Dish was tasty and portion was big but unreasonably so
The quality of the chicken is great and you can taste it also there is nothing puny about these wings either
He ordered some Pho a pork sandwich and some spring rolls all of which were good as well
This is a place that demonstrates the Alice Waters mentality that a dish is only as good as the ingredients
and would of given more stars but yesterday I spent $32 on take out food ps the menu prices in house are actually higher then those listed on the website- naughty naughty and recieved an almost $13 steak sandwich with roughly 5 quarter-sized pieces of bland steak and entire onion and no flavor what so ever
The chicken tenders were good battered with their fish and chip batter and the mustard they came with was delicious but $10 for a chicken tender appetizer
There is often specials that are sent in the mail where you can get an X-Large pizza and 24 hot wings for about 23 dollars
The seating is not the most comfortable but the food is soooo good that you will finish before you have a chance to notice
Food was tasty not over the top and more of the pub style of menu
Don't expect it to be as cheap as the fast food chains but instead you get many more options and higher quality meats
Sure you can get some of the regular stuff you get at other grocery stores like Stouffers frozen dinners and Oreo cookies BUT why would you when your senses and your shopping basket are already overflowing with so many gourmet ingredients artisan cookies and pastries wines fresh high-quality meat and delicious prepared foods
I love coming in here for some of their prepared foods - the meats are delicious - they have sushi bar though i don't do sushi but people love it
My salmon was good & the sides were DELICIOUS not the same as the online menu BUT why is it that for me the opposite plate of food always tastes better
23 MAY 2011 MONDAY LUNCH Downtown Phoenix LocationWe are not connoisseurs Not the Yelp picky palate reviewer of food but enjoy well prepared and good tasting food
We took a photo of the food but couldn't wait and took a bite
The meat was pretty good and I was happy with my order that time
I wouldn't have thought to use pretzels in a dessert but the result was a pretty good mix of textures and tastes
Only tidbit is I enjoy flavored food and the food here is a little more bland than I prefer
Request some yellow mustard and chili spices to dip your dishes in and flavor up your food
I am willing to give them another chance and would love to try some of the other pasta dishes such as the papardelle with pork sauce  but I would NOT recommend the spaghetti and meatballs to anyone
The service was decent and the food was good
Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food or maybe it was just good company   I love the decor; felt like I walked into one of my old school relatives homes - tacky Asian art with a modern twist
Their chicken finger dinner is really good albiet very pricey $14 if memory serves me
The sauce is a bit soupy and there isn't a ton of chorizo meat its really more for flavor but to me its perfect
The weekend poker tourneys are always a good time and the food is bar food but they do it right
The fish itself tasted good but they put too much seasoning on the outside and in their batter for my tastes
I went to get a good tasting non-fast food chain burger and that's what I got
Do you want to be a pub that serves beer and semi good martinis or a great gastro-pub that serves both great food and drinks
The staff and manager are consistently friendly and the food is consistently good
I am from the wonderful city of Chicago and let me tell you I've had my fair share of AMAZING Italian food and this place fits right in
ordered the fish tacos see picsMy tostada was really good I dare say a 5 star tostada
The fish tacos looked pretty he kept saying they were good but his face did not tell me the same story and he does not know fish tacos like I do I tasted the fish
Both of our entrees were very good overall; I had the chicken enchiladas with tomatillo sauce and spicy mashed potato side and my girlfriend had the Chiles en Nogada
It was a delicious refreshing dessert but I'm subtracting one star for crappy parking and pretentious crowd and one for generally not loving frozen yogurt
The food is wonderfully and artfully prepared and my otherwise simple male companions always find new favorites here
The menu features accessibly delicious meals that men won't feel emasculated ordering the spit-roasted prime rib dixie pan-fried chicken but still accommodates that girly bitch who lives at 44th and Thomas but insists she's in Arcadia Arcadia Featured salad Vegetarian Nut Burger
After a long day at the Sea Life Aquarium in Tempe the shopping mall in Scottsdale and the mediocre dinner at Wildfish Seafood Grille my bf and I thought we would top off the night by sharing a cup with two flavor scoops of gelato
So I saw this little bungalow-like restaurant which is located a block away from Chase Field and also not far from my hotel that serve authentic Southern and Soul food
I made a big mistake and opted to take my meal to-go to stuff my face with the fried chicken like a barbarian in my hotel room
My side of Collard Greens were very tasty and full of flavor but a bit too watery in which caused my side of rice to taste like a soup-like side and my monster-pieces of fried chicken's crispy skin and piece of cornbread were soggy
The fried chicken were very tasty but it would've tasted a lot better if it wasn't for my misfortune
the food we tried was really good the burrata with almond honey and flatbread
carneceria's Mexican food stands and of course 2 TJ hot dog joints the second we spotted on the drive up to Moreno's
I went in here expeting a little dive with delicious food
The chef even runs the food to make sure it comes out hot and gets to the table as soon as its off the griddle
My entree was quite tasty though- the beef chow fun dry might just have been the best I've had in the Valley
Hubby had to add all the sauces given to him just to give his tofu and veggie noodle dish some flavor
That's not to say that it entirely stays true to the Irish theme because it doesn't but what I've had has been tasty which is pretty much just the chicken boxty and the chicken pot pie so far
Then for dessert we had the Baklava which is a must for any Greek restaurant and Greekfest's Baklava was really really good
I'm a pizza snob admitting that there is very good Chicago style pizza out here in Arizona
I thought only New York style pizza could be tasty but this place knows what it's doing
The desserts were pretty good consisting a choice of cakes pies and ice cream
I've been looking for a cheap good sushi place in Arizona for the past 2 years I've lived here
Sure its no fine dining establishment so the quality is not top-of-the-line but its BY FAR much much better than store bought sushi and again cheaper
I recommend this place to anyone who like me loves sushi but doesn't want to break the bank
My nephew's birthday was last week and we came here because he wanted some good ole spaghetti & meatballs
The food wasn't spectacular but it was good and really hit the spot
The pasta was cooke al dente and the flavors worked really well together in this dish
The calamari chicken salmon and steaks were all good
Chef Anthony Ian and really everyone make it a fantastic personal experience every time and they keep us craving more of their excellent food amazing personalities and unmatched talent
So I called in an order for a hot and sour soup and an egg roll and went to pick it up
The soup and egg roll were actually pretty good but the service was beyond terrible and actually entered into the world of being a tad bit racist
Enjoyed a gluttonous evening of sushi here Saturday night
My advice Call ahead and order your delicious pizza
2 mi away from a terribly overpriced trendy sushi only place that I found had terrible service and sushi that was not nearly as good as Shogun
With great food good wine selection personal attention I cannot find anything that was not positive
Although the store is on the small side the selection of healthy and natural dog food is amazing
The mozzarella is top notch  they use quality pepperoni and other meats
We have a wood fired pizza joint Sal's Tuscan grill nearby which has really good pizza as well and when I am peeved at Grimaldi's I go there instead
This is the place where waiters replace dropped forks before you've reached to grab it where they are talkative but make the best recommendations ever and where you will stop talking because the food is just too good to slow down for conversation
It was creamy and meaty and flavorful and enough to eat for lunch for the next two days
Fresh food and basic choices that are consistently good
THe music was loud the crowd was pretty good looking and the drinks and food were great
And from looking over the menu I surmised there probably wasn't a dish that wasn't tasty
Not cheap as dirt but the food was worth every penny
OoOoOoOh how I love the herb box & team The menu is packed with amazing healthy dishes that include; huge market salads a mixture of medium rare steak with watercress avocado bacon and sweet dried corn with a tangy blue cheese vinaigrette
The food was good overall despite one issue
Ive found the food to be very good here and the service to be above average
No happy hour here but they offer high quality Japanese food at an affordable price
My husband said his fish was good and he liked the shoestring fries
There needs to be a grip-load more places like this one around the valley where they make you feel like whatever dogfood they deliver to you on your plate you're gonna gladly pay the fee with a toothy smile on your face and say 'thank-you good sir' and 'yes i will kindly see a dessert menu'
The bad Shumai was just ok duck mint salad had an unharmonious flavor and I refused to eat it chicken with wasabi sauce was dried out lychee wrapped bacon was soggy and a strange proportion cream and goat cheese dessert with peach was not fun
This place came highly recommended by the other couple we went with and to be honest we had such a damn good time with them that I hardly remember the food which does not say much for the food since I just ate dinner there last night
Anyway the four of us enjoyed each dish and the lightness of the flavors but it is easy to rack up a $160 tab with only four alcoholic and two non-alcoholic drinks by ordering 9 plates and two desserts
But I have to say my lasting impression is that I am not likely to return only because the food was just good not overly memorable
Went here with my girlfriends because I read an excellent review somewhere on their Habachi Wagyu Beef I had my first taste somewhere at World Trade Center Hongkong and I was more than eager to repeat the experience
The chicken fried steak had quality all over it down to the perfect breading and thickness of the cutlet
Again I wouldnt say the food is quite as solid as Kebab across the street but it is very good and healthier
That dish with two eggs over easy on top is positively moan-worthy
He ended up getting the Mediterranean Style Mahi Mahi and I got the cheese quesadillas from the appetizer section with Shrimp and both dishes were awesome
Though I figure it must be tasty PAnyway I got the chicken taco and the carne asada taco and got plenty of lemon wedges and salsa
The asada was more delicious than the chicken
Not much else to add except the food was delicious the price was right and I enjoyed my meal
The food and service were amazing but forty bucks seemed a little steep to me
Maybe if I was a normal American who could wolf down four plates and then go back for dessert it would be worth it
Overall~Food AmazingService AmazingAtmosphere AmazingPrice Disappointing
Whatever I don't care as long as your food is good
The food was very good but we had to use our iPhones to see the food including 5 or 6 different hummus flavors
It was an interestingly unique atmosphere with good service and great food
Sometimes I get something big and fried at Sonic and it makes me feel a little gross but on the whole their food is great if you can handle its intensity of flavor
I admit I like the unhealthy bad for you nasty ginormous amount of calories full of not so good for you food
I would die for a good vegetarian mexican food place sometimes and I think Moe's may be my go-to
I got a piece of fish on the side for a buck fifty that looked unappealing but was very good moist and flaky not too greasy good flavor
Good Asian market with a wide selection of fresh vegetables seafood
The burgers are all very good and you can order any with turkey instead of beef for a nice twist the green-chili turkey burger is a great combo
and the food was COLD and my bacon was not how i ordered it
The food was good although the chicken was a little on the dryer side
I'm a fan and always will be the food is always good here and the selection is unbelievable
The food is good - I don't think its worth the price and forget about going with a big group - the booths and tables are made for 4-6 TOPS
Their food is consistently good the menu has both unique items and traditional bar fare and all the wait staff is incredibly customer service oriented Bill is A+++
This place has good food great beers and a really fun atmosphere
Oh and did I forget to mention they have really good sushi as well
The chicken satay is always moist and creamy  and the soups are delicious too
Of course they have a chili paste you can add at the table but I find it too acidic; it changes the flavor of the dish too much
It can get a little tight in their small space but it's well worth it for the food
I mixed the sauces as if I was Picasso ready to paint with my tenderloin skewer especially the hollaindaise tasting one it was so delicious and devoured the beef paint brush almost instantly
The beef had an amazing kick of spices in the mouth and the chicken had this unexplainable tasting sauce that was decadent
After the 4 hot plates we did not have enough room for a sip of water let alone dessert
Since there are other restaurants that have amazing sushi
Asian food is always good and the gentlemen behind the line can do custom stir fry for you
This dessert is SO GOOD we each would've gotten one of our own on a greedy day but luckily we didn't or our pant buttons would've popped
The restaurant was slammed on Friday night but there were a pair of open seats there so we opted to eat at the pizza bar instead of waiting 20 minutes or sit outside in the cold
The first visit I had the BBQ chicken pizza hubby had the amazing fontina burger
Our food was just okay I had their Green Chile Burger and It was good It could have been better I'm sure
We also had the ceviche as our appetizer and that was delicious super small portion though that is the reasoning for my 4 stars this time such a small portion on one of my favorite dishes CEVICHE
Surprisingly the food here is delicious and since I was here for business I ate plenty of meals here
Being that it was my first time to this location I was SUPER skeptical because it sits at the W hotel in old town Scottsdale which is nice but it's a restaurant not some hot Sushi/club scene that came here from LA as people portray it to be
I had the Land as my first course which constitutes 3 of the restaurants most popular items steak chicken etc and all were prepared absolutely to spec well except maybe my steak was a tad cold but meh everything was going awesome so far so why screw it up by complaining
The service is good however The food is just not that fabulous
I had a chicken red curry ordered Thai hot and was happy that they were actually willing to make it hot for me
Too many Thai places won't actually make their food hot although I've found that the magic words I promise I won't send it back go a long way when ordering
When the server brought out my dish he said that they made it diarrhea hot which took me by surprise as diarrhea is a word that a server should never ever say
The restaurant itself is large open and comfortable and the food is good
The kitchen did make sure to bring out some more albondigas soup to my wife which was nice when they delivered it to the table they said they would because hers was lacking some meatballs they're call not ours so it was good to see them paying attention to that level of detail
All the staff was super helpful the day of the event and the food was wonderful
As for the food itself the brisket had a great smokey flavor but it was dry in places and had large hunks of fat
Delux certainly is worth going to but I would rather go to Zinburger or Fez if I am craving beef
My Swedish massage with Ben was wonderful
The crust and the smoky flavor from the pizza oven threw me over the edge
We decided to share a naked Mac and Cheese and a Cheese crisp the waiter recommended the Tomato and pesto and a coconut Chicken tender for a starter
Yes the food is quite rich with substance ingredients a blend of unique combinations yet every bite of every entre I've had over the years has been incredibly good
Don't put a pepper beside a dish on the menu representing a spicy dish and then have it be bland of flavor and heat
My husband had the buffalo chicken pizza and said it was good
For dessert we tried the one hot cookie
I was a bit weary about having non-Japanese food so stuck to good 'ol chicken katsu
Freshly prepared pastas delicious inventive salads and fancy pizza I actually like
Rarely do I get my undies in a bunch over a pizza place but the food here was amazing
The pizza is super good with a wonderful thin crispy crust
From your first pretzel roll through your last bite of dessert it's just as good as it gets
It's convenient to park and the food is very good
Funny even though they are known for their cupcakes and desserts I haven't tried any of them but they look like they would be wonderful
The summer rolls themselves were just okay not as good as Maxim or Sekong by Night
My daughter also enjoyed her curry chicken although I wasn't that impressed with it when I tasted it but to each his own
All in all a good experience and I'll be going back for more seafood pho
The meat was disgusting and hot and when I contacted the manager asking for a refund I was ignored
Listen we all know Ted's is delicious it just is so I will basically shy away from the food and let you know about the service of my most recent trip last night to Ted's
With service so exquisite and food so good as my friend Adam said You simply can't say no to it I'll gladly spend many more nights in the dog house
Almost everyone I asked highly recommended some dish there so I had to try it
But their food is so unusual it's worth it
And the food is worth the cost of peanut shells stuck to my shoes
All 4 of us thoroughly enjoyed all of the dishes
Naturally there are a lot more veggie options for morning food and I can happily recommend any egg/cheese combo on a biscuit
Breakfast at Red's after the Farmers Market vendor group chickened out due to rain that stopped by 9 am was pretty good
it's a tad more expensive than Fry's but totally worth it not for eye candy but that's great if you're a 19 to well 70-year old guy but for the better service and better facility and they always have killer deals on things like frozen pizzas and snacks cause well what else do college kids eat
Good wine and beer selection sushi stand olive bar deli with ready made good sandwiches and a pretty robust nutrition/health food section
The food was very good however the service was horrible
When I tasted it  I could tell it had bacon fat in it and I dont eat pork but to be honest i couldn't stop eating my food it was sooo good
Second off i happen to be a huge foodie and let flavors sit to get the full experience
was lacking of all flavor apparently in 85% of the dish and said the rest was bland
I love the grilled chicken sandwhich I had and their baked potatoe soup while not as good as the Corner Bakery across the Loop 101 to the East is still great
The place was clean pleasant the service was good and the food came out exceptionally fast
I wish we would have had room for some early afternoon dessert because their homemade cheesecakes looked amazing
Our daughter ordered Chicken Parmigiana Sandwich and it looked really good
For the dessert course we had the panna cotta with a blueberry sauce that was perfection as well as the butterscotch pudding which was incredibly rich with a complex flavor
The food here is always good and it's a decent price
It's still good just hasn't had the chance to capture as much flavor because they go through so much meat
First this place starts on a great foot by letting you buy wine next door at about wholesale prices because all great food has good to great compliments of wine
It was a couple of weekes ago that I dined but standing out still were the endive salad OsaBuco style short rib and an amazing apple and fennel dessert
I had never had sushi before so this place was a little intimitating at first but once i started to try it i enjoyed it very much so
Now that i'm more of a sushi expert i can say their sushi wasn't great but good for beginners
overall the food is well worth the wait drive or whatever your obstacle
There are SO many quality Mexican food restaurants in town that I will be choosing somewhere else next time
All of their different selections of meat have little to no flavor
I was impressed by this little gem and the icing on my tiramisu another table asked the waiter to let them pay for my dessert
Service deserved an A and food quality was between a C and an F depending on what you order
My dining partner's braised lamb lasagna dish looked and smelled delicious and I found myself wishing I had selected a different entree
I've always been disappointed with the level of service and quality of food
Now upon our journey to Italy we ended up in Naples birthplace of Pizza and couldn't believe how identical the pizza there Naples was to Cibo delicious may I add
You don't get very much food for the price and the taste was not worth the 45 minute drive or the 40 minute wait
Alas I finished it most of those wonderful chips and various salsas I absolutely loved the Chipotle one and my veggie dish
Portofino has a cross of traditional bar & grill appetizers & entrees along with a modest selection of pastas and fish
Having eaten pho from one end of this country to the other this is my favorite place to eat this wonderful dish
25 which is a soup tureen sized bowl of wonderful broth filled with noodles rare steak slices flank brisket tendon tripe and beef meatballs and asked for the tripe to be left out since companion isn't fond of it
I always add some fish sauce which is on the table because I love the flavor of it
I give them 4 stars for service quality of food and cleanliness
The food is pretty good although the steaks are kind of small
The nachos are a good choice for a lot of food
It was good afforable quality food with great service and I'm not quite sure what more you can ask for
On top of that every dish is so unique and flavorful that it's hard to compare to any other place
Amazing food and I wish it was a little closer to me so I could go there on my lunch breaks at work
We skipped the drinks after having our fair share of them at the hotel bar beforehand but if I ever have to come back to Trader Vic's which I don't plan on I'll have to mask the bland taste of their food with lots of their specialty drinks
I ordered the sicily pizza and the bread was amazing on it it also had some goat cheese as well
Can't beat Filibertos good inexpensive authentic Mexican food
as for the food - the lamb chop appetizer was very tasty but slightly overpriced in my opinion
I love the burgers and the bbq chicken pizza is very good
I wish I had seen brisker business the two times I've been there but hopefully it will pick up and they can continue to serve good Thai food in a neighborhood that really seems to need the ethnic and family-owned variety
I have been able to drink my first bottle of cold water and even eat food straight out of the frig
Points for  surprisingly delicious food friendly employees cleanPoints off  PRICE omg only going back if someone else is buying being unable to understand employees *I gave it one $ because if you are cheap you can get out for less than $10 if you are really hungry or get a whole meal or big sub you are definitely paying more than $10
Although I'm not a huge meat eater this girl loves a good old filet on occasion
You know if they served Kung Pao enchiladas that might be interesting but this is just Chinese food and Mexican food next to eachother in the same aluminum takeout bowl yes even if you'e not taking out
If you like super-over-fried heartburn-enducing flavorless cardboard you might like their Mexican food
The food menu looked good but smelling and seeing the entrees of those around us was  tempting
Had the chicken burrito combo and although the rice and beans were just OK I thought I might cry right into my platter because the chicken burrito was so delicious
For dessert we had the chocolate cake which was very rich and wonderfully delicious
I had the best French Dip sandwich I've ever had and my boyfriend thought the Fish n Chips were amazing
Food came quick and was really really good
Not only is the food amazing well of course--you make it exactly how you like it
bangers sausages and mash mashed potatoes bubble and squeak tasty concoction of potatoes cabbage and leeks shepherd's pie and of course fish and chips fries -- you'd be surprised how many people screw that up
I chose the fish and chips and thoroughly enjoyed my meal with a little malt vinegar and just a dash of salt and pepper
I was very impressed by the overall quality of the food yes quality is a word that can be associated with British food as well as the friendliness of the staff and owners
Its like a chicken noodle without the noodle with potatoes thrown in for good measure
I got the appetizer combo that Michelle got it was plenty of food for a meal
I think I want to go back now and try the chile relleno and some more of the tortilla wrapped cheesy meaty deliciousness
Yeah it was high quality beef but the fries were overpriced and mushy got so many orders wrong I just enjoyed my free bacon and ask for more mustarrd and lettuce
I still like Carl's Jr sandwich with no bun and wrapped in lettuce for fast food and Joes Farm Grill is worth the drive for many many reasons
It is a little more expensive than your average chicken sandwich but it is definitely worth it
There not a miliion items of spice to chose from what's available is plenty enough to flavor the food properly
After it comes out cooked the food is hot and freshing
What we hadAppetizer artichoke and spinach dip with tortilla chips Lunch fish and chips and their special of the day meatballs
I work in Arizona mills so my co workers and I often order chips and salsa to go from this location and I must say every time we get our food which takes about 30 min the beans are already cold the male bartender who handles the to go orders is incredibly unfriendly rude and overall deplorable in his customer service abilities
I'm no stranger to good Italian food and I wasn't expecting anything special but I was knocked out by the quality of Carrabba's food
The parlor looks amazing really I uploaded a photo background worthy so decor is top notch and the quality of the food is really good not to leave out the service which was fine but
The flavor was ok and that was the problem for me the pizza was priced right made with quality ingredients in a very cool setting but it didnt satisfy
I hope they rework their recipes to add more flavor because I love this atmosphere and the pizza was quality but missing enough flavor to keep me from coming back
Fries poached in duck fat - very good very well doneGrass fed sliders/hamburger - meat was good bun was a little hardPizza - was actually quite tasty but not New Haven pizza - I think there is too much fat in the crust
Chicken and goat cheese flat bread - very good the figs and argula made it a very tasty and relatively healthy optionfamous meatloaf - meh but then again I have never been wowed by meatloaShort ribs - okay not great
FAILPrime Rib - was very good the potato was GINORMOUSThough the Yelp review says $$ it's probably closer to $$$ - since most of the main dishes were in the $20-$30 range
Next up I had the Teriyaki Chicken which was an upgrade from the Calamari fiasco but it still was not good
We sit down and wait and wait and wait for a good 25 minutes for our food to arrive
Very good food very good value very long wait at lunchtime
I had the opportunity to treat some friends who were visiting from the northeast and wanted good Mexican food
The waitstaff was very friendly and efficient the food was really tasty and the servings were generous
I would say that I ate here some of the best Mexican food I've had in the Valley and my friends were equally impressed
We've been going every Saturday for the past few months and although there is always at least an hour wait on Saturdays the awesome food and cute cozy atmosphere has been worth it
Though I cannot readily identify with years of oppression white women crossing the street when I pass for no good reason and the spectre of slavery I think that my love of motown broad-hipped women and soul food makes me at the least an honorary brother
I've been to Thailand a few times now and although the food is not quite as good as my dinner on the beach with the sun setting over the ocean in the Phi Phi island's
With that said it's very good and lived up to my expectations of what I know Thai food in America to be
amazing and the other buffet style non-stirfry items are equally tasty; be it the egg rolls or soups or
How can you not have a good time in such an uplifting interior paired with delectable food friendly staff and tasty beverages
I kept hearing about how good this place was and with such a limited amount of sushi restaurants nearby my husband and I decided to try it
The fish in the sushi was high quality and very fresh tasting for Arizona
I don't normally order hot food but decided to venture out and it was well worth it
VERY nice broth lots of meat although a couple of pieces were a little tough served by the little Vietnamese Lady who obviously is responsible for its delicate flavor
My roommate and I were already starving but decided some orange chicken was worth the wait
It's 'Ok' quality chinese food but not something to rave about EXCEPT their crab puffs
I have never had a bad experience or anything less than excellent food
Ethiopian food is unlike anything else and it is SO tasty
If salad is not you thing they make excellent sandwiches and pizzas to order
I usually steer away from places that have large lines and after a certain time I wont dare go here cause it can be hard to find a seat and the food does take a while to make but if you are taking a lunch around 11am you can squeeze in before the rush and grab some tasty foods
Philly cheese steak on hard bread with everything 5/5 - best I've ever tried so farchicken fettuccine with garlic bread 5/5 -  olive garden is one of my favs but this tops it in areascalzones - 2/5 pretty large but terribleside salads 2/5 bland cafeteria qualityItalian sausage with peppers- 2/5 too large of ingredients throw off the tasteprosciutto - 5/5 some of the best tasting meat I have hadpizza - i cant recall it so I wont rate itturkey w/ provolone 3/5So the line may be long or seating short depending on timing
The chicken was soft moist white meat with a tasty teriyaki sauce and mushrooms
I know that this place is beloved by many but really and truly this is straight up flavorless Mexican chain food with some hatch chilies arbitrarily thrown in at times
The plantains were DELICIOUS as were the chicken and veggies
We have not had their sushi or oysters but have heard they are tasty
Ok as far as steaks and seafood go we havw had so many we would highly recommend most of them
Of the beef I recommend the filet mignon and ribeye
Every time we've been to Wildfish everyone from the hostess server busser to the bartenders have been excellent
Our food was delicious- shrimp scampi and caprese salad were fantastic
When the food arrived the pizza was pretty good
The sauce was cold by the time it reached our table and the meatballs inside were small
Only one good thing came from this dish the Poor Brothers potato chips served on the side
We said yes your pizza is good but i asked you earlier if you meatballs were hand made here or were something you purchased
WE WERE LIED TO ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE FOOD FROM THE BEGINNING
I ordered the Yellow Chicken Curry which was really tasty
Both of these dishes were delicious as well
Another wonderful restaurant to add to the burgeoning strip of foodie heaven along 1st street
Amazing chili flavor with the chicken black beans fresh chips
I don't throw down 5 stars for a restaurant often and I didn't expect that I would for this meal but I was really impressed with the menu and the food at Eddie's House
The food was wonderful not only for its imagination but also for its presentation
Although this place is a chain the customer service is always excellent as well as the food
95 which at any other restaurant I would tucked my tail and hide but the food here is well worth the price
I highly recommend the restaurant to any seafood lover
Hubby's pad-thai-ish dish was pretty good with noodles a zippy sauce and big crunchy veggies
The only good thing about this place is that they are one of the few places that serves any Taiwanese food here in AZ
Others really enjoyed their spaghetti with veal meatballs and two people who got the huevos rancheros said it was some of the best they'd had
Their sandwiches are pretty good and I'm partial to the turkey with cranberry or the chicken walnut
I did get to find something out for us Sweet Republic lovers here in Chandler that the Chandler Wholefoods will be selling by the scoop 20 flavors of Sweet Republic brand at the in store gelato shop
Great fresh food and wonderful atmosphere
Spring rollsDecent but once again not amazing
We had a vanilla souffle for dessert and it was also good
I've had a lot of delivery chinese food in Phoenix and in Scottsdale and I have to say this place really impressed me
We had the Summer Rolls and they were delicious
It is not the best sushi I have ever had however I go here frequently with girl friends for happy hour because the sushi is good and we can get out of there full under $30 each including beer and/or saki
The steaks are beyond good and they always have a nice selection of seafood
So if you are in the mood for some good decently flavored chicken soup and some above-average chips and salsa give it a try
The bartenders and servers are really interested in ensuring you have a great time while you're there and the food is easy going and good
Food is always great service is good and the atmosphere is fun and exciting
Food = GreatAtmosphere = GreatService = So SoWe were told we had an hour wait and went to the bar for drinks and appetizers
Although I've only been to Lisa G once the service at the bar was great the food was excellent I had the Juno sandwich and the atmosphere was fine
The meats were each equally fantastic and the BBQ sauce was really really good
Adovada was TASTY; tender soft moist everything you want and more from meat
The Quattro pizza topped with a fried egg is amazing and the roast beef sandwich is also good
so when we asked the waiter how long our food would be cause we were thinking of ordering and appetizer he said our appetizer would be out before the food
Food was good but not as good as Oregano's and will remember that that 1 1/2 hr wait Oregano's is worth it
It's also right next-door to Wildflower Bread Company the 2 are connected so you can sit down for some food with your newly purchased books and just hang out   The staff is very helpful and friendly and the have lots of good recommendations based on the types of books you like
My husband rolls his eyes when I walk in the house with yet another HomeGoods haul
They are healthy and have fresh veggies in most dishes carry a nice amount of spice and have enough interesting marinades and flavors to remain interesting over and over again
I tried the grilled beef sandwich that was featured by New Times' Chow Bella Blog and enjoyed it very much
American-style mexican food slightly less flavorful than El Torito
We each got a pizza and they were both delicious
That said the food is really wonderful
We had the butterfish for an entree and it was unsurprisingly delicious and the most popular of the entrees
I've been to a few Brazilian steakhouses but I was really impressed with both the service and the food
I know you're supposed to go there for the meat but the fried bananas and the cheesy bread puffs are sooo amazingly good I have a hard time staying away from those
Quite a big variety of meats cuts and they were all flavored really well
All of which were good the tandoori chicken was really good
For dessert they only had the monkey balls and some cubes of watermelon  mind you the monkey balls were good
If you like Indian food this place is not bad and a good value at $9 for the lunch buffet
I love hole in the wall places where food is good owner who works the kitchen and they know what is good food
He is a Chicago native who knows about food and we ended up talking a lot about food in phoenix small business what is good food etc etc
We've lived here for 10 years and I've been training myself to eat hotter food over that time
The first time we went to Los Dos was almost 20 years ago and I could hardly eat the food it was so hot
I think it's a summer special but lately Monday's have been happy hour til close with $3-$6 full-size apps and $5 glasses of wine- seriously there is not a better deal in town with this quality of food
Second it's a perfect portion of moist grilled flavorful fish
I've also come here later in the day and enjoyed their burgers while my friends have tried the meatloaf and other entrees without complaint
But I think the food is always good especially the pizza and the baked ziti

Butterworth's was fine - the sweetness tempered by the chicken gravy and macaroni
For my money I'd go with the puddin' but this is one damned fine Red Velvet and in the context of the experience that is Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles either make a great finale to a great meal in an unexpected but excellent setting
The presentation of the rolls were beautiful and everything was delicious
It's a very small buffet and at least half of it is cold food like salads and hummus
Chicken on the alfredo and Caesar salad had a strong lemon flavor
Deli meat household goods and everything a guy or gal could want
that has very tasty food and a few nice wines to chose from
Gosh I wish they would do some advertising because the sushi is VERY good
Other than this component the dish was nicely balanced and spiced after requesting a spice level of hot
Requested hot this dish was more medium spicy on my Scoville scale
The dish was tasty chock full of veggies and bits of beef just a bit timid for my taste
Great food good service STRONG drinks interesting and lively ambiance just an overall amazing experience
I recommend trying the sesame chicken and the house special rice
The shrimp rolls were good not amazing but I would get them again and he said it was one of the best burgers he's ever had
Again it had good flavor but i was disappointed in the meat
We walked in at opening so it took 10 minutes or so for food but the array of goods in the market to shop made the time fly
The chicken was good with a nice subtle flavor and plenty of juice left inside the well grilled meat
Some people have complained about the prices well you get a lot of food and it is good food I never leave here hungry
If you want good real Italian food this is the place if you want all you can eat overcooked pasta and salad for 7 bucks go to Olive Garden
I ordered the mediterranean roasted chicken pita and it was SO good
While this is certainly a food-serious environ the prices are reasonable for the quality and attention present
I could have order a good wrap or sandwich minus the meat but $15 for the lobster wrap minus the lobster is a little steep
We requested an order of spring rolls to split as an appetizer
The beef carpaccio was delicious and it was a very large portion
I've been several times and the food has consistently been good
Five dollars for high quality food such as tuna wasabi sashimi scallops wrapped in bacon and steak tartare
They're open 24 hours and have a drive through although it's hard to find you have to drive behind the dry cleaners to find it The Carne Asada is awesome the Carne Asada Fries are teh ULTIMATE drunk food and I finally tried their menudo last weekend and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was
Took my family there today for lunch since my 2 kids are big Pizza fans and being from NY we thought it would be worth giving this a shot based on the NYPD name
Food came out in good time so that part was positive
It's been a few years since we have been back to NY so my taste buds may be a little off but in my opinion the food quality was more of a AZPD Arizona Pizza Dept quality vs
If you are up for ok pizza good pricing maybe give NYPD a shot and hopefully you have a better experience than we did
Since it so close to Ray's Pizza I would recommend playing it safe and going to Ray's Pizza
I went with 2 other people and we did not order liquor just an appetizer and 3 dishes and we walked out of there disappointed and spent $140
To start we enjoyed deliciously fresh spring rolls - one type with shrimp #48 and the other with BBQ pork #49
The beautiful big bowl of seafood pho #12 that was placed before me was well worth waiting for
Physically impossible after all of the amazing food I had consumed
We thoroughly enjoyed a full front-to-back dinner starting with the Grocery Bag Appetizer and the Pork Belly Appetizer and enjoying the Red Fish Entree
A pizza is a bit pricier than somebut worth it
I like that the personalized pizzas have a good crust remain hot and cheesy with their delivery package and the crispiness of the pepperoni
The ambiance is out of this world the food is to die for and the beer list is as good as it is long
We had the marinated BBQ pork and the seafood hot pot at hot
It was creamy cheesy meat filled goodness
My food choices have varied and I have always been impressed with my choices although my favorites are still Spinach Con Queso for an appetizer and a Baja Chimi with Beef
I don't know about you but I don't know to may places that offer good gluten free vegetarian and meat eater options
I usually hate fried egg rolls but I enjoyed these
delicious focaccia great meat and a really nice take on a hollandaise
For me at Federico's I can count on good rolled tacos and serviceable bean burritos but I've been duped many times while hungry to delve into the numbered combos and I regret it everytime
Let me start by saying I have no idea about the food here it could be amazing and knock my socks off but I will not be back to find out
We had the arancini appetizer fried rice balls with cheese in the middle and some tiramisu for dessert
We ate the food in our hotel room we are from out of state is was pretty decent
Some of the other people at the table ordered the Chicken Lollipops the baked brie and the onion rings which were also just $5 per plate and looked to be really good and better portioned
Definitely check out the Main Ingredient next time you're looking for good food and service in a cute cozy environment
the ginger delight with chicken is also very tasty
So I know it's cliche` when talking about a certain ethnic dining establishments to refer to the food as  it's good but not as good as indian food in India
I have the short rib taco's and they were excellent the meat was super tender and tasty
The food was good I can live with mediocre service once in a while
Good food at least for lunch when we were there
Price was perhaps a little high for a lunch of sandwiches/burgers but the quality of the food was definitely not lacking
We also got the ecuadorian tamale and the beef and pork empanadas as appetizers
As an entree I got the banana leaf wrapped fish which was cooked very well and came with a bunch of really flavorful veggies and sauce on the top
I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a little hole in the wall latin american restaurant with great food
I would like to give it 3 stars for having a good time but I can't because of the food
The meat was nice and hot and flavorful but the taco shell was really greasy and thin
The Sun Devil chicken was equally amazing my mouth is watering as I type
This doesn't translate well with hot foods but with the cold salads it's awesome
The personal pizza for $4 plus $1 per topping is a good value
The pizza sauce seems to vary in flavor from sweet to a tad spicy
I've never had any complaints on their food as it's always been fresh and tasty to the very last bite
North Scottsdale doesn't really have any good hole in the wall spots for mexi food so it's a treat when I can make a stop by here
The quality of the food is a little spotty though--having been the recipient of lukewarm food on at least one occasion
The fritters were tasty but my partner thought the oysters were too fishy
Overall the food and crazy atmosphere was definitely not worth the hefty price tag of 100 dollars
The menu was reinvented this year and you will find appetizers such as Rock Shrimp Spring Rolls incredible Teriyaki Ribs Seared Ahi Sliders and a plethora of Tempura selections
Sundays are industry night and all sushi rolls and appetizers are half off as well as every drink in the house
The Italian Beef is a heck of a sandwich with tender meat lots of peppers delicious bread and au jus
I had lentil soup followed by fig and prosciutto pizza followed by cru00e8me brule very very good
I asked everyone if they had any comments on the food and the only criticism I had was the coffee was only so so and not hot enough otherwise everyone was very happy with the choice
I ordered the Chicken Korma with rice and naan bread my boyfriend and I both thought it was all delicious but I don't think I will be going back anytime soon
Eventually he came by and brought us our check but It was a very awkward atmosphere in general which is a shame because the food was very good
I had to wait for only about 15 minutes but thats not bad and its worth every bite to have a good pizza
The prices are a bit more than you would expect to spend at a place like this but the food amount is worth it
Its good if you just want to get some average breakfast food and get on your way to something else
This food was flavorful and was not boring at all and although the waitstaff does have a hippie co-op naturalist vibe to them they are really pleasant and very enthusiastic about their menu
I'm not a pizza connoisseur by any means but this was very delicious pizza piping hop pizza
Cheese is really tasty and is laid down as thin slices not shredded like most pizza places
The desserts are delicious I recommend the green tea ice cream and very reasonably priced
The only problems I see with this place would perhaps be that while most sushi is delicious cheap and prepared quickly sometimes certain rolls can be hit or miss
Other times it is OBVIOUSLY rushed the pita is stale the chicken is cold and I KNOW I said ADD FETA
But all the meat here is awesome juicy and delicious
Like I said the sushi is good but not fantastic
The service was as gracious and friendly as the last time and this time the quality flavors and presentation of the food my friends and I ordered were very good; and the heat / spice level was tempered down to our liking for both appetizer and entrees
We stood in line raving over all the delicious food items displayed around us
Reheating meat ruins it for me so i just ate a few delicious bites from around the edges of my chop
On my only previous visit the food was really excellent so 4 stars it is
If I really want a gyro I'll go the mall food court and get a cheaper gyro that actually tastes good from Pita Jungle
My bf had the meatloaf sandwich and fries which was also pretty amazing
We had an appetizer a soup the coconut lemongrass one I get everywhere I try and two noodle dishes
You MUST get the Meat & Potatoes appetizer
The food was wonderful and the waitstaff seemed knowledgeable in what they were serving and made some good recommendations
But with this amazingly detailed disclosure and warning I will say that the pizza was really good
The place wasn't fantastic enough to monopolize my Thai food business but it's tasty and a good value and close to my house
My Uncle always picks up the check so the price had to be modest but the service and food had to be excellent and at the last minute Mom threw in oh and we want to eat outside
Service was very good and the burgers first rate - meat was cooked properly tender and with enough char to make a pleasant crunch
The tofu is flavored/shaped as with it's more traditional dish i
Kung Poa has chicken-flavored tofu Beef dishes taste more like beef
The food is good not amazing but definitely worth the price
Things I have tried that I would recommendedChicken Tortellini chicken spinach pink sauce which is a vodka sauceMushroom Ravioli with pink sauceButternut Ravioli in a garlic butterCalamariAntipasto SaladThey also have a decent wine selectionThe servers have always been prompt and attentiveWhile this isn't a place I would drive and seek out if you live in the neighborhood it is a great weekday go to and has made it in my rotation when I don't feel like cooking
It wasn't the best pizza I've ever had but it was damn good
We got to that intoxicated stage where fried food sounds really good although you know you will regret it the next day so Chris ordered mozzarella sticks which were pretty good because the batter was light
I agree with one of the other reviewers that this is way better than the GAP event that is part of the Scottsdale Culinary Festival because there you have to pay for food and drink in addition to the entrance fee and so I spent way more money there last year but the quality of selections just does not compare to Devoured
Also starring roasted local corn and sauteed spinach providing a snap of green flavor/color to this already gorgeous dish
But the food here does not taste fresh is not generally tasty
This is real Mexican food melt in your mouth homemade corn tortillas homemade chips from scratch salsas and very good Carne Asada
The atmosphere was cool the pizza was tasty and decently priced and the 2 pitchers of Amber Beer I had consumed were also excellent
anyway food is pretty good --i love the chicken pasta salad order with added feta and extra dressing or the macro platter-- but not to die for
Overall AZ 88's posh locale with impossibly delicious food that even us poor people can afford easily reconciles its inherent flaws
Decent artisan toped pizzas ok prices and fast service it is a good lunch option for a smaller group
Wow the food here is so good and very cheap
lolI am a foodie and I must say that I was impressed with their take on the turkey ruben
I asked the server what their signature dish was and he recommended the duck
I used the Groupon for my first visit and the food was amazing
I believe the quality and quantity of dishes here blows away your Barrios and Gringos sure you pay a bit for it but the Guac is topped with a Grand Marnier and Jalapeno reduction
The rosemary mexican fry-bread pizza is so filling and tasty I can only eat half
The food came out very quickly hot as ordered
My friend and I split the chicken tenders which in true Irish fashion are extremely battered but equally delicious
The Chicken Lo Mein is ridiculously tasty
A bit pricier than the average taqueria spotThere's so much love mixed in this hot potI need to say that a fifth star is not illusiveJust wish it had drinks more inclusiveI'll return not just because its on Hardy at MitchellBut because it's food speaks my name Mitchell
It tasted okay but there were a few things about it and the other dishes my friends ordered that seemed a bit odd- Food was not hot when it got to the table
- Lots of meat on the sandwiches but it wasn't especially flavorful- Had to ask for barbeque sauce to put on top of sandwich
I don't have much to say about the food we tried the empanadas and they were good enough although they could have used a bit more spice
I've tried their home section with their roasted pork sirloin or oven roasted chicken it's actually edible not excellent but it's good nonetheless
My fiance had the New York Steamer #3 which was very tasty as well it was stacked with corned beef brisket and pastrami topped with melted provolone and then touch of mustard just enough to give it that zing
Now since the food is so good and the atmosphere so fun and since everyone KNOWS that due to reviews like the one you're reading now be prepared to wait
It's not exactly a five star food quality  like Ruth's Chris Steakhouse but it's good food and great service
The waffle fries are also delicious as are salads desserts and the other sandwiches
The Raj IPA and the Kilt Lifter were two beers that I really enjoyed and I'd recommend to any beer drinker =All in all the place had a brewery feel to it the food was your normal pub grub and the beer was good
Too much good Mexican food in this town to drive out of my way for what some gringo thinks the folks of N Scottsdale think Mexican food is supposed to taste like
I went here with my family and was very impressed by both the service the food and the atmosphere
Really good chicken quesadilla and then i had a grilled chicken salad my girlfriend and the ribs and Chicken
My first try to Veneto and I'm in love with it  Nice atmosphere delicious food and very nice staff
Entree Orecchiette Salsiccia e Broccolini Pugliese pasta sautu00e9ed with sausages and rapini in extra virgin olive oil garlic and red pepperoncino slightly spicy -- This dish was presented nicely colorful and very flavorful
Gnocchi di Patate alla Bolognese  Homemade potato dumpling served with homemade meat sauce -- Loved the tasty meat sauce and the potato dumpling was definitely one of a kind
The food was fresh and hot but the place was a MESS
Same wonderful food as the old school South Phoenix location I know and love but the attempted recreation of the quirky atmosphere misses the mark
I've only been to one Grand Lux location before this in Long Island and I've had nothing but good food there
Good thing they didn't mess that up because it would have been very sad and disheartening since the restaurant's parent company is the same one that owns the Cheesecake Factory
The food was on point flavorful and fresh
the pizza is thin crust which i like but it really have much flavor which was disappointing
The food is decent nothing to really go crazy about and not really worth the price
Driving North from the Chase Stadium district hungry for a quick lunch before my next appointment this was the first food place that quickly stood out as a joint that had hot quick and inexpensive food
That being said their Frito Pie appetizer may be the most disgusting and delicious food item I have paid for
The food here is tasty enough but nothing you couldn't find elsewhere
My guests seafood dish was quite pricey at around $35 but he said it was delicious and full of all kinds of different sea creatures
As I walked past the hot case I noticed that the chicken fingers were gray and I think something in there moved
Both times I have eaten there I've gotten absolutely delicious food across the board
I find their food seasoned well balanced in flavor and visually appetizing without tasting too greasy or obnoxiously oily/buttery
Anyway the food was good but since I can get pretty defensive when it comes to my kids I probably won't go here again
Their fish tacos are way good - make sure you get the corn tortillas
We waited a good hour to hour and a half for food
We did not have any food while we were there but the pizza smelled really good
It had a vienna beef hotdog mustard tomato slices a pickle hot peppers a special relish onion and some really good seasoning salt
All the food was incredibly delicious and the service was fantastic
The food was good and I learned that Thai Elephant is owned by the same family who runs Thai Basil just down the road
Food-wise Main Ingredient hit the spot for me on such a cold and rainy Phoenix night
You order at the counter   from a good size selection of ethnic dishes plus a few typical American items
I suppose the desserts aren't anything amazing though I do love the bowl of berries
The Thai dishes are  flavorful and it's pretty much the only Thai restaurant I go to in the Valley I get better Thai food at home in Hawaii but since I'm in AZ for the most part I had to find a substantial alternative
I always try the green chicken curry hot to judge a Thai place as the baseline kind of like at a BBQ place you need to get the pulled pork and brisket to really judge the food and it was excellent with a good balance of flavor very good consistency of the sauce and very tender yet still al dente veggies and chicken including some excellent baby eggplant
Out from the kitchen where a Pakistani woman was cooking came a size-able stainless steel container with this wonderfully aromatic succulent goat meat in tomato and garam masala stew
The guy was awesome but what stood out the most was their flavorful goat dish
My sister's Chicken Tikka was also super flavorful but mine was definitely more complex and interesting
They also work with you on how spicy you want your dishes so if you prefer an extra kick just ask but I'd recommend trying the dishes how they prepare them first since I like spice and thought they did a great job of making the dishes spicy but not to the point where the spice overpowers the dish
The food is ok for takeout but the restaurant service is not so good
Their pizza has a thin crust and the sauce is tangy and the cheese is tasty
The chicken piccata and marsala are both made with a thin sauce not too much flavor and the chicken is overcooked
It is medium quality food that has been crafted more towards pleasing simple appetites and a board base instead of really striving for something wonderful
Great low priced fares from Allegiant good service resonable food and drink option and it looks like they are expanding for Spirit Airlines to join this fall 2012
I had the portabella mushroom dish and my husband had penne pasta with chicken - both excellent and a pleasant surprise
The food is good for what it is and cheap to boot
The price was great considering the price included an amazing finisher's mug full of chocolate food and HOT chocolate and not to mention an awesome wind breaker
The food is pretty good however some of the items are a little bit pricy
I ordered the southwest flannel hash which was a wonderful flavorful take on the classic corned beef hash
The food was okay but not worth the service
After 5 minutes I asked how long it will take to warm up the pizza he says it's ready takes it out puts it in this cheap thin paper plate and hands it to me and I had to almost run to my table as the pizza was HOT and I didn't want to burn myself
I can't say that the atmosphere is overly special it's not - it's your typical cafeteria style eatery and I can't say that the food is anything inventive or creative it's not - it's standard breakfast fare but for a good omelet or eggs and bacon this place is pretty darn good and cheap
We enjoyed our food and didn't really have any complaints
I would have given them a 4 but I had shoddy service and as a restaurant that should be as big of a priority as quality of food
They serve good drunk food even late at night have a great selection of beer as well as bar games to play
The food coming out of the kitchen is just good real Chinese food
But Pizza is simple if you know what your doing you can make as good or better than this joint
I would recommend this place is you're craving just some basic Mexican food and don't have a long lunch hour
For fast mexcian food Los Favoritos is as good as it gets
They have amazing pizza calzones heros pasta and garlic knots why must you be so buttery and delicious and full of fat
I'm not too impressed with the menu and it's definitely food you don't wanna order to go- just doesn't preserve itself well for a ride home short one at that
The service was fabulous we had more than 4 people attend to our table throughout the evening and our waitress was very helpful with wine & food recommendations
In a time of pretentious breakfast joints yeah I'm talking about you Breakfast Club I love when I find a laidback place to have a great cup of coffee and one of the best breaky sandwiches in town the Dolly - a huge bonus if they will still have one of their delicious homemade cinnamon rolls available
Over Easy offers great food fair prices a good crowd and a friendly staff
Good to know info They have a menu on the bar from the Bar across the way Ice House Tavern where you can get a discount on your drinks if you take your food to eat there or if you want you can grab a few togos from them and Two Hippies will let you drink 'em in their joint
best mix your own cocktail sauce with a huge portion of fresh horseradish to make it hot like I love
The crabmeat and artichoke dip was also tasty
They are overpriced and the food isn't that good
*The food everyone mostly really enjoyed their main courses prime rib ahi tuna crab legs steak and lobster
Asadero Toro may not be much to look at outside or in but they serve high quality Mexican food
THen as we were leaving I spotted a dessert tray that actually had some good looking stuff on it
I got a half size Crunch Roll for an appetizer and an order of Chicken Yakisoba
The crunch roll was very fresh with good quality ingredients crunchy shrimp Tempura crab avocado etc
The yakisoba wasn't quite what I thought it would be in that the noodles and meat were separate not mixed but that didn't affect the quality or flavor
I took my order and walked back to my office where I opened my bag to discover a covered bowl of creamy well seasoned Panang curry next time I will order it hotter sliced chicken breast bell peppers and a side of steamed broccoli and white rice
It's too bad that in Old Town Avondale where one should find really good Mexican food you are getting this stuff
I have to give this restaurant kudos for good food but the time to get the food is not the best
We had hot green tea along with some hot appetizers and sushi
Our tea came out quick along with our appetizers which was the Chicken Yakatori
But there were four people making sushi and we waited over 20 minutes after we were done with our appetizer
They have a wonderful happy hour menu from food and drinks but this is defiantly a place that you need to plan on dining for a while
If you can get past  the oh-to-well-appointed interior design you will eat some good food
The food was reasonably priced and the Swedish meatballs tasted amazing
Even all their side dishes were delicious
but the food itself is worth it so we go back time and again
If you want some expensive gourmet food I highly recommend
Hard to believe this happens but I would not recommend there are better options at the Biltmore for the same price and better food quality
Their rotisserie chicken dish was really good as well
The food isn't going to blow your socks off with any new unique flavor or flare
I've been craving some good middle-eastern food for a while and I found it
The dish came with a cup of lentil soup also excellent flavors or a salad
No idea how good the food would be but were pleasantly surprised
the bbq sauce was a bit too sour for my taste but a good pizza overall
I just went here for the first time and I was surprised by how good the food was since I haven't found a good mexican restaurant since moving to Phoenix
The food here was incredible- I ordered the Green Chile Plate and the beef was melt in your mouth delicious as was the tortilla
The meat bacon cheese lettuce tomatoes avocado etc are stuffed into delicious whole wheat bread they have other types of bread too and the toppings practically over flow out of the sandwich
Hamachi and spicy tuna rolls didn't only taste excellent with awesome quality fish but they were A+ in presentation too
* The chicken bento was excellent and the portions of chicken very generous
All in all though I just hope Hana remains as an unpretentious top quality spot for sushi in town
The food was good with bursts of Italian flavor
I stumbled on it last year after scouring the valley to find a place that resembled good Indian Food
I never salt my food but the mozzarella should have been brined when they made it as it had no flavor
I can't say enough a about the food which was delicious
I was really impressed with the food here and I can't wait to try other items on the menu
What's special about theirs is the fact they don't skimp on any ingredient I got delicious chunks of pig's blood and hearty meat and big stalks of scallions
My husband devoured the chicken caesar salad and barely had room for his hot turkey sandwich turkey and havarti on cranberry walnut bread
I love an open kitchen where patrons can play audience to rising cooking flames and hot dishes ready to be served
Overall though good food and reasonably priced for all you get you won't leave hungry
I'm happy to see some very good food in the baseline corridor
We also had fried provolone for an appetizer which was amazing and the balsamic strawberries for dessert
Baseline RoadGilbert AZ480-926-2046In my continuing quest for good food at reasonable prices I was convinced by two companions to try Black Bear Diner
I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of food
I am not a huge plane fan but the food is worth returning for
We had very good service but what really stands out at Beckett's table is the food
Onto the food -  we started with the Grilled Korean BBQ beef boneless beef short ribs marinated in garlic soy and brown sugar with jasmine rice sesame spinach carrots bean sprouts and green onions - very good great flavor nice portion could even be ordered as your main course IMO
For Dessert I had the Youngberry Chocolate which is Lindeman's Framboise & Young's chocolate Stout together since both were delicious I had to try them together naturally
Walter is a true character and is very passionate about good food
I told him his food was amazing and he said No Not amazing
You know it was good food when you arrive home after 65 miles  still savoring the meal
I chatted with the owner found out they are Korean/Korean-American and immediately started whining about the lack of good Korean food in Phoenix he agreed he's from LA I think
**BUT** he and his wife have a few Korean dishes on the menu so I had the Kalbi Bi Bim Bap which comes sizzling in a stone bowl -  fresh veggies cooked just right kalbi beef over rice fragrant sesame oil topped off with an egg and Korean hot sauce
Probably some of the best quality sushi in the valley
They had plenty of rolls to chose from and the prices were not outrageous they were actually cheap for such good fish
The flavors were good and the bill was $50 for 3 people to order 9 rolls
Dolmades were meatless and served cold they had good flavor but were very mushy
But the food was really nowhere near as good as you would expect
the manager/owner said if you don't like the food thats not my problem i think it is when you only have 4 tables being used on a Friday eveningif you want real tasty authentic food go to Las Cazuelas 16551 N Dysart Rd ste 101 Surprise
Like seriously that is my holy trifecta of late night bar food and this particular bar food was delicious
They basically made 2 dishes there was so much food I couldn't possibly eat a whole order and the sauce was amazing
I personally adore the lamb dish  which is fall off the bone delicious as well as the rib-eye if you are looking for a nice protein
Nothing would make me happier than finding good Indian food in the Phoenix area
The lamb naan was very mediocre - the meat inside was completely dry and not very flavorful
They were flavorful and the spice level was about where I expected it to be but I've definitely had better Indian food before not anywhere in the Phoenix area though
Time to continue the never-ending search for good Indian food
Amazing food shrimp Po BoyVery cleanTons of high end TV's with everything onHowever I don't care for the crowd
For those of you wanting some legit american style chinese food I strongly recommend the Sweet and Sour Beef dinner combo
I would recommend this to anyone who loves Asian food
Meats are high quality and the prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you get
Quaint places with young hip owners offering high quality food and goods make us feel positively about living in an often maligned part of town
The food is very good but is truly trumped by the ambiance which is romantic in a adobe wrapped authentic way
Parmesan steak fries are super good but need a little more sauce on all the potatoes to make this a winning dish
I always try to support local places and I LOVE that they not only brew their own beer here but they don't forget about having delicious food to accompany the beer
Here is what we all ordered and ALL of it is highly recommended the Fish and Chips huge pieces of fresh and crispy fish with deelish beer battered fries Fish tacos tasty grilled mahi mahi with a side of well seasoned black beans Aegan burger apparently the BEST burger my friend has ever tasted we're getting it next time
I highly recommend this place good food good drinks and an all around great time
I sampled some really delicious food yay
The spaghetti with shrimp and the chicken della casa were also really really good but the ravioli was easily the best
Price is definitely worth it for the food service and atmosphere
I didn't get to try the beef and mac n cheese but hubby said the macncheese was good but beef was just average
Anywho Carolina's just has really good Mexican food I like their Chimichangas their burros and their tortillas
I ordered Tempura udon we also ordered some appetizers off the hh menu we got gyoza and sesame chicken
The rolls all sounded amazing but nothing really wowed me
I am elated with the quality I've never been big on street food before but I am a believer now
For a food truck in the days of $5+ hot dogs a ten spot goes a long way at Q-Up I was impressed
This place was amazing the food was so yummy and the chips and salsa amazing
I long ago stopped eating Chinese food entirely--bland piles of flavorless noodles and weird sticky-sweet sauces no thank you
Get a bottle of wine and one of their appetizers cheese dish is good but small
The food is quite tasty and the owner of the restaurant is always milling around checking to see that everyone is having a good time
Not a bad price to pay for great food great wine and quality time with friends
The spring rolls are excellent - very fresh and crispy
I got three rolls that turned out divinely including one baked roll and the sashimi was very good as well
The pizza was also good could have used a little bit less of the bbq sauce
It was love at first bite--the food was served on HOT plates that kept the meal HOT
If you're planning a wedding or event at any Hotel it might be wise to include a performance clause on food service
I agree with Sean as a Chicago native every good 'street food' type joint has the hot dog statue outside and the sports posters and stuff lining the walls
The pita was good enough but the meat was weird-dry and VERY lemony
ONO doesn't begin to cover how amazing this food is
the chicken katsu is good the spam musubi awesome snack when you're out surfing for the day
Food We had a break between meals that included tea and coffee and a bunch of accoutrements like chocolate chips whipped cream cinnamon sticks and flavored syrup
Food is generally what you get at an american restaurant nothing too funky aside from the jicama salad but everything was good
I tried three different things the fish taco carne taco and the hotdog
What really stood out to me was the different sauces they included everyone had a different flavor that really set off the food
All around excellent pizza in a tucked away dive in south Scottsdale
I would recommend it for a sunday cocktail if you can tolerate the heat or if you happen to WORK at tempe marketplace I would suggest the chicken chopped salad
This is a family owned restaurant that serves good high quality food
The shredded beef tacos are amazing and the asada rocks
* Corona And Lime Roast Chicken - this was very good and flavorfulThe service was just ok
I would like to try more of their food because the menu online really does look amazing but it is more trouble than it is worth
The sampler platter included delicious pulled pork mini burgers two potato skins named Pat Tillman potato skins on the menu buffalo chicken wings and chicken tenders
The chicken wings were good but not great it wasn't fall off the bone delicious but it was not overcooked and I enjoyed it
He recommended a chicken bacon and iceberg salad and I had asked for ranch dressing on the side
I'm not sure the food looked amazing but I can definitely speak for the cobbler
I also have enjoyed the spinach quesadilla and taziki but other than that I find the food and service to be mediocre
So I am not easily impressed but always willing to give a new sushi place a shot so naturally had to try this place out
All were excellent and I was most impressed that the spicy tuna roll had more tuna than rice all tasted fresh and delicious
They make the other stuff too but BBQ really should be brisket and all else is novelty bar-B-Q flavored food
This is a place with good food AND great service
my girls scallop dish was just as delicious
what would be great is to have a place like this so more people could see what good healthy food can be
This place offers pretty good food at really low prices
Tender chicken flavorful rice and whatever that cabbage thing was
Nice environment good service pretty good pizza and great ice cream flight for dessert
The good service cool atmosphere tasty bruschetta choices and creative thin crust pizza get this place three stars
The meat was cooked very good because it was beefy and juicy
The fish was pretty good moist inside with a really nice light corn batter
Though currently residing in Queen Creek it's worth the trip now and then for a delicious charbroiled jumbo all beef dog
I ate there not too long ago and the pizza was not nearly as good as it was in the past but it was a fluke thank God
They have a sizable menu - and the quality of the food is pretty darn good all around
The food is TINY and amazingly delicious--Tapas right
I am torn between rating this place a 3 or a 4--We spent 65 dollars plus tip and could have easily spent 20 more for just the 2 of us we went away not really full but the food quality and taste and service was great--then again the seating was cramped and outside would have been more tolerable with just an oscillating fan
The jade red chicken was also delicious as well
I couldn't finish much of the rice and beans because I was so full from the delicious chicken
The food is amazing the coffee is great and the atmosphere is everything you are looking for
room service food is actually really good what a pleasant surprise Service is top notch from the valet to the concierge to room service
Amazing decor great food tapas although it is not very large and a patio that is cooled
They make their own shells and the beef is really tasty
Is pizza worth waiting 3 hours for and putting up with snotty bad service
I appreciate his taste for good food and drink
We ordered the spring rolls and they were delicious
Already off to a weird start our waitress was really spacy like I just hotboxed some primo weed in the bathroom spacy I inquired re the vegetarian spring rolls then the vegetable pho after being told the tofu would be soft and not bean curd friend and asked for the 33 beer
Food - we had the scallops fish olives meats and cheese platter 3 kinds of bruschetta - all was wonderful tasty well prepared and artistically arranged on each plate
I have tried many sushi bars in Phoenix but as far as the quality this location is the best I've had
however that does not reflect the quality of their food
Our food arrived in a timely manner and it was good - not great
I had never been to Cuban Flavor although I am big fan of Cuban food and cuban cigars but nononono I don't smoke them no more
delightful ; they had 3 different types of chicken on the bone all seasoned and prepared differently and all delicious
Chicken Croquettes Beef fish and vegetables and soup all cooked in a Cuban style completed the hot offerings
The smoke ring on the meat was impressive but couldn't really taste the smoky goodness I was looking for
The food is really good all of the nutrition facts are right there on the menu board and they have daily specials so it's affordable
Chiles en Nogada is a twist on the classic Chile Relleno they start with a large fresh poblano pepper stuff it with chicken onions garlic pecans apples and I seem to recall pomegranate and angel dust then top it with an absurdly tasty almond cream sauce
The Sunday brunch is also very much worth checking out particularly for the seafood crepes
I had the barbeque chicken wrap which was very good
When the dishes came out my boyfriend asked me what was in the tacos so i started to push the food around with my fork to get a better look and it's a darn good thing i did because all of a sudden i saw big chunks of fish
The dim sum beef which used to be great has become rubbery and the pork has lost all its flavor
The dirty place and rude waitresses were tolerable because of the good food
not anymore when cold tough meat is served
Now the second time the food STILL was not hot
The waitress was always very nice and courteous and she did offer us a free item to make up for the cold food so she appeared to be trying I just don't understand what the issue was
The other party of 4 who were seated before we even arrived didn't get their food for 15 minutes after our first cold plate
but bottom-line they have great food and a wonderful wine bubbly and beer selection
We decided to try many different dishes and were equally impressed with all
Since I still had room I gave Cork one more shot and ordered a dessert
I suggest the owners go visit some smokehouses in the south - like Loveless Cafe in Nashville - and bring us some new award worthy dishes
The food though is incredibly tasty and has plenty of options for vegitarians and carnivores
I'm only giving this restaurant a 4 because I pay a lot more attention to food quality and taste than I do service
I work til 10pm most nights so its good to have an option that isn't fast food
Sushi wise the Spicy cowboy roll was spicier than their wings and is a really good roll
It is not my favorite Mexican restaurant in the valley but it still has very good food and it is not priced too high
The food is good like a typical Thai place but their prices can be in the high side
Dinner for both us with the appetizer fish cake and combo amuse bouche two dinner entree plus a papaya salad will set you back $72 dollars
It was a bit more than we expected but we did order 3 drinks total an app 3 entrees & dessert so I'd say that it was worth it for the amazingness that is Fez
Good atmosphere great decor amazing food sociable staff loose seating coucheschairscoffee tableetc
It has been a while since we stopped by as we are loyal to O'Connors but we heard the food was good so we got a late lunch one afternoon
When the food came out I just wasn't impressed if I recall correctly it was 11 dollars for 2 pieces of fish and some french fry's and I left still feeling hungry
I really enjoyed the wise guy pizza which has fennel sausage and to which we added mushrooms--good call
A surprising fave was the cheeseless pizza which had a really richflavorful tomato sauce and went well with the wine we ordered can't remember the name but it was a local wine [who woulda thought Arizona has good wines
] a sangiovese All in all we had a lovely evening and everyone in the group enjoyed the pizzas
i think there were different favorites among everyone so all pizzas can and should be recommended
This last weekend I visited The Herb Box for the first time and truly enjoyed the food
Nobody had any real complaints about the food quality/quantity/taste at our table of 12
Friend Excuse me sir can we place our orderWaiter You already have orderedFriend Oh that was so long ago I forgotI genuinely enjoyed the food and am thankful I had a group of friends with me that helped occupy the time while we waited
We shared a crudite edamamme dumplings outrageous and the delicious kale salad and then I had the panang chicken curry over brown rice which was rich flavorful and spicy
The Greek salad had such awesome flavor; my hubby actually loved it and he doesn't usually eat green food
I had the puttenesca pizza even though the server didnt highly recommend it she didnt like shrimp
=  Of course the food was delicious yet again
Consistently good service & food and I never miss the garlic fries
Pizzas are a good choice as well if you're dining alone
At $15 the sashimi combo at Stingray is $2 more than the same dish at RA across the street in Kierland however the Stingray combo had a side cucumber salad and the miso soup here was more rich and flavorful than the miso at RA
Now for the bad The food is overpriced for it's quality
Great little dive with good food a fun ambiance and fast service
The pork was great no mushy spots full of flavor plenty of meat in the bun
-1 Our Toscano pizza was not impressive with the flavor nor the ingredients
I definitely recommend this place for your next pizza dinner
40 minutes later a gigantic deep dish pizza came out that was delicious
Excellent service delicious food and comfortable interior
The deep dish pizza is as good as advertised
For a little more money we enjoyed fantasic sushi in a tiny and cozy space with great energy and wonderful service
When it comes to the food I wasn't especially impressed
I thought the food and service was very good
We liked the attentive service from the polite young hipsters that work for this hotel; everyone from the valets to the check-in person to the food servers in the restaurant were striving for the best in our humble opinions
tasty food and nice place to enjoy HH drink for sure
It's like ciabatta meets pita bread in a wood-fired oven - and every bit as good as his pizza dough
Add to that some of the best meats cheeses and other deliciousness available and you've got one heck of a great sandwich
The appetizers were really small for the price and although the mango avocado spring rolls sound delicious they weren't that tasty
My nine inch ham mushroom and black olive pizza was delicious; perfectly complemented by a house salad with raspberry vinaigrette
The pizza was served hot with plenty of toppings the salad was crisp and tasty and most importantly it was ready right when I got there
I used to come here a lot with one of my co-workers because she enjoyed ogling the help and also because the chicken pita with lemon mustard sauce was delicious
How can you get better than a pie crust wrapped around anything from salmon and asparagus  greek feta chicken -to a thanksgiving meal - and wash it down with a cold beer- this place is a must taste- and you're hooked
the only let down was the chicken and dumplings which were bland flavorless and lacking a good amount of chicken
Order hamburgers hot dogs chicken or steak and cook it yourself on one of the many barbecue grills
The only good thing I order is the meatball sub
We have never tried their pizza's and from what I hear they are amazing
On the plus side the food was excellent
The mesquite chicken is good however it was GREAT 20 years ago
If you're looking for a caffeine fix some good food and a cool cozy atmosphere you won't be sorry
I will say I did like the hot tea we started out with and my husband got the $3 extra soup  egg roll  crab puff add on
My husband thought the soup was good and the egg roll was crispy
At this point the service didn't bother me because I thought the food would be good
The thick chicken soup or sauce didn't taste good it seemed house made but it seemed like they didn't use any aromatics or salt or pepper in preparation and instead of good the sauce tasted like the way raw chicken smells also lacking any Asian Seasoning
The beef was tough but it was seasoned but not in a good way it was very salty and I think like you dumped soy sauce on it
Chicago Style dog was really good and said he'd stop there whenever we get bad food out
If you want good short order style fish and chips go out to a real restaurant like the Fish Market/Blue Water try the Hidden House on Fridays
I prefer the beef on the hot stone and it's done medium rare of course
I'm a bisque snob  Good job to Wildfish and their staff
The brawny good-looking traveler resembling Jay Bush from the baked bean commercials produced an iPhone from his pocket and with one touch signaled the powerful Yelp mobile application to locate an oasis of food service in the area
Perhaps the only thing hotter was the food in the restaurant behind them
The food quality was okay but nothing special
the meal comes with an appetizer of fried onions and green peppers crispy not soggy or greasy choice of 2 entrees each with 2 sides and an apple pie a la mode for dessert
Good quality Thai staples here - I almost always go with the basil chicken - and you do get the option of naming your spice level
Coming from NYC I had my fair share of disappointing attempts at finding good sushi but Sapporo actually has remained on the top of my list for AZ for the 4 years that I have been here
Their happy hour is pretty good although they recently raised their pricing $5 for a California roll during Happy Hour
My favorite rolls include the shrimp tempura roll Alaskan roll and sautee roll pricey but worth it- to me at least
If you can handle not being able to hear the person with whom you're dining in exchange for really fresh sushi and good drink deals 50% off plus 75 cents then try it out
The meat is very flavorful and has a great grilled essence happening and the toppings put this burger over the top
The BLT burger was also good but the meat and the smokiness of the bacon really overpowered the toppings
Not a bad thing as delicious meat and smokey bacon are great but other flavors were lost here
I will tell you the VERY thick juicy and tasty meat literally fell off the VERY large bone when simply picked up from the plate
Pasta with meat sauce was very tasty even though it was sent back to the kitchen twice
Chicken shawarma is tasty has lots of flavor comes with ample amounts of veggies and sauce
I am giving this place five starts because while it is not the most excellent afghan food I have had many of their dishes are delicious and we really need more of these types of places here and phoenix and what more
I do advise to order ahead of time if you are taking out they can take a while to get out the dishes but when they do it is worth the wait
The filling at Fan Boy was quite good marinated chicken in a Gochujang style sauce green onions sesame seeds and kimchee
Staff was nice and good atmosphere some decent music but food was just moderate
My wife said the vermicelli and veggies were good but was not fan of the fake beef
Even if you order your food to go they take extra care to pack everything nice and when you get home it is as good as you would have in the restaurant
Lots of great hot food crepes omelets grilled meats and wood fired pizza's with little tables set up under tents
It was obviously a good cut of meat and had been seasoned very nicely
A real chicken breast right there in my sandwich with a fresh roll around it not chucked nor reformed nor anything but tasty and real
Same goes for the pad thai although the Thai BBQ Chicken and #63 Gwediaw Graprao noodles are both excellent
And Gwediaw Graprao are wide rice noodles with a smoky flavored peppery sauce with wok fried broccoli and tomatoes and your choice of meat
For dessert the coconut ice cream with optional crushed peanuts is delicious and compliments the spicy food perfectly
Although the egg rolls are cheap most of the appetizers like the mee krob thai toast and fish cakes aren't worth it IMO
Great meal on all levels the waitress was super nice too so much good food for the money and so many other delicious looking options on the menu I will definitely be back loved it
Overall it's pricey compared to other sushi places however the ambiance of the restaurant and upscale choices on the menu make it worth it
Now we're both from Southern California so we've been quite spoiled with fresh fish so when we found Sakana on Yelp we were a bit skeptical but with the reviews we took a shot at it
The tacos were on soft corn tortillas that could barely contain all the super flavorful beef red & green pepper and onion
It was good  enough that I  definitely plan to have lunch one day next week  and try some  of the dishes  that others have raved about
went with a food group and thoroughly enjoyed myself
the rest of the group had yellow curry dishes which i samples and were ok fried rice which is hard to screw up and they did not and sliced beef dish in a tangy sauce also good
If you look gut busting delicious food with a 50's diner feel this place is for you
I wanted to try a bunch of appetizers and stuff on the menu but my tacos were like 19 bucks so I figured it would be a ton of food so I just ordered the entree
The dish came with what they called fries but they were basically baked potato chips but they were quite good
It came with the same delicious 'fries' that came with my dish as well as a red cabbage Sauerkraut which was decent but had a minor beet flavor to it
Overall we enjoyed the food but it was a little pricey and I'm not sure we will make it back soon but it was worth a shot
Bland flavor no meat no tomatoes no herbs vague cheese could not find any filling between the lasagna layers - it looked like stacked noodles
Everything was simply prepared and delicious like comfort food
I very much enjoy the food and the owners are so friendly and really go out of their way to make sure you have a good experience
Let's start with the basics-- the food was pretty good in its simplicity
Not necessarily the kind of place you will take your date unless she's blind and hungry but man oh man is the food ever good
Long story short the meat is delicious and it's well worth trying out
The crabmeat and cabbage enchiladas regular menu were a tasty light appetizer
The beet cake dessert with carrot gelato was definitely unique and surprisingly good
I will say the food is amazing and that the Santa Monica location is awesome
Servers was good and the food came out within 10 mins of ordering it
Was totally amazed that soy protein cooked properly can be just as good  if not more tasty than meat
The Food at Loving Hut is delicious the atmosphere intriguing; WTF is the supreme master
If you don't know amazing food when it hits you in the mouth then you wouldn't have seen the expertise and great hands behind this restaurant
I am giving it a 3 because the food is very good
I would go here again because the food is pretty good but only during the week
My family is big into sharing so I got to try the beef tenderloin good and came with a tasty chipotle potato the chicken special chicken with green chile and really good goat cheese polenta the pork tenderloin this was maybe the best thing it had a really flavorful sauce and horseradish mashed potatoes and the ribs flavorful but a little drier than I prefer
a lot of wedding food isn't amazing but it works because it works for big groups
Perhaps because I'm a director of food and beverage for a large hotel I'm overly-picky but overall I was very underwhelmed by my stay; not a 2-star quality hotel in my view
Though the meat section is still small the quality has increased
Yes I am a meat-eating moderately conservative Republican and I'm sure I stick out like a sore thumb in that store but like everyone these days my shopping decisions are largely made on a combination of price and quality - and people who are forced into eating a restricted diet should not have to pay dearly for it either
We shared a hummus appetizer and I had a large Greek Salad with chicken
However that is unlikely to happen because the food is damn tasty
One thing I have noticed now days sandwiches are expensive and its nearly impossible to find a place that gives a good amount of food at a reasonable price
I got a roast beef sandwich and it was actually very tasty
I was even daring enough to try the chicken pate toast and was surprised at how flavor that one was the pickled onions on top of it were sweet and crunchy perfectly contrasting the smooth and salty chicken liver
We ordered hot green tea to start with then I ordered the won ton soup and my mom ordered a dinner special that was chicken chow mien with friend rice 2 crab puffs and 1 egg roll I ate the crab puffs -D
Most of the food was fresh and hot almost too hot
I feel like opening a hot dog stand right down the street and would probably provide better service and food
I do love the Oregano's Favorite salad and the pizza cookie but everything else- from the wait time to the pizza- are not worth going
An excellent choice for authentic Mexican food
My dining companions enjoyed the chicken enchiladas and the cheese quesadillas
The food was as excellent as all of the other reviewers stated
I am sad to say the lack of timing really disappointed us I would return because the food and service were excellent but I would not recommend it for big groups
My sub was tasty but just a roastbeef and cheese sub on a cursty roll
Pizza comes piping hot and cheesy with baby mini pepperonis and sausage
I got some vegan gf donuts that taste a lot like gingerbread in addition to the herb baguette rolls vegan banana cupcakes vegan chocolate chip cookies and hot dog buns
But its also a great place for a casual dinner and they have pretty damn good food for a bar with peanuts on the ground
I had the Chicken Jack sandwich which I always get and it was good
That summer I experienced good food good company and a fun atmosphere
The Spotted Donkey brought back memories of all the things I loved about that summer good food good company and a fun atmosphere
It's a 1/2-pound of greasy goodness 70/30 beef cooked with pork fat topped with a 1/4-inch thick slice of yellow cheese which I'm hard-pressed to believe was real cheese
If you don't like spicy food make sure you request a mild flavor for any of the dishes
The cafe not the restaurant serves up good food pretty quickly
The beans were equally as amazing as the pork with chunks of BBQ meat mixed it awesome
When I got home to eat my food I wasn't very impressed with the portion size for the money and the food was so bland to top it off
NOT IMPRESSEDFYI the best place for Vietnamese food in my opinion is Noodles Ranch located @ the SE Corner of Thomas & Scottsdale road in Scottsdale
They place has nice small appetizers and boatloads of crepes either for dinner or dessert
The ONLY food item worth getting at this place is the breakfast burrito
My favorite pizza at La Bocca which I strongly recommend is the truffle mushroom but make sure you like spinach before you decide to order this pizza
A beef or pork not sure and rice dish came next and it was also very good
Finally the dessert not something I usually do was excellent
The beer garden was a brilliant addition and 100% of the profits from it go to support Community Food Connections the wonderful organization that keeps downtown Phoenix from being a true food desert
I would highly recommend this pizza to all meat lovers
The meatloaf was nicely flavored and moist the potatoes were great and the gravy tied everything together nicely
I mean the rest was good enough to forgive the roll issue
As a real-life Japanese American I am extremely finicky when it comes to good sushi -- something I'm finding is rare in Phoenix
I couldn't deny that the ingredients were fresh and delicious and ultimately it does come down to the food
They've got a decent selection of pastries and light lunch foods and also serve smoothies and other icy treats which are definitely welcome during hot Arizona summers
I was in a party of three and we had a lot of good laughs and ate a lot of sushi
We had a party of 6 and enjoyed the roast beef sandwich caprese sandwich caesar salad and grilled cheese
The crusty baguette sandwich rolls were a little on the dry side but still very tasty
The bread is amazing; it's soft yet toasted enough to where it crackles when grasping the sub and the process of steaming the meat releases flavors that are unmatched at any other sandwich establishment
Anyway I guess I can't compare here and Chicago and likely won't find a place comparable but it still below average italian beef and I would not recommend it
I had never tasted pasties before until meeting my girlfriend and had doubts as to the potential quality of British food but I was truly blown away and have always left happy and never dissatisfied with my meal
It's hard to not stick to your favorites the pesto chicken I've personally also enjoyed the Shepherd's pie and chicken Alfredo as well
The soup was good and the chicken they use in it is white meat which I thought was a nice touch
The meat tasted like it had been cooked long ago and frozen or something and the sandwich just wasn't very flavorful or fresh tasting
Complete lack of focus and concern for the quality of the food being sent out
I returned the spoiled and sour chicken twice and after the third time I just tossed the $18 worth of rotten meat into the trash
Excellent service + excellent food + excellent ambiance = highly recommended
The timing of the appetizers main course and dessert was also flawless
The food itself was excellent everyone enjoyed their meal
Too many good Thai places close by with better food for less money
The food was really good and my only issue was the wait
The wait is because the place is tiny but the pizzas take time and any bigger of a restaurant would lower the quality of the pizza
I really enjoyed the marinara pizza- just plain with only sauce and garlic
I shared a seafood plate with my husband and I also ordered the family hot pot
The seafood was actually pretty fresh tasting especially the shrimp but everything else just seemed a little bland lacking in a flavor
All in all the food was ok but not necessarily worth the drive at least from where I am
What an amazingly cute friendly bakery that serves some delicious food
Their food is pretty good but I wouldn't really classify this as a dining destination - this place is about the beer
We got spring rolls for an appetizer and it was served traditional with the lettuce
Its hard to find good asian food in general in Phoenix especially vietnamese so I was elated to be introduced to this place
I also had cucumber rolls that were tasty and nicely done
This second visit of mine I met a few friends from school who were devouring a 's-wonderful thin crusted pizza topped 's-marvelous bits of mushrooms and smothered in a 's-awful-ly nice blanket of cheese
The food = mehThe patio and service = pretty good
She recommended Fire Rock Pale Ale the Spicy Ahi Tempura Roll Jewelled Beef Noodles and the Surf and Turf with Vegetable Fried Rice
The flavors are fantastic and the chicken is moist and perfectly cooked
I did try the steak as well and while it was still really good I wouldn't pick it over the chicken unless I needed a change of pace meal
Expect top quality sushi at a top quality sushi price
The unagi roll was a bit chewier than I'm used to but delicious in it's own right although the unagi sashimi was definitely better
The best of the best award goes to the seared sesame salmon nigiri which is the most melt-in-your-mouth fish experience known to man as well as the crispy prawn roll which isn't heavy or fried but still so deliciously well
Yes even though they charge a lot they don't skimp on the fish and it'll probably be the best quality sushi you have in Arizona
I've had pizza beer bread burgers appetizers and wings and they have never let me down
I had their vegetable beef soup good but salty and my husband had house salad
The food around us did not look appealing so we ordered the appetizer platter
I ordered the #1 KK's - the chicken and waffles were both pretty good but both fell short of Roscoe's here in LA
The chicken was a bit dry and just didn't have enough flavor and the waffles didn't have that hint of cinnamon that Roscoe's has
Jon wasn't wowed by the roast beef slider but I thought it was pretty good
A little pricey but the food was really good
Served in a very hot stone bowl along with tortillas refried beans and guacamole this dish is something we will go back for again and again
The food is excellent the staff are very friendly and some of them are the originals from the old place
Upscale Chinese restaurant excellent food not-Chinese-food-cheap but worth your money 4/5We were glad when we found out and tried out this restaurant in our neighborhood
As a Chinese myself I would definitely recommend this restaurant to any Chinese food lover
The dimsum was good too but I am more fond of its dishes with steam rice
Tickets were $17 bucks with a two purchase drinks/food minimum we went to the 9 show which was drinks/appetizers only
There is no question that the food is of a good quality--nothing even close to NY but for Scottsdale it is fine
They have a nice salad bar and hot food bar
The mac 'n' cheese from the hot bar is pretty good and I really like the BBQ chicken I tried once
Definitely pizza place looking for sure and crowded so we assumed it would be good
This is an adorable place with good service fantastic food
A little expensive for Mexican food but definitely worth it
I think the prices were fair for lunch and the food was pretty good but the service was horrible
I've seen lots of good reviews on Yelp and have been really hungry for good NY style pizza
From my experience cooking pizza at home it means the oven was too hot
I have only good things to say of the owner but would recommend he retrain his employees in the art of customer service and the food that is on the menu
I've sadly become one of those people who turn to the Food Network for restaurant recommendations
the chicken was cold and i ended up leaving most of it on the plate - the salad overall was yummy
Like its name Jalapeno Inferno Bistro Mexicana has a correspondingly large food menu & drink menu and it was all really good
So I hope that it improves because it really is a good vegetarian dish on the menu
Go for the gargantuan meat selection the amazing produce section the huge food court the salsa bar the bakery and the fun atmosphere
Lots of other delicious dishes salads & desserts to choose from & all in all it was a great lunch as usual
The service was great and the food was once again amazing
From what the manager told us and I failed to realize because we were having such a good time enjoying the scenery was that our food was about ten minutes later then it was suppose to be
I wasn't impressed with the food or the service for that matter
Fancy read expensive food should be an explosion of complex flavor in my mouth
The fried chicken was pretty good but I've had the same quality stuff from the deli at Safeway
A good chicken pie needs only flaky pastry rich gravy and tender chicken--not peas corn and tomatoes
The beef dish was not much better but did have a pleasant fennel- like flavor
Their pizza was really good I am a pizza sauce type of guy
The thin crust pizzas are tasty with just the right amounts of cheese and sauce
On a visit where I ventured away from pizza I was very impressed by the shells florentine - large pasa shells filled with spinach & artichoke hearts mixed with oh-so-melty cheese glorious cheese
The staff is friendly and the food is excellent
If you want really good food at a price you can't beat try this place
A beef sans fries sweet peppers with hot on the side and a large ice tea set me back around ten bucks
The beef  itself was not too bad thinly sliced on a passable piece of bread but really void of flavor and not temperature hot
I'm not sure why they call the rolls centers but I do know that they are really big and really good and really gooey
Chicken and waffles combined are delicious sin
Soul food in general is usually delicious sin if you are counting calories but counting calories shouldn't even be thought of if entering this place; you'll want to try everything
By everything I mean chicken waffles grits eggs home fries Kool-Aid and many many more goodies that are served here and trust me you should try as much as you can
I enjoy going to Joe's Farm Grill not just because of the food utterly amazing onion rings but also because of the surrounding location
I'm not saying this is the best Chinese food anywhere but I'm just saying most of what I tried was better than what I can get near me and most of what I took was very good
The chicken and broccoli was actually delicious and so was the yummy Asian Eggplant dish
Someone can actually cook here and make some good food
I love their BBQ pizza and while their delivery takes some time its always worth it
Rosie McCaffrey's The short The best no-frills bar food I've had in a long time in a dim but clean and cheery pub environment with decent service--a good addition to a list of dependable casual standbys
I love a good Reuben and Rosie's Reuben is solid--grilled-crisp bread tender and succulent flavorful corned beef not overdressed gooey cheese that doesn't take over--so good
The orange chicken here is very different than other recipes I've had but it is good
I do miss the spicy kick of the orange chicken recipes that have red and black peppers but I also realize that would screw up THIS recipe because it would overpower the other flavors
The prices of everything are especially fair considering the quality of food
Eden's is a small family-owned restaurant where we have received good service and good food on multiple occasions
I could tell it was quality meat and the bread was tasty but dense and thick
It would seem that this place at least tries to live up to its image and the food here is quality
The food itself was worth every penny and the selection of specialty teas was endless
The tomato sauce tasted really fresh and the meatballs were amazing
The seafood stew was full of flavor but the serving was really small
The dessert the night I went didn't sound very good so I took a pass on it
We started off with the chips & guac which was pretty fantastic spicy as well but I love a good kick to my food & the pinot noir which is fabulous
That's part of the appeal for me - it had immediate hidden gem potential provided that the food service and ambiance were all high quality
You will get a plate of quite edible food here for your dollar will get good attentive service and will leave full--just don't expect anything special in terms of taste
Two varieties of sushi that we tried were excellent as well
The only downside to having your food prepared before your eyes is that you are presented with wonderful aromas during the entire preparatory process
But I've heard good things about their food in general and I was completely unimpressed
I doubt I'll even go back to give the pizza a try too many delicious pizza places around to waste my time
The food was priced much too high for the quality and service
He had some type of Sushi rolls and said they were really good
Thought we would grab some dessert on the way back to the hotel from sushi
Reminds me of a Dairy Queen or Fosters Freeze with the combination of a hot food menu
The chicken was hot and the biscuit was ice cold topped with ice cold gravy
Our server was at another table so after the manager dropped off food at a table next to ours we flagged her over asking for a hot biscuit with hot gravy
I think I had the most shocked look on my face as she offered to reheat the chicken which was was hot and the eggs leaving the biscuit off completely
My response was I just want hot food as she says well I can't do anything about that
I don't know what they're NOT doing but when Smashburger just down the street is creating a burger of kings jam-packed with SMASH flavor I can't help but be disappointed at the lifeless patty of beef crying out for a savior of spice
The food presentation is very nice and it tastes good too
There is a Starbucks attached to the hotel and various food options nearby
Last time we visited was Monday following NASCAR weekend and waited a good 45 minutes for our food after waiting 20 minutes to order
Food was still good but just not enough staff to cover the crowd
The pizzas were vaguely interesting in theory but not very good in practice
I would certainly not come here again and pay  given their extraordinary prices a large and small pizza two sodas and a garlic bread appetizer for $52
The pizzas on their menu are unique and delicious and they have a great selection of toppings if you want to create your own
Not too expensive and I feel that the quality of food provided is excellent and consistent
The FoodWe started with the jumbo shrimp appetizer which unfortunately came with 3 shrimp - hardly conducive to sharing - so we ordered two
Management did not offer to refund us for 1st ruined item but offered another item like an appetizer for free and then was rude when we commented about the fact that we didn't like the fact the chicken was breaded
IMO soul food can be really really good or it can be really really bad
Ok to start off with I'd like to say that the beer and food were both good but I have to give this place 1 star because the service was absolutely abysmal
There's nothing special about the rolls at sushi station but the price is a lot cheaper than grocery store sushi and the quality is much better
The tuna and avocado roll the salmon and avocado roll and spicy crunchy salmon roll were all good
Every special roll most appetizers and most salads have shell fish in it
The turkey sandwich and pizzas are pretty good
Before my food arrived I was given some bread to munch on and it looked really good I took one bite and remembered Patricks review of the dough tasting like tap water
Sunday evening second visit As for the food experience while good I'd give it a 3 stars overall
But you would be wrong the food really is good here commensurate with the price
The honey chicken and spicey chicken are also good
Their meatless chicken wings are really good and have a realistic texture
Of the dishes I did try I was most impressed by the Sesame Chicken
Food was delivered within 15 minutes and was delicious
Note They have a deal for $35 per person with never ending Mimosas and an appetizer entree and dessert
It reminded me of a frozen California Pizza Kitchen crust that is slightly undercooked - note this is not a good thing
They have a good selection of food from Enchiladas burritos and fajitas to mararitas and salsa
The serving was ginormous and HOT when the food came out
The burrito is average but the meat is a bit chewy and salty chicken and beef  The quality of meat was the problem I had with my previous burrito and not much has changed in the many years since my last visit to a Chipotle
The prices are low and they serve a bizarre array of food from hot dogs and hamburgers to fish and chips to dolmas
Our food arrived while we were working on our appetizer
The Tom Yum Soup was good too -- but the chunks of chicken and veggies seemed sparse in the quart size container
Was staying at the Ritz Carlton and wanted to find some good food close by that wasn't a chain restaurant
Tried the two taco meal and did the server's recommendation to try one Fish Taco and one Pernil Asado Tacos their specialty
Both were amazing but the Fish Taco won out in my book they are my weakness
Little did she know that I had eaten the same exact dish a month prior and enjoyed it thoroughly
If you are looking for good Vietnamese food I suggest either going to Glendale's Little Saigon or if in the East valley try Scottsdale's Dong Phuong
This place was recommended for their seafood
Rolls were good but the rice was a bit on the dry sideService was excellent but the sushi did take awhile I assume this is because of the new-ness of the placeI did LOVE the fact that they had fresh wasabi extra charge and it was pureedI did LOVE that they had Vietnamesse iced coffee and sweet green tea
As for the food it was not greasy at all and did not give me a stomach ache which is a good thing
Trust me I visit Thailand nearly every year so I know what Thai food is supposed to taste like and this place actually did a surprisingly good job
My first thought as I came in the door was how good the food smelled
She knew the menu and made excellent suggestions concerning the food
I give the restaurant five stars for being unique and fun with and having what excellent food
If you have to wait  just the smell of the food as you walk in the door will tell you it is worth it
We started with the spring rolls which had an excellent dipping sauce
My fiancee ordered the Sweet and Sour Chicken and really liked it which is good as sometimes she does not like the fake meat
I used the spring roll dipping sauce for the shrimp and would recommend getting a dipping sauce with this dish
Food came it was good nothing worth the 44 minute wait
There are way too many places in Scottsdale that provide good service and great food
I was not expecting anything other than good food and average service
We wanted to try a Sonoran hot dog after seeing them on Food Wars but Tucson was too far
When you don't see any Asians in a Chinese restaurant on Saturday night it gives you a pretty good idea as to what kinda food they serve
The pizza is still good but it makes me think
The chicken was hot and spicy very good and the service was pretty quick took less than 10 minutes there was a good amount of ppl waiting inside as well as outside chilling outside
I think the goodness level kind of depends on you as you add the ingredients including seasonings sauces veggies meat and starch
I thought this was going to be the only flavor source for the food so I used too much
But the fact is they do an excellent job of offering a wide variety of dishes such that you can eat here often and not have to order the same thing
The food here is not sweet at all and hence good news for your pre-diabetes but bad news for your craven palette
Food seems about the same as other locations I've been too - overall fairly good quality good prices at happy hour or lunch specials and overpriced at any other time
Friday night and Im wanting to go somewhere with a cool atmosphere and some good drinks and mabey some good food
That fish is good and doesnt need a sauce like that
Im not sure if all the good reviews are from people that got sidetracked from the atmosphere or if they dont know food and thought they were eating something special or if they had to many drinks before the food
I started with half of the beef and it was good spicy but the chicken was amazing
My dish was very flavorful and the recommendation of the server was to eat the dumpling with the sauce
I ordered pasta with lamb delicious and we also enjoyed Jidori chicken a specially made vegetarian pasta dish and to-die-for falafel
In addition to all of the other reviews that are right on target I want to share that I had before today enjoyed FW's happy hour with reduced sushi prices
The pieces of fish were generously cut and the flavor and freshness of the fish was to die for
However we were already enjoying the great music and good food when we realized the music was swagtastic and that we hadn't heard such good music anywhere else we'd been so far in AZ
Excellent seasoning this is some of the best fried chicken I have ever had from a restaurant
The wait staff is very polite decor is chic and the food is good
The spring rolls are good but I prefer their calamari with the aioli sauce
When your food arrives it looks good and is well-plated
But what I do remember is the gold lining a delicious dessert version of a peanut butter cup
I am not the best sushi critic being that I am vegetarian but I think they have pretty good veggie rolls and edamame  I mostly enjoy the atmosphere and the drinks here
Great food selection but there are always out of stock on home goods
The food was good including a very tasty raw vegetable salad
Unique Ecuadorian/Peruvian/South American food with good flavors excellent presentation and a good variety
If you're looking for some unique flavors & food combinations that are sure to impress check this place out
I can't say that I have had a Crab Cake appetizer with so much crab meat in it and without excessive breading and just the right blend of spices to make each bite sing
and looking straight over the food counter into the kitchen where the cooks are lovingly tossing and stretching each piece of dough by handTHE AVERAGE  Bland decor and cafeteria style furniture  that they seem to have inherited from previous incarnation of this locationTHE UGLY   The fillings here have flavors so subtle bland that I couldn't taste much
+3Food was fresh piping hot and the egg rolls were actually delicious-there is not a lot of spice here but the flavors are good
Falafel only 2 i was hoping for 3Garlic Lemon Chicken w/ Pine NutsSoooo good
I've been to Padre's several times with local friends and have always enjoyed the food and atmosphere
From the opening appetizers of guacamole salsa chips and margaritas to our main dishes the food was great
The food is consistently okay with two marked exceptions - the delicious artichoke hummus and the absolutely terrible falafel
Following a great restaurant set up is amazing food
Food is good but in my experience their beer makes the meal
However it is really great food and worth every penny
The food & service at Wildflower are still excellent
It is casual with really good food but plays loud top 40 music with great drinks
Luckily they're saved the  really good food that they have
We were given a free night for losing ten dollars worth of food
I'm happy to pay good money for an excellent food experience but mediocre food at $$$$$ prices is just grossly annoying
Two reasons Here's the crux of my beef I like the peanut butter flavor
There are days when it is hit or miss and I agree that is not a good thing but on the hit days and for me even on the miss days I love this pizza
That way you try the delicious ooey-gooey pizza fresh and delicious in all of its splendor
This is the closest place that offers a decent bowl of pho my comfort food on a cold or cloudy day
And the Bun was good but the same as the sandwich salty beef
poor food quality terrible service Inconsistant food quality and inexperienced employees
They have just set the bar low on food quality and taste
Want my junk food to taste good if I'm going to splurge with this type of caloric intake
Deep fried opa squash has a flaky texture like swordfish and was also quite good
The food really is quite good with a handful of intriguing dishes and worth the trip
i have to say i'm picky about cold slaw on my sandwich but this was a great combo the dressing the meat and cold slaw it was a great symphony in my mouth
And consistency is a very rare quality to find in these kind of fast food-like restaurants
I did incorporate the andouille into a traditional Louisiana staple red beans and rice which was delicious but I felt it was best used in place of linguica on top of pizza
A wonderfully massive Wood Fired Chicken mounted upon a bed of mashed potatoes floating by to another monkey's tree
I can't help but feel taken care of both in her concern for my enjoyment and in the freshness and high quality of the food served to me
Prices up service and food quality down and more and more fake rolexes
I highly recommend the Fish Shticks - imitation crab rolled & fried in tempura batter topped w/ spicy tuna and a sweet aioli
Nearly every time the food has been well prepared and delicious plus the service was always attentive
I don't know if there is a new chef / owner or what but the food is not as good as before and our dishes very greasy
my friend has THE spiciest dish i've tasted in a long time - outweighed the hottest curry i've even had lately
Get the box deal with toast fries chicken fingers delicious
Chicken is always super juicy and steaming hot on the inside I don't know how the owner does it but it's amazing every time
Had the seafood platter to start which was amazing
I know food to a certain extent is all about personal taste and the food was good just different than what I am used to is all
Everything I've ever eaten here has been delicious and that includes the food I've taken off other people's plates
and to be honest I'm a connoisseur of Mexican food I'd like to think and for a place like this their refried beans and tortillas are pretty good  i get the basic eggs and hashbrowns with a side of tortillas and beans and it's soooo good
The Staff is always pleasant and there are so many wonderful dishes to choose from my ultimate favorite is the misoyaki butterfish with the forbidden black rice
they have a great happy hour and a prefix menu which allows for most to get a taste of the wonderful food they have without breaking the bank
I started off dinner with an appetizer of cucumber rolls - light and tasty
That being said we went out today to go to Tomo since we hadn't been in awhile and were craving good food we left somewhat disappointed
The food at Tomo is always delicious and never fails to impress
The sushi is amazing cooked dishes equally as good and the portions are great for the prices
When he looked at my remote unit for my pool that controlled the water feature he was honest enough to tell me that he didn't have expertise in this area and recommended another company who did
Had enough of bad service bars with 22 yr gals dressed in slutty outfits to know that nothing food good is going to happend out of this experiment
My companion had the chicken with lemon and artichoke it was good but I preferred my moussaka
No the rest of the grounds are too gorgeous and the dishes we had at the restaurant in the hotel J&G Steakhouse are too good
They do however have good pizza for relatively good prices
Extra star because the staff was amazingly nice and I almost felt bad for how disappointing the food was
First thing you should know about Old Dixie's It is a food truck and thus you should visit their website to find where they actually will be located when you have a hankering for delicious food
Second thing you should know about Old Dixie's Jen one of the co-owners is amazing and will happily chat with you about the source of every ingredient featured on their menu the methodology behind the various dishes and anything else you desire
Third thing The chicken biscuit and gravy sandwich is amazing
I am from Southern CA Chinese and am extremely impressed about the food
There might be a wait but the staff and food is excellent
by crap pizza I mean its fun not fancy and just basic thrown together sauce cheese and toppings goodness
Secondly the sushi rice was not as good as I am accustomed to from them and I don't know why they would mess with it
The sushi still tastes good but as I said they did something weird with the rice recently
Oh yeah and the food's good too so that doesn't hurt
Most of the food is very good although I've had one or two things that I would put into the just okay category
lamb and spinach pizza thing-a-majig was NOT good
The flavors of the foods are amazing really rich and sometimes a bit complex
Choices include pizza hot dogs White Castle popcorn chicken nachos ice cream soft pretzels and the usual suspects like candy popcorn soda and icee
The place was PACKED which is always a good sign in an area chock full of food within walking distance
Fish is always fresh and its nice that sushi was added to the menu not amazing but a solid option
We also shared the daily raw fish appetizer which was yellowtail
No it's not cheap but it is quality tasty sustainable food
All were pretty good but a bit pricey $10 eachSo here comes the food
I love both these dishes because they are tasty and light
One of the only positive things about working in the financial services industry is that no one seems to care if you take a 2 hour lunch in order to make your way in to the hood for some really good food
If you appreciate dive-like settings with a good food and/or b good service then you'll like Chuckbox
its not a bad place and if you get here early the sushi is pretty good but they dont seem to take the old hours old stuff down
The chicken chilaquilles are fantastic and the steak and eggs are amazing
You know to fit all that food in to get your money's worth
The service is not always the best but the food has always been excellent
I would recommend it for anyone that loves Indian food like I do
I had an avocado roll and the veggie roll sans cream cheese which were both good
I tried the sweet potato fries pass- too greasy no crunch; the mac 'n cheese the sausage chunks did wonders for this dish; the watery cheese sauce made this dish a definite pass; and the delicious award-winning apple pie WINNER but lose the chunk of cheddar
It's a little dangerous because their sushi is very good and sushi is really not very economical for lunch
The crunchy roll is incredibly good but it's not a steal at $9
The food is really quite good for a fast casual Japanese restaurant
Each dish comes with a great helping of hot rice which I also love
And all that's well and good but it wouldn't mean anything if the food sucked right
The soup is loaded up with chicken cheese pico de gallo rice avocado on top along with chips and lots of tasty flavors
well I guess that not fair to say because I have never tried any other taco because the chicken tacos are that good
I don't mindI am astonished at how well the flavors of the rich and meaty green pork chili work with the fresh fluffy eggs in the omelet
I remember seeing them in the airport then in Scottsdale Fashion Square and recently after looking for some good Mexican food near Scottsdale Shea Healthcare to take my girl to lunch I noticed a Yelp Deal for this place and thought it was finally worth a shot
They even improved the food they grill the chicken and ribs on site now instead of just roasting them I got the maple glazed chicken and it was delicious
My one line summary is mostly delicious food - terrible service
Despite the horrible waitress situation I probably would go back because the food was really good at least what I had
I've also now sampled their fish and chips cottage pie and sheperd's pie and all of them are surprisingly for bar food really really good
Been there once before--can't remember exactly what I ordered although I think we had spring roll appetizers a curry dish and perhaps phad thai
This place is not cheap but the food & service is worth it we will be back
The food is just better there although Tempe is still tasty
I am giving 2 stars and that is only because the food was excellent
Don't get me wrong the food and location are good
We ordered a ton of food and I was unimpressed
I understand the concept of the restaurant so I wasn't expecting a completely traditional dish but come on  the meat was a bit dry and was saturated with an anise flavor which is not what comes to mind when I'm thinking osso bucco
The curry chicken dish was good but the cuts of chicken could've been better
Both I and my friend had different pizzas at lunch and we were both very impressed
Even if you're turned off by trendy sushi bars Moira is worth a try
Some argue these rolls cost just a tad too much but once you remember the quality of ingredients going in to every bite I'd say it's just right
We started eating at about 615 and we had what seemed to be a never-ending procession of amazing bite-sized foods to whet our appetites
If you like raw organic and natural food then this is a great mix of food choices with all sorts of flavors delicious smoothies teas coffee and sundry other treats
Yes the prices are not cheap but well made food with honest to goodness good ingredients does not come cheap
I admittedly fell into a food coma about 3 hours later but soo worth it
I really enjoyed their food and everyone else's food that I sampled from while they weren't looking
Further for those of you that spend hours on end in coffeehouses THEY HAVE FREE WI-FI -DThe coffee flavored coffee and tropical ice tea are good I personally tend not to stray into more interesting coffee drinks so you'd have to check those out yourself and the entire selection of both food and drinks is very reasonably priced compared to corporate coffee
Review for the Scottsdale Road locationThe Spotted Donkey is a semi-upscale Mexican restaurant with absolutely delicious food and great-tasting drinks especially the signature margaritas
I've enjoyed the footlong and regular dogs although the jumbo all-beef dogs are thicker and don't lend themselves to having the right consistency when charred
I'll take my non-all-beef hot dog complete with hooves and other weird animal parts I'm sure thanks
The menu is fairly typical of good bar food
This place is hidden in the Ghetto but the food is excellent
Food is great & the staff is really amazing
But when the food is only good I don't want to see ridiculous price tags
They were pretty down on the Arizona food scene being snobby NYers but after our meal they said they were pleased to finally have a good meal after bad ones in Sedona Flagstaff and at the Grand Canyon
pinch some more penniesI will say the bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in and the food from room service was pretty good
Laura ordered the Salmon which was excellent I am very picky with my fish being from Seattle and I would've ate that whole dish
I really enjoyed the dish and the roasted veggies were great
The kids got burgers and we split the Gourmet Pizza which was cheesy and wonderful
Overall the food wasn't fancy but it was good and the service was great
We ordered the Beef Ribs which was amazing falling off the bone and the Salmon so good
The wor wonton soup is a deep flavorful broth filled with not just one piece of broccoli and a few wontons but swimming with shrimp beef chicken vegetables and wontons
Not only does Liberty market offer Gilbert residents quality food they do it at a reasonable price
Earlier I was bragging about how good the meatball's are
Not only does this dish sound wonderful but a menu item that is only available 4 hours a week has a strong allure for me
This place is definitely more authentic tasting than the ones listed above as well although it's still not the real deal but to be honest real Mexico Mexican food is not that good anyway Menudo anyone
The service is friendly and the food is delicious
Your awesome decor can never make up for the quality of food I had last time here
Torched Goodness is just one of the handful of food trucks capturing Phoenicians' hearts and appetites lately and for good reason
It was good but nothing to write home about and I would agree with his food rating
Korean expert said this location is good with quality meat and his favorite tofu soup
So here are some of my favs;  pizza's always delicious but when you can breakfast all day the commuter is my number one pick
She loved the food liked that they didn't hesitate when she special ordered her Rigatoni with a different sauce she liked the atmosphere the mixed drink was potent my lasagna was very good and we loved the side of meatballs we both ordered
My only gripe is that there was probably too much breading on the chicken but overall it was very good
Pros=service food quality ambiance proximity to other restaurantsCons=hard to find on my TomTom and iPhone maps apps
All in all I really liked Terroir--good wine good food and laid back  atmosphere
The beans - not tasty read boring and the rice would pass for a dessert
He brought out my food commented on how good it looked and said thank you
now I eat fish which opens up the menu a bit but Rula Bula's got a few really tasty veggie options including veggie potato skins vegetarian shepherd's pie that's right - never seen that anywhere else and oh so delicious and the four-cheese grilled sandwich
It's hard not to order the pizza but I've also tried the meatball sandwich and the pasta which are both also very good
The schnitzel with ham and cheese is excellent but I always had a to go order of the chicken with the mushroom cream sauce-swear they put crack in it
A friend ordered Corned Beef and Cabbage which they served to her cold not very cool that got sent back and to make up for it the Manager let her order anything off the menu and gave her the dinner free without her even having to say anything
The food is pretty good however nothing special
You can also walk here from Gangplank if you stop by to work and need some good food in your belly
All in all the warm and inviting decor and staff the fair prices and most of all the all-around best food I can remember being impressed by in a long time make Eddie's a 5 star house in my book
I find all of the crazy concoctions that sushi restaurants conjure up to be a waste of good fish
Call me a purist or unadventurous or whatever but I like my raw fish either alone or with nothing more than good rice
Trader Joe's is the ultimate place to buy delicious healthful and sometimes organic foods
The frozen pizzas are great the hummus is delicious excluding the spicy pepper and they have awesome naan
Besides frozen foods there are a lot of cold prepared meals that are easy to heat up
Chicken curry had a few bits of chicken weak curry flavor and lots of soup with little substance
I wish the level of service would match the quality of the food
The fried chicken is good; the skin is delicious
The amount of butter cheese and fried goodness is probably enough to actually kill a small child and certainly enough to send anyone and everyone into a food coma
The egg rolls were really good and came with fresh and crispy romaine lettuce and dipping sauce
Pork on a Fork has the best baked beans EVER with great flavor and chock full of smoky meaty bits
I was in a social situation where my menu choices had to follow the lead of my hosts so I wasn't able to sample the dishes I would normally have tried but the standard American fare we had was good if uninspired especially the chowder
The food was excellent the Ropa Viejo nice and tender
The only good part of a pig for me is the other food group BACON
Dessert was rich sensual wonderful and sexy
Breakfast burritos are good and carne asada burritos are so loaded with meat that I often avoid it because it's too heavy a meal
Being a photographer I was more interested in visiting for the photo-op than the food  so I knew I just had to bring along my camera and get some shots of this landmark
They have happy hour specials from 5-7pm so we ordered a couple of Singhas for $3 each along with the fried sweet potatoes shrimp and vegetable egg rolls at half price--all delicious
To follow the appetizer specials we shared a drunken noodle dish at medium spicy which is just enough tang for a mild tongue
What is great about this place is that the spices don't overpower the dish and you can taste many different flavors with each bite
Overall thoughts  Good food great new location
Everything was pretty good but what really rocked my world were the desserts
The food is delicious and I'll drive down from Scottsdale just to eat  here
let's just say I think it'd be a good place for a beginner sushi eater to try
However the meat just didn't have any flavor to it and the onions seemed to have been cooked to death to the point where they were just stringy pieces of nothing
I think I'll continue my search for good Italian beef in the area
Of the four dishes I tried only one was worth reordering
I have no idea why the reviews for this place weren't that great because I really enjoyed the food
The trio of sauteed mushrooms & carmelized onions in the beef miniburger helped make the burger explode with flavor
We ordered the appetizer of meat cheeses nuts and fruit
Unfortunately being caucasian uniquely qualifies me as someone who can't make the distinction between good and bad Chinese Japanese or any other  ''ese' foods for that matter
All in all the service is very good and they have a chef's table that looked like a fun thing to do but I still feel there's better food for the money nearby at Sol y Sambra
The flavors were acceptable and there were nice bits of shredded chicken carrots celery
I agree that the plantains were delicious but the rice was pedestrian and the black beans were ridiculously watery even more so than the beef 's sauce
Its hard to Keep a good Sushi Chef  they arent cheap and I have seen this trend happen to more and more
We loved Hazelwoods because it's a good place to watch a sporting event the food is good the wings are good but not hot enough even the suicide are like medium and the beer selection is good
I don't know what makes this pizza so wonderful but it's delicious
I submitted a few photos and one of mine was the main one for a while so you can see exactly what the food looks like
I had some sort of marinated beef in my enchilada that was extraordinarily good it wasn't the carne asada
However since I shop for groceries elsewhere my love Fresh and Easy or Fry's only get food at Walmart if I'm also there shopping for other things and see Walmart as a place to find home goods paper products cat food towels at really low prices the Neighborhood Market doesn't really serve my needs
When I went to this location last night to check it out on the day of its grand opening I discovered that the selection of non-food home goods is pretty small
To sum it up if you frequent larger Walmarts for food limited house goods and the pharmacy you will appreciate having a downsized version of the store
The Unagi roll eel was SOOOO good as was the Cucumber tuna not the official name roll
The spring rolls are good served properly dressed with lettuce leaves and mint for wrapping with traditional sweet sour fish sauce for dipping
The unique roll was pretty amazing though and priced nicely for a rather large sushi roll
Overall I wasn't impressed but I wouldn't count this place out for a quick sushi lunch or dinner
Had the brown bag chicken sandwich good and the fried okra good
We watched a lot of dishes come out of the open kitchen and everything looked wonderful
I get the Salmon BLT religiously the BBQ Chicken Pizza is awesome the Nachos are HUGE add the blackened chicken and thank me later and the specials are usually damn good also
Over all the atmosphere was pretty good but judging on food it was a little better than okay and kind of interesting
Their food is always hot and fresh tasting I must admit I've had better but not by much
Moving on to our hot apps we had the pea soup terrible--looked like peas from a can in broth the caprese salad cheese was deep fried and salad was yummy and pizza of the day margarita--good
Our hot entrees were the veal shank good veal shank but tasteless risotto chicken with mashed potatoes chicken was a bit bland but potatoes were wonderful and the pork schnitzle kind of dry
We took a trip to the UK last year and that was the first time I had encountered pasties which were viewed there more as street food to eat on the run like hot dogs are in NY
means that you can keep yourself entertained in the interim and the food is definitely worth the wait
The food looked delicious and came out quickly but was way too salty
Having grown up with kosher pizza we opted to not grab a slice because to be honest kosher pizza isn't all that good
If you want good service good hot fresh meat & veggies you won't be disappointed here
I've always enjoyed their great food and good portion sizes
We are very impressed so far with their pizza
We ate a Kobe Beef burger and I guess it was pretty tasty
I eat Thai food fairly regularly and I was not impressed with our food from Thai Pots
Their food really is good and their service is
Did i mention that their food is really good
The Etouffee was colorful and deli-sh the crawfish were really soft and easy to chewy plus the flavor the sauce thy were in was amazing
Our waiter was really attentive and recommended dishes and helped in our selection
I never thought a gelato place would have good pizza
The food is not amazing but is generally standard diner food but the atmosphere is well let's just say - over the top
It wasn't amazing but the price was right the service was great and the food was tasty
There is nothing super special about this place but the food is reliably good so I like that
Also I don't really like the usual Chinese American food ie sweet and sour and stuff but I have tried when other people ordered and it's not that good as far as that goes
What is really good here though and what I go for is their more traditional chinese sea food
They have live fish and lobster tanks which are really good
So in summary if you are looking for awesome dim sum or good typical American chinese food this is not the best
But if you are looking for some good fresh chinese seafood and more traditional dishes this place is pretty good
Good luck staying in business when you have very poor service AND very poor food
i've never tried the american fare on the menu their new mexican food is just too good
The spinach enchilada dish I ordered was flavorless and floating in grease from the mounds of cheese a few bites was all my stomach could handle
Good food+ laid back vibe= talk of the neighborhood
The food was good a bit salty but good
The bread is fresh and chewy with shredded lettuce tomatoesonions and standard sub meat but the key component is this italian dressing that is amazing
Good Chinese roast meats and authentic Cantonese cooking in a former Thai buffet restaurant space
we drive an hour and a half 1-1/2 hrs round trip for this food & it is worth every second of driving time & worth every penny we spend on fuel
a restaurant with STEAK in the title should have amazing beef
The roast beef was low on flavor and even
We ordered the radish butter appetizer which was good - freshly churned butter and I ordered the pasta special and the husband ordered the jidori chicken
The desserts were very good - panna cotta with candied kumquats and a chocolate bread pudding
That is always a good sign cops know the city and in turn they know where the good cheap food is
Now the food is good the beer is cold so that's worth three stars at least
My pot roast had a good flavor but the meat was so completely overdone I almost contemplated sending it back we were late for a show
The Hubbs' dish was good a little on the sweet side but I guess that's Cuban food for ya
Starting with the corn rolled in delicious cotija cheese and smoked paprika we were wishing there were more than one cob but managed to share nicely
The Salads are amazing  I've been eating the Thai chicken salad twice a week  trying to figure out how to make it
Smoked salmon sounded like a good choice considering they smoke thier meats on the premise
#3 The fried catfish and shrimp were serverd hot that's the best thing I can say about the entire meal
Comparatively there are places like 'Rosas' in Mesa which have flavorful dishes that actually stand out and make you want to go back
The food is delicious and home made tasting
If I were to succinctly describe their food it is fresh healthy authentic and delicious
I had few things on  the happy hour menu Of course the spicy tuna roll simple nice down that calimari strips not over cooked just right maybe a little salty but super good and I had there spicy chicken wings which honestly was a little spicy for my taste even though I like my Sh#^ hot
The sauce on the chicken is gooey and delicious
PF's orange chicken and everything else was in no was close to the flavor and great taste of Golden Harvest
The fried shrimp roll we had was really good I would go back just to get that
Fresh and tasty sushi in Central Phoenix
The achiote chicken chopped salad is a fantastic almost-healthy entree and the chicken artichoke and mushroom stack is a bonanza of flavor
If you wish to have an epic gastronomic experience and care little about stomach pains and other adverse long term affects then I highly recommend the 5-cheese macaroni and achiote chicken
El Chorro Lodge has a great ambiance good food and service
Portion size of my meatloaf was nice and the mashed potatoes were good
Our catfish was fried and seasoned with just the right amount of spice with tasty crunchy bits at the bottom of the plate
It is amazingly consistent in particular with its crust in comparison to places like Cibo where the pizza is hit-and-miss and the center of the pizza is often soggy
They have some fancy combinations of pizzas available but its really just the quality of the ingredients and the consistency of cooking that make it great
I loved the meaty well prepared scallops and enjoyed pouring the Uni cream all over
There wasn't anything wrong flavor wise with the dish it was pleasant for me but not a wow
Sliced thick enough clean amazingly smooth it reminded me I screwed up getting Blue Fin Toro as a sushi instead of Sashimi
The real difference is Aribba's food is much hotter
You can tell when the food enters the mouth just how hot it is going to be
Before the food touches your mouth you get that this has the best flavor and it has not even hit your tongue yet
I have been looking for an entire year for good Paki/Indian places to eat in the valley but this place is my new favorite place where I'll be driving 40min to eat good home made food
I say the wait is long but the food is worth it
Why is it that you can order a mile high Reuben pastrami or corned beef sandwich at ANY good Jewish Deli like Jerry's in LA and it won't disintegrate in your hands
My Brother who lives in Chandler took my Mom and Me to the Lux Cafe and I loved the food I had the Kentucky Hot Brown which was very tasty and my Mom and Bro
had the Pot Pie which was huge and very good as well the dessert we had was also yummy it was not cheesecake
Short Leash is the best thing to happen to food trucks and hot dogs since the wheel and the bun
Overall the quality of the food is very good and the prices are very doable
The Grilled Chicken Pasta is amazing and the Flat Iron Steak is one of my favorites too
The sonoran chicken was red but had no flavor
Their chicken is pretty good better than KFC but not as good as El Pollo Loco
Overall it was a good experience and the food was good
I though I can't recommend becoming a regular especially with today's food price
They have a great selection of Middle Eastern groceries and products teas rice spices meat bread olives boxed and canned items juices sodas it is an amazing array
The small pies similar to a turnover with either meat or vegetables are less than a dollar each and good enough to eat a dozen
Don't waste another dollar on the big pizza chains Spinato's is well worth the extra money
The meat could have been a little more tender as I love me some tender pork but the flavor was so good it made up for that
The portions are also very generous and the food is incredibly inexpensive considering how good it is
Three stars for the food we did have price and portions were good as well
Consistency every time i return in quality of ingredients service and taste of food
They have some fantastic appetizers including this great brie & lavash dish and some fantastic salads with great dressing
The location is a bit odd to me but the food is good and whenever I'm in the neighborhood I'm happy to duck in
I had the Kung Pao chicken which was surprisingly tasty
There was also a good mix of peanuts celery carrots and red peppers in the dish
The dumplings our appetizer were served 10 minutes after our main dishes
The pretzel and fondue dish was delicious
The establishment is clean the food is nice and hot the service is great and the curry chicken is delicious
I have had theEarly Bird Egg Tomato Avocado and Mayo on English muffin with your choice of bacon or turkeyNew Mexico Burrito Egg Potatoes Cheese Avocado Bacon and a side of homemade Green Salsa not a lot of heat which I like but still very tasteStacked Turkey Tomato Lettuce Avocado Provolone Mustard+MayoI would recommend all three and will recommend other foods too as soon as I tear myself away from the above
I always order the drunken noodles with beef thai hot it's so good
I had the chicken parm for the 1st time yesterday - an excellent sandwich that maintained its flavor when I took it back to the office
There are other places that bring you pie that is no good and other places that make good pizza
Their sandwiches are nothing to write home about but are good their desserts are actually very good
The Yelp photos donated by members make the dishes appear larger than they are
The hummus was ok I've had better home made over the last few years the chicken and beef skewers were tasty but there wasn't a secret sauce that blew me away and the veggies they serve with them were standard - cut carrots broccoli and zucchini
Pizza slices are pretty good thin crust and light sauce
the highlights would consist of a red Alaskan snapper dish with quinoa and melon dish wish a wonderful rhubarb sauce and a cheese course of purple haze and peaches that went perfectly together
The time in between dishes took a little longer then I would have liked but with all the attention to details it was worth the wait
RIGHTS - Say they are vegan and they are - Ordering is simple fast and easy - Complimentary soup is hot on a cold dayWRONGS - Our order was messed up we got the wrong food served
The menu is extensive prices reasonable portions large and the food tastes pretty darn good
The kids had the pepperoni pizza which was very good
The sauce and vegetables overwhelmed the delicate flavor of the fish
The food buffet was plentiful with some of the largest and yummiest hot dogs I have ever seen
I knew I wasn't going to go here for the pizza but from their menu I thought I had a good shot at getting a decent hot corned beef on rye with mustard
Not too chickeny although the cup contains a bounty of carrots and celery the soup is not overpowered in their flavor
I had to give this place five stars b/c I thought the food was excellent and I had one of my best fried rices ever
My husband got the Thai jerky - hot - and while he liked it he thought the beef was a a little too crispy and took away from the flavor a little bit
Excellent Thai food and their spice levels are dead on
and the fish tacos and both of their dishes were excellent as well
Beef & Cheddar - Very GoodCorn Beef & Pastrami - NopeI will be back for the Beef & Cheddar
The menu has interesting salads apps main dishes and the wine was delicious as well although I'm not sure what it was
I tried the margherita pizza this time and of course the crust is satisfying again tasty heated up again in the toaster oven
The vinegar on the pizza was a delicious touch
But I must say the food was worth the wait
The steak was tasty and well prepared and the dessert was delicious
The waiters take excellent care of the patrons walking through the kitchen area is an experience unto itself and you won't hear too many of their customers ever complain about the quality of the food
I had the chicken salad chicken breast lettuce cilantro with hot mustard and sesame oil and a side of white rice
One thing I'll never forget is the butterfish that was melt in your mouth delicious
That said it's very good food for not a lot of money
The chicken is good and free of any foreign substances and is all white meat
My friend had beef pho which he enjoyed much more than the variety pho he picked up for lunch last time he went
The staff are still wonderful but the food is now lacking something
Ever just want excellent Mexican food for your party just like Mama used to make but without the days of preparation and cooking
Prices were extremely reasonable and the food was amazing
The pizza is flavorful fresh and very very yummy
Only thing is my pizza gets cold by the time I've finished scarfing down the first two slices
So if you're looking for a good pizza and a nice restaurant Grimaldis is a place to try
Decent food a little spendy but worth going to Westgate if you are visiting from out of town or need to entertain some out of town guests
Even if you don't need any food check this place out it's definitely worth meandering around at least once
Honestly the food is more of a fad fusion trend than it is quality
I have tried almost every hot sub they have and my favorites include Cripple creek if I'm in the mood for ranch Frontier if I want BBQ Steam engine meatball mood or the Buffalo Stampede buffulo sauce
The cafe can get very crowded but the food is worth the wait if you can get a table
My favorite is the lemon chicken all white meat very tasty sauce
Nearly every review claims the food is delicious
So many bad pizza places but now and then you find a good one
But despite the horrible service the food is good when they are having a good day and just barely acceptable when they're having a bad one
Overall my experience was satisfactory I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys tasty meats and gooey cheese
The Moroccan Colorado lamb and the good ol' beef burger were nicely charred and full of flavor
I can't even understand the bad reviews but I'm guessing they come from people who are either uptight or just don't know good food when it hits them in the face
The chef's were spot on with every dish from Californian benedict with crab cakes as the meat to simple buttermilk pancakes which were soo good they could hardly be called simple
So I was born in Bangkok and lived there till I was seven I may have forgotten my Thai language but the flavors and foods are seared into me forever
What you will get if you dine here;Friendly service they are Thai I don't think they know how to not be friendly Excellent food flavor and quality at the best prices
Anyone who says this place isn't worth the wait obviously doesn't know good pizza
If you don't want the wait and don't know good pizza when you eat it please just go to Pizza Hut
We then moved onto chicken strips and fish and chips which were also delicious
Oh well the drinks and food were good service was good atmosphere was good and the value of our dollar for what we received was great
The craw fish ettouffe is something I have to stop to contemplate each bite of because I struggle to comprehend why it's so delicious
Now I know most of you see the h-word and imagine terrible pain this dish is not prohibitively hot it manages to catch the flavor of the much maligned pepper and only a fraction of its fire
I will def go back even if it's just for the chips and salsa since after all that's what good Mexican food is all about
I've learned my lesson not to order a kid's meal just because often times lesser quality meat is substituted
the appetizers and main dishes were really not tasty at all
the food arrived within 40 minutes it was steaming hot and it smelled great before i could even bust open the bag
i found the food overall to be flavorful the portions large and everything reasonably priced
She or her son have never let me down in quality and freshness of the Sushi
It was too undercooked and i like my seafood undercooked and I don't believe the squid was good quality in the first place
I wasn't looking for anything free but offering to buy a $6 dessert for a flawed major ingredient in a $16 meal shows why the place is so cheap food quality wise in my opinion
With good food though definite room for improvement and I hope they work on their service and bar selection
Over the years however the food has gotten more innovative and become very good
Their sushi happy hour has quite a bit of variety and the value is pretty good for Scottsdale
Their mission boasts healthy but tasty food casual elegance and impeccable service
A more than ample serving of large rigatoni pasta mixed in with a generous serving of their tomato sauce and homemade meatballs makes for pasta dish deliciousness
San Diego Miami Boston basically anywhere where you expect great fresh sushiThat being said it's good for the value
The food court is cool I got a lrg cheese steak combo for like $10 and it was alot of food and good
The sandwich is huge the meat has a great flavor and the mac and cheese is some of the best I have ever had
The food wasn't bad either and the service was excellent
While all of the food was good the best part of the meal both my date and I agreed on was our White Dragon Jasmine Tea
I was not impressed by the sushi wouldn't say it was bad but I nothing stood out
You get some good size chunks of tender meat and lots of noodles important
The fast food was actually not half bad - color me impressed
All and all the food was as good if not better than any restaurant out there
It is a great place to have good food and have a great time
We had an excellent dinner i was in the mood for fish and had the Macademia crusted Halibut
as for the dogs very flavorfull i suggest just getting a plain beef brat or your choice and taste it own its own
* This place serves amazing NORTH EASTERN THAI food from Essan region
We had the margherita pizza with was pretty good
Above average food and good happy hour specials give's Philly's an above average rating of four stars
Our service was timely and the food was very good
The house wine was good and the desserts were definately worth saving room for
The meats and cheese are steamed before hand to seal in extra juice and just make it really good
The Spring rolls were average the BBQ beef had almost no flavor and the other things were mediocre
We were visiting friends for the weekend in Pheonix and wanted good food that wasn't too expensive
The pizzas were all very unique and flavorful
Food was EXCELLENT so I'll return for sure
The pizzas were really good sausage good cheese was yummy
The great food and excellent customer service is why I keep going back
Flaming Kabob serves excellent food from a family owned local restaurant
We had the bento box and the California roll for appetizers
the roll was good and the crab meat was fresh
All three fish were excellent and well seasoned but that butter fish was amazing
It was my first time to have the fish and it was buttery had zero fishy taste and was just delicious
I have to say the food prices are good but the ice cream althou it is freakin delicious  it is a little pricey
No room service but they have a gallery/kiosk/bar where you can order a full meal like roasted chicken steak salad pizza appetizers dessert and more
I hear the pizzas are a tasty option and I would give them a try if I find myself back there
I've tried the sushi and it seems unremarkable to me although I'm not sure I'd know good sushi if it hit me in the head
On the other hand the orecchiette dish with sausage and greens was bursting with flavor
One thing I'll say about both dishes is that the pasta itself was perfectly cooked and tasted as homemade and wonderful as you'd expect at a place called PastaBAR
5 stars taking into account both the mediocre and excellent dishes but PastaBAR gets a 4 overall taking into account the friendly service and casually hip space
We ordered their stuffed shrimp for appetizer and Italian Stallion pizza
This one comes with a good amount of crab meat and they sure are very well grilled
The Italian Stallion pizza is a mouthful of flavor
It has comfortable arrangements and good lighting for food photographers
Good thing too because the swordfish was quite small not to mention a little overcooked
I think we may try it again for a reverse happy hour if someone invited us but the prices were a little high for the food quality and service
Sea Saw's food is unbelievably delicious but I'm not just rating the taste of the food
We ordered 7 dishes   * Hamachi - sliced yellowtail on top of grapefruit and avocado with       ponzu sauce   * Seared Tuna Tataki - with Pinot Noir reduction and roasted beet       puree   * Cool Duck - Pan seared breast chilled in a soy zinfinadel       reduction   * Lamb - Curry Coconut milk and peanut sauce marinade grilled      with red pepper coulis   * Shinshu Mushi - Steamed sea bass green tea soba noodles      ume-shiso scented mushroom broth   * White fish carpaccio - thinly sliced with ginger sesame seeds       yuzu juice and roasted garlic oil   *  Japanese Mushroom Melange - assorted mushrooms baked      in parchment paperAs I stated above each dish was delicious
The chocolate mousse was my fave but my boyfriend and my friends enjoyed the other desserts more
I don't usually complain about portion size and price when the food is so delicious but we were still hungry and didn't feel like sitting around for another 3 hours to get 7 more dishes that still wouldn't fill us up
Philly roll -- deliciousSweet potato roll - AMAZINGAvocado roll - MASSIVE amounts of avocado greats size great tasteSpicy tuna roll - TastySprimp tempura roll - YummyThe weird mountain potato and sour plum sauce veggie roll -- sour salty and sweet all in one
A great time with good service delicious food and fresh tasting fish according to my co-diners and very affordable when the final bill came
I remember the food being delicious the vibe being cool and the beers being cold
Food A little pricey but the food is always pretty good
The decor aside the food and drinks were very good too
That wont be hard since the pizza is so good and such a good value you can stop in for the lunch specials which I normally pick up either 2 slices and a drink for $4 or a slice drink & salad bar for $4
Such a good price for such good food I dare you to go across the way to 1 Brothers Pizza
Although the food wine and atmosphere are all good sadly I must say I have been let down
I really would love to give the place four stars because the food and wine are certainly worth it but due to my traumatic experience its just a-ok
It's a pretty good price for the presentation and quality of food
Dimly lit at night and full of natural light during the day; Fez's good food and pleasing atmosphere shouldn't seem to disappoint someone looking for some well made in-between gourmet in the heart of Phx that available till midnight
The ask me how I'm doing have I been there before do I have any questions do I need any recommendations can they hold my food while I'm waiting etc
I don't know about you but part of one's dining experience along with the quality of food is how one is treated
The food is good I only have a couple CONS
For around $10 the burgers were huge the meat patties were very moist and it was just delicious overall
The breakfast menu is reasonable and the food is worth every penny and then some
But if you do choose to check this place out I recommend going for drinks and not the food and be prepared for the stereotypical Scottsdale scene
This place is an amazing place for timid to see what all the buzz is about sushi
You don't have to eat raw fish in fact my last visit i had a california roll sans the fake crab meat and enjoyed miso soup w/ a bowl of white rice
I ordered the chicken which was excellent and the two sides I had were the stuffing and beans
I don't expect Mexican food in restaurants to be like what we have at home so I don't go with preconceived ideas to judge a place but food should be hot and I should not have to pick hard things out of my teeth as I eat it
For the entree I had the grilled fish zarandeado tacos which were packed with flavor and had pineapple as well
The great thing about the food is that SOL focuses on the quality of the food and not so much on the extras like cheese and sauces etc
The antipasto plate was average the pizza was tasty but nothing special and the wine selection was decent
It looked like it was definitely worth more than $10 not that this is a bad thing but it gave a reminiscent taste of Taco Bell's Mexican Pizza
Joseph to see if they sold those wonderful special filled zeppoles named after the saint and sold in Italian bakeries and food stores on his feast day
I also browsed the packaged and canned goods areas and found lots of high quality Italian foods not normally found in supermarkets and regular food stores
The meats were very high quality fresh and ample and there was just enough lettuce tomatoes red onion and dressing to enhance the flavors without competing with the deli meats
I reside in the area and what we needed was some good Mexican food
Prices are very very fair the food's quality is super customer service is outstanding salsa is delicious; basically everything is great and I have no complaints
I would say this meal could feed someone for a week it's a lot of food but really good so if you want a great Chicken Fried Steak it's a must try
I love that they don't have the pre-sliced meat like Subway and the bread is much better quality
Yep this place is quite European in terms of the minimal service and wine with lunch but the food was excellent
The pizzas being delivered to tables around us looked pretty amazing too
It's worth the wait just for the orange juice - but the food is good too
The meat all tasted good but it all started to blend in my mind
We ordered way too much food for the two of us to finish but it was well worth the visit
all good but a waste of stomach space compared to the meat
They have a good food court starbucks movie theater and a chevy's
But Local Breeze is what tuned me into quality food--food that's actually good for you
I am eagerly anticipating their new dinner menu and hope it's just what reminds all of Phoenix's foodies that Local Breeze is a good part of what make our downtown dining scene the best in the Valley
The clay pot with chicken and mushroom was pretty good
I understand the cost of food and labor along with the better quality ingredients but I don't even spend that much on an Oreganos deep dish pie and theirs actually taste better
Funny considering that I am a guy who eats out a lot and am not afraid to spend a lot of money in a place when the food and service is good
He brought out order after order of fresh delicious sushi and sashimi
The food was excellent fresh and seasoned well
I am addicted to the hot and sour soup with chicken
The meat in the tacos was tender tasty and plentiful accompanied by chilantro onion and hot sauce - typical ingredients but done right
I was in the mood for some hot food this along with my love affair of cheese lead me to try the hot multi cheese sandwich
His meal of a cold meat sandwich and fruit salads looked appetizing as well
I judge italian food by Is it worth me making it myself because I can do it much better or is this good enough that I don't need to do the work
I really can't say enough about how good the food was
Their default republic ramen dish is pretty solid and has good flavor
Friendly service delicious food and ridiculously modest prices
Good gyros stuffed with enough meat fresh and tasty; but the spanakopita crust
Overall the food is good here but watch your order and add it up before you hand the coupon over or some shenanigans will go on with your money
Other than that I ate the baklava and hummus the next day and can report being the Middle Eastern/Greek foodie that I consider myself to be that it was delicious
Excellent service  Johnny the owner was able to chat with us for a while and was very gracious excellent food with great flavors  I usually don't care for tapas because I like larger portions but these were great sizes and excellent deals all around great happy hour etc
The food is good but I will NEVER go back because of the experiences I had
The food was good so I figured maybe the waiter was just having a bad day
I love this place not only is the food so delicious but the service is amazing
I ended up trying four different pizzas and all were amazing
The Teppan table is a show in itself the steak and calamari are both outstanding but the sushi bar is wonderful as well
As the dishes are made with what is local fresh and seasonal just know it will be a wonderful dining experience even if you have to carry a tray to your table
I have to say they have a good selection of vegan frozen organic and other natural type of foods
you can't beat that  the pizza here is pretty tasty but i've had better elsewhere
I've enjoyed the Tomato Gin Soup Filet Mignon Cobb Salad Classic French Dip and Rotisserie Chicken Crepes
It sucks that zen 32 is gone because they used to carry some of their sushi on the to go side but I guess it looks like I'll have to give revo burrito a shot
My favorite selections from the menu are the hot pots and unique vegetable dishes
The tofu and seafood hot pot selection quite simply cant be beat
I even tried a mexican pizza at taco bell once thus putting to test the old adage that there is no bad pizza; only good pizza and great pizza
I got a peach cobbler dessert and I liked it but it is kinda average the crust parts were mixed in with the cobbler and were soggy to bad it was probably very good before that was done
On a hot summer day the lady at the counter gave me a ride to a nearby location after my dehydrated heat exhausted self ordered a Pizza Hoagie
this locally owned restaurant has consistently provided inviting ambiance wonderful service and delicious food for pennies compared to anything on Mill
Thick al dente crinkle cut carrots bamboo shoots green beans broccoli zucchini red and green peppers with tender choice of meat afloat in savory coconut milk that suspends the perfect amount of earthy spice and hot chili to ensure that the meal dances on your taste buds
The Thai Basil is their signature dish and certainly doesn't skimp on its namesake fresh basil and thick flavorful sauce
The chicken satay with peanut sauce is also a very good choice for picky eaters or kiddos although they'll truly miss out on the more complex flavors of this amazing food
Probably as good or better than the rest of the fast-food burgers around here
Fox restaurants typically are delicious but people like myself and other Yelpers are weary of chain restaurants and although this is the only arrogant butcher and not a chain like Sauce or True Food its easy to lump it together into a chain restaurant motif being a Fox restaurant
Whats great about this is not only the concept but the meats and cheeses are high quality and come with bread and jam that's honestly to die for so delicious
I've also for dinner tried the sweet baked potato tortellini excellent and my favorite thing so far which I will re order is the beef short rib stew with green chiles fried egg cornbread
im not too picky when it comes to food but i wasnt even that good of a burger
I got the machaca burrito - the meat was tender not fatty and had good flavor
I had a layover here and the Southwest gate is really close to Nathan's Hot Dogs and Pizza Hut along with restrooms
Menus with pictures *shudder* anyway the food was drab and not worth the fuss
Service ambiance food quality beverages all without fault
When our food finally came it was really good
Give them a shot great food great service good prices and you only need to eat like 2 pieces to be stuffed
Ignore all the NY and Chicago comments good pizza is good pizza
Quality meat good cheese and plenty of char
The Cubano came on  a very soft roll instead of the baguette that was listed on the menu  and the filling was an extremely mild pulled pork in an almost mustard creamy Swiss cheesy sauce also extremely mild with flavor
There were definitely some green chile sliders some garlic shrimp a couple tacos a tasty flatbread pizza thing a couple beers
The spiedini appetizer which is Italian Fontina wrapped in Prosciutto over Arugula is quite possibly the best two bites of food possible
The food overall tastes pretty good above average if you ask me but you don't get enough
We enjoyed the food family style with some beer
Down to earth guys a variety of good Italian deli meats salads cheeses a nice selection of Italian grocery items and great sandwiches
The only downside is it took a little long for the food considering it was all pretty much sandwiches we ordered but it was worth the wait
Service here was excellent and you definitely get a wide variety of meat options but I only found two out of the 6+ choices tasty
The lamb leg and the bacon wrapped filet were delicious but the sausages pork chicken pork/beef ribs and even filet mignon were unimpressive
Desert included complimentary cotton candy along with a peanut butter smores dish which may have been the crown jewel of the evening and a peach shortbread which was also very delicious
As soon as I opened my door the smell of chicken and beef and tortillas and other amazingly yummy goodness hit me
They have a cafe/restaurant with windows that roll open for you to walk on up and buy some of that goodness you're smelling
On a positive note the Italian beef is very good
Greatest thing about Chicago Hamburger is that it is always good food in your typical small place
The menu is all good old fashioned food and there are times I appreciate a straight forward meal that hasn't been messed with
After a strong recommendation from my foodie co-worker my husband and I tried Aunt Chilada's
The shredded beef that was also on there supposedly had the most flavor
Although the food was not good I would typically give any place a second chance
Usually the food is good in breweries as well
I can deal with that especially if it goes to the hot waitresses who delivered my food
They meat quality if better then other burrito places5
The buffalo chicken was great they give you your choice of about 10 different wing sauces for it - honey hot is great
The service is spectacular friendly and its in a great spot by like every good old town restaurant so save room for dessert even though cowboy ciao makes that difficult and try out Lee's
The salad was crispy with delicious chicken and sweet/tart raspberry dressing
The meat department is really good with an extremely helpful staff
The food had the fried chicken my Girl had BBQ Baby backs was hot fresh and done perfect now I have spent 25yrs in the south & my girls from there and these two dishes made us feel right at home
Several of the dishes we have tried so far have been quite tasty the cotija corn appetizer and the carne asada tacos for example some others the vegetarian tacos most recently more bland
Unique restaurant with good food gives Joe's Farm Grill an above average rating of four stars
The first time I was there me and my Fiancee sat at the bar  Which was a gorgeous well stocked bar we had lunch we both got chicken sandwiches OMG Delicious
She loved it we got the WCG salad and shared a chicken sandwich all oh so good
Every time I go good food great service and its a cool and clean place
The pizzas/flat breads are very good though a tad overpriced
In an old house across the alley from Pizzeria Bianco this must be the center of good food in Arizona
Well after the eventual buildup of wonderful Mexican food it really is a disappointment to find such memories are best left in the past
Don't expect to see me hanging around this restaurant as I'll be spending my money on good Mexican food
FOOD The pollo asado was delicious and moist the vegetables fresh and properly cooked though nothing particularly Mexico City-esque jumped out at me about the dish
Once our food had turned cold the server literally stuck his head out the patio door - everything OK
On this last visit I had the spicy noodles with chicken and veggies and it was very tasty
I don't know what hippie food co-op they dragged her out of but if you're going to be a good waitress you probably should a forget that you have tables and b not look disgusted when your non-vegetarian customers order meat
Care about selling customers your concept of quality healthy foods
The meat is seasoned and cooked perfectly resulting in a very tasty sandwich
I still would recommend this place and try your luck with the food here
Tasty sauce substantial and good-tasting crust fresh toppings--yes here the pizza isn't an afterthought to the games the tokens and the ticket redemption area
I was hungry and looking for good service good food and good prices
I love that they always have a great assortment of different foods to choose from everyday from quick hunger fixes to elaborate and delicious meals
Kokopelli has been one of these consistent wines we tend to lean towards sweet whites and find they offer some derivation of almost all or our favorite varietals reisling muscat sauvignon etc The food has always been consistently good and we were thrilled when we heard we were getting a Kokopelli in surprise after visiting the surprise location we were pleased to find that the same consistency and quality carries over from the chandler location at my last visit I ordered the fish and chips which were severals strips of tilapia wiht crunchy tasty panko breading
I had the sweet and sour chicken it was just as good
$1 street tacos were all amazing -- loved the Al Pastor Carne Asada was wonderful Chorizo was excellent and the Fish my wife ordered was as good as any I've had
I've been here several times and just finally got the time to tell everyone about the delicious food this place has to offer
I ordered up an ice cold beer and looked over the menu and order up the Santa Fe sandwich - Warm roast beef chipote mayo green chili & swiss served on an onion challah roll
I think what really makes their pizza so good is the sauce
Their pizza is a bit pricier than your average chain but it's soooo worth it
I recommend them over any pizza place in the area
They must be under some new management or something because the last few times I have gone I have never had a problem with customer service or the quality of food
All I can comment on was the beef panang which had a deep rich flavorful sauce and just enough spice to make me break a sweat
Portions were good sized and while the curry could have used quite a bit more beef I don't mind my curries heavy on the sauce and light on the meat
Had a girls' lunch here the other day and was pretty impressed with the food and atmosphere
The fish tacos have gotten the best reviews from my panel but it's a smaller amount of food for a good bit of money
If your are looking for any kind of flavor in your food  this is not the place for you
I had a green chili burro with rice and beans it had to be one of the most bland meals I have ever had this the place for those out of towners You know the ones from those cold states who are not familiar with what Mexican food should taste like
Who names their restaurant something that corny and have good food
For airport quick food I think Flo's Shanghai Cafe is a good choice considering it is about the only Asian flavors in PHX
95 Appetizers  Pot stickers Spring Rolls Crab Puffs Fried Wontons Lettuce Cups Chicken salad soups and Shanghai Bao which are pork balls batter covered and deep fried you get 4
I also have had their white pizza and was not that impressed
Great hummus & bread had the spicy pepper Dessert a pazookie they don't call it that for obvious reasons didn't knock my socks off  but pretty darn goodVenue seems ideal for groups of 3-6 or so but can accommodate what looks like 10-12 is a good max sizeI look forward to promoting your venue to my friends
My dining partner had the steak sandwich with the tobacco onions which he claimed was good but the horseradish sauce was too overpowering
We ordered the following for breakfastBan Xeo Pan-fried flour crepe with shrimp pork and bamboo shootsBanh Mi Trung Rang French bread sandwich with fried egg omeletteChao Thap Cam Rice porridge with shrimp pork squid fish ball and imitation crabThe Good NewsThis is one of my favorite places to eat I have become a regular here and it is the best Vietnamese restaurant I have been to thus far in southern Arizona
The crepe was cooked perfectly as was the meat and veggies inside all of which were very tasty and the serving size was plenty for two people
You'll get service with a smile great quality food and low prices
Late at night when the hunger could no longer be quenched by drinks my wife and I ordered some sort of a pizza thing that was reasonable priced and sized and was actually tasty
I ordered chicken enchiladas with green sauce and they were delicious
Speaking of processed meats have any of you seen the section on hotdogs on How it is Made
Back to the review the eyeround pho was deliciously good eatin'- hot salty broth with rings of onion and sliced green onions scallions to some made perfect with the addition of basil mint and a few squeezes of lime comes in a separate dish with chilies- jalapenos to which I'm allergic
a good 1/3 hour AFTER the 1st pizza arrived at our table
My cioppino was more than almost anyone could eat the seafood was excellent
The food itself was served very fast and it was quite good
The beef was also good but there really wasn't a good ratio of beef to onions
Last Friday I had the happy hour sushi and was impressed especially with the Senorita roll
This $18 roll is pricey but at it's $9 happy hour price is well worth it
I've enjoyed salads with salmon and chicken the times I have visited but who knows what will be on the menu on my next visit
The Farm Monte Cristo is about as close as any breakfast food gets to groin-grabbingly delicious
We tried five of the appetizers including some kind of fried potato fingers a pizza thing with figs and prosciutto a fresh salad some green beans a cucumber and tomato mix
My only complaint was that the sushi roll we got was falling apart en route to my mouth but it was still tasty
Bruschetta Romana = good Firecracker Rolls = husband likes not my favorite Roasted Brussels Sprout Beet Salad = LOVE Calzone = Husband loves Kid's calzone = son orders every time Italiano Sandwich and Buffalo Chicken Ceasar Sandwich = my adult daughters love
I have had some of their pasta dishes as well and they were all very good
But the downside is an expensive meal for leftover poor quality food
The fact very few actual Indians came in while we were seated was yet another tip-off to the food quality
The food while it is still good is over priced and microwaved
It tasted as thought it had been cooked too long and there was very little flavor or moisture remaining in the meat
The Pho is outstanding the spring rolls are fresh delicious and plentiful and the atmosphere is exactly what you look for and expect when going to a Vietnamese restaurant
For anyone who is less adventurous with food their Chinese dish offerings are surprisingly delicious
Taste being the key since they only use high quality meat and toppings
We split an Emiliana salad at the recommendation of the owner followed by an Italian Sausage and mushroom pizza
While the food quality is OK here it's just that - average
So the Pizza is excellent; But how about the rest
We started with the spiedini and also ordered a Sonny Boy Good Fella and the Arugula pizza
Again it was all good dough cheese meats and veggies
This is not your typical pizza joint pizza which is a good thing but in my opinion as someone who is a complete pizza nut who eats way too much of it all around the country I've had better in my opinion
On Service-food and beverage is not a natural skill but it would be good if they trained their staff to be more attentive and friendlyThe food Poor representation of real Korean food
I honestly think this place is good for people who think they know Korean food who really don't because their friend's friend was Korean or something but most Korean loving hungry souls will go straight to Takamatsu
The chicken was moist and flavorful the hummus was very creamy
Bad news the wait was long the good news the food is great
The food was okay; better than average bar food not as good as a restaurant that's really trying
The fish and chips were good; the chips were especially good and others around the table were stealing my crispy-on-the-outside-fluffy-on-the-inside steak fries
They were mighty good but the fish was just good
All dishes are so flavorful and well made
And I was super impressed with the food as well
All three were such different dishes yet were all wonderful
She brought out our food but never brought out the appetizers
The store and food stations are immaculate and the menu options they offer were delicious
rrIt's 111 freaking degrees and you want a little heat in your food but also something refreshing and tasty and a little southwesty
Look at all the fancy landscaping and toney zoning controls that keep everything adobe and tasteful;  the food MUST be good right
The Reyes has beef pork ham chorizo eggs hot dogs etc
Our dishes were delicious- the moist salmon was cooked perfectly atop a bed of roasted squash and spinach in a light creamy sauce while my friend's baked ziti bolognese looked just as good as it tasted
I get they're probably doing the Groupon thing perpetually to draw people in who want to buy the ridiculously-priced food and drinks $12 for a crabcake appetizer but if you're like me and just want to see a movie in a theater this is a no-brainer
We started with the small plates crab & avocado herb poached shrimp truffle lobster medallions seriously good food
I sampled some decent sauces delicious Chicken Soya and Sirring Shrimp items and will probably return to try more of what they're dishing out despite the fact that service was initially a bit delayed
The food was CHEAP for scottsdale and it was super good too
Now as far as my dish goes; I thought it was good but needed more flavor
which is a good thingIt gave me a good reason to infuse my dish with Bragg's Liquid Amino which is healthier than other seasonings
Everything F&E brand had very minimal marketing on the packaging which made me feel like i was purchasing it for the quality of food not how nice the fake prepared image on the front looked
same thing with baked goods meat products and produce
They had so many types and the store was loaded with other goodies fresh baked bread pizzas to take n bake and they have fresh to order sandwiches
The fish was below average quality and the preparation well-presented but not as describedhad no seasoning at all and small portions
The chicken cordon bleu sandwich also good
Many dishes are like good old fashioned comfort food
2 street tacos reported to be good one beef taco small soup 2 iced teas and 2 rounds of chips they kept them coming which is a plus in my book about $20 which is fine
my chicken came with the most delicious eggplant like so delicious i will order just eggplant and chicken next time i go
the food is also amazing- the lentil soup is super yummy the veggie oombo authentic and the chicken shwarma and gyros are delicious
We had a great red sauce pizza and I would recommend this place to anyone
We started with samosas after which I had the lamb vindaloo and my wife tried the chicken korma all very good
For dessert we were presented with a complimentary rice pudding also good
I don't mind paying $100 for a few sushi rolls soup and some salmon but it better be good
Although the food was very good the service was mediocre at best the server really had a o care attitude
We had to ask for place settings then our food came out before our appetizers which was very disappointing
It reminded me a bit of the kind of food one might get at Panda Express in terms of texture but the redeeming quality was the sauce
You can find better fish in our area at Costo huge amounts good for big families sometimes AJs not always though Mekong plaza supermarket or Lee Lee Oriental Supermarket
I guess the store has to identify organic food somehow but these extremely sticky labels are not a good idea
Anyways on to the foodGyoza Very good
We will definitely be back to try more of their dishes and would definitely recommend it to anybody looking for a new restaurant to try
Now for the food and service we had a crabby waitress but even she couldn't ruin our great ribs tender rolls and interesting prickly pear cactus fries appetizer
The food here is slightly inconsistent at times but mostly really good
It is a low-key house-turned bar that serves solid food executed extremely well alongside beer and wine that has obviously been selected with care by fans of things that taste good
We were greeted right away in a friendly manner we were shown to a table and service was AWESOME QUICK and FOOD WAS DELICIOUS AND TASTED FRESH
We had eggrolls beef skewers egg drop soup fried rice beef and broccoli orange chicken for 2 and everything was delicious and hot
If you want good Chinese Food in Surprise I agree with Floyd C
safe food good service expensive without hugely breaking bank but expensive enough should that be the impression you are going for
They make a big deal about the meat being fresh never frozen 100% US raised and cooked to order and they're pretty tasty but this is a fast food burger not what I like to refer to as a backyard burger
AMC Esplanade 14 in the Biltmore area of Phoenix underwent major renovations turning its 14 theaters into chic dine-in auditoriums where viewers reserve their seats and get restaurant-quality service as they fill up on food and drinks while watching the flicks
The servers try to take your full order from appetizers and drinks to dessert all at once so they keep the disruptions during the film to a minimum
Think grilled or fried chicken fish or beef sticky white rice and the most delicious macaroni salad ever
I had a shredded beef plater that was amazing
Food is good and exactly what you would expect from a traditional mexican restaurant
Good yet not phenomenal but great when you are in the mood for traditional mexican food
The food menu is interesting a lot of appetizers
One good thing since it's an asian market you can find fresh/live seafood and cheap asian must haves
All in all Khai Hoan is simple tasty cheap and easily accesible Vietnamese & Chinese food lovingly made
To be fair I have only had the blackened chicken tacos on corn tortillas each time but they are THAT good
Excellent food and great prices what could be better
In a sea of franchise-dom that is Phoenix metropolitan area it is hard to find good non-farmed/chicken/cow or whatever themed breakfast joint
But the food quality and selection and atmosphere are well above average and a solid 4 star'r and blow any chained breakfast joint out of the water
We looked at the menu briefly and ordered our drinks an appetizer a soup and two main dishes
It's amazing how a place with great food decor and ambiance can mess it all up by crappy waiter service
I especially enjoy the fish tacos which come with a surprisingly good side of rice and beans
Appetizers consisted of Warm Asparagus Pizza Crispy Prosciutto Organic Fried Egg - Delicious
I'm a big fan of the newly embraced French style of topping dishes with an egg and Margherita Pizza San Marzano Tomatoes Fresh Basil - also very tasty
Meat was tasty but not exactly plentiful I'm used to a New York style Reuben - with loads of meat
Although I didn't have to revert to Oliver Twist-like methods to punish myself gastricly with this greasy plentiful delicious food and it was quite easy on the wallet I feel like I shouldn't have come here
The meat was poor quality ordered both sausage and pepperoni
Our family has enjoyed Malee's food since the day the doors opened
After receiving our food the worker who took our order and discussed with us that it was our first time there and tried to steer me away from the hot links on account of their being spicy
The food is quality and natural and I don't worry about their food having issues with recalls
All I can say is that I totally disagree with all the other reviews about the quality of the food and service
Back then there was a hot dog cart out front and they didn't offer anything inside other than bulk food and a few odds and ends
Relaxed cool people good atmosphere and tasty food
We decided on drinks a beer for the hubs and some tasty tempranillo for me and ordered a large salad and a pizza to split
The salad was tasty and our arugula pizza was so good
While I was a tad disappointed when I didn't find something super chocolatey on the menu for dessert the apple crisp topped with vanilla ice cream was delicious
Humble Pie a nice place to relax and unwind with good drinks and food
This place pushes out some delicious food Red chile burro with rice and beans is better than any I've had and their Nachos are soooo freaking cheesey and good you'll want to order both for one sitting
The food is good -- Pho broth is flavorful and fragrant
Can't say I'm a fan of the dessert pastys but the everything else is amazing
I am not very familiar with Phoenix or good sushi restaurants so I went to my phone for help
My chicken was good and it was a baked chicken breast breaded
I was in the mood for some amazing food in a romantic setting
I got good food in a kinda cramped but cute setting with weird lighting
my excitement for cheap delicious sushi and guppy bowl goodness was deflated into a shriveling sack of sadness on this tuesday evening
so in honor of tanked's unbeatable happy hour sweet atmosphere and splendid sushi i shall say my final words and wave goodbye solemnly as yet another incredible phoenix restaurant goes under the table due to poor economic conditions caused by politicians running amuck and unchecked in washington
I've been to The House a couple of times now and the food and drinks are good however the hostess is just down right rude and needs to find a new job where she doesn't work around people
Pros The food is really good and they're pastries looked awesome
We shared the Salmon Croquettes Empanadas and the delicious Chicken dinner I'm sure it had a name
All of the dishes were presented beautifully had fantastic flavor and persuaded us to not only clean out plates but to order dessert too
The side dishes of jalapeno creamed corn and green chile cornbread casserole were SO good
I'm not impressed by the food at iKitchen but when it comes to their boba milk teas and slushes they're top notch
The beef roll was not that good I'm not sure what kind of pastry crust they used but it wasn't crispy or even tasty it felt waxy and really bland
Food was pretty tasty despite the order being slightly botched sticky steamed rice was perfect and the service was awesome
I had the udon with tempura shrimp and OMG I was stuffed about halfway through the steaming bowl of slurpy good noodles flavorful broth and giant meaty shrimp covered in a tempura that amazingly had not disintegrated in the liquid
The pork was oooh so good; even my picky 5-yr-old was slurping up the noodles and munching on the smoky-tasting meat
Came into town for the Phoenix Rock N Roll Half Marathon and was lookin' for some pretty good eats for my  post-run
The chicken tasted tender hot  and fresh and they gave me a decent amount of avocado
The foods tasty too but it's only good value if you're there for the lunchtime menu or the dim sum
Brooke and I were looking for a good breakfast place while we vacationed in Arizona and the pictures of Orange Table's food looked mouthwatering
Everything else I've had from the pad thai and other dishes and the curry dishes are all pretty good as well
I love their egg white omelets and their sandwiches are very large and come with fruit their side salad and the First Watch Potatoes so you get an ample amount of food and the prices are really quite good considering you really do get two meals out of their portions
It can get busy on weekends but it's a very nice little place to enjoy some good food at good prices and with friendly staff
Food ordered  Cuban Pork Sandwich it was very tender so very flavorful a lot of food but we wished there was more even after we were full
As for the food the meat is decent quality for a chain and fresh not frozen
Fifth person had the meatballs said they were good
Don't let this places location and exterior fool you like it did me Vincent's is authentic fresh and delicious Italian food
That's beside the main issue however which was the quality of the meat
Not only are the sake bombs excellently priced but there is a little buffet free of sushi egg rolls and some meat dish
I would definitely recommend this restaurant - great atmosphere and even better food
The only reason i didn't give The Nee House 5 stars and I admit I'm being picky is because they do not have a dish I've been looking for in the entire Phoenix metro-area but admittedly the Nee House does not  focus on Sichuan-style dishes the dish i'm looking for is Sichuan Spicy Cold Chicken Noodles which i fell in love with while living in the Bay area but which is impossible to find in the Phoenix-metro area
If you want authentic delicious Chinese food make sure you give the Nee House a try
As a grown-up the two things that strike me about the Stockyards are the quality of the food they serve and the authentic feel of the Old West decor
Then again it makes it a perfect celebrate someone is back in town by picking them up and making the four minute drive over to chow down on some amazing beef
The waiters are almost as delicious as the food
The corn beef hash is also excellent and probably my favorite here
The noodles were cooked well and when the bowl of goodness reaches you the beef is still slightly pink
You wont find a menu like this out there with the different spices and flavors they use in their dishes
As I mentioned previously the chips and salsa are delicious at La Canasta but the rest of the food is just OK
Very well priced and the pizza in my opinion tasted delicious
It seems like everybody has some weird opinion on how good pizza is and I guess I have a weird opinion as well
They made the most freaking delicious raw fish specials that I've ever had
Neither one of us have had indian food and yelpers seemed to like here so we thought we'd give it a shot
Food was great I really liked the flavors
Then we went with the Chicken Something Masala they have a regular masala and we went with the one with 3 words haha it was very good too little bit oily and the chicken to me was very dry almost flakey
Then we went with the Beef Curry just in case we didn't like the other too this dish was real good too
After ordering the Scotch egg appetizer I decided to go with the fish fry special
The fish fry was pretty good albeit greasy
I had a pulled pork sandwich great and the Yucatan Chicken soup sooo good you can even sample the soup
Food in the restaurants is always good as it should be again for the prices they charge
very good food TRY THE TRUFFLE OIL FRIES
Had the Pastrami sandwich and Tomato Bisque Our table also ordered the Ahi Salad and the vegetarian chicken salad along with edamame and truffle oil fries off the snack menu  all was very good
The food was cooked well and had good flavor when you use the sauces
I called up on the next business day  and they pulled the booth from the wall to look for my phone  my hat is off to them for excellent food and honesty
Don't let the surrounding area fool you though inside this small Soul food joint you will find some delicious eats
The fried chicken was really juicy and flavorful especially the dark meat
Nachos with colorful chips and grilled chicken and hot wings were ok-tasting

We were then in for a good 20 minute wait before the rest of the food showed up
The meat inside was this super fine texture but did not have a lot of flavor
They are missing out on some real good food out there
Good sushi + good pancakes=SushiCakes Good Thai food + good omelet=ThOmelet Good Schwarma + good BBQ=SchwarBQGood doughnuts + good custard=DoughTurdI can see we wouldn't want to go too far with this concept but it's working for SteakenBurger
The atmosphere is pretty basic service was friendly and the food was pretty good and reasonable
The price is also good especially for how much food they give you in one order
The reviews focused on the food especially the quality of the fish that was served
Toyama had a nice mix of various dishes that were mouthwatering and delicious
Appetizers with 2 types of ika a standard type of calamari and a dish with the calamari legs deep fried in a kaarage style
The fish was tender and moist with a grilled crust to the skin that intensified the miso flavor great as an appetizer and would be wonderful as a main dish
The food is very good for a Brewery Bar and of course there is the beer
The fish and chips are really quite excellent for a bar and the burgers are downright tasty
The service was prompt and professional the food was delicious and as ordered and the atmosphere was nice
We managed to top it off with dessert lemon meringue pie and creme brulee and both were pretty good although I was honestly too full to enjoy that course myself
I was plesantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the food here
We ordered the empanadas for an appetizer and we were treated to a tasty beef pastry
-food was mediocre at best once you got past the fact that it was dry cold and tasteless -the ambiance was dreary and the incense was nauseating
I already had a hunch that it would be pretty good because I do like american urbanized mexicanesque food
Red meat being the only option however seems a good idea because they can concentrate on what they do well shredded meat seasoned and crisped satisfactorily
There isn't a whole lot to say about the food except it really isn't very good at all
Service was attentive and timely waiter was very knowledgeable and we were very impressed with the quality and flavor of the food
For a good sampling get a bunch of appetizers to split vegetarian combo platter is a good place to start and for the entree the Byblos Mixed grill offers lamb chicken and keufta ground and spiced meat kabobs
best Mediterranean food in the valley  love the open kitchen layout it makes for a great show on a Friday or Saturday night the live jazz on Thursdays and Saturdays makes it worth the trip from central phoenix for me
the broth is good the beef is good the noodles are good
Since it was actually chilly out I ordered the cha-shu ramen noodles with a couple of their yummy bread rolls & also picked up a slice of their amazing blueberry bread
The rolls were yummy as usual & I ate half of the cha-shu so good & a big enough portion for me to have it again for lunch tomorrow
Other tasty items I have enjoyed here are cali crunchy roll double shrimp crunchy roll grilled chicken salad w/ginger dressing instead calamari edamame & I have tried a couple different pasta dishes which were surprisingly good
Same great Lolo's fried chicken and waffles without the risk of getting stabbed or shot
The food is that good it might even be the ultimate in comfort food
But then I looked to the right and saw an empty lagoon with tchotchke plastic turtles and fish upended and scattered atop PVC pipes in the concrete enclosure
The chicken enchilada with tomatillo and green chile was deliciously cheesy with huge chunks of chicken
All in all the food was tasty and the appearance of the place was nice and swanky
If you like top-notch Thai food a great ambiance and excellent service then this is the restaurant for you
It was the sort of quality I'd expect from a fast food drive-thru only a larger portion and served on a plate
The food comes cold with dingy meat and vegetables with brown spots on them
The pita chips weren't that good so we ended up chucking them out to our dog who gladly ate them all The chicken portion on the salad was HUGE as was the salad
It's centrally located right at 1st street and McDowell and the cutest little diner with amazing service and delicious food
The menu has a variety of options to choose from with lighter fare fresh rolls soups and salads to more traditional Thai fare curry dishes noodle dishes fried rice and more and of course desserts that sound oh so good
Liz and I started with the fresh rolls cold hand wrapped and filled with vermicelli noodles shrimp tofu bean sprouts cucumbers and green onions
But hey if they have good food I do not care
Here are the goods and the badsGoodsFood was coming out the kitchen in a good rateThey came around to change out our platesThe combination plate appetizer was good  roasted duck soy sauce chicken bbq pork beef and jelly bandsFrench beef cubes was tastySteamed fishBadsThey did not serve us water after the meal was doneThe rice did not come until 7 of the 9 dishes were out Soup was blandBoiled chicken was just coldSeafood chow mein did not have enough flavor
Regardless I would definitely recommend checking this place out Great sushi laid back atmosphere great service and great prices
Good choice and I don't eat Chinese food
We had the wanton soupwas amazingthe shrimp and egg rolls shrimp was really good egg roll was okay and my fiancu00e9e had sweet and sour porkwas really good and it's deep fried I had the paper steakwas just good and the best was the pork fried rice  my fiancu00e9e keep raving about how good it was and he has high expectations
Its not that I don't like the other places but there is something about that coal fired oven that gives the pizza just an amazing taste and texture that a wood fired oven just can't do
I also tried some kind of pork dish that was a little spicy for me but really good
I have not been overly impressed with Wildfish either time I have been there
Details For dinner Chris offered one starter an amazing summer salad two entrees pork and salmon and two desserts orange cheesecake that I will never forget and a pastry with chocolate gelatto
I am always impressed with the professional way this bar is run and the fabulous food and the open air environment
They are always out of things I want/need they charge more and their quality on the food products is much less
We also several sushi rolls and those were good as well
There's nothing like some good southern food on a blistering hot day
All in all the food was as good as it always is
The beef was so tender and had great flavor it was served with pita lemon potatoes that rocked my world rice and a lemon garlic yogurt sauce
I remember the food was good but not very spectacular when considered the price tag
I don't normally like fried chicken but now I realize that's because I haven't had really good fried chicken before
Literally minutes after we ordered we had piping hot food in front of us
The #50 deep fried egg rolls are good and the BBQ pork spring rolls are very tasty
Good for Foodees couples looking for something different casual meals and a weekday night out
The sushi was good but not great and the bar food was not really bar food
My wife and i split the followingBar FoodEDAMAME - good this is hard to mess upRADIO CHOPPED SALAD - the best thing i eat no protein and expensiveRAISINBREAD GRILLED CHEESE - sounds a bit strange but somehow is all does work together in a a odd type of waySushiSPICY TUNA - good tuna very dry riceSWEET POTATO - to sweet and the texture was just all soft
My chicken was ok it didn't blow me away but the burger was amazing
The meat just fell off the bone was very tender and had a lot of flavor
Most of them are terrible and I find it hard to enjoy my food with a wannabe Bob Dylan not in a good way singing about the ghettos or whatever
The food is pretty good if you can even eat in the nauseatingly pretentious environment
At least the prices can't be argued with for the quality of food
I really like the hummus trio as an appetizer the pear without prosciutto for the entree and the gelato for dessert
It's not a lot of food but oh my God how delicious it is
In general Delux is OK the food is descent nothing to rave home about the sweet fries are worth coming here for and the beer selection and bar is great the seating is cramped if your a big guy like me you will want to sit on the patio
The dish came out fast and on an extremely hot plate
I have had other stuff from here since I've worked and lived nearby for the past 10 years and it's otherwise decent service and passable fast food but with so many other affordable and decent Mexican joints around with drive-thru windows this isn't worth it for lunch or dinner either unless you're in a real time crunch
But I still can't wait to get back to the good stuff aka SF sushi
I don't mind spending money on good food but this seemed kinda steep for a lackluster lunch
If you want excellent food this is as good as it gets in Scottsdale
The fish and chips were flavorful light and perfectly battered
The cuban was one of the best I've had and the chicken and beet salad was delicious
I'll admit that the food could use more flavor in the way of more herbs and spices but overall I really like this place and will come back
For entrees three of us including me had the Arroz con Mariscos Razz doesn't skimp on the seafood - this dish was huge and flavorful; kind of like a combination between paella and risotto
The food I've had has been really good flat bread pizzas spring rolls lettuce wraps burgers and best of all their pizookie
The pulled pork was good the bbq brisket quite tasty and the pulled bbq chicken was surprisingly good
I'm of the mindset that chicken is the least attractive option at any bbq joint but this was very good
I will religiously attend brunch at Gallo Blanco because their food is amazing and the wait is not as bad as other brunch hotspots around downtown
The food is good but its best to go early if you want a meal since eating in the dark is a bit tricky and messy
The blackened chicken taco was my favorite and the chipotle sauce is amazing
For breakfast I highly recommend a chicken breakfast burrito with the chipotle sauce added
If you are in the area the kind service and wonderful food is worth the stop and any wait you may or may not have to endure
Even with strong flavors like Blue cheese and Balsamic glaze the flavor of the beef stole the show
I also had ham and beef brisket although good there was nothing special about them
The food was pretty good but prices a bit high
We had the coconut shrimp appetizer which was absolutely delicious with an awesome presentation then we shared the crab fried rice also delicious and the sticky rice mango dessert yum
I ordered the Pseudo Stroganoff; a vegan dish made with seitan that was quite good
Anyway the service is nice and the food is reasonably priced  and it's in a pretty good location
The beef brisket and pulled pork were so good
Their selection of beers isn't staggering or anything but the food there is actually pretty damn decent and they have a fair number of appetizers to choose from that aren't too heavy
The only reason that I am giving this 3 stars is because although the sushi was just good I don't think it was anything special and it's kind of expensive
Chang's somehow built a reputation albeit hardly deserved of offering high quality gourmet Chinese food
They do an excellent job of replicating the same food and atmosphere without the high prices of Manhattan or LA
British pubs aren't my favorite places to eat since I am a vegetarian who eats fish occasionally but this place was pretty good
I'll be going back to Butterfields where there is good food and service with a smile
He says the sushi is amazing- comparable to some of his favorite and way more expensive sushi restaurants
The sesame chicken has the perfect texture and flavor
Pretty much everything I tried was good-- even the American favorite fried chicken was excellent
I was also particularly impressed by the spring rolls- in my experience spring rolls tend to just taste like whatever sort of oil they were cooked in but these spring rolls were bursting with flavor
The meat eats rock and service is good 'ol unmistakable Texan hospitality
It was good food made by people in a good mood which makes it taste and feel that much better
While the dish came with rice and beans I was able to see why the plates our meals arrived on were so small Any larger and the approx 3 tablespoons of cold tasteless yellow-colored rice and 2 tablespoons of cold beans that accompanied the meals would have spilled over the edge of the plate
The Pacifico beer that accompanied it however was just wonderful -  I'd comment on the other dishes we had but they are variations on the theme above
The food and coffee are good - but most of all I like that I can walk my dog here to get coffee and the newspaper on the weekend
Of course the flavor will be bland when using no butter/cream in Indian food
We ordered from the happy hour to start - tofu REALLY good but only 3-4 pieces 2 samosas yummy for not being fried and my bf got the 3 chicken wings he said they were spicy
The good thing is that you can eat the whole dish and not feel really bloated and full like regular indian food
We will never go here regardless whether or not the food is good
I've gone in for a slice at lunch and each time find that the pizza is a bit cold and has been sitting there for a while - doesn't look that great
It was everything as advertised ambiance very casual  GOOD Food excellent service   Adria was very good and made good recommendations  and fair prices
it's not really close to our house but i can see us heading back there my wife really enjoyed the food and the impressive beer selection might make it worth the journey
We ordered Spring Rolls for an appetizer
The rolls were accompanied by a delicious peanut sauce and a sweet Thai dipping sauce Nuoc Cham
To sum up good food great service in a casual atmosphere
Attended a wedding here a couple of months ago and sadly I was VERY unimpressed with the food although the presentation was decent
I guess that makes it worse when the food looks good but taste yuck
The gal that left the review in July has a big surprise coming yes the customer service is good the servers were friendly but again the food was lame and bland
There were two meat dishes fajitas and a small dry steak veggie enchiladas made with flour tortillas cold and covered with some indescribable sauce and the blandest black rice and beans I've ever tasted
Most of our food was cold and even though it wasn't a cold night by any means the food seemed cool when we received it
I am not sure what went wrong and I imagine that it must be very hard to keep all that food warm tender moist flavorful etc
But you may want to really examine the food at your tasting and ask for recommendations from other brides or customers
Just a really neat place friendly people and amazing food
there food is generous portions albeit very salty cheap and pretty tasty
Orders were wrong some of the food was cold e
Other than being tasty the food was good including the Swedish meatballs pork schnitzel and hash entrees the hash was especially salty and even on the spicy side
The service was top notch and the food was all around great quality
Beyond the wonderful drinks the food was to die for
Best horchata I've ever had and eating the fruits and nuts when your done is a tasty dessert
The Rabano radish Pibil salsa was so amazing I almost killed their supply of little cups going back for more
I'm not impressed with the food choices at all
Other than that the food was so mouth watering homemade and excellent complex flavors
My bf had the chicken/steak fajitas which looked and smelled really good
The taco was excellent the shell was crispy and not greasy and the beef had a ton of flavor
I will definitely be going back to Mi Patio the food is good and the people that work there are so hospitable it makes for a wonderful dining experience
I'm from Chicago and one of my friends moved to Scottsdale and recommended this place as something equivalent to our 3rd best deep dish in Chicago but the best available in the Phoenix area
The pizza is pretty good it is the best you can get without having the cool specialties like butter crust or slab sausage that covers the whole pizza
But definitely try the Vito specialty Deep Dish it is good pizza and I would go back for sure   The service is good as well and it has a very homely feel to it I wanted to try the tiramisu but was so stuffed after my one piece of the large which fed 4 of us with 4 slices left over mmm  I did have a piece of pizza bread and a sliver of fried zucchini though both of which were pretty good
It's clean the service is fast and the food is tasty and healthy unlike most everything else in that shopping center
The corn tortillas they use for the tacos are not half as good as the ones Food City or Ranch Market makes
Although the one is Mesa is closer to my house and the food the same quality I prefer the ambiance of this one better so my husband and I always try to stop by when in the area
The waitresses who BTW are very good promoters & up-sellers of their food and products definitely make the limited menu items sound better than they actually were
I was impressed with how friendly the staff was and the food was pretty good too
The white pizza has so much flavor with all the olive oil garlic and cheese they put on
Curried chicken and potato lavosh is pretty tasty
Yum fresh veggies quality meats homemade pesto and great bread
Almost could not eat the soup due to the size of the sandwiches but it was full of homemade flavor and lots of meatballs
Each sandwich came with a tasty cookie which is but a sample of desserts and baked goods available
rrGranted Lisa G's still has only its salad appetizer and sandwich menu but we decided to split three of the dishes the Frutti de Mare salad the Empanadas and the Skewer Plate
This is not the best sushi restaurant in the world although it's good
The pizza thingies aren't my bag but my dining companions have enjoyed them
With such good food and service I'll definitely be going back to Iruna soon
We started with a bruschetta great tomatoes and unusual with capers and moved on to our next courses  meatloaf excellent with a marsala gravy and al dente green beans--plenty for 2 people a pizza fish & chips and a soup/salad combo
Their food is not good enough to be put down and degraded in front of other customers
Good selection of food overall- you're sure to find some good deals
I had a feeling this place was going to be good but became ever more excited when our Mexican friend started getting excited at the authenticity of the menu compared to the food she enjoys when in Mexico
The food was amazing and eating up at the bar with Razz himself was the best
From the amazing grouper belly with black beans and red miso to the ox tail over polenta with avocado relish to the seafood beggars pouch in philo with a spicy tomato cream sauce
Nothing fancy just a casual sit down place with good traditional American cafe/diner food with very friendly service
I only come to a bar to watch the game have a couple of beers and eat good food
For bar food Four Peaks has the best nachos awesome grilled chicken beer bread tasty artichoke dip and a great house hamburger
This is far from authentic Mexican food and was literally flavorless
It's a shame that we paid $30 each for entry into the Food Truck Festival and maybe had $5 worth of food
The pizza is good - lot of toppings and cheese
The briny flavor of the shellfish provides all the substance to the sauce
The food was good fresh and I got exactly what I paid for
You can get all your Asian goodies here load up on siracha buy soy sauce by the gallon and all the chicken feet you want
Hard to believe it took until today to get there but with a case of the Mondays a coworker and I headed there for lunch hoping some fresh air and good food would rejuvenate us
The air was indeed fresh and the food was delicious
I love my large assortment of good foods organic buys and delicious foods that are there for my buying power pleasure
I love the organic ice creams and sorbets I do enjoy their mac and cheese and have only bought it once from their hot foods section
The fish was not quite Rosie McCaffrey's and the chips were not quite as good as Rula Bula's but it was all very very good
The piece of fish was about 12x5 and super crispy and the chips were potato wedges well-seasoned and tasty
UPDATE We returned and had another good meal and we noticed that a few things with my fish dinner had changed- less breading more flavor in the coleslaw mustard
We would go after 8 pm because they have great sushi appetizer and drink specials
I love meatballs but these were lacking in flavor big time
Also a friend of mine go the bbq pork sandwich based on my recommendation and they totally skimped out on the meat portion
After my yucky meatball sub I probably won't go back unless I'm in the neighborhood and really craving some good french bread
BUT I'm sure there are some tasty dishes this place must have because they were very busy during Monday lunch
Sushi I only had the california roll but they do use real crab plus their wasbi was really good soo much better than Stingray which in my opinion is over priced and not worth and the rock thing seriously I don't know of any Asian that has a rock on their kitchen counter to set their rice spatula at home nor for their chopsticks
Other things I like about Sprouts- Their produce section is wonderful -- everything is fresh most of the time very rarely have I seen some of the items look bad- The meat selection is amazing
The chicken in the chimichanga burrito consisted of all white meat - moist and flavorful
All in all the food was quite tasty and reasonable for the amount of food we received
Joes BBQ sauce is very very good and I love the habanero BBQ myselfPulled Pork Sandwich  very good and same super tender meat with same super BBQ sauce
Good place when you have a mixed group of Sushi and non-Sushi eaters
The food was good but nothing I'd go back for
I enjoyed the food at the little hole-in-the-wall across the street Taqueria Los Angeles  far more
The food was wonderful the pasta was cooked perfectly with great texture and amazing flavors the vegetables where fresh and the meat was very tender
But we will be going back for the wonderful food and service just not as often as I would like
There were also chicken enchiladas beef enchiladas plus lots of ingredients for finishing your tacos & tostadas including meat choices of chicken picadillo beef & tasty Al Pastor pork
The ambiance here wasn't to my liking booth arrangement daytime lighting too-loud music but the service was good & the food delicious
Our waiter was excellent drinks were refilled the bread basket was kept full and the food came out hot
Southwestern egg roll appetizers were nothing special can't beat CAKE avocado egg rolls
The food itself was good not spectacular but worthwhile
The dipping waffle fries bacon wrapped chesnuts and jalapeno chicken sandwich were all good
The chicken sandwich was tasty but we could make it at home and it would be just as good
Ultimately we all go out for good food atmosphere people watching and to socialize
For dinner he got the roasted chicken with mac 'n' cheese chicken was tasty and the mac 'n' cheese was to die for
The flavors of the meat were fantastic however there is a lot going on with this place
The Food was good but the portions are a bit small
It so far has always been good for lunch and the few times I've been here for dinner and my last pizza was better here than from the pizzeria
Over the years Sylvia's food quality has gotten worse and their prices have gotten higher
ProGood for large groupsChips and salsa barCatering is great for parties at homeLarge patioConToo much dark meat in chicken entreesDinner prices are too expensive for what you getThe signs posted by management that hang all over the place telling customers what to doObnoxious paint colors
I wouldn't say the food or service here is of Mastro's Ruth's Chris or Capital Grille quality but its the next best thing
Both were extremely tasty - fresh veggies chicken and shrimp in really flavorful sauces with just the right amount of spice
The egg roll was cold the wonton was hard and cold
The only hot part of the dish was the shrimp
I ordered a shredded beef chimichanga and when they brought it out it looked and smelled amazing
I had the Golden Soy Chicken Delight and it was wonderful
Believe me the food isn't tht good so they had a valid complaint
The pizza here is divine; nectar of the gods   Perfect to share with good company and perfect for a night of forgetting the worst and bringing out the laughter
WOW what a wonderful experience for the neighborhood feel and grrrreat food
The food and yes all the food - have tried almost everything on the menu is amazing
The owners are great the food is very very good love the Shaken Beef and the prices will surprise you
The chicken sandwich was good with basil and brie
I may be wrong on both either way Orange chicken = Crazy Delicious
Great places with excellent food & ambiance should be hard to find
The Tuck Shop delivers with top quality and innovative foods filling their menu and thats the reward for your journey
warm pita- Grilled Salmon sandwich- Half chicken with farro- Wild shrimp pizza- Apple Crumble do not have the exact menu name- Chocolate cake do not have the exact menu name- Blood orange and olive oil cake do not have the exact menu nameThey were all delicious
they commented that the pizza crust was good and crispy
Shrimp taco was delicious as was the seafood enchilada
I have always enjoyed the food at Zipps but the last time I ate there the quality seemed less than usual
Other than this last experience the food across the menu is generally very good
Chef Nubuo was there and he personally prepared these dishes for us but I was hoping to find something that my grandmother would make for me like Chawan Mushi but in truth I've found a global fusion Pan Asian Continental cuisine with Japanese flavor which means he seasoned a little heavy to my palate
There is a reason you don't usually find potato skin pizzas at other places it's not cause Prankster's is original it's cause they seem to just throw shit like meat and cheese on anything and call it something presentable like pizza skins which sounds tasty in theory
I shared the margherita pizza which was very good and the ricotta gnocchi
It was clean the service friendly and efficient the food was good
We have tried several rolls salmon tuna California chicken and beef Udon noodles and the chicken Yakisoba and all have been quite good
Dessert crepes that some patrons ordered looked really good so I'll have to try it the next time I'm in town
Delicious breakfast food that you can tailor to your liking
Service wasn't so hot and we did encounter one nasty eye-rolling huffy waitress when I said we would like to sit on the porch how was I to know they had a wait list for that on my first visit
It is a good place to shop for quick fresh food
The staff has always been really polite and friendly- The food is always Excellent and the price is really good for the portion you get
- Kung Pao Chicken - Great flavors not too saucy and the Chili Peppers have a smoky flavor that I can probably pop them on its own all-day long
Overall Glad I found them again and Keep banging out Quality food and great service
The usual chicken feet har gow siu mai chow fun and congee which are my standards are excellent here
My husband had General Tso's chicken which was tasty and I ordered the tofu and veggies
The night I went to YC's might have been badly chosen due to the car show but unfortunately is was completely packed and though I have no problems with people packing their bowls to the gills and  enjoying that all you can eat experience I really didn't care much for the quality of the food and the limited choice of rice as well as the fact that their meats were frozen and shaved
On a good note you have a larger selection of rice and noodles than YC's and the meats are more appetizing as well as the veggies
It's great food - in fact it's as good as it gets in the middle of the desert
Thought it's worthy to mention for those who are worried about bad greasy Chinese food - this place isn't one of those
They have a good selection of Korean food from various jigae's hot pot to nengmyun cold noodle soup as well as Korean-Chinese favorites like Jangpong spicy seafood noodle soup and jajangmyun noodles with black bean past sauce
I got a nengmyun and galbi marinated short rib combo lunch and my husband ordered a bulgogi marinated thinly sliced beef and soon tuboo tofu hot pot bento
The nengmyun galbi bulgogi soon tuboo and california rolls were good
The predominant flavor for the bean sprouts and cabbage was salty and sweet for the radish; no garlic no onion not spicy no sesame oil no vinegar etc
The good news was the food was fresh and arrived quickly they had expediters
HOT was the spice level I requested but disappointingly the spice level AND the food temp were somewhere around luke warm
There is a wonderful selection of cheeses and meats to choose from
I tried bites of my friends' catfish and porkchops also good
Sauce is a good place if you want lunch while you are out shopping but don't want typical mall food court options
Most of the other stuff is pretty stock from the arcade to the low-quality food
I am in love with the carnitas burrito and the employees are so nice and make some damn good food
If you are looking for all around good food good service with a pleasant atmosphere this is a great spot
The food was good but the poor service and too loud music ruined the experience
The peanut butter and jelly was good; it was like the comfort food of your childhood grew up to be just a bit more complex
This place has character food is good not wow but good and service was good
The food is unique tasty and very well put together
Even the items on the kids menu have unusual flavoring and most kids prefer plain food
The pizza which is usually wonderful was a bit burned on the edge
I decided to make the trip into town on two different occasions this past month for Italian beef and their quality and freshness became so much better late in the afternoon
Now I've eaten Asian food all over the world and I've never had a Spicy Korean see photo before last night
The Mongolian dish see photo is similar to the Garlic and Scallions dish you would find in most Szechuan restaurants
The food is good if you look past the name and accept the general Asian-ness of what is being offered
Fortunately for peeps like myself more and more people are waking up to the fact that A LOT of people are gluten-intolerant which means more availability of good products like Barro's Gluten-Free Pizza
You know the smell that sometimes comes out of a burger restaurant- the slightly-singed but otherwise-delicious smell of meat being grilled
As far as decor the restaurant does a good job of sticking to an anti-doctor theme with signs plastered all over the restaurant warning you of the unhealthy nature of their food mandatory patient gowns for all diners and waitresses dressed as cute nurses
Sure there are plenty of fast food restauraunts but if you want a freshly prepared burger for 5 bucks give smashburger a shot
There beef was good quality the fries and onion rings were great
The food was pretty good nothing mind-blowing but not bad by any means
I don't eat meat so I didn't try the carne tacos but my friends said they were pretty good
Our other dish; the sampler platter could best be described as a plate of hot garbage
Bland and boring greasy food huge portions but zero quality and a wait staff that you'd swear just woke up from a long nap
The chicken bowls are delicious especially with all white meat
FOOD This place is the epitome of quality over quantity in terms of its menu
Burgers are also amazing for a fast food chain
The steak was absolutely superb though and the seafood was good
4 stars4 The sushi chefs here do not take sushi orders verbally which is de rigeur at good sushi bars
irasshamase welcome good choice how is the sushi
Overall the food was pretty good and it was nice to eat some Greek food on a trip rather than the usual Mexican places
The chicken salad was very good but the bread it was on was AWESOME
Although I prefer the beer at another local brewery this place has amazing food
I think Panda Express has better-quality food than this place
It's all served on top of a bowl of sushi rice which is VERY flavorful
The vegetarian roll was simply amazing
The others reported their chicken salad and angle hair pasta was very good
Food is nothing to write home about what I would call average quality
I'm sure the guys are not there for the quality of the food
As for my lunch I wasn't much of a fan of the salad which was basically iceberg lettuce with ranch and the daal was a little on the bland side but the naan with the chicken was excellent
I took a taste of the korma and it was pretty tasty but my other collague said his veggie biryani was a little too mild for him which is surprising since the chicken biryani I've had at the Scottsdale locale has always been pungent with flavor
To start we got the Chicken Pot Stickers as an appetizer
The sauce was wonderful the chicken was flavorful and moist and I only wish they served 6 pieces instead of 5 so we could have shared them more easily
The spices and seasonings were perfect but the bread-to-meat ratio was a little more on the bread side but the flavor still did not disappoint
The meat was not dried out not fatty and oh-so tasty
I first experienced these when I ordered the Jamaican Black Pepper Chicken and Shrimp which is soooo good with the mango salsa black beans and seasonings
but who cares what the name is as long as the food is good
People say this place is good but my experience was bad on all fronts - food service and management
And this was after I had gone to the deli counter to see whether their meats were any good
I can't visit Whole Foods without filling up my cart with delicious goodies and I kind of feel like I've gone on an adventure every time I walk inside
I will end this review with a summary of the individual meal options they provide made-to-order sandwiches wood oven pizzas Chinese food an extensive and I mean extensive salad bar including hummus cous cous & pasta hot sandwiches pre-made cold sandwiches a sushi bar and much much more
The pear salad with blackened grilled chicken and it was tasty
What you're really getting is the cooking show worthy of a sixth star  our chef was extremely friendly and we had a great time as our food was cooked
The sauces they use are what saves the place food wise but they're all clearly pre-made elsewhere for a generic nationwide palette--the hot mustard just wasn't hot at all
On the other hand the two ginger sauces a red one in the meat and a yellow one in the salad were absolutely delicious
The magic here is the presentation the sauce and the overall delivery but it's severely hampered by food quality prices and poor service
Even if I go for work with a large group the service is good the food is great and the prices are very fair
The food is good not the best Mexican cuisine in town but the lunch deals are fairly priced
Our server was very friendly and helpful- something that can either make or break your experienceafter all what's the point of good food if you have to deal with bad attitudes
I had just a basic chicken taco and the tortilla soup both which were very good
Upon a recommendation that I check this place out by a fellow food lover I did
I have only a 10 isn't the food amazing suggestion limit that I can stomach before I want to say stop making me feel uncomfortable because maybe I don't agree with you
we're fine - may I eat now before another one of you comes by and tells me how amazing the food is
I put my good knives in the dishwasher before I knew any better
To me it was just backyard grilling food not worthy to pay a premium for
The thing that really brings these little guys together is that delicious roll that the dogs are put in
The waiter disappeared for 15 to 20 minutes at a time - food was cold portions were very small
Overall I thought the food was good value and would definitely stop in here again
Been going here for 20 years food is good service is adequate
The food is goodI really dont see a problem with it at all
The rolls are amazing with the honey butter and I cant get enough of them
so as long as the food is good and they dont have flies in their food which happened to me last week at souper salad then im a fan
I dont know if its the quality of the food the atmosphere or the great selection of beer here but Dean and the rest of the people over at the Cornish Pasty Co
If my dessert is good later on they may redeem themselves a bit but for now I'm really disliking this place  Bill comes and theyve double-charged me for the dessert
Filly B's Super Nachos consist of tortilla chips with some salsa cheese beans and then A SHIT LOAD like seriously at least three full cups more than you'll ever eat of low quality delicious beef
Another unassuming strip mall restaurant with excellent food in Mesa
After living here for seven years I'm *finally* finding the authentic mom-n-pop places with good food yay
They don't have a permit to serve hot food so pita chips and prepackaged hummus is the extent of the menu
I highly recommend this restaurant just know it is expensive but the quality of the food and service are worth paying for
This restaurant is in my hood and I had heard good things about the pizza muffins so I had to give it a try
Little wheels of pizza dough with chesse and ham fresh and hot and gooey
I think aside from the food being beyond wonderful the best part was at the end my car was pulled up front keys in the ignition with a thank you note on the dash and two bottles of water
If you are looking for good sushi or teppan grilled food there are far better choices nearby
I would recommend giving this place a shot if you are a pizza fan
If you are looking for a good mexican food place without having to worry about what you look like Armando's is the place to go
Their unique menu options for salads flat bread pizza's burgers and signature dishes are extraordinary and delicious
The Crisp Pomegranate Chicken is also an excellent choice
The shrimp dish labeled spicy was extremely spicy and nice with a side of rice as was recommended
We ended up with the banana tart dessert which was also wonderful
We will not be returning they are no longer a good value and the food is not longer great but boring
I am giving Gallo Blanco two stars because I have eaten here a few times and the food IS good
Despite good food in a convenient location a very unfortunate experience that I wish very much hadn't happened
The stir fry shrimp dish was wonderful with large shrimps
However the last two times we have been there we got soggy tacos poor service and cold food
the half order of Louisiana Oysters were pretty good my Louisiana Red Fish Filet Sauteed with Jonah Crab and Lemon Chive Butter Sauce was made very well
seafood is expensive but I was also paying for quality of service food and atmosphere of which I didn't feel like I got my bf's money's worth
At any rate the service is always good the food is fresh and piping HOT
It's a bit kitchy but the service is consistent the food fresh and tasty and the whole El Encanto story is charming
Our server was helpful and attentive and the food was delicious
Don't let the lackluster interior fool you because there is some amazing food to be had here
Overall this is my new favorite spot for Thai food and definitely worth the drive its not close by for you
The service is fantastic the food is amazing and the atmosphere is relaxing and upscale
The beef here tastes like pretty good quality and is flavored perfectly
Quality of food overall was good but it was really more about having your dessert and eating it too just in terms of everything being full on fat+flavor
If you come during happy hour you can get the Goat Cheese appetizer for $5 then Pork Chile Verde dish for $8 and share a house white wine carafe for $12
She instantly shot back curtly I can dish out attitude too
Food was pretty good in the dining area not very many tables though when the resort fills up
Fatburger has a QUALITY-quality that places it in a wierd limbo between other fast food burgers and places like Fuddruckers
Thai House has good food though so give them a tray but avoid the lunch crowd
A++_ Delicious food we ordered the Mango Shrimp
The service was good and fast but the food tasted like has been frozen for years
Not only were we sick but the food wasn't very good
Good food for the price and the next thing you know you've got a hot plate of food and cooked in front of your very eyes
Maybe I'm not a foodie or I don't appreciate subtle flavors or whatever but I was not happy with this sandwich
I don't know if they just had an off night if I ordered the wrong thing the red chili plate or if their quality of food has deteriorated; but I was sorely disappointed during my last visit
I've always liked the atmosphere at the other Los Dos better I mean come on the red chili plate is aka chile colorado at any other Mexican restaurant but at least the food used to be good
This last time the food was bland the tortillas were greasy I could have gotten better guacamole at Chipotle and the poppers were store bought yes I know dumb mistake- they just sounded good at the time
And they had several flavors of chicken wings to choose from
The food was amazing and it came out quick but then again it was 745 In the morning so we were the only ones there
Over the years I have only had one poor experience during lunch with some work colleagues it has never been repeated and I am very happy to have this establishment as one of my go to places for good traditional sushi when I am on the west side
The food was good but my boyfriends orange juice was rancid
The bartender gave great service and made great food recommendations
All the food we've ordered has been pretty good because of the plates it seems like small portions but they are actually decent sized
Great atmosphere love both the patios good service and good food
It is soooo easy to take beef marinate it and grill it up and make it delicious
I would love to go back on a hot night to check out the food and the crowd
The place was busy so it did take a while to get food but I was relaxed had my sangria and had good music so all was right in the world The parking could be a problem but I got lucky and was able to pull right in
That means absolutely do not order your pizza until you are finished with appetizers
My husband's souvlaki pita was tasty the meat was lean moist and cut in perfect sizes for the wrap
The service is usually good and the food is always fresh
I recommend Pita Jungle  for anyone who wants to have fresh healthy food
Delicious chicken teriyaki with rice & mac salad
but the bread itself was great the salads were good and the desserts were phenomenal
and food ranged from okay to good with great desserts
Maybe their pizza is just absoluetly amazing leading to the stellar Yelp average here
If you are in the Scottsdale area and would like some great burgers and food the Grind is a wonderful place to stop for a quick bite or a great dinner
but I wasn't terribly impressed w/their food
We also had the pate which was good the onion tart which no one cared for that much the french onion soup which was okay medallions of filet mignon w/blue cheese great flavor & texture combo but on the salty side and beef burgundy which tasted a bit like stewed ropes
The beef tortilla and other fillings were all very good
Definitely would recommend this place if you're looking for tasty authentic Mexican food
the weather was perfect Heidi the owner was great and I was so releived to finally find a cool place with good food by my house
* Pillow Chicken - minced chicken with a bunch of other crunchy good things fried up mouth-sized dumpling style and blanketed in black pepper sauce -  yummo
The food is good the fish is very tender and the shrimp wrapped in bacon is amazing
The food here is good and better than the local chains that occupy the strip mall
The food was delicious and the service was impeccable
We ordered wine appetizer salad dinner and a to go dessert
The rice was cold and dry and the meat was cold and flavorless
Food cocktails old school gym amazing clothing store ping pong shuffle board and corn hole
Definitely a fan of Scramble as the food is freshly prepared inexpensive and they have excellently strong coffee
I come here principally for the tea but the food is good too
The prices are very good nothing over 8 bucks many dishes for under 4 They have quite a variety of dishes I haven't been too adventurous but I would like to come back and have some of the noodles
I have had two meals here and have had most of the appetizers on the menu I think everything was well done the food was great
I cant forget to mention the prices for the quality of the food and great service the prices are very lowtry it
Flavorless and not something I would expect from such an otherwise flavorful dish
Come here if you are trying to avoid a bad hangover but not if you want quality middle eastern food
They are delicious and differ from other salsas I've tried elsewhere and I only tried a few and then they presented Mini Complementary Tostada Ceviches and gosh they were excellent and were better in taste not quality of fish  than some I've tried at high end dinning destinations paying maybe the same as my whole meal here and these were FREE here
Both these dishes I can tell you are as tasty as can be
For me what makes these dishes so great is the delicious well made light sauces they are in
I've now been two times and enjoyed myself and their food on both occasions
But we also ordered the Scorpion Roll - shrimp tempura cream cheese inside topped w/kani masago in spicy mayo & eel sauce which had an amazing decoration on it
My friends and I ordered their Pizza Bianco which was good but not great
Customer Service was AWEFUL on a scale of 1-5 food was 1 drinks were ok the only good thing was the atmosphere which is NOT going to change my mind about going back there I've had much much better fish tacos @ Rubio's & Baja Fresh for fraction of the price & didn't have to go to dinner somewhere else after leaving which we had to do after leaving Tortilla Factory
6 fresh briny on ice fresh Coromandel oysters from New ZealandOcean Trout Carpaccio - another delightful sashimi type dish of a fatty fresh fish also from New Zealand  with a warm olive oil and slivered garlic chips and shaved daikon radishMushroom salad with Yuzu vinaigrette - think lots warm mushrooms shitake enoki and shimeji on top of thin slices of celery and spinach tossed in delicious warm vinaigrette then topped with a handful of 18 year old shaved parmesan
The difference between this buffet and all the other guys  Jasmine Tokyo's food is fresh and a higher quality of  food
99 for dinner with all that Quality food then stay home
I wasn't too impressed with the menu selections either btw there was like 5 salads and 6 sandwiches for lunch but i guess it is BREAKFAST clubThe omelet wasn't very good - I'm not sure if it was because I should've ordered a meat along with the mushroom or the 1/4 lb brick of cheese inside but overall it was bland and the cheese was just ridiculous even after I pulled the excess goo out
The beer and wine selection are above average and the pizza was excellent
We ordered  a 12 pizza with a great sauce mozzarella goat cheese sun dried tomatoes and grilled chicken excellent
They are pretty good at remembering names but who cares about that-- they get my pizza done the right way
If you don't believe me then leave it for those of us who do -- the number one non-alcoholic drink to be had with good pizza
I have also had the teriyaki chicken there which was good too
To earn a 5 star rating your place has to exceed all expectations in food quality service atmosphere and eating out experience
We ordered our food which was ok we did have the couple appetizier then short ribs good but our califlower came out 10 minutes after we were served our ribs
The food was wonderful not a long wait for it to come out and just an overall great experience
5 stars for excellent customer service and tasty food
The food was not amazing but it was decent and reasonably priced
I'm not a complainer and I hate sending food back so I picked as many out as I could but it wasn't really worth salvaging
We had  pizza on flat bread with Roma tomatoes for appetizer
For the food the coleslaw and corn are excellent side items
The plantain and avocado rolls are perhaps the only thing on the menu worth the price
And when it came to selling us on the dishes and informing us of the small skewer of prawns or the 2-scallop appetizer he seemed to have forgotten
The appetizers and desserts were especially slow in coming and adding insult to injury those who ordered their desserts to go were served a good 10 minutes before those who wanted theirs served
The food is just average but the atmosphere and ambiance is worth going for
The service was good and our food came out fast
The restaurant web page states that for over 80 years Sing High has run on hard work and good food
More a small burrito than an egg or spring roll the egg roll was delivered too steaming hot to eat immediately
I started going here in 1990 and the food is as good today as it was back then
The flavors are fresh and the food is fresh
I've been going to the Peppersauce frequently for about a year now and it is always good food
The got lots of different hamburger and chicken sandwiches as well as meatloaf Reuben sandwich and other tasty lunch fair
Sure there are other places I'd rather go given unlimited time and funds but for a good comfort food meal this is as good as it gets
Your food is at least stove hot and made to order
To be fair the last time I was there  the manager noticed I didn't eat very much and asked me why & when I  told her it just wasn't very good she was very apologetic immediately refunded me and offered me a free dish of anything on the menu
I'm a bit of a germ-a-fob so you wont usually find me at buffets very often but I had to try this place after our waitress while dinning at a fine dinning sea food restaurant recommended we try Pacific Seafood Buffet
It's not Rio's Seafood Buffet in Las Vegas but give this place a shot and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised with the quality of food variety and freshness this place has to offer especially in Phoenix AZ
It's got as good of a selection of food and it's half the price
The quality of the food is slightly better at the Rio however it's not twice the price better and we don't have to go all the way to Las Vegas to eat at a great seafood buffet ~ it's in our own back yard
The Rama Beef is a good change up with tender beef in a peanut sauce over thin crispy noodles
Prices were good - I think my meal which was a lot of food and included a drink was about $15 including tip
My husband had the fish that was a special and highly recommended by the waiter
Service was good they did a good job to keep the inebriation train a rollin'
The food was also quite  good with the steaks done medium rare properly and the sides were tasty
The rolls were good but did not seem fabulous as others claim warm and fresh but a bit too greasy on the outside
THE FOOD I swear in the back of Pizzeria Bianco is some secret garden where all of the fresh ingredients come from because the quality is there
We all walked away talking about how amazing it was and how great we felt after dining on pizza
We ate the chicken apple sausage with eggs the next day and they were beyond flavorful
The food is amazing and unless you're from the UP chances are you haven't had anything like it
It really took away from the flavor of the dish
My wife and I both absolutely love their dessert in particular the Dirt N'Worms and the Hawaiian Delight sundaes but just about every flavor of the frozen custard is out-of-this-world good
I have never had better and was surprised to find something so insanely good at a fast food chain albeit a smaller lesser known one
My wife and I have both enjoyed their chicken breast sandwich as well and it is hands down one of the best you can get at a fast food chain anywhere in Phoenix especially for this price range
Definitely not your typical fast-food fare and well worth a try if you want something quick and exceptionally good but still fast-food-ish
The food is extra amazing and consistent and the added benefit of knowing you are eating healthy is a home run
I'm picky about chicken and this was excellent quality and delicious rotisserie chicken they used
PROS - Most of the food is very tasty for the price
Also their spicy chicken sammich is pretty tasty when you consider it is only $1 too
For fast food it is good/acceptable as long as you don't come during lunch time during the week or order the salads
He said the sauce was a little spicy  beefy rich and well made the flavors went nicely with the addition of mushrooms
We shared huckleberry tart for dessert it had pastry cream and less huckleberries than I was expecting but it was good  soon we were ready for the check but they bring us out these tiny BAKED chocolate mousse that tasted light as chocolate air
We also got the Eel Special and Crunch roll which both had a decent flavor but nothing really stood out or had anything that was creative about them at all
Amazing wine list fantastic pizzas with unusual toppings and gnutella crepes for dessert
Some of  the dishes were just OK some were good a few were great
Recommended dishes their fried chicken just lightly flour-dredged not thickly battered and very tasty the Singapore rice noodles and the shrimp dishes
They had heard about it from tv and said their Italian food was wonderful
Both of our sauces were also amazing and the meatballs that went with my dish were the best I have had in years
Their prices are too high for mediocre food and don't even get me started on their baked goods
The food is delicious but it seems as if the prices sky rocketed with the new menu
Then when we were in the checkout line our clerk offers us bags of ice to keep our food cold on the way home
The food had no flavor and the sangria was a joke
Just because you say fusion doesn't mean you have good food in fact Chino Bandido took cheap Mexican food and cheap Chinese food and serves it in the same establishment
The service is excellent top notch for a place where you order at the counter and they use white mean chicken which is a plus for me but the food is so terrible that I can't give it more than 1 star
I can separate the foodie critic in me and appreciate the food service which was excellent and being able to enjoy a post-pit pre-show dinner with a table for 8 even if it is just OK food
and sample the food and let me know if it's any good - the bartender told me it's excellent
The very nice flavor of the steak peppers and onions with a homemade fresh roll was fabulous
They have Italian Beef hotdogs burgers salads pitas Gyros Sandwiches including Pastrami soups baked potatoes wings nachos a kids menu and ice cream and cookies for dessert
Super thick inverted topping pizza that's so tasty and so filling we dubbed it gut bomb since one slice will pretty much do you
Very clean consistently good food with great flavor
95 which is dirt cheap for the quality and quantity of the food you get
The food is already bland then to deliver it cold
You are all enjoying good food and good company in one large room
As has been the case for most FOX restaurants I have visited the food is consistently interesting and good
I continue to frequent these places for the atmosphere service and good food
Even though I felt jipped on the portions I would give it another shot as some of those pizzas looked delicious coming out of the oven
The service is fast and friendly and the food is amazing
Of course it ended up being one of the most delicious things I'd ever eaten and I have returned several times to try other dishes
The food is good and priced right and the waitstaff is very friendly
Meatballs and Cheese bread make for a good snack the pretzels are quick pick too
Their food is really delicious and not processed
They took it away and tried again to my dismay I received a now flavorless dish with similar noodles
The fish tacos are amazing carne asada al pastor lengua you name it and they are great
Service was prompt and all the food was very tasty
For all those that think the quality of a grass fed burger vs in and out is the same you are sadly mistaken sorry but until people realize this and stop paying so little for crappy food better quality will continue to cost more
I tried the Philly Cheese steak and well it was very well made and very tasty for bar food
I ordered the Friday fish fry as the waitress told me how good it was
The potato cakes were tasty and I was so hungry I ate most of the fish
I got the Vegas roll which was delicious except the pieces were HUGE
The food is Delicious and Generous and the prices are SUPER reasonable
The Alfredo the Dark with chicken is wonderful and my staple
They offer some excellent desserts like gelato frozen yogurt and cupcakes as well
The pizza is excellent though and well worth it
The service was good and the delivery guy even made an effort to run the pizza to us so it was nice to see that he was trying hard to get the pizza to us as quick as possible
The omelet is stuffed with your choice meat clear noodles and other good things
We have tried several of the veg/tofu dishes with Spicy Green Bean Spicy Ginger Pad-Woon-Sen and Spicy Basil Leaves being the highlights but all the dishes I've tried have been tasty and fresh
Their food is above average quality bar food
The place is very cute the music was appropriate and the food was delicious
The 7-9 tables that make up this great neighborhood find the attentive service by the service staff who was also helping cook in the kitchen and the unexpected quality food that came out were 3 key ingredients that make this a 5-Star Find
The only way to describe this dish which on this night came with a vodka sauce instead of their usual tomato sauce i guess was a plate full of little fluffy pillows of deliciousness
The pizza is always delicious to me it is not greasy like some of the pizza places out there
Service here has always been good and the food is flawless
I sat right in front of the fish station and really enjoyed watching the chefs at work
Marlene was a wonderful tour guide and Jessica added all of her food knowledge of the restaurants we were visiting
I love the way they make their vegetarian food so flavorful and it doesn't feel like I'm not eating meat
The spring rolls bbq rolls and deep fried wontons are really good I like the sauce
All were good with interesting flavores but the fried chicken and carmel pudding with caramel popcorn on top were by far the best
It's void of a club scene the quality of the food is stellar and while it's not cheap it's justifiable
Their udon sashimi salads and rolls are all delicious fresh and expertly prepared
The food here was much better right away I knew it was going to be a big improvement even the chips were good fresh and tasty
Our server was awesome we got our food very fast and everything was excellent
I had previewed the menu online so we had an idea beforehand of what to expect and the food did end up being very good
We only got to try the salads with grilled chicken but it was still very good
While the atmosphere is good the food is about the worst that I have had and the service wasn't exceptional
The food is excellent I have not heard a bad thing about any dish and the dessert is worth the trip
The service was pretty good and friendly but a lot of the food just looks average
This is a hard one because their food is so good and in such large portions but everytime I've been there the service is really slow and crappy
The Lunch Special menu allows you to select one or two of many main item choices all the same price each & one or two of a good number of side dish selections all the same price each
For an appetizer I have never encountered Siam Wraps at any other Thai restaurant but the minced chicken wrapped in lettuce is reason enough to visit
The pizza sauce has a wonderful flavor but does verge on being too sweet
When the food came out it was hot and fresh
My personal favorite was the seafood enchilada but her chimichanga was dang right amazing too
Unfortunately the food was not nearly as good
We are from San Diego and finding good Mexican food as in not Tex Mex in Arizona has been difficult
The Sauce was the same for the Penne and Ziti Dish Bland No flavor just mushed tomatoes
They crammed a decent amount of meat and cheese in there to make a pretty good value
First let me say that the food was definitely some of the most original and flavorful I've had
I appreciate the masterful manipulation of flavors to create such original and healthy dishes
Now I am not an olive person at all but I certainly enjoyed that pizza
The food came out slow ice tea refills were slow we would ask for some hot sauce or bread to eat with our meals and we would already be finished with our food by the time we got it
The visit started really good untl I got my food
The food here won't blow your mind but it's quality stuff and hard to top given the price speed and convenience
The menu is written on sheets of paper shown in the Yelp photos but they offer a large variety of beverages and for the size restaurant a good selection of food
I really enjoyed the food and plan on going back
It was very tender and full of flavor; again just enough spice to let you know it was there and not so hot that you couldn't enjoy the other flavors in the dish
For me everything that was mixed with the beef was very good and full of flavor
The food was great and the service was just as good
Typically I get the Meatball Parmesan sandwich the meatballs are fantastic that's a good meatball but I've tried many others including their pizza all tasty and large portions
The ahi tuna's texture and flavor were both off I am extremely familiar with raw fish
The steak special was a good cut of beef but oversalted
Okay more like the delicious burritos I used to eat in the bay area when I lived there but still I wanted mexican food
My brother orederd the pork tacos- extremely tasty if I do say so myself- and the filet mignon torta- which wasnt what he expected and I myself couldnt really stomach meat was a little on the sweet side and way too much bread
It's sweet and vinegary and weird and ruins perfectly good smoked meat
The menu had all sorts of delicious sounding sandwiches and the barbeque staples and most of it was heavy on the meat so keep the veg heads away from this butcher shop or they'll be forced to nibble on the sides
She was chatting up a storm with us about how good the food was and even gave us a sample of their special of the day Sloppy Joes which was bangin'
I had a Jell-o cook book as a kiddo and tried just about every recipe in there including the nasty mixed vegetables suspended in unflavored gelatin and beef stock
The food did appear flavorful with the Carne Adovada Quesadilla done perfect the Carne Adovada House Special both a real hit
The Aztec Chicken came with a wonderful presentation but it lacked any depth in flavor
I'm giving three stars because while the food is good it's not great
I went in today hoping to find the food as good as during my first visits but unfortunately this meal was just as disappointing as the last one
There were still some good dishes - the clams in spicy broth the shrimp dishes the veggies the baked yams
The rest of the  dishes remained pretty much the same as in previous visits some good some just OK
I admit the presentation in no way compares to AJ's Fine Foods but the quality of most of the goods are top rate and the price is as well
On a second visit the quality of the meat was poor quite fatty and about half of it was inedible
The pizza isn't as good as Pizzaria Bianco PBbut I'm more likely to return to Cibo over PB due to the outside atmosphere
Get ready to enjoy cold cuts or chicken salad on cold bread with as little condiments or additions as possible for three times the price you would pay if you just went to Fry's and made it yourself
We also got a pasta dish that was very good
Ribs chicken fish Mahi mahi potatoes fries broccoli all made with care with quality ingredients and quite tasty
A little expensive but I think it was worth it given the quality of food and the excellent service
Not worth cutting up my petite cute little hands to get a little bit of crab meat
Always the adventurous type when it comes to food I figured I'd give it a shot
Perfectly cooked chunks of chicken breast with a slab of asiago cheese melted and oh-so-gooey delicious hatch chiles black beans
Good food takes a bit of time to cook properly
I was hoping for all sorts of different noodle dishes so that was slightly disappointing but I go some good pho and was very happy with it
Both rolls are not very authentic or traditional but both are very tasty
Off of their regular menu I suggest you try their hamachi yellowtail sashimi with a side of Sriracha the Sunshine roll and the Spicy Hana roll are both good choices too
We had so much food with a fantastic wine and wonderful service
Last night after developing a huge craving for Panang Chicken and browsing Yelp for a good place nearby I decided to call Papaya
I was upset and hoped that for all the trouble the food was at least good
As for the Spicy Eggplant with chicken it was REALLY delicious
The eggplant tasted like some of the best I've ever had not mushy but not firm and I finally got my chicken and yes it was very good
Excellent food and house made chips with the trio dipping sauces yummmm
For this price you get a cup of soup choice of egg drop or hot and sour which I was glad for your entree white or fried rice and a spring roll
My search for good chinese food in the valley continues
My co-diners were very good they helped explain other items on the menu to me and help me pick out future dishes
Overall the food is very good and very ethnic
Let's just say while I have no plans to become a vegetarian the promise of meatless meals this tasty definitely makes me less adverse to the idea
I opted for the Senorita No-Meata a fiesta for your mouth containing peppers black beans corn and rice-it reminded me of a delicious wrap I used to get all the time in college
This one gets 1 star bcause of the food having some decent flavor
Honey Bears was bare bones in decor but for a BBQ place I am not judging on the quality of their pictures on the wall but rather the tastiness of the meat
Not a good experience both service and food wise
While the food was super tasty and worth the higher prices the way in which to order food seemed to contradict both a little
Maybe Mexican food and/or hot dogs as well
5 garlic fries  tossed in olive oil Pecorino Romano fresh garlic herbs unexpectedly stole the show - not too heavy excellent seasoning3 onion rings - high quality the hand-breading is evident panko coating is a nice thought but was overly fried to a hard crust which  completely covered any rosemary/dill notes3 bbq chicken pizza - chicken breast is very smoky mild blue cheese - great flavor but as prior reviewers warn be prepared for some sogginess w/the bbq sauce2
Meaning the food is fresh good and reasonably priced
The noodles were good and the flavor of the beef and oyster sauce was outstanding
The food at this place is seriously amazing
We genuinely enjoyed our evening here and we will absolutely go back but it is pricey especially for the size of the dishes
Yes the food is pretty good - but you really want to go here for their bread
it goes on virtually everything pizza mashed potatoes salads I also highly recommend their Herbs de Provence as it is a staple mix of flavorful and savory herbs for a myriad of dishes
Hit this store and stock up on some good spices and taste the difference in the food your prepare
Quality of spice truly makes the heart of every dish
I found the food excellent but keep in mind this isn't typically Mexican food this is Tex-Mex which is a whole different variety
Im not a big fan of mexican rice so I didn't partake in eating it however the fan of mexican rice at the table liked it but not as much as the fajitas Conclusion - Excellent Staff Great Food Its Tex-Mex
OH OH and the chicken katsu was really good too
The side dishes were tasty but only about 6 were served
Overall the food was really good but I wished the portions were bigger
Chicken portions are good sized and fairly apportioned you don't get stuck with just a neck and a wing in a 2-piece meal and very well cooked but much more subject to gristly weirdness than Supremo
Now perhaps taking a hint from Supremo Sabroso has signifcantly cut its menu down to the essentials think whole chicken 1/2 chicken quarter chicken and the essential sides and a couple quirky add ons and that kind of laser-focus hopefully will keep them in business a long time as they perfect their chicken and the Sabroso folks REALLY have improved the quality of the chicken compared to the last guys Correatado
So in the ultimate final summary of the Sabroso / Supremo SmackdownCHICKEN  Supremo ***** Sabroso ***1/2SIDE QUALITY  Supremo ****1/2 Sabroso ****SIDE CREATIVITY  Supremo *** Sabroso ****SIDE PORTIONS  Supremo *** Sabroso ****LOCATION  Supremo *** Sabroso *1/2DESIGN/ATMOSPHERE  Supremo ** Sabroso **1/2SERVICE  Supremo *** Sabroso ****FINAL SCORE  Its all about the chicken at these dives
His was a bit drier than mine no sauce but both were still good and we walked away with a whole pizza left over between the two of us yummy yummy left overs
Rotating resturants always pull me in and I hope that the food will be spectular and amazing
The wine list was actually quite decent but the basic house wines were just-ok California large labels =  And the dessert wasn't good
The next day they had posted a photo to Facebook not about their food or a special but look how how our waiter/cook is
Okay the food if not able to feed entire armies is on the delicious side but unimaginative
They also have a delicious pizza bread appetizer that's good to split
I've enjoyed the food and the service a little more at the Tempe location but this one is in such a convenient spot
Being able to choose from Salmon Beef Turkey Buffalo Lamb and other meats is amazing
Not only was the hotel suite very affordable when split between 4 guys 3 queen beds and 1 roll away all in 1 suite at no extra charge
the service is amazing and the food is excellent
It's true the place was a little pricey but not anymore than any good sushi place I have known
They had good spice to them though and I liked being able to have two different meats going on
Tanya enjoyed her Tesuque chicken salad
The jalapeno bacon was good too but the tortilla crusted chicken was more crust than chicken which was a bit disappointing
The hotel has a complimentary shuttle to and from the airport and has a full breakfast included in the price of the hotel eggs breakfast meats waffles bagels english muffins oatmeal cereal etc
It's all-beef poking out between a sweet and tasty but not overwhelming bun
From what I could tell it's got good food plenty of gigantic tv's and waitresses who are more than happy to bring us tourists two feet of ballpark goodness
The chicken dish Doro Wat was one of the best chicken dishes I have ever eaten tender chunks of chicken in a reddish wonderfully seasoned sauce with just a little kick to it
I will most definitely be going back to try more of their wonderful food in the near future
Listen it's not the greatest food in the world but for the price and service it's damn good
I LOVE the hot and spicy chicken or beef
The teriyaki chicken is very good as well as the bulgogi
If its too busy check out the Original Hoagie Shop next door for amazing food and service as well
The steak was not NYC strip or anything but was a good cut of meat tender well seasoned without gristle and not fatty
Most of the dishes were par for the course for Chinese buffets with typical choices - except for the salt and pepper squid which is not very common in buffets and is quite good here
We started with some Monkey Balls from the Happy Hour menu which was a very good size portions of mushrooms stuffed with crab meat cream cheese and fried tempura style served with 2 different sauces these were yummy not soggy at all
Then we got a Sashimi combination that came with a spicy tuna roll real good
Their Crazy roll is also very good their portions are very generous and loved being able to see the Sushi masters do their job with excellence sushi rolls kept coming out non stop with the same level of mastery
For the appetizer I ordered the beef empanadas
I liked the corn starch dusted coating and the overall flavor and moistness of the chicken
Honestly I was a bit worried about this scenario because I thought I might run the risk of having the food be cold and soggy by the time I got home
And really what's worse than cold fish and chips
Luckily I don't live too far away and the food was still piping hot 10 minutes after we unwrapped and started eating
The fish was crisp flaky and delicious
That said it's cleaner than other Toxic Bells the drive thru is always busy and they are fast - which is a good sign because that means the food turn over rate is high
The food is good  the service is good and the prices are inexpensive
Anyway the food is just really good breakfast food
My dinner partners enjoyed a blackened talipia with dirty rice fried catfish with fries and a steak with mash potatoes and brocoli
I'm not vegetarian but i try not to eat so much meat and their veggie tacos are sooo good
It is probably a great place for tourists but for locals looking for good food reasonable pricing and value
I love their pho specifically the pho tai with rare beef slices which is super-flavorful
Thai hot is the way to go for the Rama's but tends to be way spicier in other dishes
I definitely recommend this place to all lovers of great thai food
Not only was the food absolutely delicious - beef short ribs I will be dreaming of you tonight - but the whole experience was tremendous
I can't wait to go to iPic and try out another one of Tanzy's amazing dishes beforehand
We had a group gathering here for dinner NAAAP and the food was delicious
They have an excellent selection of premium foods and if they don't have your brand they can special order it
The Tuna Crunch Roll is really good and so is the Buba Gump Roll
Their Thai food is also pretty good and their Tom Kha has a nice thick broth
It was quite tasty and I ended up eating the ENTIRE pizza
The food was good but I don't think I would wait multiple hours to enjoy a slice
We ordered the diver scallops and the kurobuta pork chop and were extremely impressed with both the quality of the ingredients and the creativity of the dishes
but whatever I'm always willing to pay for good food
The food is delicious and very reasonable priced especially compared to Genghis Grill
I can't say enough about the quality of the food
I'll be coming back but only because the food was so good
Definitely was proud of myself because it was delicious and though maybe a small pizza for some choosing two 8inchers filled us both up
Fried rolls are good but their fresh rolls are better
the crust is perfect in texture and taste and the ingredients that top the pizza including the ooey gooey cheese are of the highest quality
We already knew the quality of the food would be fine as all IHOPs are fairly consistent
They have a built in GPS system on the carts which helps speed up play and the drink wagon is fully stocked with all kinds of drinks and good food
I recommend the Senorita Roll it's half off
This is a good market to find food items from all across Asia really
I had the southwest chicken sandwich which was very good but messy which surprised me given the fact that they cater to a business clientele
We skipped an appetizer planning ahead for dessert and for our entree ordered Rainbow Trout with a side of Truffle Parmesan Fries
There's good food good staff good service good prices and lots of outdoor seating so this is a great place to go for a nice evening out with anyone
I'm a foodie so I want to take a minute to mention how good the food is here
Fresh Mint really shows how varied and flavorful vegetarian food can be
Update  I originally gave this place 2 stars however my wife went here a couple days ago and really enjoyed the food so to be fair I am adding a star and will give them another chance
She said the food was fast fresh and the service was good
I recommend any chicken dish since they spice it so good
Even if I had e negative staff experience I would still recommend Fate for the food alone
We go all the time the food is just so good it leaves you craving more
Not only is the sushi good but the whole concept is awesome
It was pretty good but the texture was not that of a bagel it was more like a kaiser roll shaped like a bagel
Notes from Spinato'sMeatball Trio - Even though the name of this appetizer suggests three different types of meatballs
The bread was a dry flavorless airy sub sandwich roll not a fresh-baked baguette
I will admit Mims serves up some seriously good food BUT the place is really small and super ghetto
The food was excellent and the two lovely ladies behind the counter were gracious and generous with the samples
I can usually make it through one and a half slices before I have to put it down because it just isn't scarfable to me which a good pizza should be
Presentation was lovely and the food was also very tasty
Burgers were okay but not worth the price not the best beef as it was grisly and had no taste what so ever
Everyone's food looked good especially the Wine burger
And what to say about their amazing pizza
The spicy dishes gave a kick wile the mild ones still gave a full flavor
But what makes inexpensive good beer even more enjoyable is when you can have it with equally-good food
Four Peaks has you forget that old adage as their food manages to be as good as their beer
The chicken is always juicy and the sides are always plentiful and tasty as well
don't get me wrong though this place has good food
Pretty normal food selection though we had a not so great hot dog here somehow
The food was a decent price but not worth the wait
The Beer is good most of the food is ok but I have a big issue with BJ's
The food is amazing and the customer service is probably the best I've ever experienced
Places that make good food and offer the kind of customer service these places do and family owned is always a plus for me
There is this cauliflower dish on the menu that is so friggin good I wish I could remember the name
To me it is a good sign of an authentic food experience
They make good food that people like in a festive and swanky atmosphere
Just because they have an amazing space and a well-thought-out and well-invested aesthetic concept that doesn't mean they have to try and make inaccessible food that you need to download the Oxford Food-Lovers app on your iPhone to translate the menu
Great appetizers spring rolls inari sunomono etc
and even the food coming out of the grill there quite tasty
This guy was not helpful with the menu and I hate it when you ask what is good or what is your favorite or mabey the most ordered dish and all they say is everything is good not sure what the best is
The chicken was moist and had tons of flavor
Jalapeno jack and green chili on top of flame-broiled tasty beef goodness
She mentioned how large the fish use to be and how good it was
The decor is early college student but we'll continue to return for the delicious vegan food
Cowbro beans pulled pork chicken slaw hot links potato salad mac n cheese rib tips and other items
Extremely thin Neopolitan pizza is served up here and it was quite good
Good quality cheese minimal sauce and a few good beers are on tap Pilsener Urquell paired well with their food
The texture flavor and taste are so authentic that sometimes I find myself second guessing the mock in the meat
Their pasta bowls are also really good and their mock meatballs are pretty delicious
I had some delicious Enchiladas for dinner and a Mexican Meatloaf for brunch
My friend agreed for the chocolate dessert was the perfect amount of cream and cocoa to complement a cup of hot coffee
Food 3Cost to worth it rating 3 entrees $15-20Return worthiness could go either wayHighlights- Shrimp and grits smokey chunky tomato sauce and big shrimp- Meatloaf bolognese pasta meatloaf was awesome in huge chunks with bacon around the outside
The pasta part was just ok- Beignets really good crispy small balls but more sweet than savory cheesy- Peanut butter chocolate pie my fave dessert combo which I liked a lotMidlights- Key lime pie I'm a big fan of key lime but in this version the flavors weren't distinct enough so I'd call in just okLowlights- Menu on website doesn't match menu at the restaurant so hub was disappointed on no prime ribFood was fine and hear it's fun for drinks so might try going there sometime when I'm in the area
I had a salad which was fresh and the chicken I ordered on the top was REALLY good
It was grilled and full of flavor which is sometimes lacking in chicken you get on top of a salad
Everyone at the table seemed to enjoy their food- I tried my Husband's grilled cheese sliders which were greasy but obviously good given its ingredients however it didn't seem like enough food for a full meal
I've never had a bad food experience here and thus every time I show up I know it's going to be good
In summation the food was poor quality the service was awful management is mia
My meats were a little fatty but the ribs were good
I put the hot sauce on the bread for a while but the spice of all the food started to catch up on me so I stopped doing that
Their pizza is a good sturdy kind lots of crust plenty of sauce and fresh items
I've been to this place at least twenty times and I think I only ever order four things there because they're so good the super nachos the rolled tacos with guacamole chicken tacos and the two carne asada burrito plate
If you are in the mood for Mexican food and you're within a ten mile radius of this place it's certainly worth the drive
It could have used a little more meat but other than that it was very good
5 years ago the new family that took over is every bit as nice and dedicated to putting out good food for a decent price
The menu had excellent choices for pasta subs and pizza at reasonable prices
They had a decent wine selection and good food
All I ask is just a bit more quality in the food
I've not often spent so little for pizza that tasted this good
At first glance the prices seem a little steep for a deli but it's acceptable when you realize the quality and QUANTITY of the food you're getting
I got a chicken sandwich with the sweet potato fries and the fresh fruit everything was good
food wasn't 'hot' it was warm but not hot
If I go to a BBQ place that has terrible sides no matter how good the meat is I most likely will not return
Topped with the superior ingredients that LGO is well known for and slathered with a lot of quality olive oil plus a bit of butter the crust gets a great crunch without getting much char and although the oven isn't hot enough to generate the same blister as Bianco or Pomo particularly as the bakers are opening/closing it frequently to put new pizzas in and take finished ones out the structure remains supple with a great chew
We ordered the cheese and cured meat plate to start; the cheese was good but I would skip the cured meats which were some head cheeses and kind of weird other gross-ish meats even my boyfriend who is into cured meats would tell you to pass
We also had dessert a peach cobbler that was delicious
With the dinner for two we got an appetizer 2 entrees soup and dessert
Great tasting pizza incredible crust great salads and desserts good beer and good service
We also had the prosciutto crudo pizza which was every bit as delicious as the appetizer
The food was delivered quickly was hot and fresh and presented nicely
The food looked tasty but small servings and big dollar signs actually the dollar signs were in a normal font size
decent brew baristas who know how to pull a good shot yummy food and snacks and a welcoming peaceful environment
this is a good thing kids means it's like diesel fuel or blow  and I'll have uncontrollable facial twitching for hours without the cost of either
We ordered a salad and a couple of thin crusted pizzas which I thought they were very good
I have to agree with most people that this is probably one of the best pizza places in the US having enjoyed real Italian pizzas in Napoli
Yes I know it's only an appetizer dish not a real entree
But generally these appetizer sampler plates offer some pretty tasty food for a modest price and can be a legitimate meal on its own
But this appetizer dish was just so astronomically horrible
But if you're concerned about the quality of your ground beef and want a great tasting burger that fits into your healthy diet then I think you'll appreciate what they are offering here
My date ordered the pollo poblano a $20 plate comprised of maybe $5 worth of food
Yes the owner is friendly and the food was good but here's what they didn't tell me
Wifey had a chicken plate and I had 3 side dishes all good with diet Pepsi
As far as desserts they have a wonderful selection of those too
We came in here because they the fam had always had a good experience and I heard the food was good
* but it had a great fresh flavor that went well with the rest of the dessert and fruit accompaniments
On the other hand the food is good and really reasonably priced - I recall Happy Hour being around $18 for a couple iced teas Vegas Rolls and a few other rolls having some left to take home even
It was worth the 5 miles to Ray and I-10 because the sushi is definitely good
The tuscan theme is a bit tacky but the donuts are still good and another plus is they have food and desserts too
My favorite kabob was the Chicken  The other two were meat Barg and koobideh which I thought were a bit dry but still tasty
The food was amazing fresh deli turkey cranberry Brie with a light tang of horseradish
I asked our waiter what to order since I wasn't impressed by their filet last time and he recommended the rib eye I asked specifically between those 2 dishes
BTW all the dishes were extremely hot like hell I-burned-my-mouth-roof-and-it's already-peeling hot
Anyways good place for a date but don't expect much from the food and be ready to pay some extra money
Although it took quite some time just to get in and you have to wait outside to be called keep this in mind if  you are there on a cold day it doesn't take very long to get your food
The staff was very friendly and the food was good
Out appetizer never came - waiter said he didn't remember us ordering even though he commented that the dish was good when we ordered
Some of the food was very good so we may give it another try sometime - but truthfully I think there are a number of better restaurants in the area
way coolMeh  -Corn shell was overcooked on 1/2 one side-meat was boring without salsa good thing there is like 20 to choose
But when I'm already in your shopping center for other reasons and I know that neither my wife nor I feel like cooking dinner or going out on a Friday night then your $5 Hot n' Ready pizza may just hit the spot
The food was excellent prices were reasonable and the service is outstanding
I always order the same dish at every Thai restaurant pad Thai so it gives me a good basis for comparison
This place looks pretty rough but it's been here for a long time and I was thinking that the food must be pretty good if it's survived that long
There was a good variety of food here although I was expecting much more in the sushi department considering it was touted as a Japanese type buffet
Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it wasn't as delicious as the pho I had in Vegas and also there is only 1 choice for chicken pho
4  We ordered  the appetizer sampler one soup one pad thai dish and two other entrees
It's nice-When you leave the sushi chefs and servers all say good bye
4 stars for pretty good food great ambience and nice wine selection
Cute atmosphere cheap booze friendly service and tasty food
They are filling and tasty and I don't see why more places would use potatoes for their Mexican dishes
I ended up just buying a chicken green chile tamale which I absolutely enjoyed
joined me up here for the Lunch Buffet*  The food was good overall especially the broccoli salad salad peanuts fried chicken the Polish
There was a good selection of 82 food items out today plus sauces & dressings
The chicken tikka masala was good if more mild than I am used to
Really good artisan style pizzas with bubbly crispy crust and fresh toppings
For the most part food was good and the service was standard
The menu selection was reasonable and the food was overall good
Here's the honest truth on this place Good food nice service somewhat odd decor
On the few occasions that I have been there I have found the servers to be polite and obliging the food to be hot & tasty and the restaurant to be clean
beautiful atmosphere intelligent staff and wonderfully creative food
The food was all pretty good and it looks like they have some good drink and other specials
We also ordered some hot and sour soup which I haven't tried yet because it never arrived until we were finished with all our other food
This is a good place to eat the pulled pork & cabbage or the b-que-beef and chicken mix and just tried the chicken misubi and its pretty amazing
The staff and whom I presumed to be the owner/manager was nice and friendly but that cannot make up for the poor quality of selection and food
I think its reasonable to assume that what I got to taste that day is a good representation of what I will get when my wedding rolls around
Delicious to go sushi at an affordable price
I would encourage everyone to stop by Fujiya Market and check out their selection of sushi bento boxes and other Japanese goods  They rock
But the food is always good as is the service
He actually told me I forgot about you LOLWe split aParlor saladPesto pasta with chicken small served with breadSmokey Pizza SmallEverything was really good
The pasta was very good great flavor plenty of pesto a little light on the chicken and portion but it was a small size
The pizza was excellent great combo of flavors and the crust was spot on
I assure you if you think it's odd get over it and sink your teeth into the most amazing piece of meat ever
The menu was clear and seemed to have a good selection so I got the veggi burrito and my friend got the fish tacos baja
The prices were good so we were pleased until we got our food chips are not included not a big deal so we went back up and waited in line to buy some
Nice use of soft rolls dijon mustard ketchup minced onions and flavorful beef and cheese
As a rule I avoid the concession stand hot dogs in favor of a Vienna Beef cart serving up Chicago style dogs but we've all had those before
Overall I was pleased with the quality and quantity of my food the service was decent and on a nice spring day the location is hard to beat
Now in all honesty some of the food there was pretty good  the shrimp the prime rib beef the stuffed cheese lasagna etc
I also had a ticket to see their Showstoppers show which if it sucked as much as their slots and crappy old desserts I figured it wasn't worth it
2 stars because their fish and meats were really good
For food I ordered the Latin Passion salad which was a tasty mix of field greens and baby spinach topped with pinto beans jack cheese corn tortilla strips and mixed with a sweet and spicy tropical dressing
but the food was not good and teh service horrible
I enjoyed this place when it was Chinese Gourmet Buffet but for the last few years it was had been overdue for a remodel so when the fancy new Lin's Buffet opened nearby in December '10 they vacuumed away too much of the business from this one for it to keep going successfully even though the food was good
For their startup today they were featuring a big 140 main food choices & I started with my usual Hot & Sour Soup which was excellent
In fact all the food was great here so I'll just mention a few of my very favoritesThe awesome Broccoli Salad the good selection of delicious Sushi terrific Cevichu00e9 featuring BIG shrimp great broiled fish fried chicken seaweed stuffed Jalapeu00f1os Beef Shish Kabob BBQ Pork Ribs Honey Chicken Bacon Wrapped Shrimp stuffed shrimp & more
He really cooks at the top of his craft & there were 4 tasty meat choices
Besides the excellent food the whole staff was friendly the table service was just right & they got off to a very smooth start here on their very first day in business so it's a BIG 5 STARS for this brand new Buffet
they had a large salad bar pastas seafood selection and good choice of Asian American and Italian selections
This is a great option for classy decor hot waitresses and good food
But if you really want top quality food and drink no one in the valley beats Whole Foods
We did have some sushi apps they were good but not as good as some other places
The bread they bring to the table was Excellent-- probably one of the best bread rolls I've had in a long time
The shredded beef tacos were not that good
-Ling and Louie's is an Asian fusion restaurant with ok sushi but a nice atmosphere good for a late-night dinner or lunch
Sushi Roku is kind of inside of the W hotel
25 are both good dishes but lacking in the sauce flavor department
I've had better tasting and better quality food elsewhere but the difference is absolutely marginal
My father ordered the chicken and dumplings which were good but I don't think I'd order it for myself in the future or recommend it to anyone
I will at least try anybody's pizza pieSome are better than others but very few are truly badSo when the Beautiful Carin and I wandered over to Oregano's the other night it was with the anticipation of a pretty good pizza and a pleasant atmosphere to enjoy it inWe were not disappointedThe entirely reasonable 20 minute wait went by quickly with free pizza slices to nibble and frequent refills for our drinks while we sat comfortably and listened to the musicWhen we got our table
but we already knew what we wantedIt's all pretty good at Oregano'sThis time we had a deep dish pepperoni sausage mushroom and olive pie along with a Mrs
they say you never forget your first timeBut Oregano's always serves up a good pie regardless of whether I'm in the mood for Chicago Thin crust deep dish or whatever
It was quite tasty but I think I would have rather tried some of the Mac & Cheese I've heard so much about or one of their other dishes
The appetizer the muses the main course and dessert were all spectacular
The grill was filled with great mesquite wood and it gave all the meats a nice flavor but it really enhanced the burger
The coleslaw was delicious--with horseradish in it
While I don't think I would go out of my way to drive this far for a steak I might consider bringing out of town guests here for its rustic authenticity and the food really was pretty darn good
I'll admit the pita bread was good but honestly you guys if you're looking for Mediterranean food on Mill please walk like two blocks north and go to Med Fresh Grill instead
I finished half of my tea by the time this cold and dry food came out and after dropping nearly 15 bucks I didnt really have the desire to spend another 75u00a2 plus tax for a refill as the sign read at the front
The meat was flavorful but a bit on the cool and dry side
I was pretty disappointed that the meat had some potential in flavor but never got off the ground due to the bread and sauce
The restaurant was about half full and the wait for our food did seem a little long but I'm always happy to wait if the food is good and you can see that the staff is all working hard
The pizza is greasy and tasty but definitely the cure to sober up and line the stomach with something solid after a 'rough' night
The food in the restaurant was tasty even if they did close earlier than I'd hoped on the Monday night that I was there
YOu get the point I'm sure -  However  if the food was good all of the ridiculous upcharges would have been bearable
Even if you aren't vegan or vegetarian the food tastes great and is definitely worth trying out
Nothing beats having wine beer cheeses meats bread olive oil amazing friends 75 degree dry/warm weather in March and BRUSCHETTA
Tons of things you can but in bulk by the pound Candy rice dog food snacks nuts coffee honey peanut butter and moreWe're going on a camping trip soon and we found packs of hotdogs for like 60 cents camping-size tanks of propane for about 3 bucks giant marshmallows and 3ft wooden skewers for them all on the cheap
You can select from Shark Fin dumplings very tasty to Spring Rolls to Chicken buns to Chicken Feet this I don't recommend and so on and so forth
The corned beef was good it passed muster as authentic
In summary  Good kosher-style food a bit pricey
The portion was large and the dish was flavorful
I'd very highly recommend Le Chalet to anyone who wants delicious food excellent service and a unique atmosphere
We did and quite enjoyed learning all about the dishes from two of the chefs Kyle and Emily
The food is pretty good but the beer is why you go
The manager went out of his way to make sure that we were accommodated quickly the service was excellent and so was the food
All 22 people left happy thanking me for the suggestion and raving about how good the food and service were
The pub food menu is reasonably priced and the nachos are delicious
Personally their food is good but other places are better
Update 6/3/2012 If you're taking your food home and you want an awesome dessert get an apple pie or any other flavor pie if you wanted and if you have vanilla ice cream at home you can eat a little of the pie and then eat a spoon of the ice cream
It's probably the greatest thing I've ever done with a fast good dessert that doesn't deal with a Wendy's frosty
The chicken was SUPER hot I couldn't eat for 10 minutes
I will come back again if I ever need a fix for fried chicken deliciousness
My appetizer was shad roe rolled in arctic char
The meatballs in an excellent marinara just perfectly cooked and seasoned
The food I had tonight at Efe's was so good that even though I'm nowhere near hungry I can't stop eating my leftovers
Oh I forgot to mention that their pizza is amazing
We ordered him the Chicken Karaage - an appetizer but it was plenty big for him and he loved the sauces
If you're not scared of what the place looks like it's very unpretentious simple tables/chairs/decorations you will enjoy a delicious plate of food
Since the food and service are so good however I gave it five stars
The food really is so good though that these things really don't matter to me
The food was just okay and everyone's beers 4 were barely cold
Although I am a true believer in paying for good quality food there was really not much food to try in order to find out
It was very good and lighter than the chocolate cigar dessert
The bruscetta and pizza are pretty tasty but I need to go back and dig a little deeper into both the wine and food menus
Also they are one of the few people in the Valley that carry Canidae food which is the brand/quality that I want
Their kabobs hummus and roll ups are delicious
I started with the Beefsteak Tomato and Onion appetizer which was excellent my partner loved his loved his French Onion Soup
I visited this restaurant a couple of weeks ago for breakfast on a Monday and was impressed not by the food all breakfast buffets are basically the same but by my waitress named Stephanie
I heard the sandwich was good so go in person get your own food but check the order
While the breakfast was outstanding some of the other classic restaurant dishes seemed to be oddly assembled and some of the appetizers might have formerly been convenience food
Your first time there they'll walk you though the whole process and let you sample all the different flavors they have of meat and even rice and beans
Because no matter how good your food was you'll be wondering
Next time I think I'll try the chicken noodle soup it looked good
Their food is so delicious you will want to eat the entire meal in one sitting but I always try to save some for leftovers
The jambalaya was good the sausage was tasty tho the chicken and shrimp weren't
Handrolls are good and the Haru Sushi is my FAVORITE item they sell
I've had sashimi here a couple times pretty good except the cook had cut a lemon to put on my plate and THEN put the sushi on it
Everything I've had mostly the lamb dishes has been incredibly tasty and tender
Their food is best enjoyed with a group of close friends that are cool about sharing food
I'm a big fan of their deconstructed fish taco salad and the vigan sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries delicious
Oh and it's not just that it's a good deal the food is actually yummy
This is my 2nd time at North and I must say that the quality of food for the price is great
Their food is usually fresh and their drink selection is good
The quality of the food was again outstanding
$4 was a steal in my opinion compared to the quality of the food and the drinks
I was expecting the usual -  good food good entertainment good location but this was a lot more
By far my most favorite pizza is with prosciutto and arugula but the margherita is wonderful as well
Essentially some really smokey good beef jerky one pickled egg and some shoestring potatoes but more like chips
They said Kaiser roll but what I got was something soft and delicious similar to Matt's Big Breakfast's Five Spot
I don't like fried chicken to begin with but sometimes I'm in a hurry and KFC buffalo sliders just sound delicious
Tried to order appetizers they are out of the avocado club egg rolls tortilla spring rolls and Singapore shrimp rolls
Food was good service was good managing the restaurant's supply for food sucks out of food and management for customer satisfaction was lacking
i don't care how good the pizza is with service so poorand inconsiderate i don't ever want to eat there
i don't believe there is a pizza worth waiting 4 hours for
I was worried about taking my parents here - especially my father as he has a limited palate and prefers standard meat & potato dishes but flavor and presentation of everything quickly quelled those fears
We started with appetizers - summer rolls with peanut sauce quite tasty vegetable soup with mint I did not try this but my father said it was very good and BBQ peanut veggie shiskebabs
Abundant with flavor it was way different than the usual Vietnamese yellow curry dishes I've had
My father ordered the Kung Pao soy chicken which had a little too much heat for him but he ate it anyway because it was so tasty
The veal ragu sauce was hearty and stoodout more than the gnocchi but the flavor of the dish seemed to still lack something
Food-wise everything seemed really fresh and the quality of the ingredients high however the tastes and presentations seemed more like dinner party food rather than fine dining
I must admit that i was not excited to go here since i do not do HOT/spicy food - but my husband does and we will now return as often as we can
There was a shrimp dish that was on their special that i can not remember the name of but it was WONDERFUL with a light batter and i have now had TWICE
I also enjoyed their Thai Ice Tea and Coffee and the desserts as well
The food was good like in between of good and really good not outstanding though
The bread is fresh and soft the meat is flavorful and shaved very thin and the portion sizes are just right for me
The Bakery looked amazing with tons of great dessert items that I was way too full to try but it gives me a reason to head back right
It's wonderful for vegans and vegetarians because there are so many animal product-free menu items and so many meatlovers I've gone with have been crazy about meat-free items too
The food was good as always but the waitress finally gave up and put it on some channel that was just infomercials
Their fresh Mozzarella & Tomato salad combined with the Manicotti was superb the canoli for dessert was freshly made my Amber Ale was COLD smooth and added the right touch
But I much prefer the flavor of Smashburger's meat
Sort of like the food at Pei Wei which just happens to be in the same center but cheaper more flavorful and served with a little more heart
I was also impressed by the flavor of the dish; while the sauce was definitely your run-of-the-mill Americanized brown gravy the spiciness was definitely there and the tofu and veggies were cooked really well
Tott's is a clean friendly and flavorful alternative to other fast-food Chinese joints or to Chinese restaurants offering lunch specials
They even had our hot food made and brought over from the regular Harkins in AZ Mills cuz they didnt think theirs would be ready in time for us to catch our movie
Ok maybe I was hungry and swayed by the easy parking great modern design nice outdoor eating space friendly staff and good food
The quantity of food seemed pretty good for the price and everything looked and tasted very fresh
Fresh and top quality and I know my Sushi
Most of their pre-cooked food sandwiches iced teas desserts sushi and what not is really good verging on almost always excellent
Great meat and produce good beer prices and even cool gift items & flowers
The Sea Bass is melt in your mouth oh my god foodgasm amazing
The meat was tender and flavorful; our table ordered the NY Ribeye and Salmon
If a dish was intended to be served warm it was slightly too cold etc
Overall I enjoyed my experience food and atmosphere alike
Rated by Bon Appetite as one of the nation's 10-best and focused on small batch artisan flavors just like the rest of the list Sweet Republic is tucked into a small strip mall off Shea Boulevard and while not simple to find the products are also available by the pint at Whole Foods
I ordered fish tacos which included  two tiny pieces of fish on cold flour tortillas
The trays were not only impressive to display on the table but the variety and quality of cheeses and meats were outstanding
The size of the chicken fried steak is enormous there's no denying that; but that's where the goodness ends
The food was OK the service was pretty good and the menu options are very limited
I rate my sushi bars by the quality and the interest level of the food and not their creative roll names or multiple uses for mayo and imitation crab
The burgers are steak burgers high quality meat with seasoning
During the week they have 1/2 off sushi and drinks but I did not mind paying regular price for how good it was
So we bopped around the adjacent La Grande Orange shop to bide our time - it also seemed like a good time with good food albeit loud & busy
Five minutes later we were presented with 4 HUGE slices of extremely hot pizza
I'm not gonna lie I burned the inside of my mouth this pizza was so good I did not bother waiting for it to cool down
I would recommend getting the 3 tacos first time you go try steak chicken and the mahi is a must its a great start to see what your favorite would be
I recommend the cheesey garlic bread pizza wings and there is a good sandwhich but I don't remember the name
The last time we were here the food was not good the piano was too loud and the waitress had a real attitude
Even an old white guy like me can tell the difference between good and bad food
I can't speak for the food but this is a wonderful place for an old-fashioned frozen treat
The food here is deliciously overdone
The millionaire tacos are piled high with irrelevant and tasty bits of food
The staff is so friendly and of course the food is delicious
Well labeled tasty food as if we had been in the restaurant
The service has been consistently good and the food is amazing
The service was wonderful the food was rich and complex and the whole experience was satisfying
Aside from the fact that a former Raytheon engineer involved in a contentious court battle with his ex-wife walked into the back door of this restaurant in 2006 and shot her as she was working in the kitchen they serve consistently good authentic Chinese food
I wasn't as adventurous and had delicious Chicken Kebab Burmese style
I think the folks over at The Sushi Room have got a good grasp on salad dressing
The caterpillar and spicy tuna rolls were fantastic tasting and a good size
The beer selection is amazing and the food is really good also
In fact I was beyond disappointed in the flavor of the food as I had heard so many positive comments on this restaurant
The Veal Mario was very flavorful with the sun dried tomatoes but the meat was overcooked
The Shrimp and Scallop Antoinette had the best combination of flavors of all the dishes
The meatball side dish we shared as a table you get two were dry and had no flavor
While the flavor of the food was not at the level I expected Uncles Sal's is worth a try
The food is delicious well worth the prices you pay at a resort
The meat was tender with a really mild green chile flavor perhaps it was too soon to have green chile after my turkey day dinner with spicy green chile gravy
and I had chicken shawarma which was delicious
So all in all an excellent first visit despite my concerns about the recent reopening affecting quality of food and service
I highly recommend Matta's to anyone looking for great Mexican food and solid service; I find them far superior to any of their well known competitors
Follow that up with some amazing food I personally love the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco plate with double rice
I love spicy food they have a good spicy bbq sauce
If the service improves I'll probably go there more often and then maybe update my review with glowing reviews of the great service I had and the wonderful food once I refresh my memory
Classic Good Food Served QuicklyPlaces like Market Bistro  make me wonder why anyone would opt for fast food when presented with this option
Delicious options of sammies salads and pizza some super creative ones at that
And because this was the dish that was freshly made after we pointed out that we hadn't order the Mango Wango Shrimp it was hot
The food was great I had the chicken and creamed corn and it was plenty to eat well-seasoned and piping hot - not easy to do with that many people in the group
This is a nice casual dining place to enjoy good food and located on Camelback Road it makes for easy access to the Biltmore Fashion Park or downtown Scottsdale
Sushi is in really skimpy portions and not even that good to where spending that much for that little is worth it
I have been to some good sushi places that pack a punch in a 4 piece roll
2 because the staff was nice and friendly otherwise i recommend going somewhere else for sushi/japanese food
They have Boar's Head products here so the quality of the meats and cheeses is excellent
our third time at this establishment first time the pizza was great second time the pizza and pasta were good the third time yesterday the pasta was not that good
The coffee products are Fair Trade Certified and the cafe offers a wide range of food - ranging from banana nut muffins to bacon & spinach quiche with good soups salads and sandwiches for lunch
It was tasty but the garlic was over powering the actual fish flavor
The sushi is good- I've had the Tora Tora and Tootsie Roll- pretty tasty
Too many other good places in DPHX to go to get quality Mexican food
The flavor of the chicken was good but it was difficult to eat with so much onion
The food was hot fresh and perfectly good
It wasn't as good as some of the more authentic Mexican places in town and you can easily find more flavorful complex and spicy traditional food
I tend to focus my reviews on food quality but ambiance is definitely a part of the dining out experience and that's where Old Town Tortilla Factory shines
It's not an everyday place and it's not even a place I would go if I were only craving some Mexican food but if you need a dining experience where the atmosphere is important perhaps entertaining some out of town guests Tortilla Factory is worth a look
We HIGHLY recommend Zing for the food atmosphere drinks something James whipped up special for us and all at a cost that made it a tremendous value
Dumplings were good quality and didn't skimp on meat
And then the most delicious mouthwatering piece of beef to enter my body
Here is the bottom line Hong Kong has recieved numreous New Times Best of Chinee food for years and you often see authentic Asian families eating there so it has to be good
The food is pretty darn good - which worked great for me as I used to work in the area and we'd often take over a section of the place on a semi-regular basis
That was a little disappointing but despite it all the food I ordered was good
Do try a Vietnamese dessert for a fun and delicious experience
Okay and now for the hitsThis is a  good  place for pulled pork or BBQ chicken sandwich
lil mini me had a 1/2 chicken dinner  w/o BBQ sauce  weirdo  and pronounced it good
I went with the Mock Rosemary Chicken one the waitress recommended
The food was cheap and as good as it gets
which had the meatloaf been good would have busted my gut
If high quality fresh fish and seafood is what your fishing for head to the Pier
I recommend this place and roller skating for when you need to break away from reality and just enjoy yourself
Also after having tasted these ethnic foods in their place of origin I feel like I have a pretty good idea of what things should taste like
The chicken had an interesting dry rub and it was full of flavor - not dry not overcooked not undercooked - just right
The chicken curry was room temperature not hot and was very bland
Got the wings to start they do have a good amount of chicken on them but the sauce didn't do it for me
To me the pizza was very basic but I know others have enjoyed it
It was taking everything I knew about good mexican food and bastardized it
After living in Louisville KY it's been hard to find good food here in the valley
The sandwich was so great the only downside it wasn't the traditional bread more of a ciabatta roll the fries were the shoestring potatoes were very good selection of BBQ sauces were available
The food is also very reasonable price considering the high quality of the ingredients
Ralph still cooked and the pizza was amazing
it was green apple flavored and a great transition into dessert
All of it eaten together was pretty good but the creative is what made this dish
After I took my foot out of my mouth the food was pretty good
Excellent fresh food in an airport and it didn't cost me $25
It DID cost me $13 for an excellent meaty ceviche salad and black beans
Give people reasonably priced delicious food in an airport
Everything from Kobe beef to feta cheese to avocados and fried eggs and about 20 million ok not that many sauces you can choose from to dip your deliciousness into
I'm no stranger to fatty breakfasts and was really impressed by the richness of this dish
Combine the amazing food and great service with gorgeous modern decu00f3r
I had the Mediterranean Roasted Chicken Shawarma it was really tasty
They seem to have succeeded in their marketing claims of offering better food colder beer and hotter girls than their competitors Hooters Titled Kilt etc
The freshly chopped cilantro on top of the bbq chicken pizza is amazing
Also for a place that does pizza mostly their chicken wings are darn good as well
If you like deep dish pizzas this is one good place to get one
Sushi Drinks Good Looking people are just the start
Seriously best value food fun drinks and quality food in all of Scottsdale
All in all the experience and food was very good and this is a place that I might frequent after work
The food came out and was piping hot and fresh
I tried my friend's chicken chimichanga which was very good
The food is Southern Mexican which means it has a more subtle spice very flavorful and isn't overloaded with cheese
It had a delicious foodie menu but had  cafeteria decor
We all agreed that the food was quite good for the price and while not as large portions as you might get other places - it left just enough room for ice cream
My friend was very impressed with the chicken sandwich
because the lady who tended to us was so nice I really don't want to speak ill of the joint but I was hoping to have some good Mexican food like I was used to having in Southern California
We had 2-3 glasses of wine each and 3 appetizers cheese place salad and meat plate
Maybe we were all so hungry that dog food would have tasted good
Ok how does putting a 1/2 lb of meat on a low quality sliced bread from a bag count as a sandwich to be proud of
Veggie wraps are pretty good but would be much more awesome with some feta or goat cheese or even better if you take some of the massive amount of meat from the mediocre sandwich and put that it there
The service is quick and friendly the decor and seating are perfect and the food & drinks are delicious
The desserts are ALL good try the 'beaver balls' or whatever they are called and the prices on those are low
Service was good and quick and the food was good
The yakatori was good but I wish the menu offered items such as livers and chicken skins
If you have deep pockets Roka Akor  is a great location to impress a date because not only if the food excellent but also because its a fun dining experience
A surprise is the Angus quality beef - try the $22 petite filet with sides
light and chewy crust fresh high quality ingredients overall spectacular pizza
My Mother's also offers pastas sandwiches the open-faced turkey sandwich is quite tasty roasted chicken salads and pizza
Server was great also and gave us recommendations about the amount and food choices because we asked - very professional
i wouldn't recommend it unless you like spicy beyond jalapenosOverall a great experience delicious food nice ambiance
The server was excellent her suggestions were right-on and she even offered to take a dish back when she noticed one person in the party was surprised by the spiciness of her dish
I had a small Chipotle Chicken salad and a small tortilla soup and that was a good amount of food- with a drink for only $10
Honestly the perfect dish for a cold day but I'd still eat it in the middle of July
The roasted chicken flatbread was also very good
The pizza was good and the ingredients were very fresh but isn't the whole point of ordering pizza so you can lay on your couch and be lazy
99 for a one-topping large pizza so it is a good deal but for just a bit more you could go pick up a pizza you don't have to bake from Pizza Hut or somewhere along those lines
3 Stars because the pizza was good but not great
The prices were pretty good the food was amazing and the service superior
The grilled chicken is good but being a southern girl I can't resist the fried filet
The staff is always friendly and the food always comes out quick and hot
The food was very tasty and exactly what to expect for traditional Peruvian cuisine
Lunch for two with 2 glases of Chicca Morada the fish/yucca appetizer and two plates of Loma came to $43 with tax and tip
The excellent food alone will not carry it
Their grilled chicken is bomb and the tortillas are tasty
Three chicken tacos with cheese lettuce and hot salsa is my jam
The food is good and it just feels fresher and better for you than any other fast food option
They have a traditional butcher shop with quality meats
CheckI have to say not the best fried chicken I have ever had but pretty damn good- it could use more seasoning
The seating is cramped but it doesn't matter as soon as your food is delivered your table goes quiet you get tunnel vision and after the first bite you are taken away to an orgy of goodness
It has gorgeous scenery friendly and efficient service good food and a great happy hour
We were in Arizona dammit and by golly we were going to eat at this pizza place everyone kept recommending even if it killed us
I really like their original thick crust pizzas - I had spinach pie pizza EXCELLENT BBQ chicken pizza it was OK and the margarita pizza simple but tasty
The service is fantastic and all the waiters are very nice the ambiance is intimate classy and romantic and the food is delicious
there are no words to explain how amazing this dessert was
I drank a King Fisher Indian beer and it was pretty good better than most American bottled beers
When my main dish came steamed mussels I was mighty disappointed in the quality of the mussels
Come here for the ambience but don't expect much from the quality of food
Excellent service - over the top actually with about 5 different people stopping by the table calling me by last name and filling water glasses on time serving and taking away food immediately checking in to ask if all was OK
Full of second rate food and faux-good prices
Truly full of wonderful food and not a big sweets person we declined dessert
Granted this restaurant has been my sole exposure to Ethiopian food but it is _so_ good
It was equally crowded but we were seated quickly enjoyed great service and the pizza was marvelous
The food was pretty good - but not memorable
For an appetizer I enjoyed the lobster roll
Main entrees we enjoyed the misoyaki butterfish and it was succulent moist and melt in your mouth fabulous
95 and desserts average what appetizers cost
The service was prompt and the food was good
What a charmer she is ;For good food a beer or two and the ability to watch a game if its on and great people watching this is a fun experience
He had the all you can eat fish and said the fish was pretty good fries were terrible
I did rate this place with four stars though so while the pasta was not good and the fish portions were smallish I did really like the place and can't wait to try one of their famous burgers
This is the type of place you want to keep coming back and trying other Pasties this has only been the second time I've been but will go back the first time I had the Cajun Chicken it was great this time I had the Rosemary Chicken and it was just ok not enough flavor and a little dry but it still was good and it didn't turn me of from this place at all
It was good though it wasn't a very good cut of meat
so i was told to take any table and off i went to the buffet you better be ready for chicken because thats the protien du jour one of the chicken dishes was quite tasty the other tandori was dry the spinich dish was good along w/the naan the food was not bad but when i paid it was 11$ a bit pricey
Simple and fresh atmosphere great background music and DELICIOUS unique food
This was 100% my husband's doing - I'm not a huge fan of fried chicken but I was still so satisfied with the starter that nothing could ruin my meal - for fried chicken it was really good
The meat patties themselves didn't appear to be seasoned I prefer a good dusting with fresh ground salt/pepper and garlic
Besides that the dishes are delicious and come out piping hot
I like that the food here is healthier and has an emphasis on more sustainable local ingredients Such as the coffee and desserts and high quality proteins Such as grass-fed beef and free-range chicken
Only potentially redeeming store experience comes from chatting with the creepy middle aged employee with glasses about immigration or political discussion for trippy wannabe Minute Man ranting but it isn't worth risking damaged canned goods sour milk and stinky meat these days
Its not quite as good as it gets but it is definitely one of the best pizza joints on the westside
But the antipasto salad is delicious and they make by FAR the best pizza on the west side of town
I'm able to get a TV to myself while enjoying a really really good pizza
This was the night before Thanksgiving so the kitchen staff may have been more concerned about cleaning up and going home than cooking hot and fresh food
Calamari was cold and greasy Burgers cold and greasy so greasy in fact I ended up ruining a brand new pearl buttoned shirt as I tipped the Kobe beef slider to my lips and drained out at least 2 oz of beef juice right down my neck
Lots of bars serve good food but this isn't one of them
She should get a job at a place that serves good food
My guess is that the burgers and sandwiches might be good just stay away from Chicken or Italian
Unassuming from the exterior in a strip mall with such high end boutiques as Enterprise Rent-A-Car and sharing a zip code with a cowboy tourist targeted bar that features bull riding of the non-mechanical variety Binkley's is a tiny destination restaurant that seems slightly uncomfortable with its surroundings and we were equally slightly out of place with our sinusoidal experience not for control freaks- Greeted by name due to party size and expected arrival time being unique resulted in feeling like VIPs confused by their own fame- Sending away the sommelier a bit dejected when we unanimously declined wine- Realizing our head waitress was a bizarro version of a friend from back home- Opting for the highest end 5-6 course tasting menus $82 - $89 wine pairing $40-50 extra like non-confused VIPs but skipping the foie gras surcharge +$14- Being thankful of no collective food restrictions or allergies to impede chef creativity- Impressed by a nearly endless train of experimental amuse-bouches- Processing that we were 3-4 courses in without seeing anything we ordered- Recalling that some of us were no stranger to this dining style when it's called omakase except then there's no illusion of input into the majority of the meal- Hitting our stride with the hot appetizer including a superb soft shell crab course- Enjoying the best black cod I've ever eaten in a sea of unusual but not quite as enjoyable candidates- Starting to feel full around the penultimate course an amuse of chocolate souffle - Understanding without bitterness that soda refills were not free $2
Our waitress was friendly but when we asked her for recommendations on sushi appetizers and wine she couldn't give them to us
Our waitress had no knowledge of sushi as evident by her lack of recommendations and difficulty recognizing the difference between a spicy tuna and tora tora rolls
Their sushi used to be delicious and it was just mediocre
I usually don't opt for a fancy cut of meat in Pho but I decided to try it at his recommendation
When the sever was explaining the menu he recommended us to each order 1 dish from the appetizer one from the salad and one from the entru00e9e
That almost ruined the dessert but having a little bit with the dessert adds a nice sweetness to the overall flavor
5 stars only because it's I don't think it's worth the price for the food I received
The sushi was overpriced the cold rolls came out warm while the one cooked warm roll that came out tasted like it was covered in barely-warmed mayonnaise
None the less no matter how busy they are the food ALWAYS comes out amazing
To be honest and this may sound harsh but I liked the flavor and texture form Oreo cheesecake I have ordered from a popular fast food restaurant more than the cake I ate at Village Inn
For Americanized Thai this food was good enough
So if you go be prepared to wait forever for tasty food
The best part about this place is that  it is amazingly priced I can spend less than ten bucks here easy and their meat is halal which is hard to find for those who require it
The food was actually really good and didn't have the gritty industrialized taste like Subway sandwiches have
This food was so good I'm not even mad that Persia no longer exists
Persian Garden Cafe ain't cheap but the ambiance is warm and pleasant not to mention great for groups the food is fresh homemade and delicious and you can get dairy free cheesecake that's better than regular cheesecake
Great ambiance Great service Great/Quality food and decent prices
Their deli counter food is far beyond most deli counter quality its rustic and made with quality local produce
The food is consistently good and the service is always excellent
The salsa is so flavorful the re-fried beans are taste the breakfast burritos are perfect and I have gotten the rolled tacos enchiladas bean burrito red chili burrito taco tostada & tamale and never once was it ever less than great
The food is not authentic I had the Puerto Rican combo which none of the food on there was even worth eating while the hubby ate some traditional Cuban food which was traditional tasting
The aromas from other's food while sitting around at bar let me know I was in for a good meal
I had trouble deciding what to eat so I ordered 3 appetizers   Seafood Stuffed Poblano Pepper Veal 2 ways and Braized Oxtail
The bartender did a fantastic job of recommending the order in which i received my food - lightest to heaviest
Why put slaw and tempura mushrooms on such a good piece of meat
It's always about making sure the prices are good and the food both tasty and nutritious
The food is still pretty good the volcano bowl is disgusting but worth the try
Nice pieces of lump crabmeat and a nice manageable size for an appetizer
For dinner I had the chicken tacos which were delicious
Even though it's listed as an appetizer it was more than enough food for me for dinner especially after eating the queso fundido
they were good and the tomato chipotle sauce gave the dish a nice kick
The food here was good but nothing special - I had the chicken ciabatta with aioli and bacon
I've never been a big fan of restaurant lasagna to be honest other than in Europe and this dish was pretty good
The meat was really good and was prepared very well and the bread was incredible
The shredded beef had an amazing flavor despite dripping a combination of spice and grease and the chicken was fajita style chunks of pure white meat
either way check out Lulu's good food here
On a cold day night it would be a perfect dish
We usually get  the Chicken Satay appetizer a couple of curries
Wear a good pair of water shoes there is alot of glass and fishing hooks on the ground and some in water
My friend who lives in Phoenix told me that finding really good asian food is a difficult task
Both were tasty but not really pick it up and eat it food
Next door is the Pizza which is tasty but a bit salty for my taste
I had chicken caesar and it was good but nothing special
Like I said before pretty tasty overall as it should be if you specialize in only one type of food
The vegetables seem fresher here  and maybe they use more organic veggies because they seem to have more taste too then at other salad bars and they definitely have more of a selection then most places so if your not a green freak about veggies and stuff they have a good mix of soups baked potatoes pizza and other such dishes to choose from
If the food were of gourmet quality I could easily see paying that but for the quality the amount served should be twice that
I had the flat bread pizza with tandoori chicken it was great and the boy had vigazz burger which he was impressed with so much so that we returned a week later for $5 burgers
**Note When the staff inquire how hot you would like your meal even if you like your food spicy - as I do reply not spicy thanks
Rather than enhancing the flavor of the food if you order your meal Thai hot - I think they have 5 levels and I had ordered 4 it will make you sneeze/cough unceasingly
I thought the jerk chicken was a little too hot for me but the curry still was able to clear out my sinuses
The food has been so good that to this point it has overcome the poor service
The food has great flavor with just the right amount of spice
A while later the food arrived and it looked good but it was way cold had been sitting for a while which was a shame
They wasted an hour of my time to serve me cold food only to drop a check for my drinks
I would go to Houston's better food and a quality wait staff / management
The pizza was just a cheese pizza with sliced pieces of chicken breast but still tasty
Overall the food was tasty and the happy hour prices were excellent
We got the pretzel bites with provolone fondue just okay I could make better fondue at home my husband got the stew he said it was eh just okay and I got the chicken stroganoff had no flavor
The meat in the sandwich was tasty as was the cheese but the bread was a soggy mess with grease
I've eaten at several around the valley and they have all been consistent with each other in food quality and kind service
Get the Decoy Cabernet to go with your filet and then I highly recommend the bananas foster for dessert
The food in the grill and at the turn is really good and I recommend eating there if you get a chance
The food is typically underwhelming but the dishes I keep coming back to are the pita and hummus appetizer and the curry entree
We had the veggie pizza and not nearly enough sauce/flavor
I was expecting a variety of firm and soft Italian cheeses and a variety of smoky spicy and salty cured meats but got nothing more than a few flavorful meats a handful of briny olives and a glob of mild gorgonzola cheese
The little Mexican food place attached to Charlie's serves really good food late night but now I understand why they can't sell water or soda through the inside window to Charlie's customers
I picked a breakfast sandwich from the menu and was informed they no longer had all the ingredients for that one and we went through the bread/meat/cheese options and he managed to make a pretty good sandwich
The food that sauce they call BBQ sauce they should rename it cuz its way better than others I've had and especially the good prices
but I think the quality of the meat and cheese is so yummy that I ask for it straight up without the fixins
When it came time to order food we had such good things to choose from
it's really one of those hole in the wall places and everyone knows that's where teh good food really are
As a vegetarian but not vegan I was psyched to go eat at a place where I wouldn't be limited to appetizers and/or eating off someone else's plate or having to face idiotic comments like just pick the meat off
Having read all of the rave reviews I decided to drive out to India Palace for some good Indian food
The food was pretty good but not like I expected given the reviews
Everything else was okay -- several dishes were spicier than I am used to which was good
Decent food at decent prices with good service though
I've recommended the dish to many people who loved it
Recommendation when ordering the chicken fried steak at dinner ask for the lunch portion
The food is delicious and filling but never does it make me feel gross and guilty for going out to eat
There is many other food options to go with if you want the standard hot dogs nachos etc
The breaksfasts here are always think consistently very good and I can't think of a visit to this place where the food hasn't been wonderful
Love love loved it- including the live music and the many adorable doggies of courseCame home with watermelon radishes deep purple cabbage cauliflower that looked like it had stars growing on it and some of the most amazing seedy bread i've had the pleasure of nibbling on
Looking for a place to dine with friends from California that was not overly expensive but good food was easy
Service was exceptional and food was wonderful
Boyfriend and I shared the Tottie Rolls good but definitely not the best egg rolls you'll ever have Shrimp Tom Yum tasty but doesn't hold a candle to the soup at Malee's Queen Alaskan Roll tried it because it was the daily special but did not enjoy it and the General Tao's chicken just ok
Everything on the menu - Thai Vietnamese Japanese and Chinese dishes - sounded good but it just didn't blow us away in the taste department
They also have a pretty good sized menu and the food looks pretty decent
While I can't speak to the quality of the real meat hot dogs which are probably higher quality that Oscar Meyer and likely consist of real meat I can tell you that buying veggie dogs from the store will never suffice again
The drink specials aren't anything to write home about but the food is worth the trip
The burger seems to always be around and I recommend the fish tacos if they show up as well
I've been there twice and wasn't very impressed with the food or value either time
I will say their pizza does look good so if I go back that is what I will try
They serve typical guacamole but instead of tortilla chips you get a 14-inch pizza crust topped with a thin layer of parmasean cheese to scoop up all of the avocado-y goodness
Like the bread served at the beginning of the meal the pizza crust is incredibly delicious
Less sauce is used on this pizza meaning the crust stays crisp and the flavors are allowed to complement each other in better proportions
There is a list of a couple dozen whites and reds though so oenophiles will be able to enjoy their pizza w/a glass or a bottle of the good stuff
We can't stop talking about how good the food was the great service and when we are returning
I thought their Americanized Chinese food was pretty good and very interesting when combined with Mexican food
I had a few hours left before catching my flight out of Phoenix and had a craving for good and cheap Vietnamese food
Food - Portions were reasonable and I would say more on the plus side than skimpy and I thought everything we ordered was flavored well
but the food here was well worth the trip
the waitstaff has been attentive friendly and accommodating the food appeared in a reasonable amount of time and was always tasty
i'm not a huge fan of soya chunks so i usually end up ordering a bunch of sides and appetizers and dessert which suits me just fine
Our group had a good time very good food and decent service
Corned beef hash very different had great homemade flavor just lacked enough potatoes my opinion
i have tried most of their pizzas appetizers and salads and am completely satisfied with the consistent quality and deliciousness of absolutely everything
You may be asking yourself Are their meatballs and meatball parms good
And unfortunately since Meatballz's chicken parms and meatballs are so good I haven't explored much else of their menu
The beers were always full the food was served without a delay and our guest was impressed and that is exactly why we take clients there
This little Mom & Pop joint maybe grandparents is a better description has AMAZING food
I just can't get over how good the food was
The only drawback was they don't serve alcohol but when the food was that good I didn't even miss it
My friend also had a pizza and enjoyed hers just as much
The transition from Houston's to Hillstone did not change the great service wait staff bartenders  and best quality tasting food
Majority of the same menu items are still being served along with some new tasty dishes and may I add Sushi has joined the family
Pizza had a good crust I thought but sauce and cheese were uninspiring
The food wasn't bad in fact some dishes foie gras were quite tasty but the food was very expensive
This shows the quality of service this dayP factor 7 needed minor attention no checklist todayOrder waiting time 9 very busy but our order was taken quicklyAmbieance2 or 3 hard to want to eat an anticipated meal when the entire patio and dining room tables are covered in dirty dishesFood arrival time 9 for as busy as it ws our food arrived fairly quickly
Food taste 8 even though the rice was very dry and there seemed to be not enough veggies and it just was not spicy the flavor was goodOverall 5 Today i am on the fence
The food was excellent and hot when served
We had the signature dessert which was decadent and wonderful
My sister Cher T and I came here because I was wanting Thai food and She heard that this place had good reviews
The spring rolls Cher got were good along with that peanut sauce
Appetizers are good they could have a little better selection but its a pizza/sports bar kinda place the pizza is yummy especially the Boce' Ball its other worldly
Our biggest worry was that the food just wouldn't be good
*Flavor* - This varies by dish of course
We've had some really excellent ones roasted red pepper steaks chicken mirabella french onion chicken manicotti and the calzone are our Top 5 and some pretty mediocre ones a dish with fish and pasta springs to mind
This was an amazing dish and something only Charleen could come up with
I love her dynamic approach to taking the ugly vegetables and turning them into delicious food
Quality of food for the money is really wonderful
I wasn't super impressed with the food or the ambience so not sure if I'll be back
Everything was delicious but part of the fish was overcooked
Other than that though the flavors were fantastic the fish was fresh and I plan to come here again the next time I'm in Scottsdale
Elephant Thai is a good thai place with a varied menu freshly made food and nice atmosphere
The service was very prompt; was informed of the specials they had margarita Monday's - $2 dollars off any margarita drink and our food was pretty good
While we waited for our food I enjoyed the 3d look of the rocks in acrylic tables and contemporary decorations
Our food arrived and it looked good but the cheese on the nachos had already cooled and had time to solidify and the pico de gallo was quickly making the chips soggy
Try the sashimi dinner special for $18 you'll get a gorgeous spread that's enough for two people we also ordered chicken udon and it was absolutely delicious
The burger was a knife and fork burger that had very flavorful meat almost meatloaf ish and a really good horseradish -y sauce
My next trip out I will be trying the food as I have heard some good things about it
I did my webby research got some good cat food ratings and looked where the mid-price high-quality foods were sold
But I'm not usually  jonesing for a roast beef sandwich or a nicoise salad at 8 o'clock at night no matter how damn good they are
and grab a table because this place does a good thing to breakfast foods
My friend had the BYOB build your own burger with a basic beef patty and said it was very good
The pizza was wood-fired flavorful and downright gorgeous and getting to sit all night on their light-studded patio was a dream
For cats and pizza I couldn't recommend a better place
Octopus Salad Lamb cutlets Duck breast Short ribs Rice hot-pot Chicken on skewers Yakitori Sashimi platter 3 kinds Spicy chicken wings Grilled mushroom I think it was Hiratake mushroom Vegetable tempura
Anyway food OF COURSE is so over priced and where you think you might get 4 of an appetizer you get 2
I knew going in that this was going to be typical Mexican food joint like Garcias or whatever you people consider to be good Mexican food
We split a Caeser and she had Chicken Parmesan and I had Penne Bolognese both tasty Italian comfort food
I am still giving 4 starts because the place is super cute the atmosphere hip and the food - wonderful
For food I ordered the shaved steak tartare with crostini which was very good
My personal opinions on their pizza -The crust was a tad too crispy for my liking-Flavoring was a bit on the bland side
Seated immediately got the ice and hot tea rolling and ordered the following 1 Spring rolls delicate and crisp
3 The Pepper Steak I did say with beef but they brought me chicken although I was bummed I went with it wasn't in the mood to complain but it was very good
I don't have much experience with Thai food but damn this is good
The pizza was sub par the crust was like that of a frozen take home pizza the sauce is sweet and that is the only flavor note no spices etc the cheese was ok but overpowered by sweetness of the sauce
I can on and on why I don't like the food here but you get the point the flavors and textures are not what I want from pizza
The manager walked around to make sure we were happy with our order and the food was filling and tasty
I've been here for dinner before as well and while the food is decent I'm not overly impressed
Also chicken tacos are really good as well
The food is great but not absolutely the most authentic - think good Tex-Mex or maybe Az-Mex
The catfish and craw-fish were both spicy seasoned not spicy hot
Which helps with not to take away the flavor of the meat
There was a gooey chewy layer of cheese over the potatoes and I could really taste the peas and flavoring with the meat
i literally could not taste the meat flavor hidden under the amount of cabbage stuffed in
Every dessert is super good and worth saving room for
Infact the pizza and salad were just as amazing
One time desiring a chicken salad with guacamole and another time pipping hot chicken and fixings to stuff in the tiny tortillas
The decision combines my preferred ingredients with presumably  fewer calories - hot chicken and tossed salad with a mild dressing
Yes I saw this place on Man vs Food and once I was in Phoenix visiting friends I was like heck yes lets go try that monster hot dog
Here are some of the good instances -Queso Fundido dip is pretty tasty and taken above the typical velveeta dip that alot of restaurants offer-Arriba Taco Salad with shredded beef is actually  good and has a lot of veggies in it
Either order with extra guac or sour cream or do as I did and order the queso fundido dip and dip the pizza in it  OWhite Sands Chimi - Pretty good actually but extremely spicy for my taste
Tamale was very dry-Shredded Beef tacos - Flavor of the meat is blah and the taco shell always seems to be soggy when I have ordered these
The sushi we had was very fresh and I think the unagi was the most flavorful I've had
To give you a good idea of how our 'fine dining' went down the cream of chicken now sits cold and half eaten while the chili cup is wiped clean
If I ever have the urge for a great cheesesteak good bye Corleone's and shitty US Airways Center overpriced soggy bread with morsels of imitation meat and cold hardened cheese I will come to Defalco's
We also had a few plates from here and the food was great and I normally am not much of a Mexican fan but it was all delicious
We took my mom with us this time because she said she was craving some good fried chicken
And my dining companion mentioned that the beef shawarma was pretty tasty as well
And I have no complaints about the quality or taste of the food either
My husband had the steak which was wonderful and I had the fried chicken
This fried chicken was awesome wonderful flavorand a no-bone chicken breast atop mac and cheese with a wonderful onion jus that really balanced the dish and made it pop
For dessert my husband almost licked the bowl of the butterscotch pudding while really enjoyed my super thick and creamy chocolate custard
I am a concierge for a hotel in North Phoenix and will be recommending this to anyone looking for Italian food
Sadly they may not get any return customers with the quality of their food the way it is
Anyway it wasn't that good and the chicken comes on the bone which my girlfriend didn't like
So since it was a signature dish recommended by the waiter I had to return it
My philosphy is that if something is recommended and is a signature dish and it doesn't give you a mouthgasim it gets returned
I rarely order a chicken sandwich because usually a grilled chicken sandwich from a restaurant is inedible but here the chicken was moist and flavorful
The food is adequate/OK/good/tasty--but is basically re-invented bar food
The food prices are  IMHO about $1 more per item than they should be for the quality that you get
I ordered the seasonal craw fish as an appetizer since I had an hour to look over the menu I ordered right away
We like to try different places and while we were shopping at Tempe Market Place we thought that this might be a decent little place for some good ol' fashion rolls
I've spent a lot of time in Greektown in downtown Detroit so I'm very familiar with good Greek food
The food is pretty good and there was a large enough crowd to justify the 18 minute wait for my meal
I plan to go back but I will stick with the uber delicious shrimp tempura instead of perhaps trying some sushi
The pizza ranges from good to somewhat flavorless
The pizza here is exactly how I like it thin & crispy crust with good quality ingredients
You get to sear your own beef carpaccio on a hot stone
But overall it was a great dining experience thanks to the good food and even better service
Most entrees are in the mid teens and include appetizer/salad or soup entree and dessert
The entree itself was poisson rouge tasted good and was well prepared but the dessert black forest cake mousse was too runny
Good foods fun toys and things were on sale
The chicken was kind of interesting and was good as a filler roll
The punch of chilies that hit your throat with every Mexican dish entree accompanied with the sweet taste of Chinese cuisine is just plain delicious
I was on yelp looking for a good pizza joint in my new area and found something so much better The Parlor My boyfriend had mentioned this place before and I said something snarky like The Parlor of what
the service is always good the food always yummy
But those tender meatballs and oh so flavorful marinara will wiggle their way into your brain and emerge every so often as an enormous craving
Their lasagna is also very good and most stuff comes with these garlic rolls that are oh so good
I understand that some of the flavor comes from the fat left on the meati but this was way too much
It's not that I mind paying more for quality food but lately the already overpriced items at Chompie's have hit a new level
I really want to like this place because the food is pretty good and they have vintage soda brands but they make it pretty tough
All that said i tend towards the gumbowhich is really just the burrito guts with tortilla soup on top with varying meats each time but the new shredder pork is good in it
The warm weather enables the front of the cafe to be pretty much totally open nice garage doors and though that's not something that would work too well in Michigan in the winter I have a feeling the the wine selection and food quality offered by Postino would go over famously here in Ann Arbor and elsewhere
Its unique flavors and clever food twists make this place makes you want to eat and play with your food
The food was amazing and I will probably go back to give this local place another shot
I know I shouldn't expect much for a bar that happens to serve food but even in my inebriated state I could tell the quality was lacking
Some of the flavors were okay but all of the meat felt like it was overcooked
I feel badly because this place has such a good atmosphere and great staff but I just don't care for the food
I've had spaghetti ravioli and lasagna in Italy repeatedly so maybe I just prefer the fresh flavorful experience and can't resign myself to this place's humdrum attitude toward food
if you are looking for good food in a casual environment then this place is for you
my bf and I decided to order the Oyster Duo appetizer and share the Pappadeaux Platter -- which is an amazing sample platter of all the fried variety they offer on the fried seafood section of their menu
I got to also try a few pieces of the Crispy Fried Alligator from our friend's Appetizer Trio Platter - It was pretty good actually tastes like chicken
Overall I enjoyed the most of the food except the fried tilapia and the service is good so it earned it's four stars
For me a hot pastrami sandwich and a corned beef one is meat ONLY on either rye bread or a bulkie roll
The Sushi Roku restaurant is actually good and stands out amidst the nuclear fallout
Well I'm generalizing because we DID only have two dishes but if the chefs can make a salad taste THAT good why what will they be able to do with meat
Beerbread sandwiches are always excellent fish and chips bavarian pretzels french fries daily specials I really haven't had an item that I didn't like
I highly recommend the Mido roll and the Fried Jalapeno Yellowtail roll
The location itself is small and orange and the food was good not great
We both like the deep dish pizzas and I am grateful that they have tasty options for those of us who have tomato sensitivities and the giant warm chocolate chip cookie sundae is seriously yum
-There is a $12 pre-tax minimum for delivery -Food is decent quality for the price and not as greasy as one would expect-Paper menus have some decent coupons on them
88 for entree rice egg roll and crab puff and are served until 330 pmDefinitely not worth driving to if you don't live in South Phoenix
While it was not what I typically think of as pizza - the crust was super-thin and kind of crispy especially at the edges - it was tasty
Well we found a better place that actually seasoned their crawfish with a spicy flavor and it is delicious
I guess one good thing came out of this - we found a better place with better crawfish
They have a trditional Japanese Eggplant and garlic dish that is so purple and bursting with flavor It's like Mardi Gras in my mouth
In a sentence Culinary Dropout is a foodie mecca with its plush and lux furnishings amazing location in the heart of Scottsdale but away from the duche-ery of Old Town on point entrees that range from classic to what I call contemporary chef-y food and its trendy lil touches like dishtowels for nanpkins and placemat menus
My braised chicken was good kind of on the sweet side but over all very good although the chicken did have an odd texture it seemed to me that it could have used a few more hours in the oven
I think this is a dish best served before closing when all the flavors had their chance to really marry
The grass-fed beef burger w/o a bun was not my idea of a burger but it was cooked just right and was very tasty
What I like best about Herb 'n Flavors is that the food tastes like real food and not something that came out of a microwave
okay this phallic shaped pizza was delicious
So glad our friend's expense account was covering it because I couldn't feel good about throwing that kind of money at mediocre food
There are a couple of really neat salads on the menu as well as some nice summery dishes that are served cold with fresh veggies
This place serves the cheapest Chinese food and quality is very low
We ordered a variety of items appetizers soups and main dishes and shared between the 3 of us
It was all very good If I attempted to spell some of the dishes I'd end up offending someone I kept eating long after my stomach said o more since my taste buds were saying keep going
I thought the pizza was a little shy on the sauce and the store wasn't as clean as the one I usually go to but it's hard to complain when the gelato's this good
My boyfriend really enjoyed his chicken pesto sandwich
With competitors like Four Peaks and Papago they need to up their game in food quality and a cool environment
My favorite is the hot Chicken Parm but I'm biased towards anything chicken
The perfectly crisp gluten-free crust vegan cheese that tasted like rich white cheddar & mozzarella rather than vomit and the delicious smattering of mushrooms and basil adorning that personal pizza had won my heart long before he could and that is how it was destined to stay
The food is pretty good for fast food  I am a picky fast food eater
Hospitality is great food is good Comes out piping hot  my burned tongue fell victim though  what else could ya want from a fast food joint
While not as cheap as Losbeto's the food is definitely higher quality and you don't get that sneaking sensation that you might be eating roadkill which is worth an extra buck or two
All the dishes we tried were excellent - har kaw siu mai Shanghai dumpling chao mi fen
Don't forget to try the chopped chicken salad it is amazing
Our food came out without any issues piping hot and tasty as usual
ProsSuper tasty food prepared by someones equivalent of your grandma
just chowin' down on some damn good Mexican food
Like most casino hotels the smell of smoke permeates
Excellent beef brisket and the mac and cheese was delicious
Simply put the food is plentiful and although a little greasy great in flavor and quality
My beef dish was very tasty and the wanton soup was hot and flavorful
The only bad thing I can say about this place is that the Vietnamese singing on the TV can get annoying after awhile but this hardly changes how good the food is
When the place is really full of people it can take awhile to get food but it is worth the wait
While the sauce required more flavor for sure the three chicken pieces I received were so small I almost laugh out loud but managed to keep it under my breath
The dish is a taste sensation of multiple flavors that blend oh-so perfectly together
The place was classy the service was excellent and the food superb
PizzasThe Italian Stallion - amazing if you love meat
Um I'm very convinced that any pizza you try here is really tasty and good
I suggest that each person orders a pizza for him/herself because then you get to try a variety of pizzas and you might not have any left over because it's that good
I ordered the chicken marsala which I really enjoyed and because I shared pizza with everyone I still had some left to take home
The food was tasty and just what i needed
Mimi's Cafe is a friendly place worth the wait for food or a table and if Mimi's Cafe reads these reviews know that you have a superstar in Danielle
The have great happy hour specials; a good place to go after work for a beer and some food
The food choices for happy hour noshing were odd to say the least; a warm puddle of goat cheese with crunchy crostini; a cheese foccacia which was too similar to that served up at Sweet Tomatoes; cauliflower soup; grilled vegetables which was a pile of Lima beans with a few pieces of grilled cauliflower and carrots on top with some orange sauce drizzled over it all; Odd choices- and for being odd they should have at least been delicious to counter the strangeness of the selections
To which i replied I have not been here before and I wont be back now to which he repliedWell good  and rolled his eyes
The pretzel fondue while identical to the dish at Culinary Dropout was just as delicious in it's reincarnation at Butcher
The food was delicious burgers cooked to perfection the turkey sloppy joe is hearty and stays together making it rather unsloppy etc
If only Tasty Kabob would relocate to the bay area and help fill the Persian food void
This is my type of placeFirst and foremost Tasty Kabob has good well-executed food
In all I'm glad my impulse to seek out Persian food as soon as I leave the bay area guided me to Tasty Kabob
Anyhow it's peaceful & comfortable the food is delicious the staff is friendly & when the owner asked me for a personal critique of the place all I could offer was that he should be charging $6
Some of my favorites today were the cottage cheese which you seldom see at a Chinese buffet the Fried Rice with ham they also offer it without ham the General Tso's Chicken the fried chicken & the 5-Star flavor of the Mongolian BBQ dish that was prepared for me
Just a tick below 5 Stars because some of the competitors like Crazy & Pacific Seafood are so amazing but this is an excellent buffet with SUPER LOW PRICES
It was a good meal if you want fish - but  maybe $ 51 for lunch is a bit too high
Food burrito left more to be desired although it was large it was lacking in flavor
We decided to go there for lunch as my wife had a work outing there and enjoyed the food
I'm very glad to say that Viet Kitchen has provided me a place in the North Valley for delicious food
Now while I couldn't tell if the meatballs were homemade or not they were still delicious
I can't speak to the quality of the food having never been able to sample it but I am giving them one star because of their lack of communication and their inability to deal with a situation of this sort
The amount of meat to bread was good making a decent sandwich
I frequent many sushi bars in the area and I would not recommend this place at all
For me it is always a good way to determine just how good the sushi restaurant because this bowl has almost every type of sashimi you find on their menus - albacore tuna salmon squid egg yellowtail tuna belly fish eggs etc
Now concerning Shimogamo not only were the portions very small for both the chirashi bowl and the spicy tuna roll there was absolutely no flavor in the fish neither did it look fresh
The rice in the chirashi bowl was also dry hard and not cooked properly to be sushi riceI would recommend going to Sakana specifically the location in ahwatukee
Portions are good sized the fish is fresh has flavor and prices are reasonable
Ridiculous obesity-causing portions we got the small which appeared to still be enough to feed a family of four moderately tasty food and an atmosphere that screams CHAIN
The service was good and the food came quickly
because the place is pretty classy and has good food and decent drinks
PeopleThis is a hamburger hotdog sausage and beef sammich place
Please note this so you don't kink my drive thru expereice againThe food here is very good though I've only ever had the beef sammy and the sausage sammich
The owners/employees don't even ask me what I want when I go  they just have my sammy ready at the window; I pay cash of course  bid them a good day   drive to an undisclosed location so I can unhinge my jaw and then proceed to hoark down that wonderful mound of thinly sliced beef stuffed between two fresh slabs of  meat-juice soaked italian bread
I enjoyed the tater salad but we both thought the dirty rice could have used more meat in much much larger pieces
I had the fish tacos that were fried and came with cabbage and soft shells - delicious
My verdict Decent food good service laughably overpriced
Just think reasonably good restaurants ie zin burger tru foods capital grill are all visible in the front of the biltimore
The food at this place was very good that's the most positive thing I can say
I've heard the meatball sub is good but I'm just not diggin' the tomato sauce
Chicken sandwich looked delicious and I was happy to see a fresh made bun/roll that WASN'T egg washed - sheesh
Neither dish was particularly spicy but both had great flavor
Great atmosphere friendly service and excellent food for very cheap
I ordered a #7 Combo which arrived pretty soon as a roasting hot platter with a Chile Relleno a beef tamale a hard shredded beef taco & a bit of salad
It's too dark the menu is too limited and while the food is good it somehow always fails to live up to the hype
The Thai Chicken and Jamaican Jerk Chicken wraps are amazing
They also have fresh oysters jumbo shrimp cocktails salads and tasty seafood chowder as well as the occasional lobster special
At $10-12 for lunch portions and $17-19 for huge dinner servings and $25 for a massive platter of oysters shrimp crab mussels and clams it's a fantastic value for the quality and tastiness of the food
Good reasonably priced seafood can be hard to come by in the valley but this spot is a gem
They have good food and I love how when the armrest is put up it feels like were watching a gigantic tv on our couch in the living room
Well let me eat my words down with some of their delicious fish
The calamari was huge and tentacles thick and meaty good workout for those jaw muscles
The beef caldareta was very good with shreds of meat soaking in the sauce which I scooped up and placed on my rice
This place is always clean and really has good food
They also have great soups a warm chocolate lava dessert that is to die for and good pizza and hot steamed veggies
I highly recommend the Outback at Southern and McClintock if you have food allergies
Pizza was very good but the wine is way over priced
The food is always good and generous portion sizes and reasonably priced
The bf had the BBQ chicken pizza which is always amazing but this time was especially good by his comments
I enjoyed the lettuce wrapped chicken tacos asian
This is a great market with a great selection of dry goods as well as foodstuff
Ribs were nice tender meat off the bone great sauce and pit-smoked; excellent value for 20 bux
Great BBQ place excellent food and good value
Wonderful authentic Thai food very reasonably priced
The pizza was good not Mamma Mia's good but good
If you're looking for amazing food then you've come to the right place
I'm a big fan of a good Italian Beef sandwich
This last visit we stopped in on Pizza Night which is every Friday and pretty delicious
They will not accomodate but the food is amazing and should be enjoyed as they make it
Great deal and a LOT of food but it did not taste good
Places like these I definitely think you need to try for yourself b'c our tastebuds are so different but coming from somebody who knows Chinese food I wasn't impressed the least bit
While Phoenix Ranch Market has very delicious food and a decent selection it's still missing a lot to be a real mercado or whatever
About an hour and fifteen minutes later the food arrived cold and covered in grease from poorly handled wings
oh yah I asked the driver if he just delivered cold food and he said probably  I admired his honesty but couldn't believe my ears
well can I get a refund or credit for the cold greasy food
If you really need something hot you can order take out from either the Thai place or the Pizza place in the shopping center and bring it in they told me so
While I did not like the seasoning on the curry chicken the meat itself was very fresh and juice and did not taste like factory farm chicken but good free range meat
I ended up crepe'd -I sprained my ankle playing squash a week or two ago so unfortunately no running this morning or for the past week or two for that matterBut I was able to get on the bike and grind it out today and I was getting peckish by the time noon rolled aroundI head out into the mean streets of Old Town Scottsdale for my rendezvous with a platter of good-'n-greasy tacos when I remembered that Gabi had mentioned that a new sandwich shop had gone into the space once occupied by the Ice Tango yogurt shop I may have inadvertently killed
The food was cold the service was horrible and apparently there is only ONE person who knows how to make a milkshake as it took over 30 minutes for us to get ours
lightly crunchy outside juicy flavorful chicken on the inside
It has good food and good beer and also is associated with some good memories here
It's really an awesome spot to get together with friend have a pint enjoy a game and some good food
Like other people have said the chicken sounds really good but actually comes out kind of bland
We didn't try their food - the choices weren't very appealing to me and they are limited but other reviewers say it is good
We eat mostly lamb and chicken curries spicy they have never sent out a dish that wasn't pipping hot and perfectly spiced
Spam - B+Eggs - B+County Gravy - B+Staff - B+County Potatoes - BI really enjoyed the meal it was a lot of food
With the food portions so large and delicious I don't know how all the staff stay so slim
I would highly recommend getting the ribeye cap as it is a cut of meat you cant find elsewhere and you dont even have to work to eat it -- there is no fat to cut off
The food specials particularly the seafood appetizers and a great value
Great food pretty good service and a nice upscale atmosphere
Overall a good place to catch some late night fast food
The salad was chilled and the pizza hot so all was perfect in our world
The food is fresh and really really good
The buffalo chicken sandwich is really good too
The meat was still moist and had good texture
Amazing food and great service but a hole in the wall location
Good mix of caribbean Mexican and Chinese food
This place DESTROYS any other quick-dine at every airport I've been to around the planet in terms of quality of food and making it not feel like you're waiting for the 335 to Tulsa for some lame family thing
Just terrible I ordered fajitas expecting chicken cooked over a grill nope I got pan fried flavorless garbage
I officially hate this chilis the only good thing about the meal was the chicken enchilada soup which must come out of a bag otherwise I can't see how it doesn't suck like everything else
They also have a good selection of meat including bison
The stipulations of the gift card were that you have to order $100 worth of food and I figured that 5 adults and 2 kids could do that
The chimichangas were really greasy the beef one was mostly fat the rice and beans were cold on all 4 plates
Soggy blackened fish burger with bun and condiment quality akin to In-N-Out Burger I'm not exaggerating - check out the pics
So I figured out what the 4 star rating is for the ambiance and PRICE too expensive for this quality of food
The second time I ate at Gallo Blanco was for brunch with a large group 20+ people and the food and service was excellent once again
We ordered an appetizer salad and a pizza
Then another surprise hit me -- the meat was almost flavorless
maybe they make them different non traditional or something i dunno all i know is tha tthey are the most amazing food to ever touch my lips
it's nothing special i'll agree with that but for free food i'm going to go right ahead and say it's amazing
The food was pretty good but the service was a bit lackluster
I had a margarita pizza which was pretty tasty
I highly recommend the panang chicken curry
It was delicious but way too much pizza for us 4 when we paired it when their large order of ravioli and two meatball
For a family of four with drinks an appetizer and 2 desserts
Not quite sure that this place would be able to pull off good drinks and excellent food I let my eyes wander around the space that was created
It was a little bland but smooth and would compliment another dish that was full of flavor
The  swordfish tacos were adequately portioned and flavorful
But it is solidly good Chinese food and fyi you don't do business for 80 years by making mediocre food
I got the cannelloni pretty tasty meat filling and alfredo sauce
99 or a pound of strawberries for 95 cents*Delicious oatmeal cookies*Delicious prepackaged meals like Indian Butter Chicken*Reasonable prices*Self-check outSeriously this place will save me money
The food is usually pretty good prices are very reasonable and the homemade salsa is GREAT
Nothing super special but the Bees is a good solid choice for food or drinks when you don't feel like thinking about where to go
Friday Fish and/or Shrimp Fry or Angus Beef Burger with Fries Dinners are recommended
My mother is Japanese so I know what good authentic Japanese food is and they have it here
I absolutely love the chasu ramen hot beef broth soup with noodles and thinly sliced roast pork it is soooo good
I also highly highly recommend their sashimi platter- the fish melts in your mouth and is so fresh
They have a pasta dish and hummus and all sorts of good stuff
UPDATE I received a very friendly message from the owner of Boulders who apologized for my previous experiences with the food and offered a free meal with recommendations
We started with an appetizer of fire stix - beef on a stick in a spicy sauce and fried wontons
The wontons were stale the marinated and mequite grilled beef tasted bland and neither marinated nor mesquite grilled and the hot sauce was more sweet than hot
The Southwest Salad with a Chicken breast on top was nothing out of this world though very tasty and I did enjoy it
Decent not great and sadly the shredded beef in the taco I had tasted like it was boiled without any flavors or seasoning
I have always said you can determine how good the Mexican food is by the salsa and the rice
All of the meat aside from the steak had a smoky flavor that wasn't too vinegary or sweet as some barbeque sauces tend to be
The pulled pork and beef brisket were delicious but had huge chunks of fat floating around in them that repulsed my gristle-hating taste buds with their texture so I had to be vigilant
The chicken noodle soup was decent with doughy noodles but also was lacking in flavor and contained very little chicken
However the chili was quite good with cheddar cheese onions green peppers pinto beans and plenty of meat
Granted we went an hour before closing so the service was lackluster but the food was delicious
The chicken was tender and flavorful and unlike any street taco I'd have before
And OH SO TASTY meaty juicy plump not in a Mondoburger way
Just the right amount of food for the short amount of time between Looper and Hotel Transylvania
the food is consistently good nice drink selection wait staff are always happy helpful and friendly
The food court which only takes cash but has wonderful prices
Normally I'm a big fan of Macaroni Grill--the food is pretty good and I like the atmosphere but the service at this location is usually lacking unless you can get the one server in the place that seems to know what's going on
I had a delicious salad with strawberries blue cheese and grilled chicken one night and fish over pasta the next
My food arrived soon after wards and it was served on a scorching hot plate
The key to this place is the meat is cooked over fire which only a few taco shop type places in greater Phoenix bother to do and it imparts a different flavor to the meat
no beans or rice fillers - just good beef not dry or grissely nor mushy/steamed
I usually get one of the lunch specials even the Chinese-sounding dishes have a Thai flair especially if you order them with extra spice but if you're hungry the house special chicken is well worth the extra buck as are the Thai noodle dishes the pad see ew is my favorite
The wait staff is always friendly the food is always quick good and reasonably priced
The bacon was thick high-quality meaty bacon
I picked up the burger and had a good first bite bacon lettuce beef bun probably not in that order
Staples like the Butter Chicken and Lamb Vindaloo were excellent and I was surprised to see a HUGE selection along with a fresh looking salad bar
Their grilled cheese is pretty good considering it's fast food
Cupcakes are a great alternative to having a variety of flavors when bringing dessert to a party or gathering
Now onto the disappointments - the food is all quite good
The services the food the apprezitiers the drinks and the staff were excellent
Oh and the food on the new menu is good too
Average lunch is about $10-12 a plate which isn't cheap but with the good food cool inside atmosphere and adorable patio I will gladly pay a few bucks extra to support a great local business
Great food choices sandwiches ranging from a Reuben to a Cuban o more rhymes now I mean it delicious varieties of smoked meats fish and chips and fish tacos soups including a daily 'blackboard special' and salads
Being of Eastern European bloodline and having a grandmother who started cooking at 4 AM for dinner I know what good ethnic foods should taste like
Also had the daily special which was a delicious roll of crab cucumber avocado topped with seared beef and a spiced mayo
The food was delicious and approachable It was visually appealing as well
We had NY style pizzas lots of drinks appetizers and I am sure were just plain loud and roudy through all of it
The food itself was prepared well I usually eat a lot of nigiri and the pieces are ok in amount of fish the rice was packed well and the quality of the fish was good
The food in this place is outrageously good and authentic
It was painful HOWEVER the owner Mario is so charmingly nice and with the food being so good it warranted a repeat attendance
I would definitely order that again   My friend order the Spicy Tuna Roll I was a bit skeptic at first but yet it was surprisingly pretty good
I ended up getting the fresh fish of the day it was some weird random fish from New Zealand I really liked it especially with the lemon sauce on top  I don't really have much to say about this place though it was good food but I am still heartbroken at the fact they don't have any whiskey that isn't disgusting
Ok let's start with the good things Food is great FULL bar Great prices Good service AMAZING outdoor seating Bad things Flooded with DOMS Dirty old men Crowded with cougars Smokey patio PAID parking I live in the area and love this bar
The prices are great and the food is surprisingly good
And I don't mean just bread and a bunch of veggies but they have a delicious meatless turkey which tastes like the real thing but it's been so long I don't remember what the real thing tastes like anymore
Definitely try this place out if you're in a mood for a good sandwich oh and I guess the real meat ones are supposed to be good too ha
I used Yelp to search for good Mexican food in Phoenix - after a string of disappointing Mexican experiences in Tucscon
Usually we are only going to get a guitar pin from the different cities we visit because we know the food isn't that good
The food is never bad it's just never that good
The food is consistent flavorful and diverse
I come from New Jersey where an Italian restaurant means you get delicious food and a lot of it
It's absolutely delicious food there's just not a whole lot of it
We ordered quite a few different things to get a sampling and two dishes were outstanding--the spicy won tons and spicy chicken and noodles cold noodles with chicken a few veggies and maybe a little peanut sauce mixed into the spice
My bill was $47 and I could only figure out $37 worth of food and taxes
When I 1st visited Peter Wong's I was not impressed with the egg roll
Mongolian beef be still my heart it was full of delicious firm onions and scallions and SPICY
The banchan side dishes are flavorful and delicious
I am still sad that I was unable to grill the meat at the table but the quality of the food made up for the novelty
That punk Guy Fieri on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives on Food Network made it sound like I'd wet myself with glee upon eating the carnitas and the lady making the batch acted like they'd be good enough to keep part of the recipe a secret
Anyway--maybe it was because he was high as a f*&^ing kite but the food did not taste like magic it tasted like hot sauce
i remember the pizza being huge slices of super thin delicious greasy pizza
The bun was good he said but the beef was too thickly cut and well-done for his taste
They know their food is so good it's like they don't have to be pleasant when you eat there
The food usually comes out promptly and it's always tasty - but my gripe has always been with a server who just didn't seem like they cared
BUT totally worth overlooking for this food
Giligins has cheap booze cheap and tasty greasy bar food party games and lots of weirdos
The pizza is delicious and you haven't lived until you've tried the Burrata
I would give this place a half star if I could because the only thing good about this place is the fact that they are cheap enough for the people who are crazy enough to think the stuff they sell here is food
I was hoping there would be outdoor seating as natural light is so much better than fluorescent lights for food photography
David suggested we have pizza as he'd had it in the past and really enjoyed it
29 seem like a good options for those who are willing to wait 30-45 minutes for a special dish
In terms of quality though these sandwiches appear to be a step or two above University Pizza and Wings the likes of which deliver to drunk coeds until 3 a
No matter how you eat the pizza it's pretty darn good the crust is very thin but it's not crackery and the bottom has a tad less char than I prefer; the cheese is mild chewy and a tad stringy; the toppings are fresh and plentiful
While Oregano's food is above average the food is not worth the epic waits so common for a table at the restaurant
We hadn't been here in a while and had actually forgotten what delicious pizza tastes like
Their rolled tacos supreme are good but the psuedo guac was unexpected
The Kung Pow Beef consisted of filet minon broccoli green onions bell peppers and hot peppers over rice
My plate was piled high with delicious food and had a flavorable spicy kick to it
As the food arrived I was surprised to find the pizzas are actually a good size for a filling meal
They make their own bread and have a good selection of Boars Head meat
Even though most of the Sprouts produce isn't certified organic is spending $5 on gas and another $5 on two tomatoes at Whole Foods really worth it
Moving to AZ I've been in desperate need of finding a local sushi spot that would be at least semi-comparable to the quality we get back in LA and at reasonable price-points
Overall the ambiance and the sushi quality is pretty good for being in AZ
However the prices are a bit high as to be expected being that it is located in Scottsdale and that the rent and getting quality fish so far inland from the coast would raise cost
Not sure if it was an isolated incident but for the high price I expect quality or even naturally raised organic style chicken
The waiter impressed me by rattling off a list of 7 or 8 specialty off the menu rolls that they had available that night
The combination of the woodiness of the shitake and the flavor of the beef along with the tuna and crab in the roll
They did a good job of packing the sandwich and actually cooking the Bacon instead of some disgusting boiled flab of fat that you see at fast food places
I used to go to pizza hut but after having tons and tons of problems with the pizza-cold gross and skimpy toppings; I convinced my husband to let me order dominos and we have never turned back
VERY VERY chocolatey and too much food after an app a sandwich and two beers but it was definitely worth trying
The food was pretty good pad thai seemed a bit sweet for me but not too much for me to not like it
- The food is always good which probably explains the wait
Yup it's very good sober too ;  Amado's needs to be taken for what it is  quick casual Mexican foods
The chicken is seasoned deliciously and usually not dry- and if you like dark meat the leg and thigh are juicy and delicious
Some of the food is pretty good and there are some creative options the Ranch Stack at breakfast the duck-fat poached fries at lunch
*Fig Prosciutto & Brie both our favs*Sun dried tomato gorganzola & walnuts we actually ordered the artichoke but got this by mistake but we both liked it - and I'm not a huge sun-dried tomato fan eitherI can't wait to go back and try more wine and more of the delicious sounding food
Don't be discouraged by the location or outside appearance of Rocket Burger it's a small family business ran by nice people who serve good food
C'mon when your eatin good italian food you want the passion that belongs with the Italian spirit I know the owners have
I think this place has some of the most delicious food I've ever had and makes me miss Arizona
I'd definitely eat here again but if given the choice between here and Chick-fil-a I'd rather eat at Chick-fil-a because they use more flavor in the breading on their chicken and their waffle-cut fries are MUCH bettter than the fries here
I like their selection they have more meat options than OCB but nothing impressed me
The food is very good; the signature dish that gives the restaurant its name is my favorite
The food is average and some of the appetizers are mislabeled if you have Chinese family and are accustomed to the food
Flo's is by no means authentic but some of the dishes are good for what they are and the ambiance is nice when it's not too loud
The size of the food platters are generous but the food wasn't that good
When the pizza finally came the crust was soggy  so much for coal-fired pizza and there just wasn't much flavor
The prices are very resonalble for the quality of food you receive
For $3 you get some amazing food got 2 apps and it was more than enough as a meal
But I added in some of the meat from the charcuterie plate and it was an excellent combo if I do say so myself
Don't get me wrong the food is good love the chicken thai pizza and the waitstaff know their stuff
Not saying the food or staff is bad it's just that it's not 5 star quality
I felt like I was at a close friend's house whose family was cooking and making me try all of the delicious food
I plan to bring my Filipino roommate he smiled so wide when I told him there was good Filipino food afoot
Just to share our experience with the food in recent past  I thought the food quality was better for lunch rather than dinner
Love the salsa which is always a good indicator about whether or not the food will be worth the calories at a Mexican food restaurant
The food was very good and we were extremely full and satisfied at the end of our meal
the drinks were weak and the food wasn't particularly tasty  with the exception of their avocado eggrolls& margarita flatbread
The service was good the patio was wonderful and the food was yummy
I ordered the veggie-dilla which was very good too but after tasting both of my parents dishes I really wish I would have ordered one of those
I highly recommend this place and can't wait to get back there myself to try one of those raw dishes
Thirdly the food is an expanded appetizer menu disguised as a lunch/dinner menu - there was not one thing that you have not seen before at a potato skin festival
With a relaxing atmosphere and fun menu Chicken & Waffles and S'mores for dessert I definitely enjoyed this place
My favorites would have to be the mac & cheese and the beef brisket--both delicious
Dont go to LJs for the ambiance theres not much to be had but the service is good and you absolutely cant go wrong with the endless pizza and salad lunch buffet for around $8
we ordered a few bruschetta boards and a sandwich we just wanted some food to snack on while we enjoyed our wine
The food was good but nothing I'd return a 2nd time for
I felt like there was just a lot of flour going on in my food- kinda bland no flavor
Good beer and great kid's menu even if the pizza has gotten very small -did I mention the fries
With dishes ranging from unpleasant to mediocre to excellent this was a difficult score to determine
However the food is always good and always freash
Nothing says good times like a Friday afternoon of gossip about evil CEO's over raw fish
Their menu is amazing - it was so difficult for me to decide what I wanted and I'm usually not indecisive when it comes to food decisions
the food was amazing lots of awesome choices and innovative ingredient pairings and the price was definitely right - I'll be back
The fish and chips were very tasty but the price point for the portion I got- just didn't compute
Again the food was good but you definitely don't get what you pay for
Finally the pretzel bread which was supposed to be amazing tasted like every other enriched-white bread roll I have ever had
However if you are willing to brave the atmosphere the food is darn good
I like the beans more than any of the meat products so I stick to burritos and tostadas normally but every once in a while a chimichanga is worth a try
If you are 21 and don't know what good food is but want to drink with your friends in a loud room this is your spot
The chicken salad gives you the schwarma chicken over lettuce over basmati rice -- woderful combination of warm and cold
A cheese quesadilla covered in a delicious green beef chile sauce
I won't even waste time recommending dishes because all of them are fantastic
Regios located on the south side of Indian School at 17th St is one such establishment among hundreds in PHX that serve this rich and delicious taco made from the glorious head meat of the cow
For $4 you get your choice of hot dog grilled cheese beef pizza puff or chicken tenders all served with fries -- pretty standard
For the quality of food and service you get it is WELL worth the price and i will be going back
The ambiance was absolutely wonderful the service staff was top notch and the food was fantastic
That sounded like a good idea to me and I thought I should try a chicken and waffles place here in Phoenix and compare
The pizza is okay with extra thin crust and very good mozzarella
But the prices are just too high for food that's merely very good
I was a little skeptical when a coworker followed our bosses recommendation of  this place for lunch last week; what does a suit know about Mexican food
The steaming hot shredded chicken was perfectly cooked sauteed with onions spices and dressed with just the right amount of red chili
-appetizers and desserts are generally not required as dinner portions are ample
Here is a rundown of what I ate and the quality-Chicken Quesadilla So soggy it was falling apart inedible-Arcioech sp Scallops  It's Arizona there are no fresh scallops
If I wasn't eating here for free I would balk at it just for the prices let alone the mixed quality of the food
When I got to eat I want plenty of food and I want quality as appropriately expected from the type of establishment I am eating at
The price is right the food is all excellent
I'm a sushi [ngiri] fan and I find those prices to be very reasonable and the quality to be good
On the other hand I've had much better salmon skin hand rolls in over half the sushi bars around the country I've ordered them -- I won't try them again here - they weren't crisped well enough for me and didn't have that lovely dressing so many good bars include inside
I say that good service carries a higher point power than good food
Yes the food is just as good as the fare at Pischke's
The pizza was nicely baked and tasted really good
I think the food is well done fresh and high quality
My issue is not the size of the dishes we all knew what tapas are so we were already expecting small portions but with those small portions and the amount of money we were paying we expected good food
Instead we got pretentious food with unbalanced flavor
If you're going to dress up my food make sure it tastes as good as it looks
If all of my other dishes were as good as this one I'd be raving about this place
Rounding off with a platter of meats and cheeses we were pleasantly surprised that presentation wasn't the usual draped-cold-meat-sterile-plate-sliced-cheese-refrigerated-for-hours
I have enjoyed the salad meals with fish or chicken on top I guess I should diverse and try something that suggest Moroccan
Jade Palace is much closer to us so I will try their Hot and Sour soup in the fall which is usually the barometer I use to measure Chinese Food
I don't remember the pizza but I figure it was good
Some years ago we ate at Padre's and found the food to be quite good
The next time I want to hear good hip hop music feel crowded in my seat and eat sub-par Mexican food I'll strap on my Walkman tune it to 98
The sushi was pretty good as well and I introduced my friend to some sushi that also had jalapeno in it
So I thought maybe the food was just so good that the heat didn't even phase you
My friend ordered the chicken fried steak again shown on DDD and it definitely didn't taste as good as it looked
My other friend had the best dish The Over Easy - toasted brioche w/ spinach egg bacon good bacon and scallions
That said the food is good healthy fresh and plentiful
My friend enjoyed the gyros big and bursting with meat and crisp vegetables
I had the glazed-chicken lavosh pizza; delicious with honey mustard glazed chicken cheese and onions
The food is simply wonderful I recommend trying the Southwest Corn bread appetizer to start off the evening and all of the entrees are extraordinarily well done
The lamb will melt in your mouth the chicken is wonderful and the steaks enchilada style are sizzling in more ways than one
It's been a wonderful experience each time as far as the food and the atmosphere
I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is willing to try food that is not American
The Jerk Chicken was Kathy's idea and it fell a little flat as other than the jerk rub the chicken itself was bland and needed to be dipped in their hot sauce or hoisin sauce to help the flavor
My vegan friend suggested this place to me and my other friend we were skeptical that vegan food could taste good
The food here was delicious I'd eat here regularly if I lived in Phoenix
I felt like everything was flavored well and while I enjoy meat normally this opened my mind to trying other vegetarian places in the future
It's fun the food is really good and the servers are always friendly and fast
I usually split a pizza when I come and it's always good but the big rig pasta is really tasty too
Nice patio seating area good service and of course great food
Too Expensive for Small Piece's of Chicken and COLD FOOD
Over that time my friends and I developed relationships with the wonderful servers there who always remembered our names our favorite dishes and who were always willing to recommend a great new beer from the extensive ever changing list
All that complaining aside I cannot recommend this place enough for the food
I had the fish and chips which were pretty spectacular not greasy but perfectly fried and crisp with a ton of flavor
We all ordered various forms of the chicken shawarma pita or plate and they were large portions of chicken fresh vegetable additions and delicious sauce
Pretty cheap eats for this part of town fresh and delicious food good service very fast food prep and a really lovely establishment overall
New Chef perhaps or floor manager with keen attention to quality and timing of food
I may not have enjoyed every movie I've seen here but the theater is big clean very good sound and picture quality and they serve hot food
But the food was tasty and filling at the restaurant and the next day at home
The flavor of the meat was very good and you got a ton of it but I found it to be rather greasy
My friend had the Sizzling Beef I've never had it before but it was really good
They bring out a HOT skillet and place the vegetable and beef on it and watch it sizzles
Service wasn't the best they were more worried about the big party that was going to be seated next to us but the food was really good
such good food in such a great environment
I am a food adrenaline junky so any time a restaurant has a unique enough menu for me to even waste my time with is an amazing feat
Good noodle dishes - aside from everyone's favorite Pad Thai the Guayteaw Graprao spicy flat rice noodles with meat is really good
actually any of the noodle dishes #s 54-57 on the menu are really good
Fellow Yelpers Brian S and Donald SDined here with me on several platesAnd an appetizerThe service was strongThe atmosphere was niceThe food was very goodNothing broke but the rice
I had a beef and shrimp paste plateServed over broken riceThe appetizer we shared was spring rollsWith shrimp and other stuffThey were pretty fresh and tastyI would go here againI would eat the broken grainThe prices are pretty goodYour wallet won't be
and yes the pizza is good here but I do not think it is good enough for the price or the wait
The crust was really good and the topping were ok but I prefer a meat lovers pizza piled high
I had the three sherbets for dessert and that was mighty tasty
I was offered several choices of pizza slices and accepted a bruscetta one which was delicious
This dish was on point and we all enjoyed this part of the meal
But the pizza was lacking in all things flavor and texture
The chicken didn't really have any extra flavor it did not seem processed which was a nice added touch
The others made their own personal sized pizzas but no one  was impressed
If you're ever up in the area and looking for a nice atmosphere with good food then give El Encanto a try
3 Margs + H2ONext round I'll try the higher end fish products and assess for sea quality that San Diego is known for
Too long when you have to smell the wonderful food
I enjoyed their spring rolls beef ribs and lettuce wrapped spring rolls
It looked good but the plates were scorching hot and the food was lukewarm which is usually a sign the food has been sitting in the expo window for a long time
The food tasted good including my wife's chicken quesadilla
I had sushi in the sushi restaurant within the hotel I'll be honest I found some other higher-rated sushi places on Yelp that were relatively close and I was planning on stepping out for dinner but the music and general atmosphere was so cool I decided to hang out and try the place inside
In addition adjoining the eating area is a small market so if you need halal meat in Tempe or any other essentials of Muslim cuisine its worth your time to grab lunch and then do some shopping
The deli and prepared food areas are good I have had many a fine things from them never disappointed
Pricing is moderate to the low compared to other gourmet burger joints in the valley - $36 tab for 2 with tip - a decent value in my book for good food and nice service
This means all the lovely bar food that they already offer at a very inexpensive price becomes a very good deal
Everything was COLD all the sides cold the kids food was cold and the stakes were undercooked
spring rolls were not as good as i expected it was a bit chewier than the usual
the ones who brought our food from the kitchen needs good customer service though
I highly recommend The Arrogant Butcherespecially for desserts
I've been dieting for the last 5 months and have finally reached my goal - and then some so I decided to treat myself good behavior and have some fast food
I had the garlic chicken which wasn't very garlicky and just seemed like glorified chicken salad sandwich and really wasn't impressed
Food selection atrocious hot dogs pizza etc
All the food was delicious and great for sharing
It was a bit overdone to the point where it may have been better to skip the chick half and make do with the beans bland corn waterlogged cobbettes rolls good for crumbs but not much else and the afterthought salad
That's when we knew they forgot us I'm sure the pizza would have been good but I think customer service is a huge deal so we got outta there
The food has been pretty good so far but I have avoided ordering the pho as what tastes I've had from my mother's orders didn't seem to be up to par with what I'm used to and spoiled by in San Diego
Well it's not San Diego but for a Phoenix suburb it's still pretty good food
Most people care about the food though so here is the bottom line if you are in the mood for some comfort food the pre-meal bread is also excellent head to Modern Steak for the classics
I got to taste a piece of the catfish and thought it was quite good as well
I didn't have a drink since I was already battling falling over sleepiness but I thoroughly enjoyed the food and the break from the air-conditioned mall
As the appetizers were delivered I was slightly disappointed; somehow I'd gotten the expectation that each dish would be a fusion specialty in and of itself
The pizza was good and in any other place I would be overly impressed but I think the years of hype stole away some of the pizza's thunder
If you have time and money to burn it would be a fun experience to drink next door for a couple hours then eat some tasty fresh pizza
The meat pesto pizza is way too good as well
The meat selection is good but again limited
My favorite is the chopped meat which has excellent flavor not the Cooks' brand
Who would have thought a fish pie of all things would be such pure deliciousness
he was friendly and sat us promptlyWe shared an appetizer each ordered the same entree and split dessert
The chicken and bacon was good but the cheese was bland
It's huge even if you just get the side added to your main dish so splitting it is a good option
My companions ordered the peanut butter mousse dessert and it was very tasty
I went here craving fish and chips as well as the well-worn comfortable atmosphere that one expects from a good Irish pub
The menu said that the fish and chips were voted best in Phoenix and sited the fresh made batter as the key to the dish's quality
The fish was slightly over-cooked but still tasted good
Good beer impressive local selection and really exciting food
The steak frites small plate is great and not a small plate the shrimp arepa has interesting sweet flavors and the berry cobbler fruit dessert is out of this world
I have no problem paying for good food but this place is more style than substance
The sausage was really good but they really skimp on the amount they put on the pizza
When they brought the pizza out it looked fantastic but when I started to eat it lacked any flavor
Being the foodies that we are my wife and I picked our hotel in Scottsdale not based on how close it was to the event we were attending but based on the surrounding restaurants
I bought some mexican chicken stuff which was pretty good and cheap so I'll give it that
When the food finally made it to us It was hot but not super hot I would say more like lukewarm
All in all it was a good experience the food and company was good and we enjoyed it
They just have to work on getting that food super hot
Mmmmmm a grilled chicken breast topped with blue cheese chopped celery and buffalo wing sauce sided with their amazing waffle fries
the taco came sitting on lettuce hot food and lettuce come on
The food was pretty good and exactly what you'd expect
It was recommended by an avid Thai food lover
Overall we had a nice dinner and my friend enjoyed having Thai food for the first time
For an app I got the arrancino fried rice ball with peas and meat on the inside with marinara underneath which was good but not as authentic as I would hope they used medium grain rice instead of true risotto short grain arborio rice as traditional and they tried to bring it more upscale with what seemed like it may have been prosciutto on the inside I would have preferred the traditional chopped meat in tomato sauce on the interior instead
Flavors went very well together along with the sauce although my pasta side was penne in marinara whereas with the fish pasta a olio would have made more sense
Friendly service not too crowded we didn't have to wait but we took one of their last empty tables inside and good well balanced food I will definitely be back
Well worth it and the extra for Buffalo chicken
But all this could be why their prices are affordable just go to Biltmore instead and overpay for the ambiance and their food is certainly good enough to keep people coming back
I'm not a huge fan of the food there but the liquor list is good enough for me
It was not fresh and I expected the chicken breast to be hot which it was not
The menu was BIG and the food we ordered was very tasty
I got the Buffalo Chicken Salad which was well made had good crisp chicken hot buffalo sauce and lots of greens
The staff was friendly and accomodating - service was quick and they accepted a coupon I had from localdines for $30 of food with no issues something I recommend grabbing if you are headed here anytime soon
we'll definitely be back for whatever the next big game is - Blue 32 is a cut above the Zipps and Fox Sports Grills in Scottsdale and worth serious consideration for your next sports-fueled food fest might be
The cashier said Good choice; the pizza cheesesteak is great
The pork quesadilla was flavorless however the Chicken Enchiladas had some descent flavor and the rice with corn on the side was very good
The food was very good and full of flavor though
Far and away the restaurant I have frequented most often 5th Avenue is superlative for service and food quality for the price
Other reviews describe it as a greasy spoon or good hangover food
If you're ever in Central Phoenix near 7th Avenue and Thomas and need a bite for breakfast or lunch 5th Avenue Cafe may really surprise you with their homey atmosphere friendly service good food and low prices
Once the food finally got to us I was impressed by the food presentation
Service was friendly and my chopped chicken salad was delicious i was pleasantly surprised that i liked the buttermilk dressing as i am usually not a fanit really complimented the avocado blue cheese bacon and chicken
The service was excellent the food came out quickly and everything was very tasty
The store here has various dairy products such as ice cream flavored and unflavored butters buttermilk flavored cheese as well as eggs and desserts such as chocolate dipped macaroons
I find that it's quite true about where you sit because most of the sushi we grabbed were cold
Tasted amazing and she even comped the price of dessert
excellent service stellar food cool atmosphere all for only $20 plus tip
Service was excellent and the food was absolutely delicious
Their pizza is quite good perhaps not the best in the world but still quite tasty
What really sets this place apart in my mind is their wonderful broasted chicken
The chicken is crispy and flavorful right until the last bite due to the marinade
The chicken is very tender and the sauce has a great flavor
I frequently get the drunken noodle with chicken and it's always delicious
I love all of their food first off the Brizza is amazing genious idea
I definitely recommend this plate but more importantly I think it's indicative of how they prepare food
I cannot stress enough; the food was delicious
I tried the jerk chicken and it too was plain considering it was 'jerk' flavored spicy-sweet
We were so impressed with the food and my husband actually uttered the words I don't want this to end
The flavor of the food we ordered was bland and the temperature was much too close to lukewarm for my liking
No flavor and they smelled profusely like fish--which often means the fish isn't very fresh
After waiting 15 minutes longer and my pizza getting pathetically cold he went to the counter and asked here the grub was
By this time my pizza was straight-up cold
If your order doesn't fall into the abyss you can expect delicious heavily-topped like I like it pizza in a very clean but familiy-friendly setting
One of my favorites is the hummus and grilled chicken appetizerwhich is gynormous and I have them add in some tabbouleh then cucumbers on the side
Otherwise great casual lunch and dinner spot that is extremely reasonable in price for the quality of food you are getting
The meat and vegetables were really fresh and clean which is probably the most important thing about hot pot
It's piping hot and has all the flavors of all the meat juice and veggies in it
I ordered the Caprese salad which was pretty tasty and my dining companions seemed to love the chili and chicken wings
I'd like to try happy hour next as their food prices look amazing
If you like Kung Pao like a lot of good food for little price this is the chinese food place to go
We tried the food that they were serving at Bourbon Steaks and it not as good as I had expected it to be
Haven't tried their food but they sure do make a good Mojito
We had egg rolls and fried tofu as appetizers
I also got pad thai to go with chicken and shrimp and it smells and looks really good
The fish was terrible definitely not a recommend
The spicy chicken hummus plate was good
The pizza offerings are all original and tasty like nobody's business especially with one of the great bottles of wine that they offer
The Spicy Tuna Roll is made much different than you would normally get at a sushi place but it was surprisingly very good  and spicy
it was good just Americanized Greek food
To-go containers of Pork adobo and Dinuguan each $3I found all the entrees and eggrolls save the mechado meat was a little tough very tender and very tasty loved the dinuguan
This looked and smelled so very good but I couldn't try it due to food allergies
Good bread fresh meat that isn't slimy and questionable like at some places and lots of ingredients
Update Also have tried the meatball sub and Philly cheese steak both were excellent
I don't feel the quality of the food was compromised in anyway due to their lower price
They have a good selection of organic and natural food at reasonable prices
Everything we've tried is delicious - stacked enchiladas carne adovada chorizo-stuffed chicken even the meat loaf
We visited Santa Fe and our relatives took us out to a couple of places for good New Mexico food
They were fine but neither could hold a candle to  the Blue Adobe Grill for the quality of the food
And if you have meat-eating friends there are many many excellent selections
So nice to eat in a civilized restaurant that offers tasty well-prepared food at reasonable prices
I had eggs which were good toast fine bacon way overcooked sausage wrinkled little meat things that were over cooked too and potatoes black spots and tasted horrible
I figured I would just go with a basic pizza thin crust and was less than impressed
Service was good and friendly but the pizza sub-par IMO
The service is usually good and the food is surprisingly good for a brewery
Food is good for a pub but not exceptional
the food is great -- try the vegetable medley -- and the staff is excellent
The apple-chicken salad was awesome and the ladies enjoyed just about every facet of the salad bar
I like my meat to the rare side and the flavor was incredible
Not really impressed with the service but the food was great
Like I said the food was good a couple of surprises we would have liked to know about but the service and experience was marginal
The food is only good and I would recommend getting pure appetizers as they are the only great dishes
every time i go here the lady is kinda snippy and the food isnt very good and horribly overpriced
I want to go and steal all of their recipes because this is authentic and delicious Mexican food
Tip - as others have pointed out the food in the cafe is a little on the high $$ side - but very good
I also had a taste of my friend's Nabeyaki Udon noodle soup - full flavored full of mixed seafood
Overall the food has satisfactory quality and flavors
Most people stick to steak and chicken but I really recommend trying the carnitas and barbecoa for a more exciting meal
I find these meats to have much stronger spicier flavors
My husband put down his menu and without hesitation said let's leave     We walked over to Wildflower Bread Company where we were greeted with smiles and wonderful food
desperately in search of good mexican food
you can tell by the smell the food is going to be good
halfway through dinner as they seated 3 strapping phoenix police officers next to our table i realized the quality of the food here wasn't just my imagination or the effects of heavy tequila consumption
After several minutes trying to decide on a choice I struck up a conversation with a friendly patron to my right and she recommended the egg noodle stir fry with chicken
SEAFOODOur bottomless pit had the Ahi and the Dogfish shark and said both were good
It is recently under new ownership but the quality of food has not changed
and offers wonderful food with the option of alcohol for breakfast
Fried chicken- mmmm mmmm big chunks well-spiced finger lickin good and no skimping
As much as I love food I am a quality over quantity kind of girl and this entree was not cuttin' it
I got the chicken pita and it was flavorful
Incredibly fresh food that tastes amazing and is probably quite good for my body
The spring rolls are amazingly huge and come stuffed with shrimp and chicken in addition to all the regular goodies
The food is fairly inexpensive and it is good
I actually don't have a comparison to Brooklyn pizza but it is pretty darn good
The Pizza is always very good never a disappointment
Besides gyros there are several other sandwich options to choose from philly's italian beef hot dogs to name a few
The inside decor isn't much but I'll take good food at a place rather than nice decor/surroundings and bad food
Dad had the ribs/chicken combo and thought the ribs were surprisingly good for a non-barbeque place
I enjoyed my chicken satay although the meat was a bit on the dry side
During happy hour drinks are half off so you wont feel bad throwing back that $11 martini or 5 and their HH sushi and appetizer list is extensive
I was so disappointment - the fry bread was cold very little meat and cheese- it was bland boring and sad
Lunch specials and taco tuesday monday madness on appetizers and all u can eat fish sunday
I was fighting a cold so I didn't want to overload my immune system with raw seafood otherwise I would have been all over it
They could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good
So after doing in the bathroom what bathrooms in hotel rooms are for while traveling and eating travel food I was dissapointed that I had to open the window and let 112 degree air IN to the bathroom in order to exhaust OUT to the otherwise prinstine Arizona environs what I had left behind in my tiny trailer-park type camode's delightfully drab air
The service is great as well really friendly waitstaff who ensure your order is taken promptly you get refills when needed and your food is serviced hot
The interior is very simple but hey go in the evening and take your dessert to the outdoor seats and people watch while you drift into a delicious diabetic coma
Based on where it is you wouldn't think you could get good Thai food here but you can
Again though the strength of this place is the quality of food they serve there
The food was a perfectly prepared collection of hand-made pastas in exotic flavors - cheese infused squid ink colored and wonderfully sauced
Yes it's a bit pricey - but TOTALLY worth it for special occasion food
After reading reviews I had to try the cinnamon roll and it was amazing
Yes you need some time to kill I recommend getting there at least an hour before opening and the ability to tolerate weather and a few line cutters but you will be rewared with what has been called and I whole-heartedly agree is the best pizza in America
I wasn't too impressed on the atmosphere alone but who knows maybe the food is outstanding
The manager even went out of his way to make sure we had a great experience-Complete with a very nice crowd of regulars the Mayor even bought me and the boys -It's a Saints bar-Pretty good food except the nacho cheese is grossMy only complaint is that it's a family barI like kids but not when I'm at a bar
The servers don't seem to smile suggests to me that morale sucks at this location the food is so-so and tonight we got something brought to the table COLD
The atmosphere was good drinks were reasonably priced and the food decent
The food is also always really good at Boston Market
If you're buying sushi and boxes of chicken salad at grocery stores then you shouldn't expect to be shocked by calorie content or substandard quality
pretty good food especially the green chiliusually but I can't eat in a dirty place and the floor had food everywhere the last few times we were there
The truck serves up food that is fresh addictive top quality reasonably priced and packed with a lot of punch
Recommendations CHICKEN or GRILLED CATFISH JAMBURRITOWe usually order the chicken or grilled catfish jamburrito and some hushpuppies
This is a good stop for travelers to grab cheap food and enjoy some drinks
Your end product will be worthy of 5 stars in addition to being cheaper and tastier than the pizza at Sauce
However the quality of the food was just as good during the week as on Sunday
The grounds are beautiful the restaurants on the property had good food and I feel in love with the Salvatore Ferragamo Tuscan Soul scent of products they use
The meat was cooked well but the flavor was lacking
It added some flavor to the meat but I felt Sriracha would've gone better with it
The food arrived quickly and looked good
The atmosphere is comforting and all the dishes I have tried are flavorful and satisfying
2% which could be my new favorite beer it is a unfiltered wheat bock amazingOne of the nice touches is that they have the proper beer glass to go with each beer they have on tap in the appropriate sizes and the largest karmeliet glass i have ever seen and they have a lot of imports on the list so they are doing great in the strong ale category - which is my favorite type of beerAs i was looking at the menu I asked if they had foie gras because i saw a picture on their facebook page and Mario told me they always have that as an off the item menu and it could be prepared however I would like it - which sounded great to meFoie Gras torchon with toast points honey comb apples cherries - also had a lemon tuille and some micro greens as wellThe honeycomb was a very nice touch because it got the sweetness however the bonus was the nice texture it added to the overall My friend ordered Heirloom Tomatoes and Gioia Burrata and i got a taste of that it was a great salad and had small bread sticks and fresh pesto on it as well very light and refreshing - just the thing after foie gras for my main i ordered the crispy half duck it was confit duck style the skin was very crispy and it was a huge portion - the duck was very good the crispy duck skin fat had lots of flavor with it - and i was happy to have confit again since i still dream of the chez dumonet duck i had in Paris this summer - my only change i would have made was the side items it was served with i would have liked dauphine potatoes - with that said it was the best duck i have had in AZ and i was happy it was not just seared duck breast My friends ordered the spinach Gnochi Black Tagliolini Mediterranean Sea BassI tried the Sea Bass which was was very good with the skin on crispy and crab on top the pasta dishes all looked amazing although i didnt get to try them i will certainly be trying them on my next visitrubee while i was there quite a few people ordered the crispy ribs - they looked great and everyone said they were deliciousSeems like there will be specials each day as well based on what looks good in the market everything coming out of the kitchen looked great - finally a place with an awesome beer list and delicious food - looking forward to seeing what they do with their cocktail list will certainly be back and it is nice they have parking
I'm begrudgingly giving Tomo 3 stars because their food is quite good
We ordered 2 appetizers gyoza and a spicy yellowtail roll 2 rolls spicy ninja and oyshi and a chirashi
It's UNACCEPTABLE for someone to order their rolls and get them after people ordering hot food like teriyaki
For the foodThe gyoza was delicious
The spicy yellowtail roll was very tasty and I would recommend it
The cuts of fish were excellent and the pickled vegetables were a nice addition
Many with closed minds will not give this place a shot after walking in but with one taste of the food they will know that the appearances of the surroundings is nothing compared to the food they serve
But then again when was the last time you ate amazing Vietnamese food at the Biltmore
For some carbs and goodness I tacked on 2 egg rolls - a delicious mix of pork and shrimp
Because not only will you using them mean less boxes in the old landfill your food won't dry out or pick up any other fridge flavors
The sauce served with the beef was very flavorful
I have been to different Arriba locations and the food has always been consistent and I have always had very good service here
The Chicken Chimayo is pretty good too
It's not the small plate happy hour it is the awesome wine specials it is the amazingly cozy bar downstairs it is the rotating mind-blowing fish specials it is or the prime rib it DEFINITELY is
Come here for*   Amazing sweet tea*   Crispy buttery texas toast*   Perfect Chicken fingers never dry or greasy*   The most awesome creamy peppery sauce that I could drink out of a cupThat's it
I never send food back I'm a good tipper and I'm friendly to servers
Desserts are tasty try the coconut ice cream is there's any left
Everything had an odd flavor like it wasn't quite real food
Overall the food was good and the atmosphere was nice
They've changed some of the dishes I love and now they're just not as good as they used to be
You gotta love a restaurant that cares about quality of food taste and presentation
The former location had more charm but this one is bigger and you don't have to wait as much The food is great and the owners are wonderful and friendly
If the food is that good I don't mind waiting
One glass of wine one appetizer and one roll = about $25 with tip
Let's get back to basics here - when you go to a restaurant although its great to have good service ambiance etc the real reason you go is for the food
The bottom line at Fuego Bistro - although service was very good and the place is really cool - is the food
Ok the Funghi mushroom pizza = amazing
2 stars for the torta dessert - not that goodAmbience and service are great
All the salads were fresh and tasty my favorite was the orange chicken salad
The hot bar was equally delicious with chicken pot pie soup clam chowder new england ham and cheese soup my favourite and sides such as buttermild biscuit and corn bread low-fat but I didn't find that out until after I tried it and it didn't taste low-fat to me at all
Anyway we really enjoyed our time there and hope to make this our go-to sushi place
Tons of raw meats very cold or frozen and tons of fresh veggies and sauces
Quick easy good for everyone-including kids there's pudding cheesecake apple juice california rolls etc rolling alongside the crunch rolls spicy yellowtail rainbow rolls spicy tuna philly rolls and tiger rolls
maybe my piece was too small to get a nice searing on the outside but without the jus it was a bland piece of meat without a good beefy taste
They also have stiff drinks in large amounts at reasonable prices great food and good enough service considering how busy they always are
You see hobbits love good food you can tell by their round bellies and lack of defined abs
The fried rice was good it had a few large chunks of beef but was a little skimpy on the chicken and shrimp
A little too much Cubs stuff for a South sider like myself but the food makes it all worth it
The citrus chicken and vegetarian nopalitos were very good
It tasted really good though and only decorum  and a wife that would have stabbed me for doing this prevented me from licking out the bowl The ginger dish that my partner had was very very  light in the ginger department but was pretty good otherwise and everything was as fresh as I've seen within the valley
However I do have to add a large amount of red pepper to this dish to have adequate flavor for me
We had a large group here and were served appetizer type food wings while people went off to play games
we both thoroughly enjoyed our respective dishes and took advantage of their 2 meals for $20 deal
the appetizer was 3 nicely cooked spring rolls that weren't greasy and perfectly cooked inside
tott's provided a great experience with great service and tasty food
Its solid not amazing blow your doors off have a religious experience kinda food its just a solid little place
I'd say the quality of the food is the same
5 stars so the food quality and service pushes it to 5
I think the fare is a bit too high priced for the quantity of food but the quality was outstanding and the service was excellent
Overall sushi was good and the atmosphere was nice for a date night
The food here is good but it's just not what I think of when I think gryos or Greek cuisine even though the menu is mostly that plus apps like hummus
It is a good choice if you are simply looking for something chickeny and in a pita which I am like 3 out of 5 days of the work week
It's nice to me that you can see the smoker working and the smoke flavor is present in the food and appetizing
I found the baby back ribs to be tasty but a little sparse on meat I should have gone with St
$28 for a rib-meat combo $3 for a soda and $4 for a lemonade make it a good destination for an occasional dinner but their competition in the valley are all under $20 for similar portions
If you are new to Indian food I recommend the Non-Veg Thaali
The cookies and other sweets were good I always like Mexican bakery food because it isn't so sweet you get grossed out
The Navajo chicken sandwich is SO GOOD
Their sashimi was pretty fresh and the rolls are tasty and wasn't drenched in heavy sauces I hate when places do that
As an appetizer we had the Chicken Satay
You'll definitely receive your money's worth for well-prepared fresh delicious food
Pizzas are FRESH  simple and loaded with flavor
Came here on a recommendation of a pizza nut who for the record is born raised and spent her entire life in New York so she knows her pizza
Had pizza with sausage cheese and arugula very good
Comfort food at it's best in a good old school urban energetic yet laid back family dining
The pricing on things are too high for me with the food that we received it wasn't worth the $$ we paid it was the I could make this at home and make it ten times more better looking and filling
I also don't know what's in the Tiger Roll but I was adventurous & it looked good and since it was on a $1
It wasn't that busy so there were a lot of empty spots on the conveyor and I never did get a Philadelphia rolls 'cause everyone else grabbed them but I definitely had a good time with friends & filled up on food I loved for $10
Overall I give it a thumbs down based on the taste and quality of the food alone
The pizza was above average not quite as good as the pizza back home in MA
The San Tan is a great place to grab a good beer and some good food
While the food was very good and the proportions were satisfying the service was not good
The food looked good too but we didn't partake
My husband and I both LOVE Thai food and since there seemed to be so many places in the area we went with the one closest to our hotel with the best rating
The food was excellent wonderful service and a decent price
I got the pad thai which was delicious and my husband had the Chee Choo seafood which was outstanding
I highly recommend this restaurant if you're in the area and hungry for some delicious Thai food full of mouth-watering flavors
The quality of the pizza tends to be somewhat inconsistent  and at times can be quite good while at other times we've received a soggy crust with toppings that look like the kitchen staff must have had a contest to see who could stand on the other side of the kitchen and toss the most ingredients onto the crust sadly most of them missed
What you should not pass up at YasuRed RollPremium Spicy Tuna Rollthe LambBacon wrapped ScallopsI am not big into lamb but this lamb is amazing
It is grilled food prepared over high end Japanese charcoal called binchotan
This place is expensive and you are not getting the service you should be due nor the quality of food you would expect for this kind of money
I had heard of this place as a foodie-favorite and I love supporting a local celeb-worthy chef
Overall I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the food was good; I wouldn't hesitate to go here for a business dinner or accept an invitation to go but I won't be picking it in the near future
I have never really had good service here but the good food makes me not mind as much
If you are looking for good food then I recommend it
The soup came out first and was hot and had lots of chunks of chicken in it
You can't get quality roast beef from any store today not even the high end grocery stores
The food in the dining area is good and the service is solid
I had the Chicken Nachos and they were DELICIOUS
I remember coming here when I was a kid and thinking the food was pretty good
If you're downtown and looking for great food I would highly recommend this place
As other people have mentioned the food is good enough but other than that
In general good location nice setting but just lame overpriced food
As for myself I usually have trouble deciding what I want and when I asked the waiter what he recommended he told me that one of the dishes I was debating on was actually his favorite so I ordered the papardelle with slow roasted pork sauce
The meat was also very tender and flavorful
The ribeye meat used was cooked perfectly with great flavors
The pastrami was a starter portion  which was fine and was NOT a good cut of meat
While our waiter did actually show up this time the food took forever and he brought out appetizers and meals at almost the same time
The seafood panang curry is amazingly good
their parilladas grill platters come with your choice of grilled meats on a hot bed of coals with guac radishes cucumbers onions salsa tomatoes and two kinds of beans on the side
He rolls his eyes and spends a good couple minutes pounding away on his keyboard a la the airline agent in Meet the Parents and finally gives me my new total sans late fee as if he's just done me the world's biggest favor
I am going so far as to write this review because the food that I had on a very regular basis at least twice a week was so consistently good
pork sliders with white bread buns that turn to paste in your mouth flash fried catfish fingers that are slightly soggy with an irregular aioli sauce and flavor buffalo wings that rank at the bottom of my list not to mention that six for $3
I love their Baja sauce - its like a cream cheese jalapeno juice concotion of blissfull deliciousness and this time I got the California burro which being from CA I thought would have Carne Asada and Fries but did not instead it was fillled with beans and guacamole sour cream cheese and pico on the side with an opt in of Chicken for a dollar more and it was so very good I would reccomend it highly
My friend ordered the Jamaican Jerk Chicken and it had great flavor as well
BUT the food was wonderful - everything done properly and nicely plated
The food was very good above-average fare
Again the food WAS very tasty but I would recommend this place for a first date or a special occasion because of the ambiance atmosphere and cost
I had the shrimp pizza and my friend enjoyed the chicken with pesto pizza
The meats were overall very tender I prefer ribs that are a tad bit more tender and the BBQ sauces were finger-licking good although the spicy version was not spicy
But take it to go because the ambiance of this restaurant doesn't quite stand up to the quality of its food
The food was good but if I remember correctly they had little to no draft beer
In short An inventive menu food that is obviously prepared with fresh ingredients instead of poured out of a can and flavor
The food doesn't come on a plate swimming in liquid with bad refried beans and standard flavorless rice jostling for space with the entree inevitably doused in canned enchilada sauce
I had the chilaquiles with vegetables and was impressed with the big chunky pieces of veggies and the huge flavor of the dish
The pride Sal has for his restaurant is evident through the quality of the food friendliness of the service and cleanliness of the restaurant
This place was closest to my hotel but I almost skipped it for a taco bar place because of these reviews about the food and salsa
From the star of the well spiced and seared ahi that was plentiful the in house soft toasted white roll spiced mayo and cabbage it was a divine mix of flavors and texture
The closest in quality for me is the pressed chicken herb chicken and vegi melt
The food was good but in quality and quantity
Excellent food delicately prepared and presented with class in a gorgeous setting
Food came out fast - cooked to order and nice and hot
My wife enjoys the catfish but I think its lacking flavor however they fry it to a cripy golden brown crust
I had heard this was a great little place long before it was visited by the Food Network's Diners and Dives but I think perhaps the publicity while perhaps has brought in more business has done a number to the food quality and especially the service
THANK GOD I'm not a real vegetarian even though I say I am I eat seafood and will try meat when I feel the quality of meat is on par with excellence at restaurants worthy of my money
#1 - If the food had been hot I would have been significantly more satisfied but it seems that they finish cooking  when it gets to slightly warm which made it less satisfying
Both are passionate about good food and have the skills to ensure a consistently fine product
I should have ordered a bucket of jade red chicken because that stuff is amazing
The chicken and vegetables in the dish were fresh and tasty not over or under-cooked
Also it's important to note that this restaurant's title in Yelp is confusing -- they started as a catering company and the food was so amazing that they opened a little takeout marketplace
You ring a bell for service you order food and beverages that are inline with the amusement park decor in price and quality
Dishes that I have particularly enjoyed though are the Italian Grinder sandwich and the pretzel fondue which i love love love
The ravioli was simply a square dry cheese stick the steak skewer also dry was cold and the southwest egg rolls were hit or miss as some of them were mostly wrap while others had adequate filling
-FOOD We ordered the DEVILED EGGS as an appetizer
I I was very surprised at the quality of the food and the taste
The vegetables were fresh and crisp and chicken dry yet tasty
The biggest negative about this location is the food court hot dogs they are not Hebrew national
We ordered drinks appetizers and desserts READ - $$$ - and yet all our server was looking at were the more expensive LOOKING tables
I thought the food was fabulous and the service was pretty good
I have to say that the waitress was very helpful and the food was pretty good again I am not used to Ethiopian food
I ordered the beef tacos and those things were GOOD
Then after that they would examine their pieces of meat and it appeared like they were picking it apart or something and then devouring whatever they thought looked good
It took forever to get our food and when it arrived my husbands hash browns were cold and loaded with onions
The food is what matters and the food was good but not great
I can't remember how good it was back in the Our Gang days that was like nine years ago but the food now is hit and miss
I had the seafood manicotti see my uploaded picture which we both agreed was blameless and wonderful
For the entree I had the Seafood Hot Pot which is full of Shrimp scallops clams and calamari with tomatoes and sliced fresh mushrooms in a hot and sour lemon grass broth
Desserts were good Caesar salad dressing was very very anchovy salty and I LOVE anchovies
Good coffee great homemade pastries and food desks to study comfy chairs to relax in open and airy atmosphere friendly employees clean bathrooms indoor and outdoor seating spacious parking lot great music playing and a huge tv with sports
Good job but it isn't hard to toss a hunk of meat on a grill
I have been hard pressed to find good food here
The salad bar was unbelievably stocked with delicious things several kinds of delicious cheeses cured meats and veggies
This is how meat should always be served one hot mouthwatering piece at a time
We're recent NYC transplants so good food is on our minds
We started with the fish cakes which were some of the best I have had the six of them were rich and complex in flavor and great sauce
We also split a dessert that was equally delicious but I don't remember exactly what it was
The food was masterfully prepared and I enjoyed my entire visit
I'm glad to see that business seems to be good for this little restaurant with organic food
Not the most amazing burger I have ever had but when I can grab bar food of that quality at 1030pm and spend less then $30 for 2 people I can't complain
Service and food is always pretty hit and miss but we kept coming back because when it was good it was good
A little later she brings out a new dish that had the tacos so cold that the cheese was not even melted barely any meat on it and the guacamole and pico de gallo on the side
I have always enjoyed the chicken piccata and chicken marsala
The service was great and we enjoyed the outdoor patio very much but the sushi itself - blah
They offer a refreshing alternative for hotel restaurants with lively ambiance and great food and drink
A good sized meal for two sans drinks could ring up at $30-35 which is a good value for great food
The atmosphere is trendy and fun there are a ton of drink options and the food is quite good
I was nervous that the squash would be too sweet but the flavors ended up working very well together and it was a satisfying savory dish
This is the only vegetarian entree but I don't think vegetarians suffer with this delicious dish
I hate coffee flavored desserts and thankfully this one didn't taste a thing like espresso
The place was still pretty packed and for good reason the pizza is delicious
The juices are perfect to clean your palate from the rich flavors of the food
I prefer the quality of the food here to the greasy food elsewhere
i never imagined creamed sweet corn to be such an amazing side dish - but it was so creamy and it did reset my palate after a few bites of filet
I found myself thoroughly enjoying the suite the room and the hotel look like the '60's but with HDTV iPod plugs decent tubs good cell phone reception double headed showers and really comfortable bedsI found myself wishing for the return of fins on my car and car hops on roller skates along with $
Who needs dessert when the mac and cheese is that good
La's is reasonably priced you mos likely won't have to wait a century for a table and the food is generously portioned and actually tastes good
They also offer a Mongolian BBQ area some items that you'd find at Panda Express soups a dessert area and some tubs of ice cream including a Green Tea flavor
Food is good and had more than one person wait on us which was pretty cool considering we weren't the only ones there
I've had the monkey burn their meatball app and a super delicious salmon dish among others and everything was great
The service was great the food was excellent - now I know why it is always packed now
Had the Crispy Chicken and spinach salad which was really good
But as the other reviewers noted the meat tastes so good you may not even want any sauce
50 eachThe best cupcake or even the best dessert I have had prior was amazingly 1
The food has lost some of its luster slightly dry and uninteresting to the palate save the calamari which was still quite good
A chain that is consistent always does well when their food is great in quality
This is a wonderful place to eat with good food a good atmosphere good service and great desserts
If I recall correctly the bill was around $200 for a party of about 30 with food alcohol appetizers and desserts
Dang this is breakfast lunch or dinner food and so good
Food is nothing special either a clearly inferior option to Pei Wei across the street in both quality and service
But the food was good enough soooo 4 stars
Just go and taste it for yourselfBecause I live close by I prefer to take my tacos home because the space is very small and because the food is so good it can get quite cramped in no time
Delux is a trendy place but the food is pretty good
I think even a restaurant housed in a sardine can would fare well if people really feel the food is worthwhile
This is one of those chains I make an exception for because they are reasonable have good food and are pretty consistant
So my one star meal was balanced my what seemed like good food at the rest of my table and good service= three stars
Their entrees will blow you away and their appetizers are simple comfort foods that any picky eater will love
Despite having a few guilt inducing items on the menu they do have a nice selection of meats salads and sides that are healthy and made with quality ingredients
Their horchata is also quite tasty and it's a nice compliment to the dishes with the red sauce
We did that but we didn't even come close to eating $20 worth of food
First - the not so good stuff The orange chicken was gummy as though it had never been crisp or if it had it soaked in the sauce for way too long
The grilled fish taco was really really good as well
The fried chicken was definitely crispy so that's good
The cut of the beef is a little thicker than the usual Salazar's or Filiberto's burrito but it was really good regardless
oh yeah i tried the pesto pizza once before and wasnt too impressed
I do recommend the Boulders for a nice short getaway great rooms food and service and at reasonable prices
Also for dinner if you're more of a chicken person the roasted chicken dijon is very good and the parmesan bread crust on top of it is to die for
I thought the food was very inconsistent but our server was excellent
Go here if you want interesting food and really good creme brulee
Inside is a bit different and overall I'd say this place is a bit too pricey but it's a nice time and the food is quite good
Pricey but the food is very good and unique
I would probably give this place a second shot but only because the food was so yummy
I like Pita Jungle I really do lots of good food good service
Food is always good love their pancakes and a lot of menu items to choose from
I enjoyed my blackened chicken however the chicken wasn't really 'blackened'- it was just kinda grilled lol
I ordered the spicy tonkatsu soup with chicken for lunch one day this week - it came out piping hot and in a huge bowl
Either way the food is worth trying but believe them when they warn you about the heat and the atmosphere is comfortable
50 is pricey for lunch dessert but the quality and presentation is there so I will continue to be a happy customer and order the cake
Pho is one of my meat-weaknesses and I can't express how happy it makes me to find a delicious veggie pho
I ordered a medium rare steak and my girl ordered chicken tempura we both were extremely pleased steak is how I grade restaurants and my steak was cooked correctly and meat was of good quality with a very nice sake list so good rating from me
Our food was tasty and our service was great I had the sirloin & fries - when I ordered it they told me I could get other steak on the menu too if I wanted
They are a delicious & refreshing way to get your tequila food group
The tacos are delicious & my favorite are the fish & carne asada
Great outside sitting area good food too
Pizza is good sandwiches are creatively put together
Last night we went for Happy Hour before heading over to see a movie had the Margareta pizza half off on Happy Hour special it was delicious
I had a baked potato with chicken and broccoli which was smothered in cheese and my brother had a chili cheese burger those skinny fries are sooo good
I still wasn't crazy about the food but both of us couldn't stop talking about how amazing the shakes were
The pizza to me is really only so-so but when all you want is some kind of delicious greasy feast this place will seem like the best pizza you've ever eaten
You'll be enjoying that folded slice of delicious greasy NY pizza in no time
My mom got chicken with snow peas which was very good and I had wonton soup which was pretty bland
The sweet and sour chicken is still the BF's favorite and the service is still very good
The food is good the service is mediocre
The hotel justifies charging you $15/night by providing parking internet pool & gym access free food and wine and bottled water
A truly lovely dish to gaze at and even more wonderful to taste
Really enjoyed the meaty tuna chunks which tasted fresh-from-the-sea and not fishy at all
Again the orzo added great texture contrast to the meaty fish-- I enjoyed this dish so much I had the leftovers for breakfast the next day
For dessert I had the caramel creme brulee - very tasty
Baked seafood enchiladas were more like canned tuna quality
The food is tasty just not what you'd expect from a bar and grill
Pretty big store front bigger than most of the Whole Foods I've patronized back home and a good selection of food that doesn't seem over-the-top granola-y
All of their food is delicious but my personal favorite combo is the Chicken pine nut tomato & Gorgonzola salad with the wild mushroom and truffled arugula pizza split between friends
This is a good place to hang out over a couple of pints while the food comes second
Friday lunch special is fish tacos and they are absolutely wonderful
I usually think it's a good sign when I am the only white person in an ethnic food restaurant
I had and loved the chicken dish my last visit so I went with the spinach and mushroom quesadilla which was wonderfully simple and delicious with a fresh and tasty salad on the side
Next time we come to Sam's we will hopefully have more time for appetizer and dessert
I think I'll have to try the pizza next time because it looked amazing
My first thought when I came here was I hope the food is worth the wait
I am pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food considering they have a drive through
We enjoyed delicious food all of us ordering extremely different items
From the food counter where you order and see your food prepared to where it is handed off and they put whatever you want on your hot dog sauerkraut mustard relish onions etc
This is a really good idea and you get a little free food
I really like this combo it has a little spice in the quesadilla the beans and the rice and a wonderful cooling ginger in the emerald chicken that really compliments the rest of the dish
Cider for the gf Bell's Two Hearted Ale draft for me that alone is worth about 3 or 4 stars in my world and we split a build your own pizza
The quality and freshness of the fish is top notch
The fish was neatly presented and they even deep fried the leftover bones and head which was 100% edible and super tasty in the vinegar sauce
The food was just meh not terrible by any means but not good or memorable in any way
It was very acidic and tasted not good which kind of put a damper on the whole thing as it covered all of the food
Rolls are of a great quality and there are some rather unusual and pleasantly different ones there
As in previous experiences the food was excellent
You get so much for the price and the food is fresh and delicious
Good amount of green onion white onion and cilantro already in the bowl and the meat was still pink when it came to the table
i have never ever tasted corned beef that was good
Half-priced margaritas make even the most mediocre Mexican food amazing and thankfully Blanco's food was very good to begin with
The Bruchetta was dry and the waiter called me a liar about my response to having a dish before stating we just added that 3 weeks ago  I don't know I just never got the right vibe from him and our service took over 2 hours and we didn't have a good time with our waiter
They have a good selection of wine & beer and the food is pretty tasty and reasonably priced too
Lots of TVs good atmosphere good food never overly busy to accomodate a group
Their food is pretty good and drink prices are fair
Bad things They've changed their menu a little bit so some things aren't included in happy hour appetizers anymore- throw some chicken tenders or something in there please
The Lobster mashed potatoes are just as delicious as they sound and are filled with butter garlic and plenty of Lobster meat
The food is delicious the atmosphere is cozy and the staff is friendly and helpful
We ordered a pitcher of Sangria and shared a Complimenti alla Mamma pizza which was thin crusted and flavorful
I am a big fan of Ricotta cheese and the meats were quality also
Me and the bf have decided we are going to come back here just to have friends try the dessert it's amazing
The meats were tasty but they cook them without sauce
I know carne asada fries isn't real Mexican food but man I wish they had it on the menu I could only imagine how tasty El Rico's can make it and did I mention their sauce is perfect
Oregano's use to be my favorite place  but the last few times I have been there food  service is not very good I think oregano's need to focus on good customer service and food quality control
I'll have to check it out and throw on a homemade cinnamon roll just for good measure
I was happily surprised that is was flavorful not over/undercooked and tasted quite fresh for seafood in the desert
We ended up sharing both and I must say that while the fish was good the scallops were better
I don't eat meat so I also appreciate that Genghis always has Shrimp Calamari Scallops Marinated White Fish and Krab Imitation for me to choose from  They have a very wide selection of veggies and fruits lots of seasons for spicing- and an delicious choice of sauces
I have tried their BBQ Chicken and Fire Hot Chicken meals and it tastes good initially probably because it's dripping in fat but made my stomach turn a few hours later
This place is reasonably priced and has excellent food
Their happy hour food is reasonably priced I recommend the Sliders
Well the problem is that there are several different menus including specials sandwiches and hot foods
I didnt even know about the hot foods until I saw the chef plating up one of the juiciest looking chickens
LGO has a good variety of food and for a good price
Their Lotus on Fire Roll is my absolute favorite and the flavor is right and fresh is fish
However they have a larger menu are slightly more expensive but WORTH it and don't take as long to make your food
I'm not cheap but I think that's pretty steep even if the food and service were very good not spectacular but very good
My brother got the chicken panini which was good but if your going to go there get a burger
At this one I ordered the special Blue Moon and boy the slab of Tuna on the rolls look delicious; and it was - Yum
I wasn't too impressed with the Tootsie Roll but I can't complain
I was not near as impressed as the other Yelp reviewers with this particular dish
The combination of the great service the owners seemed like lovely people and the QUALITY food waffle fries + perfect hot dog make me wish that there were an Uncle Al's in California
10 minutes later our food arrives popping hot
The wings were also a good size with a nice amount of meat on 'em but not too big
I ordered the Oreganos fav Jr salad and the sausage pesto pizza I did however manage to convince myself that I was too fat for a pizzookiethough I don't recommend you talk yourself out of it
However I would come back again because the food was really good
The food was very pricey but the shrimp was tasty
You need to eat as you go otherwise the food gets cold
They brought the rice too early and it sat there getting cold while the chef was cooking the meats
That hilarious story aside the food is pretty good and reasonably priced
at this point it's worth going just to chill and soak up good music even without considering the food
for lunch they have hot and cold pizza-bread sandwiches crepes and salads
We had the brisket plate and the meat had such a wonderful flavor and texture
The sushi was pretty good and the drinks were good
I asked for two refills of my hot tea the cups were pretty small and she rolled her eyes and started gossiping to another server about it
The sushi chefs were friendly at the least and the sushi wasn't the best i've had but good
i had the valentine roll nothing too special but good
The food always comes out in a short time and is always served hot
When baja fresh first opened it was pretty much the only quick Mexican food chain game in town and I thought it was good
First the food is more expensive than chipotle but not higher quality
I know you can custom order a burrito but it is not the same thing as seeing your food deliciously constructed before your eyes and being asked about each tasty new addition
Other than the onions that I fished most of out this was DELICIOUS
Then we moved on to appetizers because while getting drunk is fun I was really excited for the food
My thai peanut bowl was good the mock meat has a great texture the sauce was strong but not overpowering and the noodles were cooked well
we had a carne asada burrito as well and the meat was tasty
I order this dish ever time I go there because it is just that good
I ordered the chicken and shrimp Kung Pao extra hot and spicy
I never ever EVER leave food on my plate but this just wasn't worth eating much of it
This dish was tasty and had a TON of gyro meat in it
Unfortunately the gyro meat was the same as I remembered it last time -- good but not the best I've ever had
Both nights we started off with the seafood tower- wow just amazing seafood- shrimp lobster oysters and amazing atomic cocktail sauce
The food was just amazing and i am so excited that Mastros is coming to Chicago later this year
the customer service is friendly and quality of food is consistent
appalling food unfit for human consumption food here while cheap is utterly disgusting while I am used to spicy food and love mexican food and dislike the food provided by certain chains the food here was the worst I have ever come across the flavors were uniquely revolting and the food so hot no one in my family was able to really taste the food
I really liked the crazy beef salad the flavor was great
I would recommend this for date night special occasion or just a fun night out with some very good food and great service
com/28jxx76I was drivin' by when it caught my eyeStandin' by itself lookin' sweet and shyI turned in to the lot swaying' to and froAnd soon I knew I'd never let them goBlame it on the Bosa Donut with its tasty treatsBlame it on the Bosa Donut that I love to eatOh it all began with a maple barNow it seems I can't fit in my carBlame it on the Bosa DonutThe food of loveNow was it the pie
I never have a problem with the quality of the food here
Very delicious food and priced very appropriately
The first time we were in our server referred to the restaurant as a spring roll bar and all of the spring rolls we have tried have been very good
The shaking beef might be the most expensive thing on the menu at $15 but it also might be the most delicious thing I've ever eaten
The food is delicious and the people are very nice
Two years after visiting this restaurant I still remember what we ordered and how we enjoyed the food and atmosphere
healthy and tasty food good selection and the no-guilt feeling afterwards
Every once in a while you just need some good Indian food to spice things up
If you aren't used to Indian or spicy food I would order medium-mild so you can enjoy the flavors before you decide to kick it up a notch
Oh delicious Chinese food I can't even begin to express my adoration for you
Viet food you're so delightful and flavorful
Seriously food is good drinks are strong and reasonably priced and usually they have a scary ass clown lady that will paint the mexican faces white and the white faces Mexican
So far Aunt Chiladas has the best Margaritas I've had in the valley and we've been to quite a few places including Tee Pee where the food is good but the Margaritas suck
The meat on the burger is good but i have better many times before and the fries are ok
Unlike a prior reviewer I have never had food quality problems here
we had a foodie event that was way discounted so we were drinkin up the free mojitos and partaking in delicious appetizers
My folks wanted to order sushi so I let them and sure enough the rolls they ordered as well as my sashimi selections were just not very good
The dessert Thairamisu was excellent and unique
The Massaman was really good it just had too much chicken and not enough vegetables
My husband had the pork dish and it was pretty delicious
Dessert was a Neapolitan dish and it was fairly good
Just enough heat for my tastes yet  not too spicy to overwhelm the actual great flavors of the dish
I recommend ordering a side of Sopapillas with honey on the side to eat with your dish
Delicious food great service wide variety of options on the menu
It's definitely not the fanciest place but delicious authentic flavorful loving food and this place will definitely become a regular for us
The quality of the ingredients makes the thought of eating pizza anywhere else unappealing
My wife and I are completely satisfied sharing one $13 pizza although we recommend going with friends to expand the variety
When I saw a sushi joint a minute away from the office I had to give it a shot
- The food simply isn't as good as the original location
And I don't care HOW good your food is nothing warrents such rudeness to a PAYING customer
Our orders came in huge bowls filled with steaming hot liquid meat and veggies with a side of a few bean sprouts a lemon wedge and some basil leaves and of course Hoisin sauce and hot sauce
It is a pretty small place so it can definitely be a little crowded but it's a cute little place with good sushi
The pizza is cold very little toppings and the wings are soggy and not very flavorful at all
The service is always good and the pizza is always the same  AMAZING
If you were to ask me about the food I would say it is good but my grandmother cooked better -
She said it was good as she is used to South Indian food
The atmosphere is more like a fast food or cafeteria but the food is good
I was surprised when we were seated and immediately served bread with chicken liver pate - not as good as my mom's hi Mom
For $50 you had a choice of appetizer entree side and dessert
AND we were also served espresso petit fours that were so good we really didn't need dessert after one of those
I have been on a quest for good Mexican ever since I relocated to AZ and for the most part what I have found is mediocre food at best
The foodMy friend and I ordered Taco's a Quesadilla and the Del Rey Torta all of which were wonderful
While my party was seated almost immediately service from that point forward was substandard but the food made the wait for service worth it
Also they put the wiz on the bun and on top so there is good cheese to meat ratio happening
I honestly have no idea what has happened to the food but it was just not good
The food and drinks are good and decently priced for downtown
This is a very cute high end grocery and the desserts are so good I almost dropped dead
But I would recommend it to anyone who wants good food & speedy service
The menu is unique the food is high quality the prices are right the ambiance is cool and laid back and the employees/owners are super friendly and genuinely happy to have you there
But the 3 most important things to me in a restaurant are the quality of the food the value for the price and the service
The fish had no flavor at all as it hadn't been seasoned
It's delicious so it's probably worth it but some days a slightly cheaper meal elsewhere that comes with more food may be more appreciated
My husband got the pasta and added chicken and it was delicious
The food was good but the beer was better
The wonderful place combines two fantastic food genres and makes them fantasticer by combining them
Slow Service    Cold food    Incorrect orders    If you like hot tea
I will be back as its the only place around there with good food that's open late at night
Chicken was great flavorful and juicy but not too salty and the waffles crispy and tasty - cooked just right
She raved about her food and enjoyed the brown rice option
His chicken was good in my opinion but he wasn't a fan of the sauce which was a dijon mustard sauce
Clearly the specialty is the delicious tartes so I would come back and have dessert and coffee and be a happy lady
After spending 2 months in Italy and eating as much food as one person possibly could I know good Italian food
The lasagna is huge and quite good as are the regular specials of Zuppe de Pesche a huge platter of seafood over linguini and the Veal Sorentino a wonderfully tasty dish of waffer-thin veal and eggplant with cheese and a delightful mushroom sauce
Husband had the eggplant and butternut squash dish it's so nice to have 2 different flavors on your dish rather than JUST the butternut squash that would have been too rich
If good food excellent service and bartenders that mix drinks strong enough to knock a bull elephant to it's knees aren't enough for you then perhaps all these and the lure of a mechanical bull will do the trick
The selection will definitely appeal to the man's man with a variety of bar appetizers and entrees including beef pulled pork sandwiches burgers chicken and some fish
It was awesome pizza and that iceberg salad was excellent
The food is out of control good - unique and very interesting - always
I agree with the consensus that their Kung Pao Soy Chicken is really good
I recommend the Carnitas and the Jerk Chicken
I loved the atmosphere the pizza was delicious nice crispy crust with a wood fired flavor premium toppings and service was great
Immediate friendly service good food great prices
They are very good and so is the chicken but I have recently discovered Stacy's superior version
I recommend either the Tuna Sandwich made of white beans/tuna/light olive oil on flat bread or the Curry Chicken
The food was creative gorgeously presented and delicious to the last bite
To start with the packaged food that lines the aisles is generally pricier than a standard grocery store but lower quality than a gourmet or specialty one
Things like tzatziki hummus tuna salad crab cakes sandwiches or pasta dishes are well worth getting
But it's real sushi with an emphasis on good rice and fresh ingredients
Thai House is a great place to grab some reliably delicious Thai food at great prices
when they ask how hot you want your food on scale of 1-5
Take the Carne Asada Tacos $10 for example; the beef is prime and extremely tender though the real difference is the use of pesto mayo salsa fresca shredded cabbage and penela cheese for an interesting play on flavors
I've had the ruby trout the chicken sandwich turkey burger chicken enchilada green chile barbacoa enchiladas five cheese macaroni and achiote chicken- which is worth every calorie but don't order this often
We're talking amazing food at amazingly low prices
While it's known for it's pizza which is fabulous I have to recommend the Pablo Picasso Salad
We rolled up at happy hour which is a really good deal
We had the crispy french fries and chicken drumettes for appetizers
The crust is very good and I thought the pizza was really creative and delicious
They gave us tons of water to calm our sweltering hearts and served us amazing food
To start a pizza crust cut up served with a cold onion bruschetta the best i can describe it was very good but I could not eat a lot of it however the wife loved it
Of course I believe that in a good BBQ the meat can stand on its own and you shouldn't have to dredge it in sauce to enjoy it
The limited meat was not even worth trying to eat despite the three table sauces expertly blended to perfection waiting nearby
For sure the place had some fine appetizers and the desserts looked absolutely divine but we were done before we even got to them and the check was already too high to consider salvaging the meal with a one pound apple pie slice
Real good Mexican food   My dad and I went there for dinner this evening spurred on by the reviews right here on yelp
On top of all of this I feel that the quality of the food is deteriorating
The food is consistently excellent and the service is pretty fast
I absolutely love their pizza and their appetizers are also delicious
I am not a huge Italian food fan but love food so I anot going to back down from a good meal
I've been here once before and remembered the food as being very good
Food ~ The fry bread and red chili beef stew was very good and I would get it again
The red chili stew was pipping hot with a very good balance of seasoning that wasn't too spicy and it had a good balance of meat to broth
Both were very good however I should have eaten the taco first before my stew because the meat beens and yummy goodness inside the taco was too much for the fry bread to hold up to
Over all the food was good enough I would stop in again if I was in the area over the other options for a burger at that intersection
The people there are always friendly and have excellent dog park etiquette ie picking poop up controlling unruly pets NOT bringing in food - so dumb btw
I didn't say the best pizza anywhere I'm from NY so I know there are great places there but for east valley Arizona grub this is really really good
For dessert we had the chocolate souffle cake which like all chocolate souffle cakes was delicious
The second trip we both had the Beef Tacos and enjoyed themThe service was a bit slow however it was worth it
*Agua fresca of the day w/ or w/o vodka*Picoso tequila pineapple and jalapeno *Micheladas make 'em bloody for a great hangover cure*Bloody Marys they make them with dill for an unexpected but fresh twist*Elote Mexican corn with cotija cheese and cream *Shrimp tacos amazing juicy shrimp *Chilaquiles the sauce used to have chicken but they now offer a vegetarian version*Chopped saladOne other awesome bonus is that the bar will wrap up food to go if you'd like to take up to the roof
I got their delicious chips and salsa along with 2 shrimp tacos 2 fish tacos and 2 carve Asada tacos
I went back here last night for their awesome all day Tuesday happy hour with my BFF and we got the corn on the cob thing with paprika which was recommended to us by our super awesome waitress and I got 2 fish tacos and a carne Asada taco
The food is so good here & I wanted to cover all of the different feasts they put out
Then it was on to a big make-it-yourself salad & I enjoyed it with various meats hearts of palm real bacon bits & topped with their great Citrus Dressing
On my way to the hot food I couldn't resist first grabbing a Mini Buffalo Chicken Sandwich
Today's hot food included great Pot Roast Horseradish Mashed Potatoes I don't usually care for horseradish but this was great
Lots of tempting desserts await you here but all I had room for this time was some Tiramisu which was amazing of course because Marston's Cafe is ALWAYS 5-Stars
--excellent yellowtail tells me the potential is there perhaps i have to be a regular to get the good stuff because# ikura made me want to vomit# tuna salmon sashimi fishy not fresh this is why people don't like sushi
'cause they haven't had good fresh fish# masago not fresh# Tamago not tightly folded seaweed wrapper not crispy and dryif only i could have had more pieces like that yellowtail
The food here is hearty filling and tasty Italian cuisine
Delicious comfort food with a gourmet twist on all the classic favorites that makes it feel upscale
White's the chicken is amazing but the can't miss item to me is the waffles
I really didn't think I'd find a place that makes Hooters' food seem good
The chicken had some seasoning on it but not enough flavor to discern whether or not it was Cajun spices or colored talcum powder
Maybe someone could put that shtick in a restaurant and actually make food worth eating
I've had good bar food all over this country
For me this is good Italian food but in the American way
While on a business trip to Florence and friend recommended 2 Mexican food restaurants in Florence
He did a good job of explaining their best dishes and so we were excited about the prospects
We placed our order which included a couple of appetizers and 4 main dishes
Our appetizers included Chicken lollipops which were good and shrimp wanton which were very good
In summary this restaurant has a lot of potential with the food being reasonably good in a nice place
No need to pound braise or goat cheese-stuff this bird when you start with such a quality chicken
And you can taste it in the quality of the food
She is very proud of the quality and authenticity of her food
I always enjoyed the food and experience at the owner's old Lucky Dragon even back when it was on University
I'm hoping that the foul flavor and aroma was the result of some slightly-off fish sauce rather than some slightly-off shrimp
The food isn't good enough and the experience isn't good enough
The plus is they have several different foods tacos and your basic professional sporting event junk food-plus roasted pecans you'll be able to smell the cinnamon before you actually find the nuts-smells delicious
The chicken fries toast and cole slaw are always good
The food was reasonably good but not good enough to prompt us to return
This place is definitely worth trying and you will love the food
I also feel like I made a good healthy decision by eating here instead of fast food however my order only took about 10 minutes to make so still pretty damn fast
I am giving them 4 stars for right now as I have only tried one dish but so far I'm impressed
My Italian sub was DELICIOUS as was Hubby's meatball sub
The pretzels garlic parmesan were not really pretzels; really pizza dough shaped into pretzels but they tasted good with the marinara dipping sauce
We enjoyed the wonderful ribs 'n chicken fried cactus yummy
I was prepared to wait a while especially after hearing how good the food was here
The food was fresh and still piping hot by the time I got back to my desk at work
Basically what Im getting at is this is beyond words delicious classic LEGIT Italian pizza
1 Spanakopita2 Meditteranean Platter3 Chicken shawarma1 Not bad2 Pretty good3 TerribleThe chicken shawarma was NOT a chicken shawarma
The food is good but for what you pay it should be more than good
The food while eating there is delicious but I would also suggest having them set you up with a Pizza Kit so you can make authentic Italian pizza at home
We got the butterfish crudo which was really good
The tomato was a little strong compared to the subtlety of the dish but overall good pairing
A lot of places are putting desserts in jars its fun but I think the vessel led to the idea of deconstructing this conventional dessert which brought attention to each component which could have been good but didn't work out that way
Overall really good restaurant really good food pricing staff service etc
Maybe naked sushi These guys get fresh fish in the desert and they make it look GOOD and keep it smelling good too
I only had a chance to have a burger for food but if it is any indicator of the rest of the food they make their food is delicious and a steal for the price
The food was good as before although I feel there has been serious biscuit  shrinkage
The vegetable egg scramble is delicious and the cinnamon roll was fab
I used to love Pho Dalat when they served fuller bowls of cold rice noodles with oodles of grilled meat and peanut seasoning complimented with crunchy salad greens and tangy fish sauce
I sincerely wish that this restaurant finds its footing once again because it has always had quite a few things going for it like good quality food quick service and some great ambiance
Ranch style whole beans but in a salsa base with a smoky meat flavor
Both visits were pleasant and the food was delicious
I found the food to be tasty and interesting but not wonderful
Again I had some food that was interesting but not wonderful
Delicious healthy food that is not to expensive
I had them put the red pepper hummus instead of the regular and it was sooo delicious and the perfect amount of food
Friendly owner that serves good Thai food in a clean restaurant
The hotness was dead on I ordered hot not thai hot and my dish was just right
The food had good flavor and didn't let me down
Though the food was good the service was horrible
Good rolls were the Surfer Roll and the Damn Good Roll
This place is great for out of the ordinary food items and they have a good selection of wine
They have a little bakery section with absolutely amazing desserts
I just wish this place wasn't so pricey but sometimes it is worth the splurge for the high end food and classy atmosphere
The food at the C4 restaurant below is absolutely worth checking out try the chop salad
Whatever you've read before about at least the food is good is gone
it's not on the menu but it is a simple roll I like to order to see the quality of fish before I order a more elaborate roll
Here is what I liked*The food appetizers pasta dishes and warm bread and the tomato/bruschetta like topping they give you with it
*Value prices are in line with what I would expect to pay for the quality and type of food you get
I cannot begin to describe the symphony of flavors that Charleen has created in this trout dish just try it
But you're better off going elsewhere if you want good Chinese food
Had dinner here with my bf's family and I really enjoyed the food
We ordered the shrimp dumplings as our appetizer I ordered the salmon open-faced sandwich and he ordered a curry dish with shrimp
My food was good but not something that merits an excellent rating
I reserve rave reviews for food that is creative and tasty
The only thing that salvaged the service                        grade to above a failure was the manager's quick actionFood       B-  it's good but nothing to write home about
My lady threw down the Fez burger order this one and I got the tan tan chicken  pretty good
Solid block of angus beef a whole bunch of other medierranne goodness side of harissa fries and a saturday brewski
Amazing cheese / meat ratio on a triple burger
However I was not really impressed with the food
This is a good local place that fills a gaping hole for good takeout in the area with some dishes that are very hit or miss
The beef chow fun is good with excellent flavor and tender beef even though it is quite greasy and salty the firecracker shrimp is good and if you are looking for a hit of sweet tang the tangine beef is a better bet than the orange chicken
They seem to do beef dishes better than chicken or shrimp as a whole and the garlic shrimp was a real let down with a ton of vegetables in a soupy fairly flavorless brown sauce
We started off with a California roll & artichoke for appetizers
We weren't too impressed with either but ate most of it the roll was a gigantic piece of sushi packed with rice should have taken a picture so it was not the kind of roll you pick up with chop sticks
Then I ordered the chicken enchilada stack and it was pretty good and I had a cup of the white chicken tortilla soup and that was the best I have ever had
I'm originally from Southern California where good authentic Chinese food is easily found
The drinks and food were all super good and the lanes were so classy
For those of you not looking to eat sushi the rest of their menu is excellent
I was hesitant since coming from bay area we have really good dim sum in the area but nevertheless Maryland girl was craving some chinese food hence dim sum was it
suprisingly the food was fresh tasty and decently priced
To sum it up delicious food with a gorgeous ambiance
The food is wonderful and the menu changes frequently
The Ahi and the Asian Pear Salad are amazing their quiches are delicious and every meat selection I have tried there has been well aged an cooked to perfection
I honestly didn't think that really good innovative food existed in this city and having been disappointed by the quality of Mexican food here I found Gallo Blanco to be a wonderful surprise
Delivery only took about 20-25 mins and the food was still hot when we got it
I wouldn't necessarily say it was the best Chinese food I have had but it was good
The Kung Pao Chicken had a good bite to it and the kids loved the Honey Chicken
Also the Egg Rolls were not as good as I hoped they would be
Second off the menu is full of wonderful food selections and it's really not that expensive most items for under $10 including a damn good bacon cheeseburger
The food is EXCELLENT and our server Brandon is hands down the most pleasant waiter we've ever had in a long time
The food here is solid the drink menu is pretty decent the ambiance is nice menu is good service is eh
I've gotten food poisoning at Wendy's in my home town so when i tried this place in Phoenix it was pretty good and didn't make me sick
Unless you haven't eaten in days I would recommend sticking to the single bowl since that is more than enough food for one person
As for the food and any menu recommendations I like the Red Pepper Hummus Gambas Con Ajo 5 shrimp loads of garlic and tomato
The busy part is probably a good thing though because that means their food drinks and service are always awesome so people come back for more
The restaurant at the hotel had very good food overall we had the vegetarian Pasta Provencal twice and was decently priced
For appetizer we had the chicken and shrimp romain lettace wraps which were good
He gladly gave recommendations to my friends who hadn't tried Cambodian food before
The food came out quickly and was fresh and flavorful
I felt that my chicken was a bit cold and I felt awkward about asking for it to be warmer
Again both of these could have been resolved easily but I honestly felt a little awkward and overwhelmed by the owner and his going on about restaurants and patrons that don't know good food
Hanny's would be a lot of fun for drinks music and people watching and while the food was good I don't think we'll be doing dinner again based on the service
Overall delicious fresh food and shinny happy people to bring it to you
Fillings get a taco a fry bread cheese crisp a dessert bread or my recommendation a bean and cheese fry bread
The Chinese was not good but all of the American comfort foods were pretty tasty
****Four Stars for good food and friendly service
Everyone in the Restaurant was ordering the Guacamole made fresh at your table  my husband is not an avocado fan so I just watched everyone else enjoy with envy  We ordered the Pork Shoulder Tacos Crispy Pork Belly Appetizer and could not resist ordering two desserts
Ate at the Lobby Grill and the food is over priced and not that tasty
The staff is very friendly and accommodating but frankly the food we had was good but not great
While I enjoy the fast-casual concept of ordering at the counter and having your food delivered to you this seems to be a hot spot during lunch and it's sometimes challenging to find a table
I also unknowingly showed up on all-you-can-eat pizza night which was excellent and much more valuable
As good as any basic pizza I've had here in the Valley up there with Humble Pie and Pizzeria Bianco
I'd love to see some different wines on their menu - maybe a good Australian Sauv Blanc or some good white blends to pair with the spiciness of the food but the Melbec that we had was just fine
Everything was pretty good except for the chicken mole
My food was hot and it was served with fresh hot corn tortillas
The cubes of meat were tender and sucked up all the flavors of the dish
Dad ordered the ham and cheese but stripped away all the interesting flavors because well because he's a dad and likes the meat and potato type menu
Dessert was a wonderful and decedent brownie with ice cream chocolate and caramel sauces
That being said food either tastes good or it doesn't
Now I know this isn't an actual German food but it looked good and I thought they might go all out with it
Their chicken strips and fries were delicious
This is a really good pizza but its not worth the wait or the nasty hurry you up staff
My favorite slider was the Antelope the raspberry jam added a great flavor and the meat wasn't as different tasting as I was expecting
The Wagyu was good too but it's really just like a regular slider since it's still beef
I would recommend this foodless bar for its zeal and its laidback feeling
What brough us to Lolo's was the fried chicken so needless to say we were filled with anticipation and can tell you that it is worth the trip
We ordered the chicken lollipops and the shrimp appetizers
The chicken wasn't very good but the shrimp was really yummy
The meat held on the bone and a good tug cleaned the meat mostly off
I'll probably order them dry next time and moreso to really get a sense of the flavor of the naked meat without the sauce killing the flavor
Chicken and tri-tip were really tasty
The sauce was applied sufficiently so that it wasn't too sweet but added to the good flavor of the chicken
I doubt they solely smoked the chicken as doing so typically yields a rubbery skin but they could have either cooked it over an open pit or did some sort of hybrid cooking method to give the skin a good texture while infusing some good smoke into the meat
Both of my girls have been enrolled in Marilyn's studio and it has been a wonderful experience for our family
With the Aunt and Uncle in town from Alaska I thought I should keep it real in new phoenix fashion by jumping on the lightrail to hit up some delicious Mexican food both of which you can't ride or eat in AK
My food was excellent and service was attentive and professional
I would also highly recommend their rolled taquitos yummy
I have been to other Mediterranean restaurants and the food seemed to have more flavor to it
In NYC people line up 'round the corner for the shot to sit at one of the small tables at Grimaldi's Pizzeria under the Brooklyn bridge and order one of their famous thin crust pizzas
a vegetarian sandwich aptly named because when you bite into it you don't give a damn where the beef is because your mouth is full of avocado tomato pine nuts and other tasty things
Beef roll was oily but quite tasty and good size
Taiwanese sausage over rice was good but I think if you never had similar dish like this before you might not like it since it doesn't have that much flavor
The service was  fast  friendly and great - and the food was filling and tasty
If your going to serve finger foods Tapas then at least let the little niblets pack a mean punch of flavor
The other bar food they have is nothing new or different but very good by bar standards
Our favorites are brunch and lunch - such wonderful flavors and fresh food
Suzie's a great place for their lunch specials they have good posole and beef tacos and I remember they only cost like 6-7 bucks for lunch throw in a 1 penny beer and you are ready to go back to the office a happy man
For quick meals the sushi bar is excellent so is the salad bar and deli selections
The food we ordered was very good and our server was delightful - just too much waiting
Lucky Boy's is very good fast  mom and pop food
It's in a prime spot has great bar food it's way better and a good drink selection
I have been very dissapointed lately in the quality of the Meixican food restaurants we have visited
Your looking for some good mexican food for a reason
used our two free tix coupon tonight to see happy feet 2horrible movieFood was below par - had a burger which was very small and on a real cheap white bun- came ontop of a mountain of soggy fries- food arrived cold- 10$-Seats were not comfortable- the sound system and picture quality was excellent-nothing spectacular- I miss Farrelli's Cinema Supper Club which had wonderful food and service and was locally owner- oh well thats the way it goes these days
The quality of the food has remained consistent throughout the years
Amazing food nice crowd and always consistant
The seafood was good quality and solid
The beef was good but I thought there was too much salt from the cheese
Don't get me wrong the food was good but I was hoping for something more like the meal I've had at the Silver Spur in Tucson OMG -Gooooooood stuff
left me feeling nervous about the food quality and hesitant to complete my meal
The Viet Egg Rolls were filled with a flavorful mix of peppered pork and vegetables and served traditionally with the lettuce leaf mint cilantro chile and nuoc nam
What struck me most is its non-hostile attitude towards food that in the midst of Fox/DeMarco restaurant-empire building and chef-star chains there's a glimmer of light that individuals such as Polly Levine and Chris Bianco bring to Arizona honesty humility and deep-rooted understanding that good food is simply technique and soulful sourcing
The food at Chestnut Lane is free of impurity the lobster cobb salad is drizzled in an excellent vinaigrette and tossed with generous heaps of lobster meat and crispy bacon; the sour cherry scones are lightly sugared yet sweet and savory enough that you'll be taking many with you on the go; the Icelandic-style yogurt with roasted pears makes eating yogurt fun again; or try even the flute-baguette encrusted with Parma ham or house-smoked salmon
It's a small cozy restaurant that is great for events where you desire good conversation over good food
Food is pretty good although the salmon BLT was super dry last visit
Overall this place has very good food but a little too pricey especially for the location
When the husband starts to make some dietary changes go gluten-free and veggie-rich we have found TJ's a good place to start because healthy food here doesn't taste gruesome and overly wholesome
They should have some pizzas to choose from then to have us waste our time trying to decide which ingredients would be good together
Fried Chicken- OMG this chicken was juicy and flavorful
She knew all the ingredients that went into the dishes I asked about and made recommendations which I liked
I even emphasized having a few veggie sandwiches because at the get together I was having two of my good friends do not eat meat
I got the low carb breakfast and also sampled my husband's quinoa oatmeal delicious with just the right amount of sweet and fresh fruit and egg sandwich cheese to die for and some very good chicken sausage
Everything looks amazing and sounds amazing and it's one of those deals where you cannot come in here when you're hungry or else you'll order way too much because the menu reads like a best of list of comfort foods
The guys are a bunch of meatheads good ole boys and gangbangers who get into fights
The food is hearty and taste freakin' good
They are filled with amazing meat topped with your cheese and you choice of red or green chili every time i think about rellenos this is the first thing that pops into my head
Service is great sometimes and fair others but with food this good it easily makes up for it
The buffalo chicken wrap was excellent but at 300 calories it was half of a wrap with 5 carrots and a side of bleu cheese dressing
Good if you're on a diet for portion control but may require more food if you're hungry
Service for our big table was great - and again we were blown away by the delicious and authentic German food
Their prices are reasonable the food is good and they're quick- which is important when you're on time constraints
Nothing on this coast even comes close to the quality authentic Mexican food this joint offers
I also remembered having pizza from some other Streets location at some point and it was fresh and good also
We should have went to Greek Corner where I know the food is GOOD
I don't recommend having coffee with one of those Jalepeno'd hot-sauced spicy meat pepper jack cheese monsters that every place seems to be slinging but coffee and chicken salad on marble rye perfecto
And anyway who cares about sides when the meats were all done with such care and tasted so wonderful
After this we opted not to order any food taking our cue from the inability to mix gin with tonic water and were met with an outrageous bill for our two 'well' shots
I haven't had a roll with that kind of flavor
Overall the food experience was good and I highly recommended
The food is incredibly tasty both vegetarian even vegan and meat alike
The manager always comes by your table to check on you the service is impeccable the food is fresh crisp and amazing
I confess I don't bother to order any of the fish filets or other items at Joe's but I will say that they get the straightforward items right- crisp fries fresh coleslaw without too much vinegar sugar salt or mayo and balanced in flavor and I do like the chutney like dip for the coconut shrimp
My girlfriend had the Beef Enchiladas which she loved and I thought were really good as well
I had the Meatloaf and it was not so good
The food here is always fresh and full of flavor
In the end the food is universally good -- not NYC Chinatown Five stars good but fast food Chinese Four Stars good
If you are staying close by at the Hilton Squaw Peak and you want to eat some good Mexican food head on over
I have also tried their burger a noodle dish and various appetizers
I think this more a place to hang out with friends unwind from a tough day at work or at the pool and just chill-Im ALL about delicious food that keeps you coming back not a social environment so I'll take a pass If your hungry and want to get some food take-away that might not be a bad idea
Before the soup came I had a very tasty spring roll called the Enlighten Me with jalapeno jicama asparagus rice noodles and sriracha
Though these were very similar ingredients to the Pho this Spring Roll had it's own unique flavor experience
Took advantage of their Groupon deal $20 for $40 worth of food
But for the families that come in Chinese and otherwise they know to get the Dim Sum its very delicious with real Chinese options for those that dare to eat real Chinese food
I had the traditional being that I've never had a patsy before and it was simply amazing beef potatoes and a red wine gravy that made my mouth go um what the hell just happened
Everyone else had pizza -and really enjoyed the sausage and carmelized onion  it looked good though i think it may have been a dash under cooked IMO
Also a nice rotating wine list pretty good for a pizza place
95 and others like the Gyro I found to be less than good becasue the meat was very dry some parts burnt with the obviously strong taste of fish
The Griz is amazing and it like 50lbs of meat and egg for your morning pleasure
Our desserts chocolate torte and chocolate peanut butter decadence were delicious and totally redeemed the meal in my mind
more wine delicious chicken specialmore wine tiramisu
I tasted the stromboli filled with chicken braised greens feta and carmelized onions picture an extra-long Hot Pocket cut diagonally into thirds
Came here on Easter based on the recommendations of friends for their Fish & Chips for my mumsie
The lunch sized portion was just right with 2 good sized pieces of fish a side of cole slaw and the chips for $9 served before 400pm
Appetizers - some sort of sushi thing that was drowned in seaweed tasted okay but was barely noticeable on the plate
Despite the uncomfortable setting I enjoyed my meal next time I'll probably order my food to go
The food we ordered was excellent especially the yummy interesting appetizers
The chicken is noms their hummus is as good as any I've ever had the garlic paste they give you is delicious but lethal--don't eat it if you have a meeting later and their rice is just killer
A good concept for a dish but execution could make it really shine
I've been here once before and remember the food as being excellent
She ordered a mild version of Yellow Curry with coconut milk chicken potatoes onions & carrots which she said was very tasty
We eat there a LOT and the pizza and wings are consistently good and very reasonably priced for the specials
I also came for breakfast once and that food was good too
He provided us with wonderful service and even dessert advice
I'm a huge fan of Fresh and Easy because the food there is good inexpensive and they have great deals on several items
The coffee is delicious the ambiance is laid back and friendly and the locally-sourced food options are excellent
Go relax have some good food and drink with some very nice people
The food was pretty good - once we got it - but the service was very slow
Good  Meat Jun and the BBQ beef were both good
[I know that kale is SO VERY good for me but sometimes what's good for my health isn't so great for my digestive system  ]  I wasn't a fan of their hash in the past and tonight's side dish didn't win me over either
The exquisite crunch I so loved in this pizza was gone and so was the flavor
If you need food they have a book of places that deliver and they do offer hot dogs and popcorn
Everything that came out looked really high-quality and my food was delicious
Besides the tasty food The Main Ingredient also features a little patio and it's definitely a central Phoenix gem that's worth checking out
After months of listening to a coworker talk about how amazing this pizza was I finally gave in and went for lunch
The gentleman on the phone was so wonderful when I called and helped me create the pizza I wanted
The toppings on the pizza were really good but I didn't like the crust
Only good things last night were my emerald chicken burrito and diet Dr Pepper
Everything is delicious and super fresh from chicken feeturgh
Great fresh mix of vegetables - and the tasty fake chicken makes more sense in smaller pieces there
The meatloaf was good the ham OK and the dumplings a strangely gelatenous texture
I guess it's a good value for the money though my plate was around $8 or $9 if you're not too picky about your food
They were really good - meaty crisp and juicy and I found the medium sauce fit the bill nicely
Everyone I know MUST try the Hot Buttered Lobster Roll as well
We had been regularly eating here about once a week and even recommended it to some friends however since we first starting frequenting this location the service and quality of food has been sliding downhill over time
Tasty pizza dough savory sauce and any pretty much any combination of cheese/no-cheese and high quality toppings that you could want all baked to blistery perfection in the non-homemade coal fired brick oven
The food is nothing amazing but it gets the job done and the price is definitely right
After having a cup of chicken soup fries and that sandwich I'd have to say the food is pretty good yes diner food but still pretty good none-the-less
OVERALL  The food is good the service is very good and the prices are LOW
I've heard such good things but thanks to less than stellar food and underwhelming service Over Easy feels like it's quality is under medium
The food had a nice flavor but I asked the girl to substitute flour tortillas instead of corn and she forgot
All that I tried from the soup salad sushi hot dishes & dessert selections were good & I particularly enjoyed these items*  The Hot & Sour Soup
It would be one thing if the food was amazing
The food was good but it was not AMAZING
It seems they have lost a lot of their bar crowd business but at least they are turning things around in terms of service and the pizza is a good late night option
The subpar overpriced pizza is not worth the crap service - Do Not Go Here
I have had their entrees and the best that can be said is that it is good americanized  mexican food
Even though we were sitting literally next to the kitchen window our food arrived cold
The closest good sushi you'll find downtown
The Western scramble was good and there was definitely a lot of food
I like the laid back style nice decor and fresh and delicious food
After looking at this flavor I figured trying it would be akin to those 90% chocolate bars at Whole Foods
The ambiance of both inside and outside is excellent & so is the food
On weekdays they are open for lunch and serve amazing sandwiches the bread is based off the pizza dough
We ordered a ton of food like usual wonton noodle soup - wontons were perfectly firm not too soft noodles were the Chinese version of al dente and a good soup base
beef stew noodle soup - the flavor of the beef stew was disappointing not enough of the earthy flavor you expect to get the noodles and soup base is the the same as above
that seems like a lot of fun and a good way to try lots of food
Peter Piper Pizza pretty bad China Town Buffet a little banged up but good food
Their Tandoori Chicken is excellent too & they keep it moist with a foil cover
but whatever other day you're hungry for some delicious Indian food hop on your elephant or in your Mahindra & get over here
More than likely though this place just isn't what I or any other self respecting lover of Mexican food would consider a good place to eat
They have expanded the menu to include sandwiches and desserts the chocolate cake is DELICIOUS
We like the heat but the food has to be tasty
Then the Chicken Vindaloo that was ordered spicy was delivered spicy but with no flavor
Moral of the story  Drive a few extra miles and go to a place where you know you will get excellent food at a fair price
I highly recommend this place for the great food now and the low price booze
I always read Yelp reviews before buying massage/facial Groupons just to make sure my purchase will be worth it and after reading these reviews I thought it would be totally worth dishing out the $79 + tip
The iced coffee drinks are delicious and although I haven't tried any of the food options I've noticed they have a nice breakfast menu
Nice variety of menu very good service and very good food
I was impressed by the Vu Pizza caramelized onions mushrooms pepperoni and it came out fresh with no issues mentioned by other reviews that included the pizza
This 'personal' size pizza lasted me for three meals it is like a Barro's size small pizza something that one stomach can't contain no matter how tasty it is
My fiance had a chicken sandwich that he liked and it came with fries that were very good fresh and potatoey instead of just tasting like oil and salt
Really wasn't that impressed with the food either
I couldn't keep my mind on the business deal because of the aroma of some very delicious food
The plump potato dumplings tasted homemade and the meat sauce was delicious
The food is really good and homestyle but better
It is hard to find good Mexican food anyways
Great rolls amazing calamari and good prices
The Food Court has been completely revamped although many stores are still vacant YC's is always delicious and I can see the developers vision for the future
Prices may have gone up a tad and portions were downsized but the food is still tasty the patrons are still trendy and the drinks still flow like the hoover dam
The food is ok it's not interesting by any means but it is tasty and my girlfriend really enjoyed her house special pizza
The food was exactly as expected -- somewhere below the quality of an Olive Garden
Meatballs well formed and of overall good taste but spiced with powdered everything and old powder at that
First my wife and I ordered chicken ceaser for an appetizer and pizza / burger for entree
Care is obviously put into not only the choice of wares being sold here but the quality of food presented to the customer
It's a delectable flavored chicken breast topped with the thinnest slice of eggplant and covered with mozzerella cheese and a Tarragon Cream Sauce
Besides the excellent food the service was extraordinary
To sum it all up healthy food doesn't mean it should lack flavor but that is exactly how this place was
We enjoyed the Aiko and Moki both were delicious the mango chutney was a perfect little sweet compliment to the meaty hot dog
I have actually dreamed about this dish- that resulted in me returning just to savor the delicious tuna creation
It had a good portion of meat beans and rice except no cheese
I am one who enjoys my food HOT temperature wise so by the time I am finishing up it is still a little warm
its an ok place with ok prices and ok foodI would have given it 2 stars  ehhh I've had better but I have yet to find a really good breakfast dive in the area and MATTS BIG BREAKFAST is just too far to go
Food  goodService  nice polite cute hippie girls don't pop in for a quick lunchPrice  around $10Would I go again  I will be there this weekShould you go  yes
Apparently I was craving pork which is beyond rare Man all of the food was really good
The egg rolls were stuffed with yummy goodness the honey chicken was finger-licking good there was TONS of pork fried rice packed into that container
When I first moved into my place in Tempe I took a good look around the neighborhood and I saw a Thai place a coffee shop of death A decent taquieria Ted's Hot Dogs and SakeBomber Sushi & Grill
For the sushi novices I think this is a perfect place to get used to the flavors of sushi
maybe in a pinch but with an even better sushi joint one block south it's not worth it
The good measure of any breakfast brunch is the Eggs Bene it's a tough dish to get right and even harder when they have to sit out
The prices are ridiculously good and the food is authentic and just freakin' delicious
Their food is great - i've had the veggie frittata and the house style veggie burger both are pretty amazing
The food is typical for a small mexican restaurant but the quality and taste is top notch for the price
The tamale was delicious with pretty much a 5050 ratio of corn exterior to beef filling
The service was amazing the manager even came over at one point and told us not to worry our food was on its way while my boyfriend and I didn't even think it had been a long time
When the Chris Parker Project plays Aunt Chilada's is a pretty good time but the food is just so-so
Our menuSpinach enchiladasChicken tacosChicken enchiladaFideoRiceRefried beansHouse margaritaMargarita w/Tres Generaciones and Grand MarnierChips + salsaSpinach enchiladas were mushy and flavorless - probably frozen spinach and too much cheese
On the other hand their menu had many greasy deep fried things or meaty beef things that sounded like they might be good
The more I eat at the Fish Market the more I appreciate it's quality sushi
;I'm sure the raw bar and other traditional fish dishes on the menu are equally as good I definitely recommend it
However if you want real Chinese food I'd recommend you skip right to the second half of the menu
Most of the dishes we tried are very flavorful and good
Their Kung-Pao chicken definitely is not as good as S
We did get water boiled fish and that was tasty
The emerald green chicken was tasty as a sample but I'm not sure I could eat an entire dish
I know sometimes people are wary of straying from the original location for fear the quality of the dishes may be compromised
Pizza is a must here of course - I didn't do the ordering this time but I can say it was quite delicious
The pasta dishes are good as well with portions expected in a urban restaurant don't expect Claim Jumper portions
Authentic or high-quality Mexican food this certainly is not
And to top it off the food's kinda delicious too in a you-know-this-is-so-bad-but-it's-so-good sort of way
Pros - Pho was tasty and cleaner than most Pho places           - Decor of the place was very chic           - There is a bar for you drinkers           - The banh mi were HUGE and came with garlic or sweet potato fries           - Nice outdoor patio for when its cooler outside           - The head server was very helpfulCons - Price was a little more than most pho places Pho $10 / Rolls $3
2 The $12/$15 PER PERSON price of the 'Chefs Spread APPETIZER' was far too high for the minimal amount of food provided
They play great music make strong drinks and have amazing food
Beware though as the food always comes out extremely hot
The food is worth the wait for sure though
And yes the Guacamole is basic but that's exactly how its supposed to be - if a blender or food processor is involved its not gonna be good
now there is a food worthy of blowing your diet over
Other than highlighting some of the excellent side dishes I'm not sure what I can add to the other excellent reviews
Normally the food is good and portions are huge
I ordered the Kalamata sandwich from the cafe because it was featured on food network and it was super tasty there was a lot of meat on the sandwich
Service is awesome and food is pretty good
The food was excellent atmosphere so fun and the service was super friendly
The menu is somewhat extensive for a small place like this but nothing fancy - sandwiches and a few salads; but there are some nice selections - turkey avocado roast beef with horseradish and a good veggies one too
It's a four star experience with three star food and fun/interestig/good service
My favorite was a roll with fried fish skin in it -- not sure what it was called but it was tasty
Your genuine excitement for the food was a nice change from past servers reluctant to give a real recommendation
They have a good selection of food and open at 6 am
All in all great place to go to grab a glass of wine and some good food especially after hours as they are open from 5pm to 2am
I liked the food here & the portion sizes were good
I decided to try it out anyway was seated by a friendly waiter and ordered the hot & sour soup they were able to sub in chicken instead of pork - bonus and the waiter recommended the house chicken to me
* is from the SF Bay Area like myself so he gave me the lowdown for good Asian food in Phoenix for dimsum he recommended Golden Buddha first Great Wall second C-Fu third - then for Vietnamese he recommended some place on 19th Ave between Indian School & Camelback
Anyway he recommended I come back and get the Mongolian beef next time which I'll definitely do plus the hot & sour soup
I have lived near this place for a few years and I have not had food this good since I lived in Germany
This is one of my favorite places the food is always consistent and the staff is absolutely wonderful
The food is even pretty decent for bowling alley fare not quite Lucky Strike level but good for the price
I filled up on the pretzel appetizer for my lunch while the kids ate pizza/fries good fries; lotsa cheese on the pizza
Not to mention the food locally grown was delicious and tasted fresh and homemade
Finally I had to get someone's attention to come and take our order and it wasn't even the guy who took our drink order We waited for a good 30 minutes for our food which is fine but then it came out cold
You get to choose from 0-5 how spicy you want anything and everything you order and the way they cook there food is just delicious
The drinks and food were good and the prices are reasonable
The chicken shawarma was much juicer this time and the gyro meat was good
May I recommend the Apricot chicken or mixed grill
their el greco sandwich is killer as well if you're a meat eater and it's served on this delicious toasted sourdough bagette
However the best part of our meal were the chicken and waffles sooooo delicious
Entering the store there is a selection of beer and wine to the right and a cold showcase of meats along the back wall
' Corn fed corn makes tasty and tender beef
He spoke further of how grass fed beef may be a little leaner but it is not as tasty
Whole Foods is good for fruits and vegetables
The wait staff was very prompt and friendly and very helpful when it came to recommending food
We even decided to give the desserts a try and had the salted caramel something or the other which was a wonderful combination of flavors
Before the pizza the Handmade Mozzarella Local Tomato and Basil with Extra Virgin Olive Oil was simply stunning and if the food alone was not good enough the service is a definite match to the gastronomic sensation
While my side dishes were good I will never go back
drinks were good food was mediocre but the atmosphere is what made the event
YUMmy only complaint is that the chicken had too much a of a bitter charred flavor
So I think to myself if they're advertising something that looks that horrendously awful how good could the food be
The dry goods are extensive and I found good quality sushi rice there for an excellent price
With the food being made fresh and in-house--- the price is well worth it
Not as great as Whole Foods but it does have a good selection of healthy foods
All of our friends showed up and we let the good times roll
I got a chicken dish which was really good I stuffed myself silly
Not since my old neighbor a refugee from Iraq moved out have I had I experienced such robust flavors combined with healthy food
Except that the food here is less on the fusion side of Mediterranean flavors and more middle-eastern authentic Iraqis with a little Jordanian thrown in
Let me just say that my sister had to hold me down because their food all looked so good
Their table was literally crammed full of dishes with smells so good that I swear my nose grew just trying to get a better whiff
The food here is New Mexican and has a serious kick to it in a good way
Good food great service accomodating hours and steller energy and atmosphere
While it may not be as sophisticated as Modern Steak or trendy like Olive & Ivy Zinburger has a sleek setting with a great casual outdoor bar and some delicious food
I am pretty sure at this point I should have stopped but when staff recommended the Bacon Bloody Mary how could this foodie resist
It was really good I just wouldn't recommend pairing that with Dessert and wouldn't do it again
I was amazed at their decore  service and food presentation of this fabulous and delicious ORGANIC food that simply tastes out of this world
Once you taste  good organic food  in Tryst  you no longer want to return to hormone and pesticide laced food products
The slight crust on top created a wonderful contrast to the soft fish
A squeeze of lemon actually added to the flavor as well to the saltiness of the fish
It had a slight sweet taste to contrast the fish's flavors
The whole dish had so many textures and flavors that made me jump with delight
It looked like dog food though and I didn't see it being worth the price
The shrimp was tasty but very oily nothing you couldn't get at Smart and Final's frozen food section and cook up yourself
Service was good place was cute food was decent
If you want good food in a noisy cheerful atmosphere like a bunch of friends or after work this fits the bill
The table favorite was a light white fish that has hot oil poured over it with homemade foccacia
With 3 drinks dessert and tip we spent roughly $130 well worth every penny
The food came hot with a small bowl of jasmine rice though you could easily just eat/drink the curry
Service is wonderful food is great and like I said a great curry
From my brief glance at the menu the food looks pretty standard and Americanized but given how good our drinks and the service were I'd be willing to go back and give Z Tejas another try for a meal
Juan's food is 100% delicious all the time - from the burritos to the chimichangas to the tostadas rellenos tacos basically whatever your heart desires
My favorite is The Meat its just a pizza with pepperoni and sausage but still amazing
The other con is that you might be in for a wait for your food but that's only because they make them fresh so it's definately worth it
the mushrooms were huge and delicious not little mushroom flakes like you get on other pizzas
The food is still good so I'll give a star for that also
Just because your food is good and you have good looking servers doesn't mean your customers will continue to come back
The value when considering the food quality portion sizes ambiance  and service is tremendous
AKA a New Yorker  The onion roll assigned to the task of containing all this sandwichy goodness gave a great effort but collapsed in defeat about 3/4 of the way through forcing me to finish off with a fork
After a quick 3hr round of golf an ice cold Raj IPA from four peaks Sicilian pizza and BLT pizza hit the spot perfectly
The telltale sign for tasty pizza for me is crust and sauce
Probably my second favorite place for appetizer/side dish veggies after The Grind
I got the kale salad and tried the bread pudding dessert - all are delicious
While I am a huge sushi fan the price of the rolls were a wee bit more expensive than some GOOD sushi places I went to
The yuzu miso marinated black cod was a fantastic piece of fish with great flavor
i enjoyed the food more than at michael mina's bourbon steak house the steak was not that great note the steaks are humongous so i'd split them the service is a little fake except the sweet manager who paid us a personal visit & seemed very sincere but the soy-glazed shiitake sides & free duck fat fries were yummmm
My daughters loved the Swedish Fish italian ice and it honestly tasted like eating that particular type of candy albiet ice cold
The drinks were strong the food was good and there were always plenty of ASU guys around to talk to
The amazing Odor of the cinnamon rolls in the cafeteria is pure ecstasy
My fiance got the 5 meat sandwich and really enjoyed it as well
Each and every one of our desserts was so good
This restaurant is casual but still nice to take guests to the waitstaff are wonderful and food quality very good
We grabbed some pre-made spicy tuna sushi which was fresh and tasty probably the highlight of the experience
The food was nothing amazing and it took entirely too long given that it wasn't lunch time or dinner time
If you're looking for just a great pizza that offers unique combos flavors and even gluten-free varieties its the way to go
The camarones rice plate & chicken fajitas both looked great being served but the dishes lacked much flavor which was too bad
I come to sushi places for the Veggie rolls and appetizers
In fact this dish needs way more rice given how strongly flavored the sauce is
The firm flesh of the fish just does not lend itself well to deepfrying and the lemongrass is such a delicate herb that all flavor is lost in the frying process
Despite the solid support well-trained and cheerful volunteers & staff  lots of food good crowd management I'm not sure I'd go back
Tony was recommended by the woman we buy our dog food from
This is not to say Ballpark Pizza isn't worth a try
While their pizza isn't worth writing home about it's pretty low on the grease factor and tastes quite nice when dipped in ranch
After being unable to give me any direction or recommendations whatsoever I ordered two BBQ Chicken sandwiches with a potato salad side and a garden salad
The food is pretty tasty the drinks arent bad
Paid about $22 for a large which isn't huge but is decent pizza and walked back to the hotel
Step 7 Ate an amazing pizza by a gorgeous pool in Phoenix
Second- the kiosk was cool but really effed me in the end- When I put the reservation I found a neat deal to have a $46 credit to use for food or hotel movies while I was there
Pair it with one of the really REALLY tasty desserts
oTotal cost 1 drink 1 appetizer 2 curries plus rice dessert
The restaurant was good - we had the breakfast buffet a wide selection of hot foods pastries and cereals and yogurts
What surprises me about most hotels - motels is the fact of no controlling of noise with insulation and sufficient windows and the huge gaps under the hall doors
One of our dishes was cold but they quickly replaced it after we complained
If you want good food and good service - go next store to J & G Steakhouse at the Phoenician
We had some excellent food for very reasonable prices there
The food is upscale and priced so yet more on the classics end rather than new and innovative flavors
I recently dropped by Pasta and Sugo and wish I had made more of an effort to have come by previously when they were still serving food here but the trip was worth it
I was also informed that their products will also be on the shelves of some Whole Foods and AJ's in Arizona which is so wonderful
I can't say much for the decors - very dive Vietnameseish but that's when you know the food is good
I went with the fish tacos since that's what the waiter recommended
the food and drinks were delicious and the atmosphere is sexy yet comfortable
There are always a good choice of pizzas to get a slice from meat and not-meat varieties and plenty of choices for your own pie
I would recommend cooking meat you get from here the same day you buy it
But the food is pretty good and when I told them to make my dish spicy they actually listened and complied so they get props for that
They DO charge a small cover but it's well worth it as the food is more than passable and in many cases it's quite good
He gets up and goes to ask the manager where our food and/or server are and hes told  you got your food and you guys have drinks so your good right
The ceasar  sald is a good portion to share while you wait for your pizza slice spinach and onion for me and peperoni with extra sauce for my BF
If you're unaccustomed to raw food the menu may seem pretty foreign to you but still allows for exploration of more nutritious food without any flavors that are too out of the ordinary unless you only eat fast food
I didn't think their room service was pleasant and the food wasn't good therefore we didn't even bother trying the restaurant's food
He forgot some of our appetizers a glass wine and dessert orders
He apologized and comped us our undelivered appetizer wine and dessert
I had the chicken Pita which was astoundingly tasty with a great salad and it's $6
Hip atmosphere great food good portion sizes and fantastic service
The side dishes were not very good but the desert was pretty good
No place in town compares to the atmosphere and the food is very good
The food was alright but not good enough to go back for a second time
The meat is pretty good but at least one of the meats has been dry each time I've been
I was quite impressed when Ifrequented the Pacific Seafood buffet at THAT location
I told her I only walked about 20 feet with my filled plate - so that didn't seem like a reasonable excuse for the temperature of the food not being hot
The portion sizes and prices are great for the food quality [and for Snobsdale]
This is very good food at a very good price
It has a great atmosphere good food good drinks and reasonable prices
They were tender and meaty and had a good flavor to them
Next time I am feeling like cheap Italian food like pasta with white sauce since the husband won't make it for me I think I might give this place another shot
The meat was juicy well cooked but lacking a little in flavor
Even if the food weren't good I'd recommend people to come here just for the atmosphere
The food was solid and the service was amazing
I had a tostada and chicken taco- both tasty
The chicken was all white meat which is a huge jump in quality
I love hot spicy food and this does not disappoint
I asked about the food and was assured it was delicious
LOL The thin crust pizza was delightful the flavor of the crust was good and fresh
The chicken was super tasty and I made a sandwich out of that with the Hummus and the salad
I am very particular about my pizza- I like it thin I like it crispy I don't like too much sauce I like a tasty dough etc
My mom's chicken and broccoli was good and so was my sisters pepperoni and sausage
Okay so this is not health food but it is delicious
One star deducted for the bland ambiance but the food has plenty of flavor
It is totally worth the few extra dollars for a clean comfortable seat with full service drinks and food
Meanwhile does anyone have any recommendations for alternative restaurants for healthy food
I've been regularly going to Coffee Plantation they have a delicious breakfast wrap a great chicken waldorf salad sandwich and some amazing lettuce/spinach salads
Someone that we were with had the spicy BBQ chicken and that too was good
Favs The burger is 10oz of quality beef
I get the regular gyro and I cant tell you enough how delicious the food is here
I havent tried other foods but what i have eaten has been amazing
Their meatballs are the best I have had in Arizona and taste wonderful with their homemade mozerella which you can buy fresh daily
I picked Cafe Bink because we think we're kind of foodies and I'd heard Binkley's was amazing but a little too expensive
The chicken was juicy and flavorful and the pasta homemade was great
For dessert my brother wanted the donuts AMAZING - especially with the cream dipping sauce I ordered the chocolate souffle AMAZING and the three little ice cream sandwiches one vanilla/chocolate chip cookie one mint/chocolate cookie and one honey/gingersnap cookie
The soft-shell crab roll can be anywhere between good and awesome depending on which sushi chef puts it together
Had the House Salad Old Monkeyshine Nimbus beer excellent Tuscon AZ brew and the ilTagliere sampling of meats cheeses and veggies
but the good news is that the food is fresh and tasty
7 bucks for 2 entrees and some spring rolls was a pretty good deal
the food is still good but it takes forever
I rarely give out 5 starts but any food that can take me to France with just one bite is well worth it
The Garlic and Onion Naan were great as recommended so was the Chicken Tikka Masala and Lamb Saag
We were driving from Phoenix and I didn't want to eat cold food
The pizza was pretty good and the onion rings
Over all it was good but a long way to go just for food
Can anyone recommend a good Goo Ball vendor for dessert
Disgusting food and shitty service ambience is great if you like to dine in a hot cellar engulfed in stagnated air
Unlike some chicken the flavor was beyond the skin and the meat was really really good
I agree with the other Yelpers in that Truckin Good Food is awesome
I can't comment on the food although it does look pretty good and apparently it's all organic if that's what you're into these days like everyone else
I ordered the mixed seafood boil and it was outstanding $18 and surprisingly worth every penny
Just a ton of seafood in a rich sauce that I had to clean up with a ton of their excellent bread
Food was tasty service was fine the only potential problem would be the noise
But good value its like ordering a gyro with a pasta dish
But still Crazy Jim's is decent to good food good portions and pretty good price
I have had their pizza a few times which is always good but I really love the sandwiches and soups and salads
I have had the salmon and cous cous salad which is great and the Chicken and Gorgonzola salad which is also very good
The other food was good but the service is rather fail
Overall it's worth a go a bit pricy for the food/drinks but enjoyable none the less
The hot dog itself had that snap that you find in really good hot dogs and I think it was an all-beef dog
The quality of the food we had was very good
It was all tasty -- and waaayyy too much food
The giant cookie dessert is worth it if you make it to dessert and have someone to share it with
Being Indian I prefer Indian food meaning I like all the grilled meat items but they better be able to make quality sabjis and vegetarian dishes too
Indian Punjani/North Indian food involves Tandoor items as well in addition to vegetable dishes more variety and types of curries and is spicier and more flavorful in general
Of course if you ask them to make something hotter they can but their food in general is not very spicy and is bland with the exception of some of their curries
If you are a Non-Indian and you want to try Indian food for the first time this would be a good place to start
If you are someone who has eaten quality Indian food and wants the real thing avoid this place because this is as far from being the real thing as possible
The service was good when we went there but at the same time the servers were pretty ignorant of the menu and didn't know a lot about Indian food
The bottom line is that if you are an Indian person or a person who is used to eating quality Indian food and you want honest to goodness quality INDIAN not Pakastani food avoid this place
If you are a non-Indian person wanting to check out Indian/Pakastani food and just want to have a good time this place is for you
Food here is really good and the service is friendly and quick
My biggest grip is that they fry their fish in the same fryer as their fries so the fries can have a hint of fish flavor on them which isn't too bad but I don't eat seafood so it isn't too good either
You want good food at a good price and this place gives it to you
It goes well by itself with a soup or even topped with something to make for a delicious dessert
As for the dessert the offer a variety of toppings for the fry bread I've had the honey and sugar and the chocolate Both are good but the honey and sugar is a bit messy so be prepared for that
They also brought a complimentary birthday dessert as well as took a group photo and delivered it to us in a frame
The birthday desserts as well as the chocolate lava cake and the pineapple upside down cake were a perfect way to complete a wonderful evening
I always get my food within 30 minutes and it is steaming hot
That said the food was delicious and the cocktails were strong though I thought the menu was better suited for a classier atmosphere
This was a wonderful dish with super-fresh greens and cheese that perfectly complemented the mushroom
Shotty service aside the food was AWFUL also
The drinks are strong the decor is wonderful the food is great and the serve is prompt
Well other than the coffee that is consistently excellent the pasta dish I ordered left everything to be desired
I ate because I was hungry but there was nothing in that dish worth recommending - dried pasta uninteresting ragu - no sauce whatsoever
So much for driving 20 minutes to come see you I'll stay home next time thinking of you and make my own meal and not spend $ 13 for a dish that's not even worth two bucks
The Chicken Salad was amazing and the turkey was right off the bone like Thanksgiving leftovers
It's worth trying but for us there weren't many dishes we'd be craving on a return visit for
I had the Beef with Lemon-grass Chili sauce over jasmine rice and LOVED it it was very flavorful
In a city of good Mexican food if you are looking for entrees less than $12 there is no better Mexican food in Phoenix
We ordered the salad and a margarita pizza the salad was good but the pizza was a little disappointing the sauce tasted like the sauce from spaghetti O  's  the basil was over cooked and the crust was still doughy
The food is close but not as good as with the previous staff
However my big issue is with the soup stand and the quality of the food meals in the deli area -  for several years I hAVE ADDRESSED MANAGEMENT ABOUT THE uncleanliness of the soup stand and the lack of keeping the soups fresh
I use to go once a week and purchase my wife -- a meal the last two have been not very good and one fish dish I brought back for a refund
I had the Schnitzel and it was very tasty and all of the food was very well prepared
Both dishes were succulent and moist not to mention full flavor
The egg roll that came with it was also good
The pizza was amazing - it's not really pizza
The brisket is good for several meals and the dish with the eggplant and matzah is amazingly good even though there is no meat and it is not better than the brisket
how come the food at the restaurant isn't as good
The food is simple delicious and sticks to ya ya know what I mean
The flavor is hard to describe probably because I have not had such fresh tasty Mexican food like this
I had a chicken and beef and both were equally tasty
Quality of Food My grandmother and I got the house salad to split and a hamburger
I've never had bad service the food is good the waitstaff friendly and the prices are right
The fish and chips were good but not great
We always split two order of the egg rolls and go back and forth between sharing the charbroiled pork egg cake and I always forget what it is called but the cold pork with noodles
The food is good and the portion sizes are enough to take some home and have the next day
The coffee is amazing they use Illy and the food is always plentiful hot fresh and tastes like homemade
Every premade food item like pasta scrambled egg breakfast trays salads have been wonderful
On later visits when I was able to eat here the food was interesting in that it was non-traditional on many accounts and had good presentation but was very lacking in taste
I've really enjoyed their crab puffs pesto pizza sweet & sour mock chicken bowl salads
I also tried some of the fruit and chicken salad which was equally good and very refreshing
-A note regarding SmashBurger Service  It has always been totally friendly at every location I have visited but don't come here in a big hurry as it takes them 10 minutes or so to bring your hot food which you'll love no matter what you order
The Food Truck Festival welcomed us with a hot dirt lot filled with thousands of people standing in zig-zaggy Disney Land-esque lines with maybe 20 - 25 food trucks
But at Happy Hour I can get full-sized special rolls and their delicious crispy spicy tuna sushi for $5 or less each
If you can sit outside it's lovely to lean back in their cushy chairs and revel in the sushi-delicious just consumed
Stingray isn't the best sushi in town and their dreadful cocktails definitely pull their food down to 3 star quality but they've got a great Happy Hour and a great ambiance with that delicious seaweed salad and spicy crispy tuna so I'll give them 4
Though I can't bash their pizza it's actually pretty good
Ambience makes you feel smarter too -- or maybe I'm that already   Service was great my server recommended a small since it's actually a large   Do organic food appear more hmmm
They don't have much on their menu just burgers beef sandwiches and hot dogs with all the fix-ins you'd want to put on them
Their prices are good  for the quality of food you get
The pizza is good don't get me wrong but I find Humble Pie's selection and taste better Cibo's is also better in my opinion
I think some of the low scores come from the fact japanese food just does not have the flavor punch that Chinese and Thai do
Not only is sooo good but the food is always consistent
The chicken enchiladas are just as good
We have good Mexican food in the Bay Area but not like this
The wait time is considerable but as long as you aren't in a hurry the food is worth the wait
Delicious food and excellent warm service
The server Gina was so friendly and gave us great service we decided to order from the set menu for the restaurant week and the food was excellent the french onion soup was hot and delicious the filet mignon was cooked as I ordered and very tendered as the cream of spinach and mashed potatos had good flavor
I've been twice now with groups that like to share and the quality is high dishes are flavorful and the prices are great
It was fantastic; perfectly breaded insanely flavorful and the chicken was hot while the salad it was served over was still cool which I really appreciated
It comes off as an insincere/non-genuine attempt to produce quality southwestern food and the forced atmosphere comes off as tacky
This way you can make adjustments and hopefully get your food to have some flavor
The prices are fine the food's okay and the brewsky is cold but we all know that has nothing to do with a bar's success
Our food came and was amazing so we were feeling good about it
The food is consistently good; do expect about a 20 minute wait for food if you are dining in
The food  I had the fish and chips and they weren't that bad and weren't that good
The brick of fish wasn't so great but the chips were excellent
They have decent pizza and imo good bruschetta because they put the tomatoes and whatnot on garlic bread
Tea refills per few and far between and food was not worth the money
The real authentic Greek mom as others have mentioned makes it seem semi-authentic and worth coming back for the yummy food
It's hard to find good burger places in phoenix because it's diluted w/ crappy conglomerate fast food places like McDonald's Burger King etc
The fish is as fresh and high quality as you could possibly expect this far from a major coastal international airport
I enjoyed in the food even more in the nice modern decor
Highly recommend Bombay Spice as you intro to Indian food
The only positive thing out of this whole evening was that the food was pretty good
However the Thai Dye seemed more of a mix between Thai flavors and Indian with the curry chicken
Not a big fan of potato pizza but this was very good
The food was excellent all the way around
At $10 for an 8 pizza it was not only delicious but affordable as well
I've been a lil dissappointed the last couple times I went as the service was slow which isn't necessarily the waiter/waitresses fault could have been the kitchen and my food wasn't exactly hot but warm
The bean dip for the chips was cold and my food was mediocre
Like everything they do the food is always excellent staff is personal and quick and the drinks aren't bad either
More customers leave and looks like the staff knows them by nameSO- this all set the bar highOrdered a margherita pizza it was awesomeLooks like I finally found an my local pizza jointD-will update as I try new things but their sauce for spagetti smelled amazing
Chai Tea included and even pizza yes Indian style veggie pizza and its goodThis is why I am so in love with this place 1 Great Flavor you can beat the unmuted flavors that sing in your mouth
The house special steak is what I usually order because it is reasonably priced and still a good piece of meat with a house blend of spices
The Chinese Chicken salad is always a good option
In the past we went when the dessert was carrott cake and that was very good
I do want to return someday  for the fried fish and try the appetizers
Pizza is amazing no cutting corners these are quality pies
If you like spicy try the Cuban Pulled Pork Pizza very tasty
sampled several top notch martinis the smoked salmon app good chicken burger and sweet potato fries
This was our third dinner at Renegade and each time have enjoyed the food
For me chicken must be flavorful ample crisp skin and moist on the inside--this entree met my priorities perfectly
So go to Renegade for very good food good but unpolished service
When I got home I ate 1 taco which was pretty good the meat was flavorful and tender I only wished I had some of that salsa to add to it
The food was delicious but what really sold it for me was our outstanding service
For this review I'll tell you why I - even as a person with seldom an army to feed - frequent Costco*fresh affordable quality seafood salmon tilapia shrimp scallops
So a few of us had burgers which were delicious but I had to stroll down memory lane and have my old favorite the base-ball cut sirloin
All the food was very good and the salad bar was delicious and had not changed in 29 years
However the food is good greasy cheesy type Mexican
My friends had the Mexican pizza which they pronounced as delicious
The high prices I understand being in keirland but the flavor and presentation of the food don't match up
I think that Pick Up Stix uses much better quality ingredients than Panda Express and many other Asian fast food chains and is fairly affordable given the quality
Their lunch special is a particularly good deal - you get a choice between 3-4 specific meat dishes a choice of wontons or egg rolls a choice between different rices or chow mein and a drink for $6
The House Special Chicken has a really flavorful sauce and is great combined with sauteed veggies for $1 more and the crab wontons are much better than ones I've had at many Asian restaurants that have kind of a fishy or overly creamy filling
The place blends into the industrial neighborhood but there is one strange cardboard cutout in the parking lot consisting of a hot woman with a stroller which is bizzarre
I need to be able to get good food free wifi and a plug for my laptop
I went with Arlin B's recommendation on the sampler tamales and even got a beef turnover
it was juicy and flavorful and the skin crispy and deliciousfired catfish The Best
Monday Morning - take outRoom for improvement - - same curt terse service- too cramped to actually look around and appreciate their items for sale- food was average but not worth all the fuss this place requires
they also had desserts that looked good but I was too full to try any of them
Don't get me wrong good food passable service in a pleasant dining room at a cost that while not a bargain is not a rip off either
The chocolate-cherry dessert was a mouth full of yum as well and my apple ginger dessert was tasty thought I like a bit more ginger zing in general
The prices are a little Scottsdale-ish but the quality of the food makes any meal here worth it
My boyfriend and I have been here for a few special occasions and have never been dissappointed the food is amazing and the service is just as good our waiter was so unbelievably nice
The accompanying photo is of the Wong Jo chicken from my first visit
It is close has good ambience and consistently good food
Their salads and thin-crust pizzas are excellent and not too filling so you can leave room for one of their yummy desserts
Service is sometimes a tad too relaxed at least by US standards but our server recently comped our group some late delivered desserts - a very good recovery
They use Boar's Head deli meats which are delicious
They also sell their meats cheese flavored cream cheeses and a few other items by the pound
95 which tasted just fine-nothing phenomenal but they were pretty good as bar food
Their pasties definitely pack in the flavors not very well known for English food
The kitchen is wide open so you can watch the ARMY of staff making tortillas prepping the food and packing it for your tasty delight
At any rate a cold hot dog is basically bologna with a smaller diameter and so I was serve bologna on a roll with glop
I went right around 2pm & only waited about 5/10 minutes before I was on my way home with my delicious food
To name a few entrees I have enjoyed and would order again the  Thai Chicken Bowl is a must try the Fish Tacos are monstrous maybe a Pineapple Chicken Sandwich for some flavor or the Wings for an excellent starter
Highly recommend the volcano flamed beef and the sugar cane pork
The food is very flavorful -- but everything is a bit spicy garlicky-spicy even the dishes they call mild
They were perfectly cooked and I knew I could eat the whole meal without reservation because it was within my daily caloric intake  But then again we had to get an appetizer their cheese breads are like flat pizzas and dessert
The food is pretty good as far as bar food goes
To start with the rice - the most simple base to good sushi - was overcooked into a completely flavorless glutenous paste
Oh - and I ordered beef I was just served pork - good thing I'm not kosher/halal etc
I could not more strongly recommend against this place - If I wanted sushi that tasted like it was catered by a gas station I would have gone to one
The food is amazing reminds me of my moms cooking
The Italian food is generous if not too generous but very good
Of course you may ask how can a hot dog bread hold so much food without falling apart and that is because it does not use a hot dog bun it uses another type of bread
I love the decor and of course the delicious food
The dishes maybe vegetarian and vegan but in no way restricted in its choices or flavor
By day they are a coffee shop that serves delicious food has a full bar and some of the coolest most fun baristas in the city
By night 32 Shea is the perfect place to grab a glass of wine and some amazing bruschetta or the dinner of the day with an delicious craft beer or even a lavosh pizza and a mint lemon drop martini holy yumminess
The bowling is cheap as dirt the drinks are cheap as dirt and the restaurants food is VERY good
We've stopped by in the evenings for sit-down dinners when looking for some good Indian food
The food itself was good stuff though- we particularly enjoyed the lamb and chicken dishes we ordered
Don't get me wrong the cheese fondue and the chocolate fondue were great but I was not impressed by the salad or the meat courses
food was good but nothing on the menu jumped out at us
Back a couple years ago when I started going there a beefy guy was doing the cooking always made quality pizza
One liner Great/Delicious Indian food w/ good happy hour specials but could improve on service
We started off with a King Fisher 22 oz $1 off at happy hour and a mango lassi with a shot of vodka
For appetizers  we decided to get the Chicken Naan and the Spicy Chicken wings
I really didn't expect to find such good Indian food in AZ
I kind of wish the waiter would have offered his opinion that we had ordered very similar dishes and recommended something else but it is okay
In addition he informed us that they only use non-beef dog food at their facility because the switch between beef and non-beef is what gives them diarrhea Good to know
Oregano's is a great place for affordable tasty Italian food with a twist
Aunt Shirley's Gorgonzola Sausage Pan PIzza - an amazing combination of Chicago sausage crumbles pepperoncinis and gorgonzola cheese
40-50 minutes seems a bit slow when you're the only people ordering food at the time you ordered itWhen I got my Cuban sandwich it looked pretty good
You can even order a Tasty Kake for dessert
the menu has all the essentials ribs and pork sandwiches chicken everything hot dogs grilled cheese
Amazing food ultra cozy atmosphere and a huge patio a little too cold for the patio tonight
This Buffet lives in the nice Tempe Mission Palms Hotel & is open for lunch Monday through Friday  featuring a different food theme each day
Moving on  to the rest of approximately 50 main food choices there were two prepared salads out plus two kinds of greens & the usual other goodies to make you own salad
The main dish items included beef Fajitas beef roast Chayote Squash with lots of other goodies in there with it Spanish Rice Charro Marinated Cod with lots of other goodies in there with it in a tasty sauce fancy grilled chicken pork loin & so on
Delicious food here with friendly service in a lovely dining room but somewhat smallish selection & the price of $15
Food I ordered the Fish & Chips and both were pretty good
I enjoyed the ends and outer edges of the fillet of fish the most
Dani and I shared the calamari the veggie tempura and the Diamondback all were good and we enjoyed our late night sushi fix with good music good vibes and yes she serenaded with her ill version my ears are still bleeding =P
It tasted like really good cafeteria food nothing to write about here
Food is always good and the steak is done to perfection
Gotta come back and try out all their appetizers and next time - yes on dessert please   The ambience is very classy and low key
Our server ended up sitting us down early warning us the kitchen was backed up-the food looked huge all around me so I figured it was worth the wait
And I got a LOT of food that was cooked just perfect with really good hot sauce on the table and extremely helpful wait staff
To say this location is different from others in terms of food would be a lie - it's just as tasty as any other Culver's I've stepped into
The chicken strips are some of my daughter's favorites she's quite the connoisseur of poultry  and the Butterburgers are quite tasty
Kids meals are wonderful here you get your choice of burger 2 chicken strips or corn dog choice of applesauce or fries and choice of drink
The food was great and although we only ordered appetizers we enjoyed them immensely and will be back for more and to try some of the dinner selections
The patty itself was pretty tasty as was my chicken dish I had too
The food is amazing the staff is very friendly and the owner goes out of his way to accommodate his patrons
The albacore tuna is made with a real tasty garlic sauce and they have several good rolls
It is amazing the night and day difference between sushi made to order at the bar and any other pre made stuff anywhere
Their green and red chile are so tasty and the meat is so tender
The food was good and the service prompt and cordial
I ate at this place consistently years ago and always found the kung pao chicken to be pretty good
Not the greatest place but i will revisit for the alligator po'boy and sea food gumbo so far i am unimpressed but i'll go here before i drive all over the valley to get my cajun fix
It's not fancy but the food is delicious and incredibly well prepared
This was the least good of the bunch - the meatloaf was pretty dry and over-seasoned with rosemary
The prices speed and portions are about average and the food is very good
I have been looking for a good Jamaican restaurant for a long time specifically one that has beef patties and home made sorrel
I ordered a beef patty and a chicken patty; both were good but the chicken patty was definitely better
I am now recommending this restaurant to anyone I know that enjoys Jamaican food
So when I first moved to Phoenix I immediately began a search for delicious Chinese food somewhere near my house
Their dinner specials are fabulous -  they come with rice an egg roll a crab puff and either sweet and sour chicken or what they call BBQ chicken it's no bbq I recognize but it's definitely delicious
The ton of food they give you is always piping hot and the quality never varies
I have a hard time straying from the lo mein and Andy F adores the sesame chicken but everything else we tried was just as good
This place is a real gem and one I recommend to everyone disappointed in Phoenix's Chinese food offerings
It's ok I say I am just hoping the food is worth it and James assures me it is
So I start off with a glass of velvet devil merlot and a three meat meatball appetizer that consisted of pork veal and beef with ricotta over cream polenta
I wanted dessert but as delicious as all the desserts sounded I just wanted some good ole fashion baskin robbins ice cream
The first time I had the fallen angel pizza I thought it was good
However I didn't feel it was worth the price and being the fattie that I am I really don't like to have distractions from eating my meals leaves falling in my food packaging on my ham
I don't know about you but a restaurant keeps me coming back with 3 main ingredients  1 good food at reasonable prices 2 General atmosphere & cleanliest & 3 Excellent attentive service
Not when I wanted good food or quick efficient service but when I was meeting a few friends on a leisurely weekend afternoon to drink a few beers and watch a game
The food quality thereof and flavor was fabulous
but so far their food has been consistently good
This place looks like a typical American franchise and I was not expecting the food and service to be very good
The spicy chicken salad with fire feta was a bit weird which is why I ordered it but in a good way
There are plenty of delicious bar food dishes to choose from
Overall the service was good but for the decor and presence of the Big Earls BBQ sign the food just didn't live up to it
Their pizza is quite unique and while I wouldn't say it is a favorite of mine it is still very good
I've been to Guido's a few times and have enjoyed the Chicken Parmasean Sandwich Spaghetti Italian Sausage Sandwich and the 1/2 Italian Sub at today's visit
Soft bread quality meats piled high a garlicky house dressing which really brings it all together = the perfect lunch
It was for the most part very good but not good enough to merit  say $37 bucks that I spent on a seafood stew over noodles that my daughter and I shared
The food was overpriced for the quality
I love super hot tears streaming down spicy but this burger was out for revenge and the amount of horseradish they put on the burger was just cruel
I think it could use more flavor not just a heap of the ass kicking horseradish they slap on
The food is really excellent- more real mexican than American mexican - which is a good thing by my standards
Fast food at an outdoor mall is not supposed to be good so we weren't expecting much
The food is delicious and fresh and reasonably priced
While the food was good we probably would not come here again due to not wanting food to go to waste when we receive items with meat inside when requested without and lack of hot sauce / salsa when doing take out
I guess it's a good thing you don't see piles of freshly sliced meat else it might not be so fresh after all
I highly recommend the miso marinated salmon and the tsunami roll were amazing
The caterpillar roll tasted good but really paled in comparison to everything else
I didn't get her name but one had beautiful black hair with the biggest victory rolls and it looks amazing
See ever since I took a trip to Tuscany a few years ago I am always faced with yearning for the freshest prosciutto the perfect cheese and bread and a wine to wash down the salty meaty goodness with
They don't have any music and the place lacks a lot of atmosphere but the food is pretty tasty
it is NOT CONSISTENT in its food quality and service
Most of time we had very good selection in dim-sum and the food was just good
he had only one comment about his dish that it was a bit on the salty side for his taste- otherwise he really enjoyed it
This is not just excellent Thai food for Phoenix this is excellent Thai food for the Bay Area
All of the dishes were richly flavorful and had plenty of sauce to carry over to the steamed rice
I got the chicken and tried the pork and its as good as I make
The meat tasted pretty fatty and didn't have any real flavor to offer besides oily
Yes folks the Hispanic community can cookor crudo seafood the same as the rest of the world and it is good
I love the seafood stew which is always filled with goodies like fish shrimp and squid
I wanted to grab desert too but i think i ordered enough for me to eat ill be back to get some Friday lol All in all it was AWESOME food but deducted one star for a lil greasy and some meat was dry but it was all good
They had a couple of different trays that were good corn souflee  big crunchy chicken wings and BBQ pork chops  all of which were real good
Why anyone thinks over-processed luncheon meat is good is beyond me
The chicken was cooked perfectly- very tender and sauce had a lot of flavor
Don't get me wrong - the ingredients are excellent and the pizza was pretty tasty
Their food is usually pretty good and it seems like a good place for novice sushi-goers to ease in to the world of raw fish
With that said their other specialty rolls are delicious
But I decided if the food was good then whatever
My daughter's grilled cheese was rather tasty for being a simple grilled cheese and I'd recommend the Mediterreanean chicken pasta that my wife had which was outstanding
This means having a place that delivers good pizza and wings is a must
A nice balance of Thai flavors and I thought it was quite similar to an Ayam Basil dish I used to get at a Malaysian place in Mt
Overall the menu is brief and the food is good but I don't think it's worth a long drive
The food is always high quality even if it's obviously a lot higher in sodium and calories than they'd like to admit
This retro chic quintessential neighborhood place gives us comfort food meets pub food with a unique twist and flavor to keep you coming back
Food stuff I LOVE includes the Vegetable Chop Salad maybe one of my top salads anyplace that's big enough fir an entree loaded with good stuff including fried okra and eggs and hard to pass up

If u have not tried chelsea's Kitchen then you have not experience amazing food and great service
With the yelp deal its incredibly cost effective to get full off of good indian food
- The food was good not great not bad but good
I paid $5 dollars for AYCE indian food that had a decent selection of food all of which was delicious
Yes the food here is actually quite delicious and colorful and fun and healthy and everything it claims to be
Yes it's a chain and sometimes feels like it but the beauty of chains is a dependable level or service and consistent value and food quality they deliver on all three
The fish tacos with the pineapple salsa jalapeno slaw and chipotle crema were sooooo delicious and the red chile pork  super spicy too
The maragaritas are great made with fresh ingredients and the owner and managers really love food and care about the quality of what's going out
All things considered the food and drink are amazing
I'm still a bit of a sushi virgin and while I thoroughly enjoyed everything my more seasoned sushi-eaters said that they had had better
I would recommend it to anyone and there are some great dishes for any sushi-haters to enjoy
I ordered the side Chef Eric's Caesar salad and thin crust cheese with pepperoni I highly recommend For GREAT pizza
Or drinks were quickly brought to us and or appetizers then sushi came quickly after
All were wonderful but the evil roll was by far my favorite and I loved the sauce it came drowned in
Our entree was eyes-roll-back-into-your-head good
The owner is Turkish and has developed an amazing array of handmade dishes he undoubtedly learned to love in his native country
Being a smaller business they make their dishes in house and the processed foods are swept away making this a quality and enjoyable meal
There are many fine Greek restaurants out in the valley that push out amazing dishes this is not a fine dining establishment like others filled with waiters and high priced side dishes
What Med-Fresh does is  push out amazing food at a good price and the locals have steadily fell in love with it
So I've never fully stepped into this store I was lucky enough to enjoy their goodness from afar but I will soon go grab me my own pizza after this amazing experience
I would go back and stick with meat and veg and follow directions on the sauce cuz this place is clean and could be both healthy and tasty if done the right way
its your basic buffet it seems like it has a larger selection than Ryans or JBs and the food quality is way better than both of those
Our pasta dishes were just as fresh and delicious
My husband loved his steak and 2 Seabreeze Cocktails vodka cranberry and grapefruit and I had a very delicious burger chicken soup and freshly squeezed Orange Juice
The cabeza also didn't taste fresh at all wasn't hot and had some off flavors that was hard to pin point but made me believe the meat may have been bad
Hot on the outside and cold on the inside is not exactly the way I prefer my food
I'll be honest it can be a bit intimidating walking in to the Meat Shop for the first time if you aren't a chef and don't know your cuts you may be afraid but don't fear just ask for help because the staff are excellent
Whether beef pork or lamb the meat here is always the best quality and knowing its locally raised and by people who care about what they are doing makes it even better
The charbroil taste of every bite along with the flavor of meat 1000island dressing and the veggies just sent this burger to the top of my list
Asked for a Spring Roll recommendation he recommended the Roast Pork and it too was Phlavorful and Phabulous
The chicken was good and the rice was rice
This place has consistently good food for amazing prices
My poor tummy can't handle spicy anymore and that's made finding good Mexican food that I can actually eat a bit difficult down here
All of the meats I've had are very good
So I have no particular gripes and I would recommend the place to others who are looking for good chicken noodle/matzah ball soup or a massive corned beef or pastrami sandwich
Everyone enjoyed the food the atmosphere is adorable and the service was impeccable
I could only hope the food was as good as I remember when I lived in on the Islands and it was
the butternut squash was sweet and balanced out the flavor of the beef well but i've had better steak
Black Chile is not your standard Sonoran style Mexican food that we Arizonans including myself love and use as our benchmark it is a bit more refined and every bit as delicious
I'd say scope it out on a given night and if you don't immediately get a good vibe roll across the street to The Coach House and grab a cheap pitcher and come up with a new plan for your evening
I got this appetizer dish entree-sized as my vegetarian entree and it's one of the yummiest dishes if you love pesto
Extra points for cool decor excellent margaritas and a bomb fried ice cream dessert
But as soon as I tasted my dish I knew that it was amazing
The food is very good but not exceptional
I'd heard that the food here was good if overpriced
The food was good but not fantastic the service was mediocre and the prices were a bit much
I'll get into the food in a bit but first I have to applaud Chang's for their amazing service
- what good is that when you make people sick afterwards with your insanely salty food eh
If you are in Phoenix on a layover please don't judge the quality of Mexican food in the city from what they serve here
I sat at the sushi bar ordered a couple rolls both were not good
From the deliciously aromatic crusty baguette; melty muenster; ample portion of roast beef- cooked to juicy perfection
They grind the meat in-house so the medium rare burger had a good texture ans taste to it
The chicken and waffle app was good but not that great also the chicken was raw in two of the chicken strips
So she likes meatloaf different than I do I guess but what I didn't like was the gravy it wasn't that good
I liked the lamb burger more but the meat wasn't seasoned well it couldn't get a salt hint from it at all but the topping helped to add flavor and it was good overall
Last the dessert the apple pie was very good not the best I have had but solid apple pie
The food is good and the manager is friendly
All were good I would definitely say it runs more on the spicy side and the food was what we expected
Most of my companions that night didn't actually order sushi and instead opted for Chinese dishes or Japanese noodles and other hot dishes
As noted in the number of stars I posted above I was not impressed with the rolls/nigiri I tried that evening
I found the sushi vinegared rice lacking in the flavor department and the roll ingredients to be subpar
Since it's been almost two years and a lot can change in two years for good or bad I will be back to give Sushi Ken another try
The flautas were crispy the shredded beef was flavorful and the sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese were just right
My fiance's beef enchiladas were good and he finished them all
I've been to Verde a few times now and the food is pretty good
I won't ever forget the woman behind the counter who so coldly denied me my slice of pizza
I was told Our soy cheese pizzas are so good you can't tell the difference between regular and soy cheese
The spicy tuna roll and squid salad were good though
The Macadamia Nut Chicken Salad is pretty good too and so are their kind-of-gross-but-good fried tuna appetizer thingys
The good  - large array of food vendors prices are reasonable- kids activities lei making Hawaiian name label etc- they keep the park public restroom open so it's a alternative to the potty johns- 2 different areas for endless stage performancesThe bad- malasadas are really oily- if it's a hot weekend it gets muggy out here luckily Hawaiian shave ice booths are not too far away
I'd strongly recommend Thai Spices to anyone looking for good Thai food in Mesa
I wanted cheap and easy and this place reminds me of Le Pain Quotidien in how it offers great food for reasonable prices and other market-style goodies as well
I must say in my book a little jazz and some good Italian food is a great way to spend an evening
I love their pizza as long as it is fresh if I can offer any advice only order what u can eat since the food does not taste as good the next day
I just love Sam Fox and all of his foodie goodness
I've been here twice and both times enjoyed my food and service
You get a pretty large amount of food and it's a good value
Flavor-wise the food kicked my mouth's ass
I rarely eat red meat so when I do it better be good
[Note This was during a weeknight happy hour special]A snooty sushi connaisseur would probably tell you that something is wrong with the quality of the sushi
If your needs are very simple and they are to stuff your face with sushi and have a good time shootin' the breeze with your buds Tanked Fish will meet them
The quality of fish is decent with a good variety of nigiri and rolls
Different quality of fish for sure but still a great bargain with good tastes
My food was cold even though it took 5 minutes longer for my food to come out than the my 3 friends' plates
Good food and a friendly staff typically make for a positive dining experience El Bravo delivers on both fronts
Anyways the food was great it was fresh and very tasty
Friend's meal Chicken chimi recommended by Jose enchilada style w/ green sauce which was an extra $1-1
My wife had the buttermilk roasted chicken along with a glass of their creative and delicious interpretation of sangria
And if you like uber spicy food like I do try everything Thai hot
Between the fact that this place is on the list for Dividend Miles dining US Airways miles and mostly positive reviews here I figured we'd get some tasty food
The side dishes were all very good seemed fresh and well prepared
It's tasty but far too sweet almost like a dessert bread
Food was excellent but I'm sure tired of these places where everything is a la carte
Tricks has made a name for itself based on quality dishes and prime date-night atmosphere
There was nothing special about it-- the sausage was baked in the cheese on top of the pizza which would make Bianco cringe and drowned the fennel flavor in cheese and tomatoes
The chicken wings were the perfect mix of baked and flavorful goodness
I've had the fish sandwich and it was pretty darn good
While their food is good it's the desserts at White Chocolate Grill that really stand out
Sticklers is cheaper Duck & Decanter has more choices and seemed healthier but if you want a heap of tasty meat with your sandwich this is the place
95 dinner - This roll is very pretty to look at and even more delicious to eat
The dish had good flavor and the portion was generously sized
The service has always been pretty good although food can take a little while
We were highly impressed with the quality of the food -- everything was fresh and delicious
This atmosphere was a bit 'cold' for me but the food distracted me enough to where it wasn't an issue
The chicken and waffle combo was very tasty but their fried okra wasn't the best and the lemonade was too sweet
I am still pleasantly full by this comfort food gem in downtown Phoenix and would recommend this to anyone
The food is extremely delicious yet simple
The spring rolls were really good too
I don't mind spending money on a nice meal but the quality of the food service and atmosphere doesn't justify the money spent
Ordered the brie appetizer wedge salad fish and chips and shortrib
The wedge was good but  the portion on the fish and chips was way too small
The staff was superb and friendly and the food particularly the fosolia was delicious
The flavors on the lamb and beef dish were pretty similar but it might have just been the combination I ordered
Good food good drink good times - HUGE portions at very fair prices
The pizzas are great and the perfect size for 1 while still sharing a slice the burgers fantastic be on the lookout for their burger of the week - always especially good and their breakfast is wonderful
For the main course I had the Nonni's Sunday Chicken which was again good but not amazing
They have a good selection of decent food
Palak Paneer - good for your vegetarian friendsChicken Korma - sweet and savory flavors in a creamyyellow sauceLamb Boti Kabab - the onions will melt in your mouthChicken Tikka Masala - tomato base with a little kickGarlic Naan I could go on and on
The food was good not memorable but good
The chicken was prepared well and the rib tacos looked good as well
I can say the tilapia tacos are topslarge filet on each on the list of my girlfriend's quest for good fish tacos
I would love to know what a good chicken taco is in your opinion I cant think of any besides maybe the California tacos at the now closed Chuy's but the ones my sister ordered from here were full of chicken and topped with a nice chipotle/ranch like sauce which is similar
I'm used to very fine food and was quite impressed with their culinary expertise
Excellent Japanese restaurant serving entrees that are comparable if not sometimes better than food you can find in San Francisco's Japantown
It was perfectly grilled with a lot of vegetable and meat with lots of flavor
I also tried the steamed buns which were more deconstructionist that I was expecting they look more like Asian tacos rather than meat enclosed in white puffy bun but tasted very good nonetheless
Not only was the food good but the dessert was just sinful
I will definitely be back because the food was really good and I hear there happy hour is pretty decent too
The menu has some gastro pub favorites  unique takes on classic dishes and then burgers fries appetizers desserts wines beers well drinks fluffy purple things
I would recommend drinks-room servicemoscow mule food- meat/cheese
Maybe their prices were too low for the quality of the food they produced
I ordered the meatloaf based on our servers recommendation
Then you can choose a cold side and/or dessert such as cole slaw or pudding
The phyllo pockets are great they come out warm and are packed with delicious chicken
Dimly lit fireplace cozy and tons of tasty meat
John told us the walnuts were rolled in cayenne pepper and rosemary and let me tell you--I'm a sucker for flavored walnuts in salad be they with spices or with sugar so I LOVED it
that wine was SO good that I've bought it from Whole Foods 3 times since visiting Jug
They have some great deals on basic sushi and appetizer choices and can someone say sake bombers
I also have not had a sandwhich or saladhere I have not liked the quality of the food frankly still surprises me as this local chain continues to expand
Their selection of sushi are excellent
But the sandwich although it was tasty it didn't have much meat on it
I opted for the 5 dollar July special which was curry chicken and it was very good
Good combination of meat veggies and a carb rice
The food was good but for some reason was not kind to my stomach later
Saying Mexican food in the UK means pretty much one kind of cuisine and a fixed range of flavors here we at least have attempts at many variations and regions  though mostly from the USA it seems and this is what I would consider to be the default  for  the type
All fresh all hot all tasty  if you are in the mode for Mexican a la USA without needing to shoot yourself for going into On the Border Service really good on the Sunday AM  kids eat free  food is generic to a fault and if they were to the cheaper side of the street it would be 3
went here with my Mom and the food was good but the service could use some improvement
Good selection of rolls and sushi and various non-sushi dishes for $3-$5
The meatballs were tasty but the whole thing could have used more sauce
I keep trying new things but haven't found one dish worth getting again
Once you take your first bite of food all the hullabaloo will be well worth it
If you're still not sold on the idea of carb-loading the salmon superfood is delicious and nutritious and who's not into a little superfoodiority now and then
I sent it back service was extremely polite and when it came back the food was hot but the pasta shell of the ravioli was undercooked and hard
If you're looking for awesome wings and very good pizza Red Devil is the place to go
Their BBQ sauced wings are amazing on a dish
OHSO salad with chicken was good pretzels were good yucca chips with dip it's guacamole
My dining companions ordered a wedge salad a wedge of Iceberg lettuce = B-O-R-I-N-G Caesar salad with grilled chicken pretty good so I was told and bean soup with hamburger meat
They bring you sectioned plates for all the dipping sauces a plum based one that's like a sweet & sour a yogurt curry one a creamy cheese one good with Buffalo chicken and a creamy veggie dip
That spicy chicken pizza looked to good to pass up
Too large to be able to offer truly good quality food
I'd trade the fancy interiors at the Arrogant Butcher for a hole-in-the-wall with good food any day
I have been to Sushi on Shea several times and have always been impressed with the food serviceand the food again
The people that go here understand the quality of the sushi
Why aren't there plates accessible next to the hot food items
The presentation of the food would make all the Iron Chef's proud and flavor beyond belief
This dessert was so delicious - the lemon was sweet and the goat cheese gave it just the right hint of sharpness
Both have been pleasurable experiences with surprisingly good food and drinks yet it is pricey
The food was great we split the crab puffs which were nothing special but still good
The food was hit or miss - the crab croquettes were amazing but the seafood paella was mediocre
The service was excellent as was the food
I know that the dish probably had five trillion calories in it but it was so worth it and my heart is still beating so that's a good sign
While it's kind of gross to see raw meat out it is always kept cold and is much better than the frozen meats at YCs
While the food was good I was disappointed with the service and atmosphere
The onion rings were super delicious i may be biased though because they are my favorite fried food
I compare it to Cracker Barrel not because it has a ton of crap all over the place and a tacky gift shop but because the food is pretty flavorless except when they decide to heap on the sugar
Dining experience was well executed but the quality of the food and price did not do it justice
Good food good service and nice environment
Came with fries the dreaded crinkle fries a very good cole slaw and a roll
While the food in the bar was very tasty the service was just all over the place
I drove away with an amazing vehicle with warranty no roll over from my previous loan on my own low interest and I have the monthly payments I was comfortable with
The egg rolls and wontons are tasty as well  sometimes I get dissapointed with bad eggrolls not this place  Fried rice is great and they give you wonton chips with your meal as well
From the second we walked in the door we experienced nothing but real people trying to help us enjoy a relaxing evening with dangerously delicious food and beverage
3- The food is stupid amounts of tasty and the portions are more than anyone would really ever need
Great atmosphere amazing service and food that makes your heart happy
I don't know if anyone spit in our food because of that but my dish sure tasted delicious
I do hope they add a meatball sandwich to the menu though; that seems appropriate and would probably be pretty tasty
Dessert was delicious but nothing special or very creative
With that said I thought their version of Kang Karie was good nicely balanced flavor to the curry but the chicken was dry as I find it seems to be everywhere
The noodle dish was a bit difficult to maneuver as the noodles were all glued together but once we cut them all up it was manageable and the Chinese sausage added an interesting dimension of flavor with it's classic 5 spice taste
Good Happy Hour with Reverse Happy Hour - The Poke stack is deelish the spicy thai pizza is sooo yum hmm pretty much all of it is good
My husband and I also often drop in after dinner for a delicious light dessert
First the Mac & Cheese was so very creamy and tasty that I had to stop myself from eating that and get back to the meat
It's hard to not give this a five and I may just end up doing so just to frustrate people that hate seeing perfect scores Seriously I was skeptical but after what seems like a streak of  3 star reviews I finally have something good to report on the end of the food chain I can speak to Is it the best chili cheese dog I've had
The texture of  fine ground meat  / amount makes it easy enough to eat and theirs actually has flavor in the chilli you know  unlike every chain that tries to sell you the same thing
Wife's  bare lettuce and meat burger was tasty with maybe a slightly enthusiastic shake of the seasonings  but to be fair if it was a fully dressed burger I bet it would be hard to tell
Besides the whole money issue the sushi wasn't even that good
As a Native person who appreciates the wonderful tastes and textues of traditional Native foods from the many tribes of Arizona
The service is always friendly and prompt the drinks and food are just as good as I expect every time I come in and the store has nice comfy chairs in addition to tables--perfect for hanging out with a friend reading a book or typing a paper
Oh my goodness the chicken was yummy but that corn bread stuffing was amazeballs that I wish I could order that up as a side dish
Amazing food great service will be back for dinner and would love to try their happy hour
The food is pretty good and above average for a sports bar
For apps yucca chips and trio of dips AMAZINGEntrees- Strazz-something chicken pasta scallops and New York
Our group was fairly big and they were able to keep our drinks full and our food came out in good time with the size of our group
Within our party there was mixed reviews on the food that they ordered some really enjoyed their meals while others thought the food was sub-par
I have never seen such a consistent kitchen staff as I have at AZ come in at 7 pm or call in an order at 1229am and the food will always be good
Eight bucks for a chicken pita with lots of chicken and absolutely no flavor whatsoever
The reverse happy hour really is a good deal especially when I just want to go out and grab a few drinks and some food with friends and not deal with any Scottsdale BS like you would encounter at a place like Sapporo
For happy hour beers are $1 off mini pizzas are 1/2 off and most appetizers are $2 off
Good fried chicken that meets my Louisiana standards is hard to find in Phoenix but this was really good in a different kind of way the seasoning was light but it worked with the dish
Prices were good food was good atmosphere was good  service was good minus a few missteps and the sangria was good
The staff at the front desk mentioned that the food there was pretty good
I'm used to the agedashi dishes from Gombei or Hoshi's - piping hot chunks of creamy deep friend tofu swimming in that wonderful sauce covered with bonito flakes grated ginger and radish
It has a great musician on weekends pit fires are going and everyone is enjoying tasty simple food and reasonably priced drinks around picnic tables
A few beefs-If I want to park my own car which by the way is a good quarter mile walk don't charge me $10 a night for the privilege
I ate here on a Sunday afternoon and was impressed by the food quality very friendly service and speed of service
The food filled the plate without being overwhelming and I found room for one of the Beaver cookies actually two large waffle-wafer cookies with a lightly flavored lemon cream between them
They have really good rice bowls and a large variety of toppings to put in them from curry to teriyaki to bulgogi to spicy chicken chili chicken and good veggies
In short I could see how the other offerings on the menu may be good and given the ambience and service another experience with different food may give better ratings but ya gotta do your ribs well if you are going to call yourself a BBQ restaurant
Nothing fancy or wierd just very good chinese food
One of my favorites is sizzling rice chicken verrry good
This will always be a neighborhood favorite  good food good service and good people
The food here is good exactly as good as you expect from the Waffle House
The fish taco was good but not good enough for me to come back here over Filiberto's or El Taco de Chandler
I haven't totally written it off; I may come back on a hot day for a Corona and a fish taco on the sand
The food is pretty good the prices are reasonable and appropriate
I also couldn't wait that long and ended up visiting you two days later craving good Persian food that is so hard to find here
If you're visiting Pearl for a low cost and decent quality sushi be prepared for the horrible customer service that comes with it
For starters the food is not great and the prices definitely fit the quality of it's food
For a little more money I would definitely recommend RAW sushi or Stingray
who asked us if we were here for Ethiopian or Raw food because the raw menus weren't printed yet new menus weekly-a good sign
The other room with lower wicker seats and curtains looked very cute but with much less light and we wanted to see the food as we enjoyed it
The best part of course was the injera on top of which the food was served when the flavors have soaked into the little pockets
I will definitely be back sometime in the next 3 weeks that I'm stuck here in Tempe to enjoy the excellent food ambience and company
I am the youngest person in there by about 40 years every time I go but I don't care I don't know anywhere else in the valley that has the same combo of charm service food quality and cheap prices as this place
We came here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and the service was good and the food was great
I had the Pesto Beef Panini and a basket of fries and it was so delicious
omg the grandma g's pizza with rosemary chicken and potatoes was soooo good
Now I will say that the food is very good taken home or back to the office but to truly experience it's greatness it should be eaten immediately at the restaurant or in your car in the parking lot so the toasted bun and everything else is crisp vs
They have a beautiful outdoor patio where you can enjoy some delicious pizza
The food was so good I wish there was one in LA but in the end we settled with an Oregano's T-shirt Menu Can Trust  to remember our great experience
Surprisingly the champagne was good when pared with the food
A switch flips and I can't stop once the meaty bones are in my hot little hands
It is really good pizza but most defnitely not worthy of the best pizza in the country
I thought the crust could have used some flavor so I really didn't eat it too burnt anyway but I really like how they blended the cheeses meats and vegetables for the toppings
LOL But after moving to Michigan for a few years and having no choice but to pay the super high prices the colonel commands from his troops customers  I was looking forward to moving back to Arizona and some good fried chicken
Gone were the days when I sat with my grandma and feasted on tasty fried chicken
LOL I only hope that someone at Church 's will awaken from this nightmare and start making the food that makes good memories instead of just making people sick
The food was pretty good; not sure why they were not as crowded as Lin's
I have been to this place many times and the food is still good staff is still friendly table is still clean
The only thing I actually halfway enjoyed were the chicken tenders
We then ordered a full-size dinner of Ginger Chicken to share mild i am a wimp but got the hot sauces on the side for the man
We are both fans of ginger and this was a really  nice light dish to follow a mostly fried-foods appetizer
The capers added flavor that was nice against the earthy/meatyness of the mushroom
I must admit though I did have the spicy salmon roll and wasn't too impressed
it was a delicious dish but the overlying flavor was of the bacon infused throughout the sweetbread and greens
during this course I finished my Riesling and tried a glass of the Super Tuscan a rich red wine that smelled of butter with plump-fruit flavors which grew subtly bitterer on the back of the tongueI finished that wine with several bites of Jamie's tender juicy Prime Beef Rib-Eye--I'd been craving steak for agesfor dessert we had the complimentaryvanilla-infused cotton candy
luckily it came in a tiny delicate stemmed dessert fluteanyway bottom line Noca is a bit pricey but worth every dollar---the service is friendly and helpful without being patronizing the atmosphere is boisterous yet cozy and the food is
They don't seem to care that much about the quality of the food perhaps because it's reasonable to assume that you'll be drinking and distracted anyway
The curry I got and the jerk chicken the bf got were good but the rice was
--heirloom tomato side dish was the one delicious thing
This isn't cheep it's not going to break the bank either so if you're drunk and need a cheesy/greasy fix hit up Little Caesars or Hungry Howies but if you want some truly delicious and satisfying pizza try Spinato's - you won't be sorry
If you like a combo plate with all the flavor and spice of Scandanavian food
A quaint intimate setting that's not pretentious where everyone inside is enjoying there company and the delicious food
This is my first experience with Turkish food and I must admit per Tuti's recommendations on food choices it was absolutely amazing
Excellent food excellent service excellent price
I am a chocolate fiend and this lacked that PUNCH of chocolaty deliciousness I demand from  a dessert
The babyback ribs were also tasty but not as flavorful and less meat of course than the St
Sauce is a place for some quick tasty quality food
Most ordered pizza but the pasta with red sauce looked pretty good too
Now onto the most important thing the food--delicious melt in your mouth perfect
We tried the steak fajitas blackened chicken platter quesadilla appetizer and it was all among the best Mexican I've had in at least a year probably last rivaled by an LA taco truck
So in sum amazing food amazing value casual ambiance they do have outside seating but no alchy on the patio so I know I will be back soon
What was as amazing as the food is that the prices were quite reasonable given the quality of the food and the experience
The dishes are very good though can be bland at times
The Thai spring rolls are also quite tasty
The pesto chicken sandwich and the big butter burger are quite delicious
The food is good enough but didn't blow me away
The total including tax and tip for our party of 4 was just under $150 and that included 2 appetizers a soup 4 entrees 1 dessert and 1 bottle of wine
I looooooooooove the food choices in the center although they were a little pricey but it was well worth the buck
If you've read any of my other reviews you might just know that I'm driven by good food with a great value and as such
I promise you this will be the most delicious burger you'll find in Phoenix in the fast-food market
recommended FoodFish 5/5 My girl's favorites are the halibutswordfishmiso salmon with basmati rice she also loves the spinach and asparagus
Sandwiches 5/5 for roast chicken with green chili side of coleslaw or balsamic salad 4/5 chicken caesar is good but sometimes is hit and missmeatloaf 5/5 best I have ever had it is a beauty
I am fine with it as the food I order is totally worth it
Chicken Basil Chili in a sourdough Boule   fairly tasty IMHO
Very tasty sauce and the meat was firm and tasted how a meatball is supposed to taste in both texture and seasonings
My friends both got pizzas that they thought were excellent
I frequent this Qdoba about once a month and have never been unhappy with food quality or service
The food is good for bar food of course although i don't venture out very far past their Hot Wings
First found out about this place through the yelp app for hot new local places and after reading about this place I was stoked and wanted to try it out for it being a sushi version of subway/chipotle
The sushi is basically average quality and is for those that are on-the-go and need it quick than waiting at a typical sushi shop
Overall it is a good place but it's not something I would crave for and rush there but more like if I'm in the area and not feeling other fast food joints
That aside the food was amazing we had the fried sweet potato app and the had to different styles of their signature thai basil dish
It was very flavorful and the meat was juicy in both meals
Pizza joints is a hot concept for a business but they need to refine their interpretation of it a bit for me to return
The pad gra pow chicken lunch special with spring roll and soup was less than $8 and absolutely delicious
I went here because I had a coupon for pizza they confusingly operate a pizza joint that is really the same place but for some reason they call it Snaggle's Pizza and pretend it's different but they don't but they do but - hell don't ask and I was anything but impressed
We tried the deep fried soft shell crab and this was greasy and salty the deep fried egg rolls with shrimp; again greasy and cold
There was one shinning dish  the tripe was delicious
Overall much better food quality at other places
The lobster spring rolls are a really good appetizer
The meatballs were a good sized and the bread was very fresh and warm
The steaks are generally excellent although on this last visit the cut of meat in my filet was questionable - it tasted more like liver
I got the impression that the jerk chicken was made a tad spicier than it should have been to mask a lack of flavor though
The food is just NOT GOOD and the entrees are OVERPRICED
The dishes are extremely flavorful as well as a work of art
It's very green the walls' colors make you want a fresh salad I think they did it on purpose the owners are friendly and most of all the food is SOOOO amazing
i stand by the 3 star review for the food for me personally it was good but not great hence the 3 stars
The waitress was extra nice in helping me decide what noodles were good and checked on me when my food arrived
I was in phoenix on business and im allways looking for some good eats  I found this place with the help of yelp and food network app on my i phone
I got the ramen lunch special which came with a California roll that was incredibly tasty and fresh and it came out to under ten bucks for a lot of food
since then my husband and i have ordered to go and we haven't had anything but wonderful dishes from here
Low mein chow mein hot pots fried rice dishes squid sauteed with green onions & peppers and so much more
Also while the vegetarian and vegan food selections are admirable they aren't that good and are overpriced
I'm in my 20s and still love to go with my friends bc we love great food and a good atmosphere
Just enough spice to give the beef good flavor
From @AZvern to @audreyrlwyatt to @TheDottsyZ to @ThomasWSmith to @lupnacca to @chrissyP71 to @cutepup8191 we all had a great time and enjoyed the old school food and service very much
With just a few selections it can get pricey for an appetizer but it was a reasonable portion of meat and cheese and presented nicely with preserves and toasted bread
With a shared appetizer two entress one cocktail 4-5 glasses of wine and shared dessert the tab was $180
The chicken wings were juicy and good though $12
Though you pay a little more here than at other places that sell bar food we think it is worth it for the wonderful ambience and the overall excellence of the food
I've eaten here three or more times now to know that the food's consistently good
The one thing I noticed is that everything tastes good because the flavors are blended together so well like they put care into cooking a delicious spicy dish rather than  just a flavorless spicy dish
I would have given this place a three if it wasn't for the pizza especially with the amazing happy hour price and the burgers
The food is fresh organic and very delicious
My favorites are any of the crepe dishes with a cup of French Hot Chocolate dessert in a cup yum
Even the fake canadian bacon tasted like real meat though more like bologna which I think is still delicious
SO MUCH FAILRegardless of whether the food was good or not nothing spectacular I am NEVER going back there again nor would I recommend anyone else to do so
The Food We started with oysters as our appetizer and they weren't too far off from the best I have ever had
The spaghetti and meatballs are so good I have had day dreams about them
For dessert their creme brulee is amazing- wow
Only problem is this food is really really high in calories duh but it's worth it
Any foodie worth their salt know the difference between Spanish and Mexican chorizo
The meat was nice & tender & the rice had good flavor
The caramel was pretty amazing but I don't know I don't think I'm a crepe person it was just an ok dessert for me
It was pretty good food but it was expensive
The service was so prompt and friendly and the food went so well with our hotel room screening of Die Hard 2 a solid sequel though a little limiting to Bonnie Bedelia's character that we just had to do it again the next year
We were craving the Monkey Brains ever since our last meal here an incredible melding of flavors and textures that melt in your mouth and wanted to try at least one of the Korean dishes
We ordered the Summer Crunch Roll Fried Shrimp Spicy Crab & Cucumber with Crunch outside and it was fresh and quite tasty
We talked a bit about the Korean options on the menu and he recommended the Beef Bulgogi Grilled Prime Cut of Beef marinated House Sweet Soy Sauce
Out come a long large rectangular plate with mounds of the most moist flavorful and tender beef with a heaping  portion of white rice and two delicious Mondu potstickers
We probably started eating our food around 830pm after being there for more than an hour munching on our appetizers which were devoured in seconds and sipping on our beverages
I ordered the chicken marsala which was really good actually but just way too much sauce
My friend and great dinner companion visited Rokerij and was I in for an unexpected wonderful night of food
I heard about this place but never really believed the food was this delicious
I have had a number of items on his menu the food is good
I love deluxe and also places like Stax which is good but not great deluxe is great btw not Stax either way the food was great not the service or annoying people next to me but i cant hold the restaurant responsible  the people behind me made me want to stab myself in the ears with an icepick service was crap but
The line on their menu describing the food as Authentic flavors refined is too accurate to improve upon
WHAT I'D RECOMMEND Going for their amazing happy hour as well as their Indian chai latte Chicken Tikka Samosa and Carrot Halwa
Good food nice portions definitely upscale but don't be afraid the food is down home and will make you feel good
Plus if you want some delicious food eat at the Blue Hound downstairs first and then head upstairs after dinner for post-dinner cocktails at Lustre
I was enjoying the medley of flavors on my plate and in my glass maybe a bit more carefully than my other 6 friends at the table so when the server cleared all of their finished plates and left me the only one with food in front of myself i was furious
some eggs chicken breasts spinach as well as an additional $20 worth of random sh*t that I didn't anticipate buying today
There are other pizza places in Phoenix with perfectly good food
Anyone that thinks this is good food must be of Irish or English decent
The veal meatball that my husband had and that I had to sample was also very good
Needless to say we loved this place not just due to the amazing food but also the atmosphere may be in a shopping area but still nice and cozy and the great staff who were very friendly
Food around the table-  Wedge salad - Good but obviously not a complicated thing to prepare
As an upscale restaurant I'm surprised they aren't a little embarrassed to serve such a low quality piece of meat
-  Ahi tuna a la diablito - High quality sushi that was pretty good
-  Had a couple of desserts and they were both good
Plastic cutlery is a turn off but who cares when the food is so good
Chicken Schwarma is delicious dolmades and hummas cross my table often
In fact my mom only orders lettuce wraps when we come here I had the Rosemary chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries and it was delicious as well
The food varied from good to mediocre
The staff and management was pleasant and welcoming and the food was very good
The food was excellent fresh & full of flavor
This is a good place to go with long-lost friends since you'll be waiting at least 1 hour if not more for pizza next door
I got a kid's meal which comes with your choice of a main dish a side of any choice small drink free refills for dine-in and a frozen custard with 1 topping any flavor/any topping
The chef was knowledgeable and made some excellent grilled fish and veggies
I sat at the sushi bar so I could hear then talking to the other customers about sushi selections and recommendations
The sushi chefs though rocked and I had a good time
The food was very good quality and not too salty
Building cool and funService On point and friendlyFood Sounds great great menu good sizesSo why only 3
Other than that the servers have all been friendly and the food is always delicious
Jalapeno's has a fun atmosphere good outdoor seating good service and pretty decent Mexican food
I wouldn't go out of the way but if you're up north and craving Mexican food Jalapeno's is a good bet
There wasn't that beefy goodness and charbroiled taste to this burgerI wanted to like this expensive burger as the location is terrific and the service even on a slow afternoon was quite wonderful
The food at El Encanto is good overall with a few small overlooked details
Ordered the chicken quesadilla appetizer and sat on the patio
If you want generous portions of really good Mexican food hop in your Chivy & whip over here ahorita
This place has tons of character & the food is very very good
My husband and I got a huge platter of fresh and delicious sushi for a really good price
The salmon skin was really crispy and delicious though that particular roll is a handroll in most places so I was a little disappointed that it wasn't here
like any other born-and-raised west coaster i know that a hole-in-the-wall mexican restaurant is where the good food is at
A good brunch for me is a fair indicator of how serious a restaurant is about their food
They have self serve all you can eat brown or white rice 2 choices of soup which were pretty good and some tortillas to add to your dish which was a delightful addition
I always get the salad with the chicken no need for dressing his wonderful bbq sauce is all you'll need
The cucumber soup was cold creamy and delicious with a substantial amount of crab meat in it along with caviar
The skin was not rubbery at all and gave away easily with a little resistancewhich is nice because super flaky skin is never good and a teeny bit of resistance keeps the skin together on the chicken
The skin to meat ratio was also good - in other words I didn't feel like I was either eating nothing but skin or that they were being skimpy with the skin
Soul Food Platter - My girlfriend and I basically ordered two dishes and tried eachother's dishes
In regards to side dishes I recommend getting the collard greens and red beans
Putting aside their pathetic excuse for ice tea food was not as good as i would hope for
At Daren C's recommendation a Smokehouse Burger was ordered along with shoestring potatoes & Amanda K's review called for an order for the Smoked Link Sausage platter & macaroni & cheese & beans were the side dishes picked to go along with that
When I took my first bite using a fork and knife like a good deep dish is always eaten I thought of Pequod's and Lou Malnati's
Food-Decent jade red chicken but basically tasted like good version of your typical sweet and sour chicken-Four kinds of fried rice that also tasted straight from a Chinese restaurant everywhereDecor-Dirty cafeteria style with a giant mexican panda statue which I didn't really find that endearing or understand with its thick belt of bulletsOther than the snickerdoodle cookie which I thoroughly and guiltily enjoyed rather than a fortune cookie Chino Bandido is basically Panda Express with more samples
I still like the overall quality and taste of the food but the value factor bottomed out with this one move
The avocado based one is also excellent but it's the reddish green one that simply blows me away with its combination of flavor and just the right amount of spiciness
My recommendation is to try all of the dishes that you won't normally find in your traditional Mexican joints
This place certainly is hyped and is well worth the trip if what you seek is italian beef which is done fairly well and is one of the best that I've had
the food was good and i loved the basket of different bbq sauces on the table
Another thing I don't get it why the french fries are FROZEN they tout Food Matters and where your ingredients come from matter more  We are committed to great flavor and excellent ingredients We are committed to food raised naturally and without the use of pesticides and harmful fertilizers Yet there is only a handful of organic ingredients on the menu and again they are using frozen french fries
The dish was gigantic-I could only eat half of it-and every bite of the tri-colored pasta was delicious
The dessert just wasn't as traditional as I would have liked-I like a ton of espresso soaking the ladyfingers but it tasted good and was served up generously
There are definitely some tweaks I'd make to create a better experience at La Torretta but I would go back for the atmosphere and that amazing tortellini dish
We have been going to the Chompie's on Shea for over two years and really enjoyed the Hometown NY food and atmosphere
The food is excellent and the service is outstanding
The side dishes served at the table are also very very good if you like Latin food
The pizza is decent but very appetizer-ish
I liked this pizza flavor better than the Other place but the crust may be just a little more doughy at this place and not as crispy but still good and thin
The food quality has suffered so much over the years and Im not even sure they are aware of it
The food is very good and really the owners add the little touch of care that I appreciate a lot
It is small the food is good it is what you need
The heat in the delicious food should have you breathing clearly in no time
I would recommend going with the least amount of heat possible especially if you're new to Thai food because the heat always tends to be way hotter than you anticipate
The food is good more Richardson's style than say Garcia's mexican style
We needed something good and cheap for dinner and are all about supporting local businesses when we can so we meandered over to the Plaza to see what the food court had to offer
We ordered the seafood trio which was nice and the fried mozzarella which was also good
I went here in search of a good close mexican food place and this is not it
Until we find a good Japanese bbq place in Arizona we are gonna stick with Korean food @ Chodang
*Portions = wonderful so much food/person*Area = not too desirable*Drinks = I ordered soft drinks not knowing that there were no refills
The food is delicious and the atmosphere is fun and hip
The food by that standard not the most amazing i have ever eaten
I had the lamb biryani and the chicken makhani which were both done good
The quality of food really can't be beat
I was pleasantly surprised by how good the food was
Go down to the B & G Cafe for some wonderful food and great hospitality
Important lesson learned is you don't need a large quantity of food when Chef Willie prepares QUALITY food
Plus their food is always hot and delicious
The lo mein was pretty decent and she brought us all of our dishes complete with all of the sauces; sweet and sour hot mustard
My mom is a fantastic cook and was really impressed with the food here
I am going to second Georgeann G this restaurant is always empty when I go in and I don't know why because the food is amazing
So if you love good Mexican food try Sonora sometime you won't regret it
I ordered the teriyaki chicken it was dry and the sauce was too strong with soy sauce flavor
The decor is a dive which I am normally willing to overlook if the food is good
But a funny thing occurred as we continued to eat we became less and less excited about the prospects of eating our food and more and more concerned about the quality of our meat and ache in our bellies
I would subtract more stars due to the frustration every time I visit but the food is just that good
The jade red chicken is the most popular item and for good reason but try it in a quesadilla and it'll blow your mind no really try it- the owner himself was the one who turned me onto this and I will never go back
And a free giant delicious cookie for dessert
I have a good amount of Cuban food and this is one of my all time favorite spots
Good ethnic food is hard to come by in the Southwest and this place sets a good example
I ordered the taco combo one ahi taco which was good however the crispy chicken taco was very bland and tasteless
I ordered my wedding favors from truffle trolley and had a wonderful experience
Overall my I would 100% recommend truffle trolley
his way of controlling his domain to me he was a little arrogant and a show off to his new young girl employ we ordered the cheese and meat platter with four different options the big push was that every thing was made in house although he was pushing the prosciutto which I said oh you do that in house he said no they get it out of Idaho / oh but then mr cocky was wrong then we finally found out it was from Parma  ok good but i have had this 1000000 times he also was talking  how fab the cheese port salute was and we should try it
The food is amazing and very well priced
Fine the waitress said she couldn't close my bar tab after checking with the bartender while she was getting our drinks and she didn't even ask my name to make a good attempt at pretending fine it was an hour and a half wait to get fries after ordering them fine the onion rings came out cold after waiting one hour fine the ham/egg/cheese sandwich came out cold probably sat at the window for a bit less than an hour fine the med-rare burger came out med-well fine when i tried to leave to eat at local bistro they offered to comp my food if I left that I never received I went back as waitress said food was almost done my big mistake fine they comp'd desert I didn't want that came out undercooked and had to  wait again for them to make a second attempt fine they dropped and shattered a plate on one of the guests at our table
At least food was better than McDonald's but at least there u get food within an hour that is cooked and they actually charge you the advertised price granted whether McDonald's is quality food
I choose to eat low quality food that will take 2 hours off my life rather than the 3 hours the grind @ greyhawk took off my life
Pom is great at making healthy food taste truly delicious and satisfying
I had the Green Protein Bowl which was full of fresh veggies perfectly prepared and had this delicious basil-macadamia creamy sauce that tops this egg/veggie dish off perfectly
When we got there they didn't have the daily specials up and were getting all their deliveries which cluttered up the whole front area but I'll put up with that for the quality of food they put out
The fish looks good but sometimes is fishy depending upon the day of the week
The rolls are fluffy and good the meat is flavorful I come here if I'm in the east Phoenix area nearly every visit
It's funny I was born and lived in New York got to live in Chicago and both cities take a lot of pride in their pizza and as a result I did become jaded and developed the false idea that good pizza only comes from these cities
This place had the most AMAZING meatloaf fried chicken and mac & cheese
I don't order meatloaf at restaurants mainly because I know it'll probably be dry or have no flavor but I had this feeling that Bobby C's would make it perfectly
There's pictures of all kinds of pork choppy type things stacked on other pork choppy type things sitting next to mahi-mahi grilled and fried shrimp my chicken katsu and other deliciously photographed things
With little options for a great dining experience with delicious food it's great that this place exists
We ordered the mixed grill plate for appetizers and chicken tikka masala and naan for the main course
Food is fresh and delicious which brings me back
PCG is PDG pretty damn good food and attentive service
We finally get our food and I will admit the tangerine chicken was tasty
The place only got a second star because the tangerine chicken was good but I would be hesitant to go here again because apparently my business means nothing to this restaurant
Overall from the service to the food to the ambiance an excellent place to bring friends or a date ;
Ika Kara Age Sweet butter marinated squid breaded to a crunchy finish  -  This dish was DELICIOUS the squid was cooked just right
Agadashi Tofu Lightly cooked tofu served in tempura sauce with bonito  -  This dish was a little bland you'd think that since tofu doesn't have much flavor
There must have been a secret sauce they put inside this roll because you got this amazing after taste
Spicy Tuna Roll -  REALLY good spicy tuna roll made me regret not ordering a spicy tuna hand roll
It was simple pasta with some Mexican flavors thrown it a dish that your mother would make if she had leftovers from Mexican Italian nights
Food was very good as you'd expect from a Fox restaurant
The service is always wonderful; the chicken curry is wonderful
I had the general tso chicken and several vegetable dishes all were good
I had the general tso chicken and several vegetable dishes all were good
I had Gnoochi which was terrific others at my table had chicken veal and salmon and all enjoyed their meal
I thought their teppanyaki beef and yakisoba was excellent
Usually if I eat out and love something its almost as good as I make but I've eaten here a ton and DDDDDAMN they rock my worldI don't eat meat but I have brought plenty of picky carnivores here and they all love it too
If you aren't willing to pack away $40-60 worth of regular priced sushi why bother
If you want decent food at a good price without flare then this is a good place to try
everything we tried was delicious and i ended up going with the rum chocolate i am so not a rum-flavored dessert person but it was probably one of the most tasty and original flavors i've ever tried
The dish was wonderfully infused with basil
We got to try the Thai lemonade really different mixed with tea and ginger Thai iced tea tasty and the awesome Thai mocha dessert in a glass
People should stop complaining about the price - this is really nicely done food with great ingredients plenty of vegetables lots of fish dishes good meats
The cheese fondue really puts this dish over the top it's perfect and warm and comforting and have a great real cheese not nacho cheese grossness flavor
I really like the ambiance of this place but I was not too impressed with the food to be honest
They have fairly delicious food - soups are good and their won tons are great
Dessert was a very rich and delicious Key Lime Pie
We actually had one order of California roll as an appetizer and the first quality I noticed was how fresh it tasted much unlike the kind that comes in a plastic carton from Basha's
In general the food was cold and not satisfying
Heck the restaurant was hotter than the food
So although the crust was good the pizza was hardly structurally sound flopping around in my hand like a fish
White tablecloth good cutlery big wine glasses open kitchen spicy dishes presented with flair - I'm impressed
I had beef Kiewan a delicious green curry that packed solid American-gauge heat
I have never dined there but food looks good
I bit into my roll with eager anticipation but was surprised/turned off by the bacon grease flavor
However the owners keep the experience open to everyone and charge a mere pittance for their amazing breakfast food
Both the service and the food were excellent
They attemp to make good desserts by loading them with butter
As for the cannolis while I was looking forward to those being the only good food because of some good reviews on other sites I was unfortunately let down again
Well even though the food was good we probably wont be visiting again
The Good The selection is great lots of meat It's affordable
The last two times I've been to CPK two different locations I split the BBQ Hawaiian pizza with no onion of course with whoever I was with and both times it was super delicious
For those looking for a tasty healthy alternative they have the Half Viking which is a grilled chicken breast served with sliced avocado and your choice of sides I recommend the spicy cottage cheese
That being said this Marriott has some pros- hot continental breakfast not the greatest food in the world but a decent variety including cereals yogurt waffle maker fruit bread bagels pastries and hot items like eggs sausage etc
Fresh and tasty is how I would best describe my food and my companions choice too
I enjoyed the food but I wanted to have a romantic night out with my boyfriend and they RUINED it
but saddly I found that my Pepperoni Pizza had virtually zero flavor
My friend ordered the Huehner Chicken Schnitzel which had a very good flavor it was the best part of either of our meals
I recommend it to anyone looking for simply great food
The service is right on point and the food is so comforting delicious and perfectly done
Foodwise the beet appetizer are hands-down the BEST beets I have ever had and you also can't go wrong with the brussel sprouts
I have been here twice and the service is good the chips are addictive and the food is yummy
I really seek out good organic spots hard to find True Food is pretty good
Finally their quality of food went from 'notable' to 'forgettable' so much so that I stopped ordering their specialties and went strictly with pizza
While their pizza is quite tasty there is a cap on the amount of pizza-and-wine dinners one can have weekly which was about the amount of time I put in there over the past few years
This dish is amazing and if you've never been to Japan and want to try something truly unique ask Mom to make you one
The sushi is excellent and the chefs even have a few of their own creations like the citrus roll that is made with Toro and jalapenos
I read some reviews that said it was expense but once you taste the quality of the food you won't think so at all and if you have ever been to Japan you will think it's a bargain
Also highly recommended  Mongolian Beef Beef and Broccoli Walnut Shrimp and the Won Ton soup
The only thing they don't do well are the egg rolls--for some reason these are not up to the same quality as everything else on the menu
When you walk in and you see the bubbling tanks of fresh fish & crustaceans plus a room full of Chinese diners -- you know the place is good
Diamonds fried rice all kinds is the best I've had in 30 years and all of their dishes are custom cooked to order and sered brilliantly hot
The one time I did get sushi it was pretty amazing
I would say the food is good but the malaise that I experienced on my flight back to San Francisco would persuade me to steer clear of this place again
My sandwich was lukewarm if that and literally just dry flavorless chunked up meat on a dried out bun
To make matters worse my food had gotten cold by that point and they hadn't bothered to reheat it
And yes I have had the pizza on 3 different occasions and it's not THAT good
I'm addicted to the hot and spicy noodles with beef would marry them if it were legal
Yes the pizza is amazing especially that crust
The food has been consistently good for decades but lately I hear and see a waiter who talks disparagingly about the owners and their other restaurants in Vegas
The food is good but I wouldn't say it's the best I've tasted
Went in for the pizza and ended up with a seafood pasta dinner that was delicious
I had a chicken caesar salad which had way too much dressing on it in spite of me asking for easy on the dressing but which was otherwise pretty good
It's rare to find a bar that serves excellent food but Pomeroy's is definitely at the top of my list
Anyone looking for good food on the cheap great service and the Cubbies or Bears on the TV
Step 5 If you wish end the meal with one of our delicious dessertsThe salad bar was impressive
We each ordered a different dish and we all enjoyed that which we ate
Not just for a great bar vibe but for amazing food
I am not sure if this was really such a good deal since the pizzas on their menu all sounded awesome and were much cheaper than the $30pp that we paid
I would eat here any time I was in the mood for a really good lunch without feeling guilty for stuffing myself with greasy food and over-eating
Most of my friends were completely turned off by the whole experience despite the cool decor and good food
The balance of bad service versus cool vibe and good food leads to a barely mediocre 2
All in all I'd say that's as close to Ethiopia as I hope to ever come and the next time someone recommends this restaurant or type of food it will serve as grounds to immediately never speak to them again and put a horrible curse on their sad existence
No one item of food was worth what they wanted
So we got the hummus appetizer which was pretty yummy and the special mushroom pizza that had i believe 5 types of mushrooms on it
Definitely worth trying once but I think there are other cool pizza places I would like to get around to trying too so it's not really a place I'm dying to go back to
The grounds were nice the food was good and the service was hospitable and friendly
Good food was a plus for sure and the outdoor patio is very pleasant
Fortunately I noticed Two Hippies Beach House yesterday night and remembered it tonight when I wanted some good food fast and cheap and fun
Four tacos one Green Beef one Cactus one Chicken and one Carne Asada were all very tasty
Loved the dish with garbanzo beans and spinach could bathe in that stuff all though I wouldn't smell very good
Meals are good comfort food and on-par value wise
Now in my foodie experience there is eclectic food that is just weird and then there is eclectic food that makes you say I'd never think of combining all that but damn that's good
It all worked together but it was almost like there were too many subtle flavors in the dish and it added up to it being a little bland
Overall Grade = B+ Very GoodThe EV Foodie
Sandwiches are my favorite food by far I guess I'm just a lame ass like that and Dilly's makes a damn good sandwich
The food was dry and no amount of spicy mustard could give it flavor
so I get a text to meet at this spot and I put the name and address together and im like wtfmakes no senseim inso im thinking some wannabe swank mockery of a white trash bar/grillWrongI was shocked and overly impressed by this restaurant/bistro 70 decor spotthe food is orgasmicly infused to take you way back to comfortable times and drinks that will blow your mindthe lemonchella blew me out of the waterone its just like my grandpa made and twoBig in az
The service was extremely friendly and for the quality and quantity of food this place is a real bargain
However the food had a nice home-made quality to it and was all ready in about a minute
Peeps are right about the high-quality ingredients and the food is inexpensive
I attended the 2008 Christmas party of SYNERGY HomeCare of the East Valley and was introduced to the wonderful food from Joe's
Seriously - as good as it gets - the food atmo and service couldn't have been better
1/2 price sushi appetizers and drinks on those days
Their sushi is delicious and they have a wide variety
Inside the atmosphere is pretty sparse but the friendliness of the people the incredible prices see the menu pics I posted and the delicious food more than make up for it
It was very good - the bread was perfectly cooked and the meat and cheese were very complimentary
The first visit I sat at the bar and I was treated great and the food was good
The desserts are similarly fresh-baked huge and delicious -- having had both the 5-inch square brownies and cookies
I don't know much about rating food but the food here is so decadent that it gives me stomach aches afterward which I guess one can take as a sign of high quality
And the flavors of the chinese style chicken inside the mexican cheese quesadilla were perfect
The broth was tasty beef was delicious the veggies were fresh and our server came by and suggested sauces we needed to add for the optimal flavor
My wife had the Chicken Picado which was pretty flavorful and delicious
The chicken was flavorless and the amount of cheese on the thing was pretty disgusting
In this case the chicken remained moist and flavorful
The portions were amble but with quality ingredients; boneless skinless chicken breast all white meat sliced chicken in the stacked enchiladas roasted pepper sauces fontina and goat cheeses
At Otto's they wouldn't even think to mention their ingredients because you have no question whether or not this is good food
Excellent sauce tender chicken great cheese
For dessert try one of their excellent pastries and cakes it is in the name for a reason
our waiter was personable and attentive the food was surprisingly good and the ambiance just right
I just stood in line for 15 minutes for the value food items got 2 hot dogs & a popcorn
Okay I love your convenient packages of delicious healthy  frozen items like calzones burritos  lasagnas and even desserts
the must havesfish tacos esp the mahi mahitheir pork shoulder-carnitas stylechips and salsa w/ queso-appetizerthe huckleberry margaritawhat the heck is a huckleberry
Overall great beer although selection never changes great food and a excellent atmosphere if you can get a spot outside
I think I was really impressed by the food once out of six visits or so and the rest of the times I just enjoyed the atmosphere and drinks on the patio with family or friends
The food is good but doesn't blow me away for the prices and hype
I had an Asian salad wrap that was good but too much dressing made it fall apart and it was difficult tomeat
My friends had the open-faced hot beef sandwich and mashed potatos
The chicken fried steak served with creamy gravy and rosemary potatoes and topped with one of their delicious farm-raised eggs was ridiculously good
But lets be clear -- this was damn good food
Friendly people really good food charm and HUGE portions
I guess you pay for the show and not really for the food because you get the same or tastier meals from other vietnamese/japanese places without spending too much $$ but definitely worth the try if you wanna experience having your meals prepared in front of you
The desserts especially the cupcakes are truly tasty and you should go out an try them
There was 13 of us in the group we had reservations from a week before and every one of us was talking about how much we enjoyed the food and service once the night was over
We ordered 3 appetizers 3 bottles of vino 13 dishes and did not have a single issue with anything over the 2 hours we were there
I faced a lot of disappointments and mediocrity before I found Thai Lahna and crowned it my valley favorite but while I have enjoyed consistently good Thai at Thai Lahna I have never gotten that glorious rush from eating their food
Rather than list everything I love about this place I encourage you to get a DD hop on your bike or take a cab on down to the Papago belly up to the bar grab the beer list or consult the usually very helpful bar tenders and prepare yourself for some good food and even better brews
The Lobby Grill is incredibly overpriced and the food isn't close to as good as it ought to be for the prices they charge
Long story short this restaurant is overpriced and the food is not good
The employees there are good and the food is exactly what you expect
All in all the food quality is excellent
Answer Nice crispy toasted English muffin meat of your choosing let's go with Canadian Bacon creamy delicious Hollandaise
There is a new KM who has swiftly addressed the food quality consistancy
One definite plus is the consistency in the quality and flavor of their food
We were seriously craving some excellent Mexican food and found it at Loco Patron
But the Corona battered fried fish tacos were fantastic - complete with an avocado type sauce on the top of the tacos completed all of the flavors
I love Vietnamese food and flavors and here they were in a convenient little bread pocket which they make fresh on the daily
Appetizers include falafel hummus dolmades spanakopita zucchini mushrooms and even chicken nuggets and jalapeno poppers
great food great atmosphere and good people
I personally enjoyed the food we had a set menu and the food just kept coming out everything from their biscuts to the cotton candy was excellent
Their food is very good much better than most fast-mexican type places like this and their prices are cheap like a 1
For the price and quality of food this is one of the best places in the area try a few taco's and see for yourself
The nachos were really good make sure to add steak or chicken both are great and they give you a lotta guac too
I compare all chinese food places to my favorite place good china located at 67th and Thomas so that is why it is very hard to beat for me
They were sauced to perfection - not glopping off with every bite but yet a good counterpoint to the dryness of the meat itself
While the menu looks pretty good I think breakfast might be the only saving grace here the lighting for dinner the service and the food were all exceedingly below par
This location is clean the staff is friendly and accomadating and the food is good
The food is also very good and seems to be served all day and night
As for the rest of the food we tried the pollo parilla was very good
The food came pretty quickly and everything was good
and right after that the fresh juices area and the festive hot foods dining area
I am always astounded by the array of fresh frozen packaged and hot foods at this place; and it's pretty much the same for all the Phoenix Ranch Markets though I prefer this one in Glendale because it seems cleaner than the others and well it's the closest to where I live ;- Love ya Phoenix Ranch Market
Love your tasty foods your prices your amazing variety of goods and your fresh donas doughnuts that kicks Dunkin's ass
They don't carry it as a main dish so you have to pick the appetizer
LGO what the cool people call it has good food and is a very popular trendy place to hang out
Overall it is a great place in a good location with good food good ambiance and is a good place to take kids if you have them
Standard breakfast food and good price/performance ratio
no expected that you'll cover your food in real butter wether it's good for you or not
The staff is amazingly friendly the food is always fresh fast and delicious and the ambience is interesting but always pleasant and usually quiet
If you want something different and want to try their chicago style pizza then I recommend the Numero One-0
We were originally heading to Rice Paper for some pho but got sidetracked by the idea of pizza and decided to check out Humble Pie since I had heard good things about it
Was a really delicious yet light served as a medley of seafood with avocado citrus white asparagus and lime sauce over greens
There are many interesting condiments to add to your food I really enjoyed the spicy red one with carrots
We ordered three wonderful tacos fish chicken y chorizo and shrimp chile verde a mole tamale the mole was AWESOME and some very tasty guacamole
Our food was pretty good however our service was not so great
I love Vienna hot dogs but that is the only reason this place gets 2 stars is cause they use Vienna beef
The Chinese food is what you'd expect for the prices-- tasty a bit americanized but still very satisfying
In there defense they knew they messed up and treated our party of 10 to free desserts which were really really good
We had some drinks and some food and a good time was had by all
Love their California Rolls The Las Vegas-wonderful
This week it was chicken so I stocked up and we'll be good for a while
I expected a more boutique pizza but for the money this is good thin crust pizza with a tangy sauce and good cheese
The food is good but somehow not quite as good as other locations it doesn't seem as fresh
Just watching the crowded scene at Sushi Roku and the W Hotel was enough to keep anyone occupied
All of the desserts sounded so good we told our waitress to surprise us
|The food was tasty but the experience ruined it
After a long week of running a partner conference myself and the team wanted something unique to Phoenix AZ which had a good steak and seafood combo
It's not always the cleanest place I've seen the trash overflowing on a few visits but the food is always good
I had the chicken something or another that the server recommended and it was the best dish of the bunch
When you walk in you're smacked with the delicious smoke from the FIRE-GRILLED meats they use for your meal
I like the decor service from our waitress was good not so much for the table next to us  and the menu had some great sounding dishes on it
The sauce that came with the fish was a little weak in flavor otherwise it was good
I liked it better then the fish for sure but it was equally as good to what my brother got
Food took a long time to arrive and was not hot
Service was so-so waitress certainly wasn't enthusiastic This place is akin to a typical tasteless truck stop breakfast joint If you want great service tasty fresh food go Matt's La Grande Orange and Orange Table
I'm stoked I finally got to try the food here well worth the wait
I ordered the hot chicks which were buffalo chicken pattie/things on yeast rolls with fries
Which was fine but the rolls are super soft and I'm not sure if they complimented the hot chicks to their maximum potential
preferred the BBQ pork over the beef pieces but the leftovers weren't as good-- I threw them out after the first bite
Just hit up Slices right across the street if you want good pizza
I took the sandwich home and found the sandwich on sour dough to be a good healthy alternative to the typical fast food fare
My fish was cold and had a slight stinky odor and though they say that they fly it in 3 times a week from Fiji I was quite surprised about the difference in quality
This unique store is a favorite among many healthy foodies and is the source for all things herbal and the home to wonderful vegan and raw foods
Every time customers enter the store they are greeted by the wonderful aroma of herbs and spices; and the view of a display case filled with petite delectable chocolate desserts
OVerall the food was good however the service was crappy
The food was good - nothing extra special
I highly recommend that dish to anyone who likes seafood - it looks like it would be spicy with the chili and sriracha but the dill aioli and the buttermilk coating on the fish blend out the spice so you get the flavour of the spicy ingredients but not the heat
but between the pleasant service and the delicious food I would definitely eat there again
Well besides the band who was probably a bit miss guided in ther music taste I have to admit the food was good and hey the bread basket is awesome
The steak is served on a freakishly hot plate and once you applied the emergency kit band aids to your fingers the medium rare piece of meat turned into medium well
The chiles en nogada was an interesting dish but it had so much going on that all of the flavors were muddled  roasted poblano chicken walnuts apples apricot red sauce almond sauce cilantro pomegranate seeds cheese
The appetizers are good and the service was pleasant and I will have to wait to try a dessert till next time
No hand tossing no hot real pizza oven no bubbles in the crust not character
the Popeye - a pizza highly recommended by fellow Yelper Aileen B
We ventured back a week later and started with the pepperoni pinwheel appetizer - a small stromboli-like roll of cheese and pepperoni encased in the fantastic crust
A wonderful pizza with the same fantastic crust we enjoyed previously now topped with spinach goat cheese ricotta and thin slightly crisp slices of roasted garlic
But there are some days when I earn for the simple straight forward Chinese food I remembered eating growing up on the East Coast where good eats were plenty in the Chinatowns of New York and Philadelphia
Well I was pretty excited to discover Nee House- I love the food there- it's simple and it's always good
The decor is simple and unpretentious- I always feel relaxed there and know that I am going to get fed some mouth watering delicious dishes
I love to eat out and try to do so as often as I can or cash flow allows so me and girlfriend tried 2 apps with 2 main dishes trying to get a feel for the food and enjoy a good dinner
Second we have a seat take a look at the menu and the server greets us by the way nice server but kind of spacey he takes are drink orders and recommends a few dishes
If the food were amazing the price wouldn't even be an issue i
Food might have been good but the place was just one of those joints that time forgot
I really like their meat section and the manager specials can be a really good deal
They have this spicy chicken breakfast sausage ground like chorizo which is excellent mixed with eggs or in an omelet
Their deli meat is also very fresh and delicious
Fries were cold and beef dip dry however wifey enjoyed the salad
There were some pro's about this place Service was decent and some of the food was really good
Now onto the other food Hubby said his pork chimichanga wasn't bad and that the pork was cooked well but needed more seasoning my chili relleno was ok but the batter had a weird texture to it and my spinach enchilada was not very good at all
My real problem was that the waiter didn't warn us about how much food the appetizers were
Two split appetizers and one entree apiece is way too much food
Anyway I hope they start warning people about how much food they are getting if they order multiple appetizers
The pasta is amazing the meatball sandwich is awesome never had a bad appetizer
95 hot wing night happy hour and had cheep drinks plus a complimentary grape tootsie roll shot
The chicken quality is ok but has a good portion of dark meat in it
The service was very good decor top notch and the prices very reasonable for the quality of the food
Overall the food was above average and worthy of high praise
My beef/pork/noodle combo was pretty good and was excited of the concoction
- We ordered received our appetizers in ok time and then waited another 40 minutes until our meals began coming out we ordered special courses - big mistake- Each dish came out somewhere between warm to cold for sure sitting around-  Even if warm the quality was not anywhere near the caliber of what a similarly priced meal at any other high-end establishment around town would be
The food was perfectly prepared top quality and tasted superb
The food was tasty for what it was but I only give it 3 *'s because its just so unhealthy
Food was ready pretty quick and order was hot correct and delicious
The meals are cheap and you get a lot of good quality food
*snicker*Overall service was ok but not great the food was good and the decor/ambience was a bit of an enigma
The shepherd's pie I had the second time around was good enough but the so-called horseradish mashed potatoes on top just weren't horesradishy enough to satisfy a kid who grew up in the horseradish fields of southern Illinois
I ordered the fried spring veggie rolls $6 that were delicious
By itself it's not exactly a flavor rush so wrap some up in the lettuce and mint and dip it into the fish sauce
The meat is incredible quality I got the Louie XVI which was cured ham turkey havarti let/tom/onion and amazing mustard
Overall we really enjoyed this place and found the sushi/food to be excellent
The dressing is creamy delicious & the chicken breast is perfectly prepared leaving it moist and finger lickin' good
I loved the pizza that must be done in a really hot oven leaving the crust browned and crisp topped with plenty of chicken bacon and a very tasty sauce
Also some random ordered us a round of Washington apple shots so that made the food taste even better
Also tried the Barbecued pork slices and they might have been good a week earlier but the dish did not taste fresh
We ordered an egg roll and it too had an odd flavor
My faves are the ZBQ barbecue chicken pizza and Thai delicious peanut sauce
There is no dearth of quality pizza in Phoenix
A great pizza that has flavor and won't give you a coronary
Ok here is the analysis of the demographics of Frozen Dessert places2 - 12 year old boys and girl all ethnic groups of middle income Parents take you to Baskin and Robbins2 - 12 year old boys and girls in lower income familiesYou get a cone with one scoop from Rite Aid for $1 OR you stop the guy in your neighborhood with the pushcart and bell on bicycle wheels13 - 36 year old Females on the coasts of Asian descent You go to Pinkberry or Red MangoOver 40 men Go to TCBY at the mall or bring home a gallon from SafewayArizona or California men with young kids Take your kids to Cold Stone Creamery
You get the big waffle cone they take a couple of spatchula's and mix flavors for you and add ingredients as if they were today's Julia Child making dessert and they charge you a minimum of $5
Mexican food purists would be turned off by this place but it's a fun joint to get a good couple of tacos
We were looking for GOOD NY-style pizza and great wings
We love the delicious and fresh pizza with great quality ingredients
This was a surprise to us because we have been to Carrabba's numerous times and have always had excellent food and service
Carrabba's a great place good food and great management
I'd recommend the chicken tortilla roll-ups or the egg salad sandwich
My noodles were good but they were the premade style noodle the wide variety of vegetables and texture of tofu really made this dish shine I really like the skinny green beans and thai basil
The feta cheese used on the dishes was very tasty
The desserts were good too our favorite being the one with phyllo dough filled with mascarpone type cheese
This is the eighth Souper Salad I have tried around the Valley & it earned the usual 4-Stars for it's clean cheery atmosphere good service & fresh tasty food
The Pepperoni Pizza was good too which is unusual to me for a non-pizza restaurant
They also have a dish that gives you cold cuts in addition to the potatoes onions and pickles
We had gone to Humble Pie the week before to try pizza and were not impressed so we're happy to now have a spot where we live that we LOVE
After I read the menu and not only saw but smelled the delicious food coming out of the kitchen I actually felt guilty for being Vegan
see pics Not only was my dish Beautiful it was Delicious
It was a well thought out dish from presentation to flavors
I swear the server telepathically took our app order as the spring rolls arrived to the table hot and crispy before I had even squeezed the lemon in my water
Along with the chicken satay they were both good not out of this world however
Rickie's chicken noodle soup was flavorful yet the chicken was hella funky
Let me tell you the food was good - I ate my entire breakfast
The Roasted Pork dish was great but was only 4 small pieces that came with a bland side of grits no justifying its  worth at $17
The food was delicious I give them that but the portions were very small and the sharing concept was gimmicky and complicated
The Supreme pizza was very good but came without the thin crust I'd requested
our dinner companions ordered the spicy shrimp dish and although i didn't taste both said it was hot and spicy a description i took in earnest as one of them was mexican
The food was tasty and the sauce was a sweet tangy vinegar based one
The variety is of smoked meats fixins and other Southern inspired cuisine is worth noting
Been looking for a good Italian sub shop that cranks out a nice chicken parm sub
I would give them a try again as the menu is varied and I would give another dish a shot
Friendly staff wholesome ingredients inventive topping combinations and a tasty slice are enough to keep me coming back and two slices and a drink and a drink always seem to cost a buck or two less than other downtown pizza joints
For how much food you receive in a order even for the appetizers it's such a disappointment to look at how much goes to waste all because it's so bland & boring
The food is good for a burger joint and the service has always been great
The food was good but I expected it to be better with the prices they are charging
Great appetizers/finger food awesome sandwiched and 30 different salad for the healthy minded
Somehow the seven mares appetizer soup has turned me onto other soups the shrimp soup here same thing but less seafood Japanese udon and the lagman at Golden Valley Uzbek
Inside the box the sandwich was in was an italian pepper that helped add a great aroma to the food as well as a giving the sandwich extra flavor
I never would have guessed based on the big sign outside the framed poster from Guys Big Bite on one wall the caricature of Guy spray painted directly on the wall the autographed photo of Guy on the other wall or certain dishes on the menu labeled as being featured on the food network
I have only had the capellini with meat sauce and the marinara sauce is worth raving over
We don't mind paying for good food but the prices do not match the du00e9cor or the service of the place
Boyfriend has also enjoyed the Sicily pizza before
My soup was tasty but lacking any chicken
Groupon got us into Sandstone Cafe and although I recommend it for the food you need to understand a couple things
The food is worth waiting for even if they are shorthanded
The bread was tender but sturdy the condiments fresh and delicious the meat at a safe medium was perfect flavorful juicy
I can't say anything for the dinner crowd but get here before 12pm order off the lunch menu and you'll have a healthy portion of fresh delicious Mexican food in under 10 minutes
I recommend full-tilt the lamb vindaloo chicken tikka royale with cheese bangers and mash the salmon one I forget what it's called--literally everything here is delicious
I will deal with slow service for the food but good gravy I wish they'd get a clue on this point
Sometimes I go there and it's wonderful--I get my booze food and check in a time frame reasonable for human living
The quality of the food is excellent and the wait time is short
I am basically a creature of habit and always order the same thing - General Tso comes with rice & egg roll and a small hot & sour soup
The service and food quality has never let me down and I will continue to make this my primary choice in Queen Creek
We were quickly seated given great customer service and most importantly served wonderful food
The food is authentic and worth any amount of waiting lunch they are quick I've waited longer for dinner when they've been busy
Shwarma beef is also a recommendation I've had it over 20 times
High quality beef with arugula and a blend of cheeses onions and bacon
Our server was just attentive enough to not be MIA but if I'd waited for him to come back so that I could point out my lack of yummy pork product I'd have been sitting another 15 minutes with food in front of me that although lacking a bit was fairly tasty
Would recommend to anyone that likes good food and friendly people
The service was good and the food was very fresh
The service was decent the food was amazing
The food was filling and made a good start to the day
Popular friendly and clean chicken and waffles spot that's worth the wait
4 stars- Chicken crispy and well seasoned but not too greasy tender meat inside- Cornbread sweet moist mongo muffin with crispy edges- Waffles like that you can get them cooked with pecans in the batter though wish they'd make em a bit crispier- Fried okra I always order this when I see it- Fun drinks 4 different flavors/colors if kool aid and super crazy the way the southerners like it sweet tea- Atmosphere dinery slick red booths- Service very friendly and food came out quickMidlights- Mac and cheese I didn't care for the sour creamy taste of this particular version but my cousin loved it- Red Velvet cake we're a fan of this type of cake but this rendition was just ok
Moist soft cake was great but the flavor was lacking Lowlights- Long wait even Sunday at 230 there was an hour wait- Ran out of banana pudding the southern hub's favorite dessert he was looking forward to ever since he saw the commercial
The salmon tasted like it was food quality and freshly smoked however it was very salty
I was a little disappointed because the reviews were so great and the food looked delicious upon presentation
a truly family run operation serving up good pizza in a friendly atmosphere
Although there are a number of locations throughout the Valley now I remember when living in Ahwatukee going to Nellos and seeing the late Pat Tillman his wife along with his brother and Jake Plummer eating pizza and having a good time
The meat was good quality the pork was spicy and delicious just enough to make your nose run but not enough to send you screaming around the restaurant
I have to say the radish kimchi was spot on for flavor and by far my favorite
I'm sure it's excellent -- but after waiting on line for 30 minutes on a Saturday morning we sat down and realized that their menu is pretty small and almost all dishes contain some sort of pork
I'm sure it's great if you like good ol' home cookin' diner food but for this New York food snob the choices are too few to wield my wallet
Surprisingly this place has good food
as are all over priced banquet style Thai places that place a premium on marketability at the expense of food taste and quality
True Isan food is amazing - usually eaten with hand fulls of sticky rice - larb ground meat mint and lime  som tum papaya salad gai yang grilled chicken and sai krok isan isan sausage
The fried chicken is great and the waffles are amazing
Whie our food was being prepared we enjoyed our chips and salsa which was VERY good I must say
The guac on the chicken flautas were good however the flautas were a little over cooked
A couple of brews good food good tunes and good conversation you should be set
The quality of their food has decreased from when it first opened
Drinks appetizers and desserts were all awesome
I was asked repeatedly how the food and service were and I said it wasn't good
My son likes to eat at the sushi bar because they give you an extra little treat a crab appetizer and you can see the TV
Friday and Saturday nights you can wait up to 20 minutes for a table because the actual restaurant size is so small but sooo worth the wait if you want exceptional sushi
We had no wait and the food was really good I got a shredded beef cheese crisp and my coworker got the chimi plate
So much vegetables and beef with great flavor
*Food = pretty good homemade*Price = good go through the entertainment book if you have it
Not sure how authentic the food is but I like to think I know what GOOD food is and this place has that
The quality of food here is consistently amazing
Enjoyed the Portabello-Chicken Pasty w/ a salad and finished every bite okay I split it with a friend their servings are plentiful
Must say my focus was more on the company than the food but here's what I can tell youFriends ordered the Lobster Spinach Queso for an appetizer
Tasty Mexican fast food at reasonable prices is what I've experienced
Crispy fish well portioned wrapped in a flavorful tortilla filled with cabbage and pico de gallo
You can get some delicious appetizers and desserts to accompany the dozens of wines they serve
Drunken Noodles - B The meal was pretty good it was not really spicy so if you're not in to hot food your safe
It's dense and moist but the devil's food taste it's chocolate cake with about three bottles of red food coloring in it for those of you that think red is the flavor is weak and the cream cheese frosting was so thin that there wasn't nearly enough to lubricate the bland meaty red slice
The food was ok but what I really liked about this place was the fun owner who sang happy birthday to me and it made me blush and the drool worthy desserts that they offer
The food was blah the prices were too high for the low quality food and the atmosphere and decor of the place was rather cheesy
The chicken fried steak was good the country gravy was spot on
I chose to eat Filipino food and it was really good
If you enjoy good Filipino food or you've never tried it this is a good place to go
If they we're really serving Mexico City food it would have some flavor
get boxed mac n cheese hot dogs peanut butter and jelly chicken noodle soup or even a can of spaghettios
Around the table someone ordered the pork chop and found it pretty tasty but that was about as good a thing anyone else could say about their dish
Everyone enjoyed their food our friends really liked the dirty rice
My dish was absolutely delicious the etoufee sauce was smoky/spicy and very flavorful and I as well loved the dirty rice The fried crawfish was ok nothing special
We have friends from New Orleans who are great cooks and they enjoyed the food here as well
& their fake 'chicken' is seriously some of the best Ive had across the country ---- try the OG Poo Boy sandwich a spicy buffalo 'chicken' sandwich on a sub roll so delicious or I usually get the Ranchero Salad Buffalo wing style instead of BBQ
We ask the sushi chef to make us something special and he Joe always makes us an amazing assortment of sushi
The first we ate me & hubby   we can't believe OMGvery delicious BBQ  we always order no 1 and no 20  next time no 1 and no 21 or 22 not order to muchbecause the food to much
We ordered spring rolls for appetizers a couple of beers and entrees
My family enjoyed ordering food from the menus instead of waiting in long lines at Harkins
The worst values here are like sale prices at Fry's Food & the best are just amazing
I have been here quite a few times and both the service and food have always been excellent
I have tried their ribs salads fish and steak and they've all been delicious
Stick with any the noodle soups and you'll be good to go rice dishes are a little stingy
The food because of this crazy loss of direction has become eh quality
Focus on making simple flavorful and quality food
Take the simplicity of that dish and figure out how to enhance the flavors in it
That being said Thai Elephant was pretty good and definitely worth the visit especially if you work downtown and want something different from bar food and sandwiches
Completely fresh ingredients and a good flavor but probably not making it on my dying food request list
Enjoyed so much ordered identical items for take out for my wife & for his daughter and both also thought food was great
Chipotle is a great place i think if you want to eat healthy this particluar one is close to my house the food is very good but its the service that gets me sometimes i always order special things on my burrito and its a bit complicated usually at other chipotles the person making the burrito is nice and does it with a smile at this one they always seem so impatient and fast and when i ask for my special requests they seem a bit upset
Won Ton soup was good as were the egg roll crab rangoon and pot stickers
I tried the chinese food here and it is EXCELLENT
Wonderful flavorful broth with a truly meaty wonton with very light dough
It's a place with delicious food and good value
The service was fast and friendly and the food was actually good
Spring Rolls Shrimp this time recommended by waiter were excellent
The food is amazing and the service was great
Just a note the food was really good the first and second time I ordered the Bistek Tagalog
Beers were served in icy mugs all dishes served temperature hot on HOT plates
The food here stayed hot well after it was set down on the table my kind of joint
Overall the food was really flavorful
Dining with a group of six offered a great opportunity to taste a myriad of dishes encompassing a vast spectrum of flavors textures and heat levels
The service and food were both wonderful and I loved the comfy feel they have inside
My favorites are the Pad Sew Ew Pad Thai Rama Beef Massaman curry and the ice tea is good
Well I had better particular dishes at other Thai restaurants Massaman at Thai Elephant Pad Thai at Swaddee Pad Sew Ew at Yupha's But for overall quality of food service and atmosphere Lemon Grass is my favorite
ProsNext door to my gymA minute from workClean interiorExcellent staffFast serviceConsThe food
I've given them a shot and will probably grab some food there again due to the convenience
The food is always fresh and delicious
The bean medley that accompanied the fish was just as good as the entree itself
The curry was tasty and not to spicy I ordered medium and the dish was well prepared
Food was great service was good prices quite reasonable
The food is standard steakhouse fare the same delicious steaks have the ribeye  la carte sides and a good wine list albeit a bit Napa-heavy
My beer batter chicken strips were tasty but it was the garlic cheese beer bread that was the best part of my meal
This isn't to say that food there isn't good
Ribs were tender and meaty my only complaint was the copious amount of sauce and perhaps the absence of sandwich style white bread to mop some up as it was mighty tasty
I asked for hot sauce when the food was delivered and got a bit of a why would you want to do that to my bbq
Was offered up packets of generic  hot sauce which enhanced the smokey meat for me
The meat was a little too thin for my liking but it was good
I'm really not one to complain if the food is good
They get you in and out and the food is worth the price
Clean platesGreat servicePleasant buzzDelicious food
Their regular menu is a tad pricey but the food is always fantastic so it's well worth it
But the entire reason for going here was I heard the sushi was beyond amazing especially for the price
I must say their prices are good with their all day every day happy hour menu which I don't really get anyhow why not just have cheap sushi call it what it is
The seaweed was tough the tuna quality was a bit fatty and hard to eat and it seemed that all of their specialty rolls were made with fake crab
consistency is a big thing in running a good sushi place well any place for the matter
So we were up for some good Mexican food munchies
The flavors of those dishes and the flavors of the AMAZING salsa were just super
The calzone was really good but the pasta dish was lacking flavor
The chicken in it was overcooked and tasteless and the one thing that stood out the most were the kalamata olives which were delicious
Thai Basil would have won a 4-star from me if their service was better because the food is delicious
The food was tasty - I was actually worried it'd be a bit watered down this is my first Thai Basil visit EVER  but it was actually good
They have one of the most deliciously crafted pizzas I've ever tried
I guarantee that whatever the wait is the food is totally worth it
I wasn't impressed with him flinging cooked meat at us either one piece of chicken hit my mom in the eye and he stood there laughing about it
Our server highly recommended this dish to us
get the hummas appetizer soup and dessert and you may like it
I have eated at other TK's and its the same Hot girls crummy food cold beer it works out in the neighborhoods but downtown there is no real bar crowd so your food needs to be good
Our friend recommended I order it Philly style at least I think that's what he said which is charred on the outside and I always order my meat rare
I'd be lying if I said that their chicken wasn't good but I rarely come here unless I have one of those GET A FREE SANDWICH coupons
I didn't get to try too much of their food but looking at other people's orders I could tell it was pretty good bar fare with a few twists
I recommend getting the sushi boats which is basically an assortment of sushi
The food was delicious and the service was very attentive
My mom doesn't care for sushi at all but really enjoyed the teppanyaki chicken
Food was very good and get this - healthy
Everything is fried/cooked made to order so you do have to wait but dishes are piping hot
I will say everyone said the chicken was quite good
My girlfriends and I all ordered the butterfish based off the recommendation from our friendly waitress
As for the food i was good but not amazing
Disappointing was the flavor of the chicken breast as there was none
As soon as we got home she was on the phone with her boyfriend gushing about the delicious place we'd just been to with its retro layout delicious food and the too-cute coffee shop
The crab legs were fresh and the buffet had a fairly good selection of Chinese food
GREAT way to get me in there even on my diet  thanks for making some good Mexican food
Some hot dishes came out cold and cold dishes came out luke warm WTF
I met some friends at the True Foods because they heard good things
It appears the food is fresh they use great ingredients and it is a good place to see and be seen
The food tasted authentic and full of flavor
If it wasn't for the great quality of food I may have left upset
This worked well but I'm sure we missed out on some good food we didn't even know about
There seemed to be tons of Asian customers there so I take that as a sign that the food is pretty good as well as authentic
At about $35 for 2 people it was a bit pricey for lunch but well worth it because it was a very unique experience coupled with excellent food
I also hear the food off the menu is excellent so I would like to return to give it a shot
Tasty Kabob is kind of a throw away name but the service and food are excellent
The chicken kabob was excellent I am not sure how they spice the chicken shwarma but it is excellent
The aesthetics service and food are all traditional spot on and wonderful
The only thing that is making this a 2 star and not a 1 star is the food is actually pretty good
Who knew Venezuelan street food could taste so good
Even my sushi-smart friend commented on the quality of fish
I had dined at the Baltimore location  and enjoyed their food so I was eager to check out a different dish
but I was not prepared for cold food and having to constantly fend off the drunk and/or homeless people who unabashedly walk right up to the table and brazenly harass you or ask for your leftovers
the pizza was the most worth the money at $2 Grimaldi's;2
I thought it was a bit pricey but the food was good and the portion was generous
Good subs alright pizza very good calzone
The spicy shrimp appetizer was perfect salad was crisp and fresh my chicken was succulent and a guest had the Big Ass Burger - which is a Roaring Fork tradition
I've never been to a restaurant that has that much LACK of service its amazing how many people actually come back for more bad service I guess its because of the food which I can understand
They use Boar's Head meats which is prime in the deli world and they pack the other good stuff into their sandwiches too like tomatoes peppers whatever
The fried chicken noodles are also delicious and nothing on this menu is expensive
The place is rather small so you may have to wait for a table but as evidenced by the sound of Mandarin being spoken throughout the restaurant it is clearly a place that has good food
But the service is amazing the food is yummy and the prices are more than competitive
They could at least spring for higher quality beef
Well if you think this is Authentic and great food the Mexican cooks you know aren't very good
I went with Authentic Mexican friends and none were impressed by the food
I called Dragon Palace one time when I was really hurting for some quality Chinese food
The dish was absolutely delicious except the chicken was still in huge pieces that I had to cut down
I highly recommend the Chicken Cordon Bleu
around $90/couple without alcohol*Food = pretty good
Kobi Beef hot dog wrapped in bacon with beans on the side
It's so clean with healthy food and good fast friendly service
I love spicy food and like someone else said some of their dishes seem spicy just to be spicy foregoing full flavor
The food was amazing very flavorful and light on grease though we didn't really order anything too greasy to start with
The sushi is actually pretty good but the Thai is the bomb diggity
I think they are located in an area and catering to a crowd that does not know good Chinese food and does not expect much from the buffet crowd
Last night we tried the pizza/wings combo and thought the pizza feta spinach and red onion was quite good although I'm not a fan of the frozen spinach; the wings were simply mediocre
Haven't been to one of these places in years and I was pleasantly surprised by not only the quality of the food but the service as well
For my main course I got the chicken fettuccine alfredo and I got the lemon-raspberry cheesecake and it was unbelievably light and flavorful
They have a great deli with a large variety of meats vegetables and tofu a hot food bar a massive salad bar a soup bar a wine bar a sushi bar a great sandwich counter great coffee awesome desserts and a HUGE selection of wines and beers from across the world
Everything I've ordered or tasted here Duck Three Ways entree special Pork Osso Buco entree various appetizers sides & desserts has been outstanding
I'm just a bit surprised that it isn't more crowded--with food this good you'd think people would be flocking here
Dallas wrote nothing down amazing considering my odd sides and requests our food came out hot perfect and fresh
The service is good nothing over the top but it is sufficient for a pizza joint and the pizza is delicious
My friend order the fried chicken salad and said he really enjoyed it
Didn't eat anything there but saw other people's food and it looked tasty
It was amazing the difference in quality between this place and our regular sushi spots; we are very happy to have a new place to go when the sushi craving strikes
If it wasn't for the great company we had I probably would have been mad but we were with good friends and just rolled with it
The tacos were ridiculously tiny and the meat was cold
The food was meh desert was pretty good but way overpriced for what we got and not made for a big guy
Had the bread vegetable cheese appetizer and the chicken shrimp and steak main
We enjoyed the food once I got over my little hissy fit
The food the rest of the fam looked amazing as well
I had tried their Picasso pizza before and was not impressed
If ya want good pizza head to Nello's or Sal's Gilbert Pizza
Despite the service I had been going regularly as the food was usually pretty good
Joe's at lunch and get prime rib as good for a lot less2 Chicken fried steak is way overrated
So while I can't say it was the best pizza ever it was good enough that I'd eat it again for sure
There was definitely not slow-roasted anything in the dish - just cubes of unflavored meat
My group ordered a number of the um  strangely named rolls some of which were pretty damn delicious others may not have suited my taste but were interesting nonetheless
The first experience proved to be comical and appealing for reasons beyond the food;  the Ha Ha HOT roll being a little warm as an understatement the sudden fear that the place may turn into a karaoke bar later in the night and the look of pure raging hatred on the face of a hip Japanese teen when his birthday ice cream was brought to him with a candle and a song
Not even crappy sushi buffets can touch the $20 deal which includes appetizers dessert and a plate of sashimi that would run $40 anywhere else
I managed to eat most of the meat out of the sandwich and it was juicy and smoky but maybe slightly a little too chopped up for my liking however it was still amazing
Shiver me chicharru00f3n this is some good tasting food
The service was excellent both times and the food is pretty good too
I had the Shrimp Etouffe the first time and it was an excellent choice and the second time I had the fried shrimp with a side of the Seafood Gumbo
I really liked the fried shrimp but didn't really care for the Seafood Gumbo it just totally fell below my expectations it was chunky and bland but I was so impressed with the rest of my food that it didn't take away from my overall experience
The food was good but we'd have to seriously weigh whether to make a return trip based on the time it took us to get served
Both times my husband and I have been greeted by friendly hosts given fast and attentive service and had delicious food
the egg rolls were tasty and seemed fresh
The staff Dobson location is great and the food has been consistently good
We enjoyed The Matador foodgasm and the Steel Cut Oatmeal
Their lambrurger is awesome; their lamb chops are great just order them cooked med rare trust me and it's just nice to have a place that offers tasty lamb dishes close to work and for a special price on Wed's
The food is organic prepared in a healthy manner and more importantly SUPER tasty
There are hundreds of side dishes; organized in categories like  Vegetables Fruit Carbs Salads  Appetizers & Desserts
For a whole entire week's worth of food - delivered daily the price tag is $200 a week
The food was good or A-OK in Yelp terms but nothing that blew me away to think I totally need to come back here
What good food can do to us I would so love to go there again and try more of their menu
The food was goodI'm a picky eater and working on that
it was a deliciously sloppy wonderfully sexy in a beefy way
Very good quality food especially for the price
The times we usually dine here are during happy hour/ reverse happy hour because the menu has a wide selection of some of their popular sushi rolls to their appetizer
Considering we ate the food hours later and microwaved it everything was good
keeps the food in a dark cold area while conserving energy
The food here is pretty authentic and tasty
Other members got the fried chicken which looked yummy and the ribs which also looked good
HOW you may ask when the food is so piping hot
Gilbert needed a place that was nice laid back good food and good beer
Truly a treat  Not to mention their generous portions of fries  The cart was convenient for rolling back and forth between my girlfriend and I and it also created the illusion of containing less delicious sweet potato/regular cut fries than it actually did
not only is the food and atmospher amazing but the SERVERS are
The food was fresh tasted great the portions were good sizes for the prices
You won't be expecting food this good hidden away in this location
it's got the potential to be a good pizza place but doesn't fully live up to it
My companion and I decided to start with the marinated pork spring rolls which were served with a delicious peanut sauce topped with chopped peanuts and julienned carrots providing a little extra crunch to the fresh cucumber within the rolls
Use of mint in the rolls was understated and allowed the flavors of the other vegetables and the pork to shine while still providing a needed brightness
There isn't a place in the valley where you can find quality cured meats from Europe
So folks the bottom line is if you want a place for quality imported meats and cheeses for your next wine party don't go to whole foods come here
The food was not even that good as the reviews that are posted on here
The food is fair but not worth the price IMHO
The food was good but the orders were screwed up
Fajita's turned out to be pretty good actually but pretty good mexican food in a land of bountiful mexican food is a restaurant that is not trying hard enough
As an appitizer we had a Fajita Pizza a large flour tortilla covered in cheese fajita meat jalapeno slices onions and olives all baked up crisp and delicious
But it is quite aways to go for us from Gilbert to get pretty good food and as I say it is not really much of a bargin
Still Fajitas gets good marks for flavorful food friendly staff and a good concept
Agree w/ the other reviewers that the service is oddly slow but the coffee & food were really good and overall super cheap
I once held Barrio in very high esteem recommended it to out of town visitors and regularly thought of it as some of the best Mexican food I had enjoyed outside of Mexico
Also it was served with a side of cold unseasoned steamed zucchini and bland mashed potatoes that added absolutely nothing to the dish
The cheese fondues and desserts are AMAZING
I go here because I accept the Melting Pot's faults and cannot escape cravings for their delicious cheese fondue scrumptious desserts and lovely atmosphere
Wait staff knew the menu to answer questions and make recommendations both had food delivered just at the right time - not too early or too late - and was friendly without being familiar
Between the four of us we split two starters had four creative wonderfully prepared entrees ranging from pork to fish to vegetarian choices enjoyed a great bottle of wine had two cups of coffee and split a delectable dessert four ways come on now
you've done it too -  and we thought the bill was very reasonable all things considered for quality of food ambiance and evening's entertainment at about $55 each before tip
It would be 5 stars for the delicious inexpensive food and the huge portions of their lunch specials big enough for at least two people for under $5
The building is kind of gross looking but the food is soooo good
I will absolutely still keep going there because the food is soooooo good and I will still keep praying that the nice Asian ladies will be behind the counter so that I will get decent customer service
In the Cantina you can order a taco basket which contains 6 smaller tacos  chicken and or beef which can be a small meal or appetizer for two
You may also want to try the pollitos fried chicken strips as an appetizer as well
but when it comes there is always a deliciously different taste to the food
We started the meal with delicious crispy calamares then went on to nilagang baka boiled beef and veggies sisig a spicy pork dish relyenong talong roasted eggplant covered with ground pork and scrambled egg and fried chicken
The portions were generous the dishes were good and with rice it turned out to be too much food for the three of us meaning we had some pretty good food to take home
But I compare everything here to the wonderful Vietnamese food I had in California
Good sushi great beers interesting appetizer selections including the justifiably famous Hot Rocks
Here is what I like-A trough of cheese for me to drool over and spread on a variety of toast-point options- Creative hot and cold sandwich's including the Chicken Gruyere with Pancetta and Balsamic Onions- try this on Sourdough rather than the Baguette and you won't be sorry
Wonderful food great service can't recommend it highly enough
I ordered a full glass as i munched my salted feeder-corn-looking appetizer and selected from the menu full of great descriptions of the dishes and even several photos to help a gringo like me
EXCELLENT FRESH FOOD Okay they've got that in Peru apparently and brought some here for us
My Lomo Saltidopic had beef chicken rice onions tomatoes and HOME FRIES mixed with cilantro and other spices to make a tiny amount of an au jus like gravy on the bottom of the plate which i made sure flavored every bite that got into my mouth
Adding some of the aforementioned hot sauce is a good plan for nice flavors  My go to is their Green Machaca Beef Burro deep fried with Cheese inside
I have had Machaca at a few other restaurants and theirs is definitely at the top - it is a stewed shredded beef and is nice and moist with LOTS of flavor
I don't order dessert here very often but have had their sopapillas fried dough with honey cinnamon and sugar which are a bit iffy sometimes good sometimes not The service at Rositas is typically pretty good although not always the most upbeat
The food is good but it is not stand on your head and do cartwheels great
The spring roll appy was mighty tasty as well crunchy and hot in all the right places
I ordered the Famous Soul Food Platter w/ 3 pieces of chicken a cornbread muffin mac & cheese a waffle and some of that good ol' lemonade
Our chicken was hot crispy and juicy even better w/ that hot sauce
If you're craving some good italian deli food this is the best around
It also has Italian groceries where u can pick up some great quality meats
I always order their hot sandwiches  like the meatball or Philly cheese steak
And she is correct it is some good damn pizza
however as time passes and money is made the food quality starts to fade
Homemade everything quality ingredients straight forward Italian Food
Looking forward to trying some of their other tasty food creations and drinks at my fabulously new food crush place
For dessert they came over and did the birthday thing and I had the RED VELVET CHEESECAKE WHICH IS SO GOOD OMG
Where else can you watch a guy practice boxing in a real boxing ring shop for vintage goodies sit on wooden bleachers your grandparents probably sat on in high school buy a pie from a pie bar get a soda pop from a soda bar order your food from a trailer AND eat an out-of-this-world brunch all in the same building
I went with some friends had a great time sitting on the upstairs patio and enjoyed some fish and chips
The fish was nothing to write home about and if you're looking for actually delicious fish & chips and not just a cheap Tempe staple you'd be better off going to Rula Bula or 4 Peaks which have fantastic beer selections to boot
Unfortunately this means the food quality has become very inconsistent
Spicy Curry Beef Linguine used to be a favorite; it was mildly spicy and had delicious curry flavor
Liberty Market is excellent for breakfast lunch dinner dessert or just coffee
For dinner burgers are always good but so is the Best Chicken Sandwich which really is very good
Stopped in for a bite with Mom while visiting AZ and decided to try the Roast Beef sandwich cold
The fact that the food was so tasty  but helped ease the annoyance
The shrimp and BBQ beef taquitos were amazing
The wait staff was attentive food and drinks great so I highly recommend it and I plan to be a regular
As for the food excellent homemade pasta with a very delicious sauce
Meatballs were light and tasty ravioli were homemade ade delicious
This place is somewhat inconsistent in its ability to provide good service and in some instances the food was not as good as it was in others
All of the free food is doused in hot spices and sauces to keep everyone eating a minimum but that never phased me
In addition to excellent horchatas the food is delicious and affordable
I had the fish tacos very good the beef enchilada excellent
The food is consistently good which is why we usually make it to Don & Charlie's for various birthdays or holidays
The dessert selection isn't particularly exciting but they dishes they do offer are good from a light and tart key lime pie to a sweet creamy banana cream pie
The food has been super hot almost too hot both times so be careful when biting into those delicious crabby patties
The belt experience was semi-ok and the Sushi is kinda supermarket quality and you better hunt the plates that are just being added to the belt if you want fresh
they pushed their little carts around with hot plates that basically steam the food and is not fresh and what you get is soggy poor customer service we had to get up and look for someone to give us our tab so we could get the heck out of there are get some real food
My daughter ordered chicken that looked good but was raw inside
Admittedly I had to dock a star because the food isn't as high-quality as it used to be but it still beats the typical bar food any day
and I don't know what they use to marinate the meat but it is so tasty and then you get to dip it in Nouc Cham for more flavor complexity
it's like having your appetizer and main course in one dish for the price of one dish
For dessert we order the bread pudding which was good not great
NegativesMy noodle dish just really didn't have a whole lot of flavor and was not even remotely spicy for being titled 'spicy noodles
The experience was overall a good one and I would like to try this place again I was just a bit disappointed with the grease content of the foods which gave me a bit of stomach ache
If you want Old Phoenix flavor and are OK with rolling the dice with your meat preparation give Durant's a shot
Food was good price was OK but made it great was the 1/2 price promotion on a bottle of wine that they were running on Sunday nights
Oggies is a good solid brewery and pizza restaurant
I've been here a few times and love the beer and the pizza is real good
My yellow currey chicken was good but defintely not hot enough for me
I tried 5 different items on the menu and they all tasted the same like not good cafeteria food
It is a bit pricey but  it's inside a resort and the service and the food quality are excellent
Food is amazing I had the chorizo eggs Benedict while my husband had the meat omelet with smoked Gouda both were amazingly tasty
My husband had the meatball sandwich which was delicious
I tried the 'not your typical' chicken lasagna which was also very tasty
A friend of mine that works nearby recommended and I was craving pizza so I finally went while I was in the area
My husband had the chicken enchiladas that I tasted and were very good
The food is cooked to order so it did take a while to get our meal but it was worth the wait and service was excellent
Both times we have excellant service and very good food
Each visit the food has been from good to great
I give it two stars because we had a good waitress who was fairly attentive and because the shredded beef was passable
Thats how good the bacon from The Meat Shop is
I've heard mixed reviews on the food from good to meh but both times I stopped in were for the liquid meals
I ordered an all-beef hot dog with medium spice and mango salsa
Chef Steve Byrne Director of Culinary Operations for the whole parent company was attentive to the entire dining room- checking on food prep; diner's experiences and quality
I recommend this as a wonderful stop after dinner for dessert
a mix of a simple casually-upscale atmosphere including a terrific patio area lounge music that sets the mood without drowning out conversation good service and of course excellent sushi and other menu items
It's definitely on the high-end of the price spectrum and sure you could get sushi as good for half the price elsewhere but it's not your weekly sushi place
The FOOD here is over the top amazing and doesnt sit in your guts all morning after you have moved into the balance of your weekend routine
Between that factored with the good food and decent drink offerings I think they've found a new regular
I started with some very tasty spring rolls and went in the Italian direction for my entree
Except for the bland unseasoned chicken the dish was quite flavorful with a bit of kick provided by crushed red pepper
The food here is delicious cheap and the people working here are very friendly and appreciate your business
But I like the walk-up counter ala Pei Wei that has good food and a good environment
There was a good steady stream of what seemed to be regular customers in and out for take out as well as eat in the pizzas coming out of the kitchen looked and smelled wonderful which is a very good sign at the time of day we were there given folks were off work and on their way home
It's not the absolute best greek food/gyro shop I have ever had but considering the comparison is with Gyro's on the Island of Santorini its probably pretty good
The pizza arrived quickly and was also very big - the menu states the personal pizzas are 12 but it appeared larger to me - six slices of gooey cheesy garlicy goodness atop a wonderfully crisp crust
The groceries such as produce and meats are much better quality and the prices are very close to the same
The best kept secret is that they discount their meat when it gets close to the expiration date so you get excellent quality flavorful meat for a great price
Its not pretentious the food is yummy and the drinks are tasty
Cozy atmosphere tons of televisions to watch the game and for a sports bar - the food is actually REALLY good
I love that we had our own coffee carafe  The cinnamon roll was delicious with a cream cheese frosting and the food we all had was perfect
Food quality at this location is on par with all other Taco Bell's
When I was waiting for my food the man who greeted me said that he felt the best thing on the menu was the #3 Hatch green chile and chicken enchilada which I agreed sounded good
Jalapeno Inferno has a separate menu dedicated to food items that contain Hatch Chiles and if you were to ask for recommendation of what to order they will tell you to order off this menu which of course we did
If the delicious food and $5 drinks and happy hour appies weren't enough to win me over the service made it a slam dunk
Ordered the machaca beef in a quesadilla very salty and not very flavorfulJerk fried rice it was cold and blandChile Rellano filled with Cheddar cheese--seriously
; I love Sapporo for the restaurant' s teppan - the chefs are fun and the food is amazing
the Burger Windsor style is amazing with caramelized onions a garlic aioli and cheddar on an artisan roll
Got mac and cheese as the side dish and it was really special creamy and flavorful
Sometimes you tire of various types of food and sometimes nothing but a hot dog will do
I got the foot long and it tasted good but next time I'll try the all-beef which my wife had
I really thoroughly enjoyed the pesto chicken
My brother had a mango glazed chicken dish and it was not good either
It was pretty good but the meat was underseasoned and there wasn't enough for the size of the roll 10 inch I needed more onions than they gave me but it was still a decent cheesesteak
Now for the good parts we had a shredded beef cachapa which had a sweeter and thinner corn 'bread' and this was delicious
The food here is very good especially the bison burger
The prices are slightly steeper than most other breweries I've dined at in the area but the food is quality and the happy hour deals are unbeatable
The ingenuity of offering comfort vegan food is matched by its excellent and delicious execution of the concept
Here you can find inventive takes on veghead staples such as salads and Thai-inspired noodle dishes to daring vegan versions of chili fries and hot wings made from mushroom stems that prove worthy rivals to the animal-involved originals
Having a house nearby we have been to this Mastro's several times and have enjoyed the food every time
The food we got was cold by the time it got to us
None of them really wowed us sadly - Lava a special roll that could have been a lot more special Dragon best of the batch veggie for the lone ranger who didn't eat meat yet surprisingly good and tempura shrimp tasteless
The food is good and it is a locally owned establishment
Good experiences both times although the food was a little mixed
It's not entirely fair for me to compare authentic German food prepared by Germans with our best American shot at the same
She recommended the fish tacos so I went with them
They are very inconsistent with their quality of food
When you hit them on a good day it's great food and a good qualtiy for your money
The prices for their entrees are kind of hefty but I like their bar atmosphere once in a while and their food is pretty good
You know food is good when Richard Z says the following That was so good
It's a bit pricey but the food is worth it
Although for me its kinda out of the way but the food was good and worth the drive
My chicken & sides were very tasty & at a smaller lunch portion I almost cleaned my plate
Made reservations and were seated very quickly The food is very good
They have excellent sea food and it's all been extremely good in my experience
Their specials are always delicious last night I had roast chicken green chili and white cheddar polenta and brandy butter apples with caramelized onions
The salad with the avocado and shaved parmesean californai rolls a noodle dish and the marinated pork appetizer
Their lobster & crab mac n cheese is a dish I like to categorize in my prestigous jizzing in thy pants worthy Nomnomlicious as it is though  as a college student with an empty/dusty wallet that is always there to remind me that I 99% of the time am not allowed to indulge and happily jizz my pants I cannot get what jesus christ probably ate at his Last Dinner
I've tried the Fisherman's Platter and it is tasty
It WILL take a while to get your food but when you get your food it will be delicious
The food was almost as good as the Swadee Thai  Cuisine
Had the Hanger Steak on the server's recommendation and it was one of the best pieces of meat I've ever had
If you must order only one dish at Eddie V's let me highly recommend it be these scallops
If I were looking for a light lunch I could see ordering this salad with a seafood appetizer
I think this dish could be improved with a bit of tweaking for instance the crostini could be rubbed with garlic to give it a more assertive flavor
I was impressed at Darren's thoughtful touch he brought over a flashlight when he delivered the steak knife to demonstrate the rare-ness of the meat in the otherwise semi-dim restaurant
Thank you for the gracious hospitality and amazing food that still has me telling friends about my epic dining experience more than a week after my meal
The veal meatloaf was very flavorful and moist
We spent a good two hours here and although our bill for the food and bottles of wine came to under $100 we paid $150 - our waiter even told us we paid too much
Their only saving graces were their seafood and real ice cream of which 6 flavors were available
Everything was delicious and while I am not a big fried chicken guy I must say that all three pieces disappeared quickly
Were looking at the basics Customer service Food Quality of beer and variety especially when it comes to a brewery and ambiance aka mood or vibe of the restaurant
But their service no matter how busy it gets is on point with a smile Food is amazing paired with their beer quality of beer is the best in the southwest and the vibe is always laid back-good times
after a while of checking out their digs and studying over the menu and drink/food specials they had for weekends we opted to go for the order any regular appetizer and get you're first beer for $1 deal
The real reason to come here is the beer; despite the fact i didnt try any entrees or their delicious sounding kobe beef burger- i'm gonna go ahead and stand by my sentiment
They are pretty good about the food being ready when you go to get it
The Broccoli Beef was fairly good with the Broccoli still kind crispy when I got it - which was nice
excellent food generous portions super-quick service low prices and a cheery atmosphere
Not much in the way of vegan fare but I managed to find a tasty dish The Red Flannel Hash beet potato and root vegetable hash sans eggs
I took home a regular Siciliana pizza tomatoes mozz eggplant for dinner later and also enjoyed it - I probably would rate the cannelloni higher but still thought it was good pizza think I enjoy Bianco and LGO more
The food was good I had the steak fajita which you can't go wrong because its just steak
But I also had a fish taco which was pretty good
In hindsight even though I'm sensitive to salty food I wouldn't have have changed a thing since the beef broth flavor infused into the ingredients so well
The shreded beef hard tacos are good the carne asada burros are my wifes favorite around town from there
I come from Seattle and most of the pizza joints are all gourmet and fancy which is good but from time to time it's good to have just dirty ol pizza
The mission good Mexican food in Glendale
We enjoyed our meal pizza and house salad but liked the atmosphere in Brooklyn more this one is just too new and sterile
The sushi is ok-good not worthy of a 4 or 5 and if you're OK with crowded noisy bustling places then Hana is for you
They've had consistently good prices with a good selection of meats vegetables and sauces to choose from
It's a pricey place but the food is great so coming here for a special occasion is definitely worth it
I hope this is not a reflection of the quality of the food in 2010
So I agree with the other reviewers good for drinks probably not for food - I only say this because I asked the server what she recommended for appetizers/food and she was very vague didn't seem enthusiastic but she was very specific what she recommended for drinks
Sandwich was on the salty side but I enjoyed my fried chicken
It was almost like a pizza salad and I enjoyed every bite
In addition to delicious food and generous portions the prices are super reasonable
Most of the food is good but the best thing on the menu is the Monaco Foccacia
it was amazingly good and I still talk about this pizza to my coworkers
The flavor was right on and the crust was thin but did not have the cardboard texture like other pizza places
The pizza was so good it needed nothing else added to it
I highly recommend this place as the food is great and the service is equally great
The food in general was good but I didn't think it was over the top
If you go to Sushi Broker expecting a great rowdy bar atmosphere with good strong cocktails and ok food you'll probably have a good time
As soon as I walked in I was enveloped by wonderful aromas of pho broth but in the AZ hot weather I opted for a cooler dish the #45 Vermicelli with Charbroiled Shrimp and BBQ Pork
It wasn't a large amount of food but it was delicious
There are mostly Asian people in here always a good sign the food is authentic
The food service and ambients was as good as it gets for me
I ordered Spring Rolls as my appetizer the Thai Basil Thai hot with pork and more basil and garlic than might be fit for human consumption as well as the Yellow Curry also Thai hot with chicken
I asked for hot oil on the side of the Spring Rolls
He asked if the spring rolls were good and I relayed the missing lime juice and fish sauce situation
The curry flavor was nice; the dish came out at about 4 spicy
I wish I had known about the turkey flavored chicken before I choose to add that to my mac and cheese
Honestly the mac and cheese was quite tasty but I was so turned off by the chicken that I couldn't eat much of it
Pork tamale sounded good as well as the shredded beef taco and to complete the trifecta a chicken enchilada
The Wiseguy pizza is my favorite the fennel sausage is just unreal it's so good
I think that its worth the wait as long as you are in a mood to not mind waiting and you really want some amazing fresh pizza
From the amazing staff and service to the delicious and beautiful food I can see why it's the only 5-diamond rated restaurant in Arizona
While some of the dishes were very tasty others were not  for such a pricey place
They let you know the portion size is appetizer size but it is more a one bite size at least my husband's and mine our daughter's portions were a bit larger I guess because it was her birthday and she did like every one of her dishes
The desserts were delicious and you could actually share them since the portions were the perfect size
Either Lolos you choose you're going to end up with some of the best fried chicken in town and some pretty damn amazing waffles too
Four stars only because the chicken has been a bit skin/batter-heavy and in a way that hasn't been amazing the last couple of times I've gone
In SF and Emeryville Trader Vic's is known for being a classy cool spot to go get good food and even better drinks in a funky environment
The meat quality was great it just missed some seasoning or something to take it to the next level
Actually I enjoyed the side dishes and desert better than the steak
The sushi had a clean taste and was very good
The food was actually quite good yet not good enough to overcome the terrible discomfort that we felt being in this restaurant
All in all the food was good - the quality for the price of the lunch was good - but the service was ridiculous
This large burrito had no flavor what-so-ever except for the taste of leftover chicken that has been reheated
Ambience is nice but food especially mexican usually has great flavor so give it to us
I had great service from the bartender and enjoyed some mini donuts for dessert
Caminero replaced my favorite taco shop Bisteces a few years back they changed the meat in the burrito and it wasn't quite as good Bisteces probably had my favorite burrito and salsa ever
Food - 4/5Quality burrito I get carne asada with avacado cheese and sour cream and load up on the Tomatillo salsa which you can and recommend you do buy by the pint
Of the six ladies at the table every single one of us commented on how good our food was
Everyone found a wine that was to their liking and that plus the food plus the good weather made for a very relaxing evening on the patio
The eggplant enchiladas are pretty good but they have this light chicken burro plate with cabbage and celery and a really good peppery vinaigrette that I discovered I preferred without the tortilla and this is my staple when I visit Mi Patio
That said the meat is much better quality than what Subway offers the taste says oh hai Martha Stewart
Speaking of the food here the quality has gone way down
Seriously is it to much to ask for fresh chicken and food that is hot
Looking at the menu I saw many things I could certainly try but with The Big Unit staring at me it had to come down to that -- a 22 inch full pound Vienna Beef hot dog
I had a lobster crab spring roll concoction with it's flavor totally replaced by bland
But the fish itself was cooked well and flavorful
How about pizza and a movie back at the hotel
I have a hard time ordering anything but their chicken fingers because they are extra greasy and so delicious
I only gave thus pei Wei 3 stars because the food was good and they have the cool soda fountains

The food is home-style grub referenced by sports & rocker namesakes like the Tom Brady burger The Big Unit hot dog 3 feet
Long Version Hand-crafted dinners of seasoned good-quality meats and veggies or vegetarian options wrapped in a flaky buttery baked melt-in-your-mouth carbo-load of a crust
Food is hot and fast service is outstanding anyone can and will help you and the soups are to DIE for - chunky yet smooth appropriate levels of salt and fresh ingredients with flavor that really pops
The food portions are rediculously huge and the prices are good
Food good portions huge price reasonable service ok
I ordered Chicken Korma Chicken Pekora and Naan and brought it back to my hotel room
I've never had chicken pekora before and it was delicious as well
Gyoza - Good Wonton Soup - 2 wontons and salty soup base I did not tried the rolls but the girls ordered a Kalifornia and Tootsie For my entree I got the sesame chicken with brown rice
But it was deliciously gooey with cheese and the flavor of the meat was decent
5 star Yelp rating we went with high hopes we'd find a hidden gem stuck out in Goodyear and we found a 3 star passable but not great sushi joint
I ordered the three piece chicken meal expecting to stuff myself contented with fried goodness and slip into a glycosidic stupor from a criminally sized slab of red velvet cake
I tried the Chef's Wine Dinner one night $25 four courses with wine pairings and enjoyed a motley mix of chowder red fish headcheese dirty rice cola braised beef cheeks and liver and trotter patu00e9
Beef Short Ribs where delicious my wife and I had a couple great salads and the Sangria
I made some Tartar from the boneless rib-eye a couple of times not cheap for this cut of beef but sure was delicious
The prices are fair and while their tofu dishes may not be the healthiest thing in the world they sure are tasty
The food quality of The Grove Cafe was excellent
The burritos are hefty the rolled tacos are greasy but in a good way the guacamole is tasty and even the fish tacos are yummy
I have to tell you after traveling through Southeast Asia eating a lot of noodles dumplings and all kinds of delicious food imaginable I am on a mission to she'd some pounds so it was great that I was able to order their lobster lettuce cup and have it for dinner minus the fried wonton chips and sauce and have it be low calorie delicious full of flavor and filling
Sure everything is vegan but it's lots of fake meats some odd flavors and horrific videos playing on the wall of vegan propaganda
and I have been to this place many many times but I have to say the last time I went there for the happy hour hot wings they were dry over cooked then I had ordered a steak and seafood combo Cajun something but after my second brew I thought it was me so I had the wife and my son taste it man was it salty
Especially recommended are the ham and Mega Meat pizzas
The ambiance the service the artistry of the plate the quality of the taste of the food was ALL AMAZING
I have no problem with creativity or with changing traditional recipes when it actually improves the quality of the dish
Its next to my work which is convenient but they answer my calls on the first ring and always provide excellent service and food
As for the dishes we started with the softshell crab roll which had too much rice and no flavor
Typically a good sushi chef tries to layer the meat in a way that the entire roll can be consumed
From a flavor perspective I have never found such an interesting Asian/fusion style of food in a quick-serve setting
First of all I'm not sure whether it's the quality of the meat the parsimonious manner in which it's cut or some combination of the two but their meat is always tough and stringy
-Answers the phone on the first or second ring check -The person who answers the phone can actually help you check -The same person pulls up your account and purchase history within seconds check -They keep your preferred credit card on file and don't ask you to verify the number and expiration date each time check -Delivers your order for free the same day or next day check I've been ordering dog food from Goober for several years now and their customer service is so good
It was horrible; but I chalked this up to what I ordered a dish that was a cross between Mexican and Italian food and the fact that it was cold from the drive home
Waiters and bar tenders were nice we ordered our food and we had a good time with the music too
Ample vegetables whole grains and just straightforward good for you food is at the heart of True Food Kitchen's philosophy
Salads sandwiches and various entrees will keep your options open as you select the right true and good food for you
Day to day we get caught up with standards it is good to step aside and give your body some good food food that was truly made to sustain your body healthily
So i pushed that other roll to the side and devoured the rest hey I told you I was hungry and enjoyed great convo and food with Kira
With food this flavorful and inexpensive neither should you
And as long as you don't you'll be treated to some of the most flavorful and uniquely flavored Chinese food in the Valley
As far as the food its good enough for me
I feel like Blue Wasabi and maybe a couple other places has a bit better tasting sushi but for what I pay at happy hour and the great time I have everytime I go here it's worth it fo sho
I also ordered some food the delicious Adobo Pulled Pork sandwich and guess what it came with fries AND onion rings
I get to soak up your meat juice and you get to eat all 6 of my round deliciousness
Though I thought their pizza was really good I was taken back by how delicious their cheesy garlic bread was
I may give the place another try in the future because I have had good food here in the past
Anyone else notice how once you roll out of bed on a weekend around 1pm it's nearly impossible to find some good old breakfast food
It's more than just a food sushi is an art form enjoyed for its taste as well as presentation
I only have a half hour lunch break so I used to rush over their and stuff my face with as much of their delicious food from their lunch buffet as I could in 15 minutes
The food is mouth watering and delicious
There was some serious greasiness going on here - the food was good but absolutely nothing to write home about
For years I have been looking for a place that served a good bowl of niu rou tang mian and while my favorite Chinese late night food isn't served at Cherry Blossom there are plenty of delicious noodle soups that will keep me happy until my next trip east
The food was good at decent ballpark prices
The staff was kind of slow and inattentive but I'll give them a break because the food was worth it
That said I must admit that the fried banana dessert was delicious
Great portions of high quality meat and yummy breads
The food is consistently good and service hasn't failed me yet
While you have a very cheery atmosphere and wonderful staff your food just didn't woo me at all
Shane the bartender eased us into the menu both drinks and food and made some excellent suggestions
The food was delicious and the drinks were well made
The food prices are a little high but the food quality and portion sizes are also very good
RA is one of the best sushi restaurants that I have found in the Phoenix area and it worth visiting for anyone who likes sushi
however I'm ok with that for food that tastes this good
The food was pretty good but the best thing for me is that they have Cerignola olives
I found some amazing deals and used it to my benefit in several ways including making an amazing dinner dish for this evening
The swordfish oddly was cooked perfectly and tasted buttery and delicious
Chef David crafts some of the most delicious dishes I have ever had
A GEM tucked back in a strip mall corner this restaurant has it all excellent food and a glowing ambiance
Now let me say that the food has been good both times I have eaten here
The egg rolls while not greasy seemed a little cold but nothing a microwave can't fix right
Yes I have always had a pretty good experince with them except when it comes to the wait time for the food to be delivered
I can't say enough about this wonderful pizza place tucked away in the Hilton Village
The pizza was delicious and the atmosphere was tasteful and worthy or a date-night
Minus one star for empty cups and late checks but 4 stars for wonderful food
It's good to try at least once especially if you love Indian food and want to try a different side of it free of goat or chicken
Some other places I'd recommend over Udupi for typical delicious and cheaper Indian food would have to be Jewel of the Crown in Old Town Scottsdale and Delhi Palace on ASU Campus
The pizza was good and there was enough for leftovers while the salad was just ok
*Food = great*Service = good but you basically serve yourself*Price = good*Decor = very cool
The egg rolls were pretty standard and probably not worth all the grease
For less than 8 bucks you can get a pound of the seafood goodness some tostada shells and lime and avocado for around 8 bucks
I highly recommend the steak or chicken salads
Kind of off the beaten path in a slightly hidden location but the food was excellent
It seems the quality of the food changes with each new location
Is it delicious when you're craving some really filling Chinese food
I'm going back to try the pizza that I hear is delicious but it's gonna be hard to sway myself from that killer pork dish
For dessert I had an amazing chocolate peanut butter cake and it was a great way to end the meal
The quality of the food is consistently good and flavorful and the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant is very tasteful
The food is always good and the service very personal though not to the degree of hovering
The meat was perfectly flavored and the burrito was freshly made
Good service decent prices solid food in a Tempe strip mall
The fish was real good and the fries were bomb too
She had the curry chicken sandwich which really didn't pop with curry flavor and I had the buffalo chicken sandwich which was overpowered by the bleu cheese sauce and I like bleu cheese
The pulled pork was equally good and the chicken was great too although we would have liked a piece of white meat
It was good I'm just not an expert on that dish
5 stars**My first experience with Totties was when it was just Shanghai Palace and although the food was solid filling and delicious each time the atmosphere was that of any other mom and pop Asian restaurant
Their food genuinely is good and good for you
Very unassuming little restaurant with delicious food
If you are looking for super casual and yummy comfort food stop in and enjoy some delicious soup
I enjoyed the Rosemary Chicken I had ordered the Salmon however it was unavailable sad
Sticky rice- it's hard to come by sticky rice not transformed into dessert so I was impressed when they had it
I highly recommend the Banh Mi White Fish Sandwich paired with the chopped kale salad
It was good but it was no Banh Mi White Fish Sandwich
You can tell the owners take great pride in their restaurant and in the quality of the food they serve
The food has been excellent every time I have been here and the service has always been great
I am Turkish and Med Fresh Grill does not do a good job to represent Turkish food
most were pretty mild but the dish came with the warning that you may stumble upon a HOT one
The Brisket was another huge sandwich almost needing a knife and fork as meat spills everywhere a good thing
I'll probably go back because the food was good but I'll probably just sit at the bar so I don't have to deal with the rude hostess
Sunday brunch at C's K gave us very very good service but disappointing food
If the food is good though the prices might be justified
just a very mild barely flavored liquid to help make the meat more palatable
OTHER THINGS I RECOMMEND  YOU TRY OUT Rolled Tacos- DELICIOUSNachosCarne Asada w/ beans
But the food was so good we had to come back for a second try
I am a big seafood lover and there a lot of chain sushi places in Arizona that are decent and good for rolls but if you want quality and authentic Japanese style fish and incredible Sashimi you need to go to Yasu
Hint there are purveyors that sell gr8 pizza sauce and cheese sellers that sell fine qualityWisconsin cheese and those only  cost another 50 cents a pie so why would this mellow place charge $15
The food however I was not all that impressed with
I had to pull a bit of the meat off which made me feel sad for those slices of delicious meaty goodness
And for dessert I ordered a scoop of their homemade ice cream - brown sugar & cinnamon flavor
Olive and Ivy has a better than average happy hour with good food and drink specials
The naan is fabulous the chicken tikka masala is always tender and delicious and the palak paneer is incredible
The menu sounded delicious but it really wasn't- We ordered the tortilla soup which was supposed to have chicken in it it was so fishy tasting I'm really not convinced it was chicken not to mention it was one big hunk of chicken which needed to be cut with a knife
We have searched all over Vegas for Persian or Middle Eastern food that matches the quality and taste of Pars to no avail
The food was really discounted but still pretty good - the steak sandwich was especially tasty - although I would recommend avoiding the pizza which had overly sweet sauce congealed cheese and vegetables that tasted canned
Our food was definitely tasty - the lamb shank and steak tenderloin bruschetta were very flavorful - but the prices felt a little high and perhaps more fitting for a hotel restaurant
However the food we Wanted was unavailable and so this is how i arrive at a rating of 3A few minutes before 8pm last night when we got to the restaurant the specials board out front had some kind of chicken thing that sounded delicious to Ben
Boy can I just state for the record that it is seldom a good idea for a restaurant to screw around by replacing their menu with ethnic food to celebrate holiday's
My associate decide to risk it and ordered the chicken tacos but offset it by having a margarita which is as we all know a powerful flavor enhancer and pain reliever
On my first visit a woman complained because it took so long to get from the meat to the salsa because they were so busy fixing a large messed up order that her meat would be cold
I've never been a big fan of any creamy potato dish but this was exceptionally good
Their presence usually means that there will be some good food coming
Not a good comment when he says It tastes like beef stroganoff without the beef
We really go all out and each get our own appetizer drinks main course and dessert
Grilled chicken sandwich was good and the aioli sauce for the fries excellent
Stopped by for dinner and I agree with the food being blah however my husband enjoyed his combo enchilada plate it was not spicy but the flavor was good
There's no shortage of good food in this town
The portions are good and the spices and ingredients are perfect for the dishes they serve
THE FOOD-- tuna sashimi dish is great value great flavors
Meat Some of them were a overcooked but they were all very delicious
The waitress told us their chef is generous on the spices so we might want to be careful in order our food spicy - we took a chance and went for the spicy number 7 the hottest
Anyways the chicken was bland and flavorless
When I was there they had a jalapeno beef pizza which was pretty good
The flavors of the meat the onions and cheese came together in perfect harmony
From an earlier Yelp review I knew exactly what I wanted the Spartan Club a pita sandwich with grilled chicken gyro meat lettuce tzatziki feta and hot sauce with greek fries
The chicken was excellent if not overcooked just a touch and the gyro meat was as good as any I have had
They served it with two salt dishes a black lava salt and white truffle and they accented the flavor perfectly
However the quality of the food has suffered at The Pink Pepper over the previous year with more gristle on the chicken and less pork and beef present in those dishes on the buffet line
Both of my fish tacos were cold not lukewarm COLD
The horseradish was nice and hot like usually which gives a nice kick to the sandwich
Anyone who says they are from Sicily Italy Philly Chicago are of Italian heritage or believe they know good Italian food from bad AND give this place more than one or two stars is full of shit and lying because they don't know what the fuck they're talking about
For what little you get and the poor quality of food their price point is easily 20-25% higher than what it should be
Good service will not cover for bad food just as bad service will not cover for good food
Other recommendations include the spinach salad with blackened chicken the daily specials like the buffalo burger or camarones a la diabla or the steak sandwich on beer bread
5 stars for its great local vibe and cheap and tasty food and beer
I highly recommend the Calimari appetizer and the Chicken Marsala
It's a really cool place to people watch and the food is pretty good- not great- but good
Food was good after we got up and asked the waitress to take our order
It took them 30 minutes + to get the pizza by this time my pasta is cold
For dessert the lemon tart was just okay but the strawberry sorbet was excellent
We ordered a few of their rolls and appetizers which were half off on their happy hour special
The rolls were really tasty and the appetizers were good but had they been regular price it probably wouldn't be worth it
The meat is the worst quality water pressed turkey and the cheese was Swiss American  a couple sparse holes and little flavor
It can be a little pricey but if you want something other than your standard pep and cheese pizza with sodas drop by and give it a shot
A really good restaurantwith really good food
We will bring the kids and return  Good food and great staff
We went with lamb meatballs hummus and the fritto mizzo sp appetizers and were blown away
My boyfriend owns restaurants in California and it takes excellent flavors textures and quality of food to make him happy
I don't think I'll be returning here unless they really upgrade the quality of the food
I specifically say a cafe because that is where the french go for good food and wine at reasonable prices
My friends dish looked and was as wonderful
It gets the highest of ratings from me because it is what it is excellently prepared French food at prices that don't give you indigestion when you think of paying the bill later
They may have to put an apple in my mouth and roll me out on my side when I have done so but it will have been worth it
The spicy Tuna was quite hot perhaps to mask the fishy taste of their product
The Geisha was for me the only roll fairly enjoyed
Eat here when you need delicious satisfying comfort food and a pretty-cheap Dos Equis
If you read anything about this place that is negative then try it again - again you can B*&^h about places all day long but really - good food is subjective but well crafted food is unusual
Also the Moo Goo Gai Pan looked good but it was mostly white meat chicken and a bizillion mushrooms and my friend is not a fan of mushrooms in the least
Anyway its pretty good here lots of meat and veggies rice is tender and you get a couple or stuffed wontons for free with the order
Orange chicken - Decent but super spicy was even a bit hot for my hubby who was raised on Cajun cooking
Sweet and Sour chicken - Delicious the sweet and sour isn't runny at all
Broccoli and Beef - Pretty tasty I get this when I'm not in the mood for sushi
Egg rolls - Neither of us found them very good
Because the meal left us full and desiring of more flavor we skipped dessert
Overall a decent restaurant and perhaps very good for this area but not one for foodies as the concierge described it
Although the shrimp rolls need an extra layer of flavor on the inside red pepper
The food and the service have always been good
The  Tortas are THE perfect sandwich their meat is so flavorful and the bun that they use is soft and toasted with mayo lettuce tomato their homemade salsa and onion
My husband and I usually share the chicken Torta a bowl of their AMAZING pozole and a couple of Carnitas tacos
I always get the Chicken Shawarma plate which comes with rice succulent chicken topped off with some amazing garlic sauce tabouli hummus and pita bread
What I will tell you impressed the heck out of me I have sensitivities to some food chemicals so I always ask before I order
We have some out of state family that get their fix on good Mexican food when they come to visit
Just noticed that a Filbertos is going in across the street but will quickly go out of business as their food doesn't hold a candle to the quality food and service you'll get at Tacos Atoyac
Pleasantly surprised at how tasty the food was
We ordered the frito misto and 8 inch Margherita pizza to share as appetizers
There was plenty of duck in the dish which made it a good deal at $12
Food is delicious and I am always a fan of the side dishes
I've had the Route 66 Buffalo chicken and the Ringo Starr and have enjoyed them but it wasn't true love
Out came the meatballs blanced kai lan or Chinese brocolli fried seafood pastry was  actually pretty good and sticky rice
Great flavor great quality meat cooked perfectly and super juicy
I was impressed by the option of drilled salmon and at least one other fish I cannot remember what
It's more business like than going to The Duck or Postinos both of whose food is better so it's a good option for taking clients meeting associates etc
we went ahead and ordered the food was very goodbut we really wanted other things than just fries
Like I said food was good atmosphere charming but no choices in menu
I will be back though food was good simple and I know kids will eat it
All the good food trucks like Short Leash Dogs Truckin' Good Food and Torched Goodness are here too
Reserve a table for some cooked Japanese food and be witness to a show then enjoy a very tasty treat
More the most part you get good portions for the food you pay for
I mean you cant live on veggies for too long without getting a craving for something tasty meaty and full of carbs
I didn't recognize any crazy seasoning or added flavor to the beef which is a good thing
And if you're looking for a quality drink to go with your food Half of Delux's menu is alcohol
I wouldn't recommend anyone going there if they have a kick for Mexican food
Great food good people and an all around great time
The sashimi fish was very cold and still had ice in it
The dragon roll with eel tasted good and had a nice presentation
Between the mediocre quality and the dishonest business practices they won't be seeing me again
I got the spicy tuna roll salad which was really interesting and tasty and everyone I dined with seemed to enjoy their dishes
Great quality meat and fresh toppings made the way you like it
In all seriousness the selection of meat is actually really good with everything from lamb ostrich antelope and kangaroo to the standbys of beef Kobe beef and turkey
It brings tears to my eyes just thinking about those wonderfully seasoned morsels of beef surrounded by the best corn tortillas this side of wherever has the best corn tortillas
It seems that Phoenix has a lot of restaurants that have Chicago style pizza or hotdogs and usually I am not too impressed
The food was great and certainly worth another visit
Friendly Good food and very affordable
The food quality and price of this place is unbeatable
The decor was beautiful the hostess was really nice and the food was absolutely delicious
Not only was the food great but I felt good eating it because all the food is farmed locally
The fish always tastes fresh the price is good really good if you do the all you can eat menu
I will say that the Chicken Queso Fundido was pretty damn good and the chips and salsa were ridiculously addicting
The food was delicious with both classic dishes and new twists
Quality Control ingredients are as good as it gets  Pizza quality one of the best again one of the best so many great pizza places to choose from especially in the Phoenix area
Being a vegetarian I always get the same thing at every sushi place I visit so I can spot a good veggie roll when I see one
For appetizers we had the Roquefort Flammenkuchen which is like a tiny pizza with melted blue cheese small pieces of pear crushed walnuts mozzarella and sour cream on top
To maintain a successful restaurant you need a good menu with quality food nice decor/ambience and great service to keep the patrons coming back
Good prices decent food not jam-packed with tools
As long as you're there they'll keep bringing on the plates and more of their really good warm rolls with honeybutter
For about $10 a pop it is quite a deal for a great range of food that actually tastes good
Whatever they're using to rub their meat is very singular in flavor heavy on the pepper
I work in the office tower attached to this mall and it is completely worthless beyond the food court for lunch and deals when Dillard's has clearance marked way down
The stuffed tomatoes are delicious as well as the sweet and sour pork I also really liked the lemon grass fish
The prices reflect the quality of the food and the servers are always right on the money with wine pairings
Sweet Potato Roll- Very unique never heard of or had one very good
LOLAnyway bottomline is that if you are new in town been scarred by horrible desert sushi are a first timer when it comes to sushi or just need a new place to try of QUALITY
Og yes and as other reviewers have said the surroundings in the restaurant are very nice big fish tanks chill music AMAZING service
Everything tasted pretty good but I've had more flavorful Middle Eastern food outside of Phoenix
my dining partner is not so adventurous on the sushi front as evidenced by our sushi order but i tried enough to say everything was fresh and tasty
If you never have had Vietnamese food before it is exceptionally flavorful french inspired light clean Asian cuisine that couldn't stand out more from Chinese food and Thai food throughout the valley
I have lived in the bay area for many years a place which has excellent Vietnamese food and many Vietnamese people and let me tell you this place does not disappoint
Awesome pho great noodle dishes rice dishes and amazing spring rolls
Until Yelp I was under the false impression that Vietnamese food was too hot and spicy for my tastes so I never even tried it certainly not the way it was served to me
Their pizzas are delicious but on the small side
There are plenty of Italian men running around serving people tasty plates of food and wine
We started with fresh pasta delicious followed by caesar salad excellent and then chicken parm mmm and tiramisu and caramel flan love
The food was terrific - we shared beef w/fungus fish in a delicious ginger sauce BBQ pork duck and the soup of the day
When I moved to Tempe I was unsure that I would ever even find passable Thai--let alone good Thai food
Everyone at the table loved their dish and deserts were amazing
I grab a table next to the wall and proceed to wait approx three minutes for that cart to come rolling out of the kitchen with various goodies all for my consumption
Like I said the food was good but not good enough to get us back into that place
I sat myself down and watched some of the college football game and enjoyed my wonderfully delicious slice of pepperoni pizza
Very friendly very clean great prices and damn good pizza
The food was all very good the pork stew is something I still am salivating over
The chicken caesar pasta salad is delicious as well
The greasy po-boys are a comfort food staple I crave often the specials are often unique and tasty Big Wacs forever and the service is usually pretty great
I love to walk the aisles and see what's on display cookware dishes jewelry auto accessories baked goods wine fruit books clothes
Spring rolls So good that I'm going to hit up an Asian market tomorrow and make them for lunch this week
Marinated Fried Chicken Wings More tasty than they look
I recommend the kimbap Korean sushi
The meat was tender and not at all fatty and the tortillas that came with it were hot and buttery
The trout was moist and meaty and full of so much flavor it was silly
The teryaki chicken was really tasty a great grilled flavor and the sauce was good
I haven't tried the food yet but I definitely recommend everyone to give it a try
My very first time I said Pizza is not worth this wait on the contrary it most certainly is
50 for a large - actually that may be a bit pricey for pizza but since I don't eat it very often I am kind of clueless; it travels well and I bet leftovers are just as good if not better - actually I'll find out today when I have them for lunch
The food is  good he had a box to go for the next day
Other than pretty good food don't expect much
They were brats with a foodie-twist and definitely in a good way
But the food is very good I keep going back
It's everything you love about Cibo--delicious food attentive service and cute ambiance
We chose a menu that featured an antipasti a couple of delicious pizzas of our choice and a sweet nutella crepe for desert
The food of course was amazing and the service was even better
I ordered the chicken nachos as an appetizer
The chicken was cooked perfectly and the jalapeu00f1os were amazing
I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for great handmade Mexican food
My favorites include-Hawaiian roll spicy tuna topped w/ tuna-Spicy crab & shrimp roll-Haru sushi two pieces of tuna wrapped around imitation crab & topped with a few slices of avocado-Haru popper mispelled 'poper' tempura-fried stuffed jalapenos-Crunchy California roll I only eat this if it's topped w/ eel sauce they should have a bottle of it there for you-Vegas rollThe asparagus roll isn't good
I would say the quality of the fish isn't as good/fresh as Mido Sushi or Kabuki but hey it's only $1-$2 a plate
In a nutshell I have to say that Haus Murphy's has delicious authentic-tasting German food
The mango papaya spring rolls were dominated by the flavor of anise/licorice
The black dragon chicken was good but not great
Great atmosphere service prices and of course amazing food
Besides Mediterranean food the menu includes burgers hot dogs large salads chili & daily special combos
We didn't wait long for seats our food came out fairly quickly the server was personable always a good thing
What's more their food doesn't taste like it's the product of a focus group at corporate headquarters that's trying to give me just enough flavor without having to spend too much on quality
no instead it tastes like it is the result of a few people who know how to make delicious Mexican food getting together and saying Hey let's make some good Mexican food and sell it
My friend started with the pictured Tortilla Soup avocado rotisserie roasted chicken which I'm told was creamy and robust with flavor
The adobo sauce was flavorful but not so overpowering that is took away from the flavor of the meat
Between the inviting pink chairs where I haven't yet had a drink the delicious food I couldn't get enough of and an outdoor patio with fire pit that looks like a great spot for day or night I'll be back invited or not
The only reason why it's not completely 5 stars is that it wasn't very clean and the atmosphere wasn't great either but the food was excellent
The Chicken Fried Rice was very moist and delicious
The Emerald Chicken was very juicy succulent moist buttery it melts in your mouth and the quality is undeniable
It was very flavorful and crunchy and the meat was moist
You can imagine my surprise then when the sake sashimi I had was some of the freshest highest quality fish I'd ever had
Normally it is worth a stop especially if one is deprived of Mexican food at home
Now for the not so good stay away from beef entrees
As most Chinese restaurants the beef used is from a cut that needs to be finessed its tough if not cooked delicately most of the time its cooked too long and gets rubbery Michelin/Goodyear like
Other than that we got a ton of greesy tasty food for $15
The hot roast beef sandwich was insanely good
The recommendation then was to buy a la carte Orange Chicken at $5
You can be as ice as you want and you can get away with mediocre food if you're really amazing with customer service but Hsin is doing it wrong
Not to mention the food was tasty we shared two dishes the seafood pho and the Bun Bo Xao and the ambiance was as cozy and charming as one would hope for a nice little date night
NY pizza and the same is true about Chicago vs east coast hot dogs
The broth was very light and not too salty but it was missing something I think someone else said this and I will agree with the other poster about their rice dishes; that looked pretty good
I'm all about fun and trendy but not at the expense of the quality of food
Hubby ordered the Beef and Onions which I would classify as good but not mind-blowing
While the food was pretty good & 4 star worthy I felt it was overpriced & the place lacked any ambiance so I think 3 stars is appropriate
The food is always delicious especially the soups since I am a soup lover
But if you want the basic fundamentals of tasty food and good service in a comfortable clean environment this has them
We have kids so we ordered the pizza for pick up the staff was friendly and the place was cute the pizza LOOKED amazing
We basically just took $25 and threw it in the trash I will never go there again and I would highly recommend people who don't like sugar on their pizza to not go there
Watch for the specials - the chicken pipian has an amazing pumpkin seed sauce everyone loves the chicken mole the tamales are decent different than you may be used to drier the chiles rellenos are great
The food is good but don't get that confused with good for you
On the recommendation of the owner I got the oxtail and the Jerk Chicken
Then once the food arrived it was delicious
Not to mention my husband has none of these restrictions and enjoyed his food just as much
I love how the hostess brings the hot rolls and cinnamon butter as she is seating you
Pulled pork was also ordered and was given an good   - the star of the meal was chicken fried chicken - huge portion pounded thin deep fried and covered with a white gravy
It was not the most amazing food ever but it was fresh and cooked by a person in a pan not in a microwave and beats the pants off of an Einstein bagel sandwich or anywhere else with comparable prices
Swordfish tacos were grilled perfectly and the homemade tortillas were delicious
The hummus was tasty and spicy they have a very good variety of dishes and dessert
As others have said the place is not fancy but the food is worth a try and the staff was very nice too
I do understand that America's food is high in quality and especially tasty and I appreciate that
On the side I found the eggrolls rather average but the hot and sour as reviewers have noted well above average for the bevy of complex flavors and numerous shrimp
Now with that being said on to the food it truly is delicious
The pizza in my mind is a little weak - I don't like how they cute them in squares and the flavors are too overpowering like they need to take of one ingredient on each menu item
The seafood cake salad I had at Taylor's definitely met my standards for a good salad
There were a ton of greens and the seafood cakes that came on top of the salad were both flavorful and well-sized
I would have happily eaten everything from the appetizers section but my dining pals and I set our sights on the plaintain avocado spring roll that is baked not fried
For $45 we could have had a much better meal at many other Valley Italian restaurants  The service and wine were good but that hardly matters when the food is not
Their food is always very good and I've never had a bad meal here
We shared a cheese plate and sweet & spicy wings both good but there's a lot of good food in the valley and this place didn't make me feel like I want to go back
Its also the only place we've ever eaten Pho so I don't feel qualified to comment on the authenticity of the food but it tastes so good so fresh so delicious that even if it were not authentic I would still give it 5 stars
The Mediterranean Chicken Salad and Artichoke Pasta Salad are Amazing
Now the food was a little bit of a let down although it was good but seems like it was a The Old Spaghetti Factory  Probation Center
+Neat clean store great decor and atmosphere very casual and welcoming+Great food and selection fresh and delicious+I would go here for lunch so much delicious food and decently priced at least it's healthy no fast food
After asking me questions about my dogs and our lifestyle they recommended a food and WOW
The not only have a more spacious theater a bar food beyond the typical nachos and sour patch kids crappy but it's there and basically just a bonus in my opinion but they have 3 flavors of popcorn
The pizza here is always a treat and the molasses they add to the crust gives it a nice chewy deliciousness that lends to the uniqueness
There is a good variety of speciality pizzas available for all palettes as well as the usual build-your-own option
We had the meat ball starter for 2 huge portion with Gluten Free bread - Delicious fresh and very tastyThen I got a pizza - Italian style with fine crust and plenty of topping on it fantasticAnd the best of all Gluten Free Chocolate Brownie with Coconut milk Ice Cream - DivineThe place looked great the staff friendly and the bill had a good price
The staff were friendly and helpful and the food was fresh and delicious
Their cuban sandwich is SO good -- it came toasted with just the right amount of meat and spread
The staff are always friendly and chef Paul makes some tasty rolls
Happy hour rolls are a bit limited I hope they add more but they are delicious
The calamari roll is very good texture is not rubbery like other places I've been too *cough* Kabuki
If you want a roll without rice I recommend the rock and roll
This is a great little place and with amazing quality sushi
I had a beet salad veggie pizza and a Pim's cup and really enjoyed the food as did my family who also had pizzas and dessert
The scallops were huge and perfectly cooked pork belly so tasty the hamachi roll was a delicious revelation and the salmon so buttery and soft
The dish is perfectly spicy and even the diced onions it's cooked with are delicious
It was served with radishes rather than coleslaw which was interesting and the crema which was tasty
The sauce was very tasty the meatloaf was tender and not  dry
For the hassle of valet only parking  late reservations  and okay food it just wasn't worth it
Though not blow me away fantastic this place has large portions good value and stand-up food
We snacked on the Margarita Pizza which was delicious and fresh tasting for 'bar food'
For some reason I am always craving sushi on Sundays and there is a huge lack of good places open
The seafood tower appetizer can really add up on your bill but the quality is as good as it gets in Arizona
Seriously I placed my order and moments later was handed the soup {Wonton} and a minute later the meal with appetizers {crab puff and spring roll}
On top of all of this good food we decided to try a Frosty Ho-Jay
The atmosphere is great the food is pretty darn good but the staff isn't all it is cracked up to be
A  bit surprised at the high prices but figured that the trendy factor in old town and the atmosphere was the reason because the teeny portions of the food and the quality is just GOOD like the Good egg not great not bad just good
The side dishes of street corn and some potato chorizo thing were very good
The fried chicken was different than what I have had in a good way
So tasty it's worth the charred meat smell that lingers for days despite multiple ablutionWhen I get that craving for spicy piquant charred protein
and if it's more starch that you want then I'd happily recommend the seafood with green onion pancakeLike all terrific Korean bbq places the meat platters come with endless little bowls of kimchi in all its various glorious permutations
Not good food at all but I chalked it up to the waitress/restaurant being new enjoyed my Diet Coke paid my bill and left
I also sampled the shrimp cocktail which was ok but may have given me the shits fried shrimp bleh fried chicken ok their soups weren't very good chocolate cake crappy and stale tasting rice pudding barely ok  and the table bread was fresh and nice so stock up on that shit
The food is very tasty and healthy and the impact is not the same as with traditional mexican food
The whole Reality Food Show Swoops In And Makes Dining Hotspot Out Of Otherwise Run Of The Mill Establishment is getting really REALLY old Phoenix
The food itself was good but not amazing and the atmosphere was very low-key and local which was one of its high points
I recommend people check it out if they want to try a sushi place on the Mill ave when you are in town visiting Tempe
Like so much fast food it sounds good
We'll have the Rainbow Roll the Lobster Tempura Roll and the Gyoza appetizer
I can see why he's been a mainstay of the city's dining scene for so long - his food is terrific the atmosphere is pleasantly casual the service is good although not as refined as you might expect for that price point and the prices are fair
Menu items change periodically but the duck cake appetizer is a mainstay and for good reason - it's a dish he's been making his whole career and it's delicious
everything cold EXCEPT the meat and cheese
The BBQ sauce I gotta say they had enough on the food but with 5 different flavors you can't help but play around with it Try the Devil's Spit
I just had lunch at Eliana's today and thanks to other Yelpers steered my way to the combo appetizer platter [and ordered an extra papusa so my friend Jim and I could both have one] as well as the chicken and shrimp entree
The papusa's are everything everyone says they are warm delicious with meat potato and cheese
Went there with one of my friends a while ago and the pizza was amazing
And their pizzas are as good as other notable places
I'll try the Buffalo Wild Wings location out at Norterra but this whole experience was pretty much a bust for me cold food dry burger lousy service and on top of that getting nickel and dimed on the BBQ sauce
And by sushi I'm not talking about deep fried rolls with lots of sauce or hot sauce on them
It's great because you can order edamame seaweed salad or sushi appetizers and then get a thai entree
or you can get a thai appetizer and sushi dinner
Some of my favorite thai appetizers are the siamese kisses and summer rolls
I loved the nachos the best but everything was pretty good and great finger foods not too messy/difficult to eat
The Sizzling Rice dishes are just amazing and I mean AMAZING
One chicken dish was really cold inside the meat with some pink color
What I didn't expect was for the food to be good - not just bar good but actually good
I tried the chicken salad sandwich with candied walnuts and apple jam on honey wheat bread which was really tasty  My husband had their slow braised short rib sandwich with spicy bbq sauce onions and havarti cheese
Not fancy but it's clean the people are friendly the kitchen is open and again clean and best of all the food is really good
The interplay between the meats on the torta are wonderful
It is insanely hard to find good New Mexican food outside of New Mexico
Add excellent food the prices were definitely a bit higher than other sushi places- but still the flavor and quality were tangible things you can actually TASTE excellent service Angela was a complete doll
The food was really good specially for the price
The  Rainbow and Spicy tuna rolls where really good but the one that suprised me was the Las Vegas rollhad me bobbing my head ofcourse a sign that it was enjoyable and delicious
But the food was not bad and the price is pretty good as well
Their refrigated ranch dressing is really good chocolate chip cookie dough pizza
The brined and roasted chicken was also tasty but you have to like the saltiness of a brined meat
I was in Fountain Hills with family for Memorial Day and needed a good Mexican food joint and Senor Taco was it and more
The meat is delicious the pickle and tzatzikii compliment it so well
I had the seafood provencal from their seasonal menu yesterday and it was so very delicious i was literally making yummy sounds mmmm
The pizza my friend ordered was good at least the portion of crust I tried anyway
Dessert of fall apple crumble was insanely good but also insanely small of a portion   / coulda eaten buckets of it
the fish and chips some other patrons were having looked pretty darn tasty though
The shrimp and fish were excellent very fresh tasting
While the service was good and the ambiance casual and attractive the food sucked
The BBQ chicken was pretty good not the best but pretty good
Everything is absolutely delicious and you'll have fun guessing the spices in the various dishes
If you're in the mood for some tasty middle eastern food I would really recommend it
Ok I went with my two kids I had chicken fried steak and my son had 1/2 sandwich and soup we all had hot chocolate which she charged me $2 extra for on my bill and my younger son had a side of mash potatoes
The price is average too but not worth it for bad quality sushi
Having this meal makes me full and the various flavors are awesome and refreshing contrasts to fast food
The food is its main strength second by good service and decor is not considerable
The tamales especially the green corn tamale was outstanding beef tacos were out of the world chicken enchilada was hot and steamy beans were full of flavor and reminded me of my old childhood days
Nevermind the appetizer of the skillet of cheese - think cheese pizza without the pizza with extra oil and a nauseating stomachache to follow
Tao Garden had excellent service it's great for a group and I had no complaints about the food
Each dish was very flavorful and also presented well
The pizza had really fresh sauce and the crust was quite good
The food was all very fresh and quite tasty
I had ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich grilled with bleu cheese you can also choose ranch tossed in their garlic hot sauce with french fries
Went here for our company dinner/happy hourWhat I liked-friendly staff pretty quick to serve drinks n food-good bar-very clean and plenty of seatsWhy no fifth star-the food seemed about average-for a clean place kinda has an identity crisis
The food at Angel's Trumpet is some good stuff too
The pizzas and Asian-style wings were also pretty damn tasty so I think they've got all the right elements any respectable alehouse should have
Now on to the main points-Meal will set you back only $4 to $6 bones per person cash only-Chicken may be ordered white or dark and is the most flavorful and crispy grilled ignore the red-dyed skin it will be the best grilled chicken you have ever had-Carne Asada is always cooked to perfection not overcooked or stringy or chewy always is Carne Asada greatness-Not only do meals come with your choice of flour or corn tortillas they come with perfectly salted pinto beans not refried fresh salsa and red onions that seems to have been soaked not pickled reducing their flavor to a delicious subtle onion instead of a crunchy onion
-Lastly the BLISS OF THE FOODGASM experienced when the tortilla/chicken or beef or both chicken and beef mmm/onions/salsa/and sourcream for those that enjoy a lil sin explode in your mouth with flavors you only dreamed of
Food was well worth the wait and our server was very helpful and attentive
They had to dodge the kid and easily could have dumped hot food on a customer
The biggest problems I have with the food is the overpowering mesquite flavor and mediocre sauces
I will give the girl at the window who took my cash and handed me my food was very friendly and asked if I wanted any sauces and wasn't stingy when I asked her for ketchup however I did ask for a good amount
I literally live 2 minutes and when I got home my pizza was cold I was also concerned the wings were undercooked so I cut one open first to check
They sell whole pizzas and pizza by the slice and it's actually very good and you'll receive five star+ service
The girl behind the counter was knowledgeable and the food came out fast and hot
While that may be true I have never had this problem at any other restaurant and I don't think that a quality chef should be using that much salt to define their dishes
My father ordered the Beef Stew off of the waiter's recommendation
For those prices the food was not worth it
The Friday night Fish and Chips is delicious
I have always happily paid more for pizza and eats at Rosatti's because the ingredients were always high quality
The servers are knowledgeable the food is good and the drinks are very well poured
The margarita's are tasty and the food is pretty good
I went there with my family and we ordered the Plato de Carne mixed meats which was ok if you mix all the sauteed veggies with the meat because with out it the meat is pretty dry with little flavor
Although I must say if I was to order again I would get the chicken because it was very moist and flavorful
I ordered steak and eggs a classic which was like 7 or 8 bucks in the back of my mind I knew there was a hitch but instincts aside I was still hyped sadly like most things in my life disappointment  The Steak basically was badly seasoned deli roast beef stacked over my horribly cooked eggs my plate was over flowing with watery steak juice it really should have been served in a bowl it was gross I mean gross the coffee drink was good kinda girly and the decor was aiight
For food they offer the Hawaiian noodles that seem to be at every stadium kettle corn Chicago-style hot dogs and Italian ice
2 stars for marginal service & average food quality
I have always enjoyed the food here as well
Indeed The food is good but not great and they overcharge you because they can
Food was fresh & colorful which is always a bonus on top of just being delicious
Anyway excellent food excellent service amateur bartenders
There's a lot of pizza in the valley and I would dare to say there's a lot of good pizza in the valley but when I say pizza my family immediately begins to salivate and we all say Pino's at the same time
I've been to Italy on several occasions and his pizza is just as good as any I had there
Of course Pino is from the old country so he brings that love for good food with him
The food is good but don't expect to cut calories here
I will stick with Greek Patio and Pita Jungle for tasty Greek food
It can be a challenge to come up with exciting flavors and combinations when you're preparing nutritious foods and Nourish really has it down
I don't mean health conscious to imply the entrees are like diet food or aren't very tasty it's just not the same dining experience as Chili's or Culinary Dropout so keep that in mind
We sat in the bar and the staff was awesome the wine was great the food was delicious and affordable
But the food was slightly greasy but really really good
This is a fast food joint and they did a fast and good job with the food
The food was good enough that I will definitely return if I can find out when their slow times are
I will definitely come back whenever I am craving some good Italian food with a nice ambiance and good service
The pizza was good and appropriately priced at $13
I thought these new sandwiches were pretty good the chicken breast was thin and well cooked and seasoned and the bun was a giant Ciabatta one that held everything together well
My husband and I come from NJ/NYC area where good Korean food was plentiful
The Banchan little dishes also hit the spot as they were all equally tasty and spicy
if you want to eat the good food on the menu order the Korean food
so perhaps the less Korean/Hawaiian foods aren't very good
as long as food is good and service is quick then it's a win in my book
I have never tried such delicious stewed beef before
My experience was a good one and the service was perfect but I normally rate on food and it just wasn't all there for me
Everything was real good but the meat was too salty
But unfortunately the food was just not good
These far-reaching Gods of Cafetopolis you see Whose minions such as Paneracles and Chipotle have erected from sea to seaDesired like the vendors beyond the Acropolis offeringsCafeteria dining serving Gyro and many such thingsThe fare was befitting of above mentioned ilkTwo stars at best though service was silkThe dolomades came hard the hummus was tastySpanakopita came fried as the cooks may be hastyFalafel were shaped as tater-tots wouldPasty inside the two were not goodSalad lacked olives but for a dollop all groundFeta was sparse with no pungency foundDrachmas went quickly when food was just orderedHigher quality Greek food the price could have affordedEnglish majors
The chicken was cooked perfectly and had a delicious flavor that just spicy enough without searing my tastebuds off
It'll help the heart get through all the cheese and fatty meats consumed in this delightfully sceney hotspot and will make the experience of waiting for a table much more pleasant
which was as good as I remembered complimented by rich meaty bits of short rib and diced potato
The other desserts were only even more amazing
The people I go with swear that the Traffic Jam sandwich a cluster fuck of different red sandwich meats makes it worth the trip
The pasta was al dente and the fish dishes were moist flavorful and served elegantly
Heaping portions hot food friendly but not overbearing thankfully staff
This place is good for pizza if you're looking for something different
It is different though so it's easily worth a try and I honestly would probably be back every once in a while if only for a change of pace from standard pizza places except that I usually don't even think about it since as I said it is kind of hidden away
I asked the sushi chef about lotus-- I wanted to know if it had a strong flavor
Bottom line is that if you are in downtown Phx and want reasonably good sushi for a good price go to Ichi-Ban on Central and Thomas
I'll preface this by saying I like the flavor of burnt food
But the food is good or at least what I've had so far
All in all we were really impressed with the food
The service was prompt helpful and friendly and the food was delicious and inexpensive
The non-dairy cheese is very good they also have many gluten free options pasta and pizza I have tasted the gluten free crust before and I have to say I think I liked it better than the whole grain crust
quality ingredients and hey they know how to make pizza
Even though we had ordered over $25 worth of food without our lunch special we were told we couldn't use our Groupon  because we ordered a lunch special
My husband had the meatloaf which was good but slightly overcooked and pretty small considering the price
The Mother Earth pizza is rife with just awesome vegetable ingredients and flavors
and a couple different fry breads that had ground beef on them these were delicious and were my favorites by far
I've never actually eaten dinner here because the happy hour food menu is enough to fill you up but I think I've tried almost all the items on the happy hour menu and I would recommend every one Ahi tacos guacamole green chile pork stew big ass burger seared ahi lamb chops and fondue and the drink specials are all mouth wateringly delicious
For a nice looking place with cheerful service and delicious food I'm not exactly all in
Pretty setting friendly but inexperienced service fun menu generally tasty and overpriced food
$8 later after eating 3 flavorless greasy shrimp and picking at the fish I threw it away because I knew I was going to throw up if I ate any more
Especially since the rest of the hotel's food wasn't so spectacular this place was quite a surprise
We shared fries the sliders and the egg rolls the waiter recommended the egg rolls
For two people approx $13 for two reasonably nice meals unless you are creep ed out by the bathroom or art workWe shared the chicken with hot peppers and honey sandwich it came on a bun and was served with large house made waffle fries and was garnished with 1/2 a large radish a broccoli one carrot finger  two small melon wedges and a pickle spear
these guys have really stepped up their game a notchback in the day it was subpar reallybut i ordered a spinach and sausage pizza a few weeks back and it was great not too much cheese and good thin crispy crustnot many places around the area are open latecome 1am you have a choice between various disgusting fast food chains ex$pen$ive $ilver mine $ubs or these guys which when you line em up isnt much of a choice at allgood job fella's now just dont mess it up
These food items were particularly good*  The seasoned Naan Bread served hot at the table
Everyone I know that's eaten the miso soup rates it above average There's a wide variety of rollsappetizers and drinks that are reasonably priced out-with happy hour
I came here because it had good reviews a groupon/living-social voucher and was craving some Mexican food that is actually spicy because I'm tired of going to restaurants that put that little jalapeno pepper graphic next to an entree only to have be as if they never put any spicy peppers in the darn meal
I give the restaurant the most credit for having the few Lao menu items as it is rare offering in Phoenix the majority of the menu items were Thai dishes and they were good too
The food is delicious and pretty inexpensive the portions are also very generous
It was definitely hot but did not make up for the lack of flavor the food it was smothered in
pizza that is determined  by the delicateness of the crust and the quality of the ingredients
The meatloaf was an Asian/fusion interpretation and was pretty tasty
If you want Asian/fusion food this place is pretty good
I've never tried the pizza or sandwiches but they look great and back when I used to eat chicken I thought their pesto chicken on my salad was really good
The pizza was so-so but not worth the price
My friends got the veal and the chicken marsala which were also truly wonderful
For service vibe and food quality you really can't go wrong with this place
We both got pizza but like I said it was good just nothing special
They were delicious The pastry was freshly made and very meaty inside
The food is very good and similar to what you might get a Chili's or Applebee's and not too much more expensive
The soup which was a pleasant surprise had a rich tomato flavor with small pieces of ditalini pasta and a few homemade meatballs sprinkled in
I ordered the Blackened Mahi Mahi which came with a Pineapple Relish Mixed Greens and a Cajun Remoulade Dressing -- very excellent concept for a dish and the flavors were really lovely together
However as I'm sitting there enjoyed the dish I start getting closer to middle of the mahi filet and I realize that it's not cooked
Note to customers If you're a spicy-food-junkie the hot will literally burn your esophagus
We both enjoyed the thin chewy crust brick oven pizzas
The food was great the service absolutely amazing our server made some really thoughtful suggestions
Being from Hawaii it's difficult for me to find good sushi here in the valley
The best deals are happy hour where you can get appetizers at half off while splurging on the other rolls
I had the prime rib special for my meal and the meat was really smokey flavored but not in a good way
I kind of wanted to stab my fork into the chicken pot pie that the guy at the table next to us was eating because it looked good--definitely looked better than my dinner
I ordered the yellowtail sashimi as well as the salmon sashimi and both of these fish came out very fresh and flavorful
I remember coming here a few years ago and really liking it so when Deal Chicken had an offer for $15 for $30 worth of food and drinks I grabbed one
The meat inside the chimis was pretty good but the chimi itself was disappointing
The red sauce was good and super spicy but the meat was pretty dry
At my most recent visit they had 32 trays of food out & it wasn't bad except for the low quality fried chicken legs & the awful hockey puck things that you see at some Chinese restaurants that are supposed to pass for Egg Foo Young
This is like a southwest chicken stew and it was very good
I opted for a Vietnamese fried rice with pork sausage and chicken which was quite good and a type of Pho with beef brisket
I really should have chosen the sliced beef over the brisket as I found the brisket pieces too tough to eat although the Pho itself had a wonderful taste
Service was good prices are super low for the quantity of food and my wife and I enjoyed our meals
I would not recommend this place because the food just wasn't good
I have been going here for quite a while and will continue to based on the quality of food their cleanliness and their friendliness
The service was a bit spotty and our food was only warm rather than hot
Second the food is very very good and fresh
We ordered the dumplings in chili oil from the dim sum menu as an appetizer and for dinner we ordered water boiled fish ChonQing spicy chicken and chicken with jalapenos for dinner
The ChongQing Chicken at Szechuan Cuisine is as good and as authentic as what you can expect in mainland China
Our guest had never experienced authentic Sichuan dishes and she was amazed and delighted at how flavorful the dishes were
The prices are decent too because the quality of the food and service is so un-parrelled it is rare
The food was light delicious and just the right quantity without making you feel like heavy
The seating I would say is a little tight but the food and service are excellent
The food is good and there's always ample seating indoors and out so you'll never wait
At the very least the rangoon are quite good and I do remember having some good chicken teriyaki there
I HIGHLY recommend the brown bag chicken sandwich; the addition of hazelnuts and blue cheese absoultely makes it
The food is good and filling and the prices are great for the amount and quality of food that you get
Someone in our party tried the chiles en Nogada which is a seasonal dish and it was excellent also
We definitely enjoyed the food a lot - it tastes fresh and made-from-scratch
Next time I am going to try the corned beef and cabbage - it looked delicious
not simply the sushi but the grilled items were wonderful we had the terriyaki spareribs and bacon wrapped scallops - yum
The roast beef was wonderful and not over cooked which is rare but the mayo which it touted as being herb spiced mayo seemed nothing more than plain old mayo and there was too much of it
After waking up at 3am and spending a few hours out there in the hot dessert you get pretty hungry
The rolls were good the salmon sashimi was awesome and prices weren't outrageous
The sauce was SUPER sweet and none of the meat had the slightest flavor or appearance of having been even wafted through smoke
It was good food and I was impressed they offered sweet tea vodka
Service was good - they were very friendly but when we asked for a menu they immediately pushed us towards the buffet special saying that the food on the buffet line contained the best items off of their menu
The quality of the meat/chicken was so-so
The pizza came promptly and it was very tasty
Looking at the menu we really didn't see what we thought we were going to see we got some recommendations from the staff and ended up with Meatloaf very good by the way and a dried out pork chop that was covered in a chipotle raspberry sauce gave me a great idea for my next BBQ they stated this dish was there best/fav
In summary the food is excellent the atmosphere is great and the hours of unbeatable
I'm surprised people are saying the food here is not good
I'm giving this Morton's 4 stars because every bit of our food was delicious
Plus there's still a soft spot in my heart for Udupi and their swoon-worth veggie dishes
Their pizza smells so good it's ridiculous
Their rolls are good sized some places have really small rolls
However if you want good sushi then this is the place
The cut and quality of the fish was nice and went down easily and the ingredients of soy sesame and green onions were all there but somehow I was a little underwhelmed by it which was strange since I'm a big fan of poke
I swear my dad nearly cried tears of pride and joy a few times smiling broadly as we ate our amazingly savory large Combination pepperoni ham bacon sausage beef mushroom olives green pepper onion pizzas as we watched/listened to Lew playing
To say the least is was very dry and the flavorless but maybe that's the price you pay when altering the dish so it is what it is
My son had an omelet that was plump and full of veggies/meats the hash browns were perfectly crisp eggs made to order were on target and their iced tea was good
The food has always been excellent and fresh and about the only place we go out to eatPlease do not change this great place to a Soup Nazi Field Kitchen or we will not return since we went to the one in Tempe and it was horrible and like some alternate universe ST and these good ratings will be dropping like a rock as have all the other locations that changed
My husband and I had several of their happy hours sushi rolls including Spider Roll soft shell crab is quite good there Philadelphia roll tuna sushi spicy crab roll shrimp tempura roll
Small chicken parm was good for a runner a big guy would want a full
My friend ordered the turkey meatloaf and left raving I must admit the sauce was mighty tasty
The food is out of control - good and fresh
My friend had the chicken salad sandwich and butternut squash soup and while she raved about the soup she was less than impressed with the sandwich
They have amazing food especially good appetizer options for group events the wine selection is wonderful and the service is the best I've had in Phoenix hands down
Lola reminds me a lot of Lux in terms of the food and drink selection and quality however the atmosphere is a more urban than grunge and the furniture is cleaner and does not have holes in the upholstery
The food was good but not great and our waitress was friendly but lacked a professional attitude
Penne Alla Campagna sounded good w/ spinach sun-dried tomatoes mushrooms & chicken - but it was somewhat bland chicken was tough
Our girls both got the pasta of the day which was penne with pesto chicken and sautu00e9ed yellow squash-delicious
The chorizo was good although I order it from the same place they do which I learned from a NewTimes story good job on this dish it was yummy and I enjoyed every melty piece of cheese and chorizo
This pizza is worthy of supporting a pizzeria let alone a Brew Pub
I think the price is just right because it is a specialty dish so I don't have any problem paying the $7 for an amazing crepe
I came here last night with my family for a birthday and the service was great the Rosa pizza was my favorite and I REALLY enjoyed the caprese salad
The only saving grace was that the food we did have was pretty good
The special that night was beef cheeks which if you are familiar and like them they can be amazing
I love fried chicken and theirs is really great especially if you add on the Louisiana hot sauce
Food = very goodService = not bad though it took 20 minutes to get the check after we were done
Instead of being attentive to the fact that you want to eat plants the vegetarian options are usually a bland house salad with sponge flavored tomatoes and cabbage that would be better suited as a packing material than food
Who would think seafood in the desert could taste so delicious and fresh
That's not a bad thing lord knows I love Fez and have enjoyed Hula's it's just a fact you need to know in order to have a proper expectation of the food
I like Roy's for that ;-- The food in general is good-not-great
Only wish that the carts with eggplant stuffed with shrimp or green peppers with shrimp were not on heated carts; by the time it gets to you the food is cold
This is a bit steep for for a buffet but it does mean that they can serve a high quality of food
They have fairly typical buffet fare a decent salad bar; a few cold pasta selections; chow and lo mein; white and fried rice; roughly 10-12 entree dishes; miso egg drop hot and sour and a spicy thai soup; a sushi bar with probably 5-8 types of sushi; and a few dessert selections including a hand-scooped ice cream bar with 3-5 types of ice cream
In regards to appetizer-style dishes The crab rangoon was very good with a good balance of cream cheese and crab
For my entree dishes The steak in black bean sauce was tasty with tender large chunks of beef and fresh red bell pepper and onion - and thankfully not greasy like some buffets I've patroned
The orange chicken was somewhat mediocre with neither enough spice nor orange flavor for my liking
Sesame chicken was nice with a good balance of sesame flavor and sweetness
Overall I was impressed with the quality of the food; most of the dishes were much more crisp than a lot of buffets with the vegetables retaining their snap and the coating on fried dishes still retaining some texture in the sauce come to think of it this might be why they do such small portions on the buffet
The soup was chicken noodle soup today it was loaded with goodies carrots onions celery chicken and lots of noodles
The was very juicy and tender because the bun was fresh the meat was tender and fresh and once you chew on it after about 2 bites this burst of cheese flavor enters your mouth and takes over the whole taste of the burger in a good way
Fourth Samples of Bonnie G's food - a caramel macaron tasty and the special of the day a Belgian waffle with strawberry-rhubarb sauce and creme fraiche
The food was decent had the southwest burger pretty tasty
Remember to pour some spicy salsa sauce on your food if you like hot stuff
Pretty mixed I'd say had the green tea soba dish it was pretty flavorful but the vegetables snowpeas and green beans mostly were waaaaay undercooked
Let me start this off saying the place is quite good for bar food but it just is not to my tastes
Here's what I can remember beer battered french fries with melted shredded cheese sides of ranch and ketchup three kinds of wings mild - for grandma hot and hot bbq both grilled salad chicken fingers and tots for the kiddo she didn't even touch them so I have no idea how she felt Sierra Nevada pint for $2
I love their chicken and brocolli fried rice and their egg rolls are good too
The food was pretty average - I had some unagi sushi shared the skewer appetizers and had a sushi/sashimi box for lunch
The food is pretty good and the presentation is pretty right on
While I'll gladly pay that amount for the concept organic grass fed etc I expect the food to be flavorful and delicious
The food on the buffet isn't as good as if you order fresh off the menu so don't judge Royal Taj on the buffet alone
They had a great smoked flavor and had lots of meat on then and cooked perfect
I told her that I couldn't have been better and that the dish's texture and flavor combinations were perfect
Hiro the owner is from Japan and is typically working on the bar - they seem to be having a good time back there rolling up a storm
I went home and days later was still dreaming about the wonderful Carbonara dish
The flavor of Lemongrass and cream did not blend well together and the fish itself was raw
I was even really impressed with the presentation of the food and the dishware
Both my boyfriend and I shared an egg roll appetizer we debated between this and the spring rolls which also sounded quite tempting
An overall very good value for all the food you get
I haven't had a chance to eat in yet but I did get to try their tikka masala chicken salad and it was good
The food did not blow me away but its good and the service is very friendly and efficient
All local food delicious and incredibly affordable
I was not familiar with New York style Chinese food before but apparently it means dingy restaurant ugly chairs and tables the same generic menu that you've seen dozens of times before flimsy plastic eating utensils and damn good food
This place is as good as it gets when it comes to pizza
Then we had a sonny boy pizza which was excellent with the right amount of meat to sauce and cheese ratios
It's a chain restaurant but EVERY ONE of these places has good food great service and an extensive menu good for big parties/bad for indecisive people
Their desserts are AMAZING and IF you can finish your meal then go for their signature cakes
Now I knew little about this place just that the food was very good and they had at least a few gluten free items on the menu
We ordered the baked wings with BBQ Chipotle sauce and Meat-Za Balls as appetizers and shared a small Vortex pizza with Picazzo's original crust for dinner and Eve's Temptation for dessert
Their RW deal included an appetizer two dishes as well as a side
The meat was very tender and the sauce was delicious but not overpowering
My other favorite was the tuna which was an excellent piece of fish very lightly seared and served with chunks of creamy cheese
The food was so good I am sure we will return since I have looked at their full menu online and I can't wait to try some of their other dishes
Each dish tasted very good individually but the secret of this place is when you eat them together
You can taste each individual dish and then find new flavors when blended together
Highly recommend sitting at the bar and eating the sushi/seafood
I got the Vegas roll it was good but didn't have a lot of fish in it
They also had noodle dishes hot and cold though cold is only served in the summer and a few select styles of really simple sushi not Westernized
The Palour Creations are just as good try the Santa Fe Sautee pepper grilled chicken or the Crack of Dawn complete in it's own pan
I've only ordered takeout but the food is as you'd expect if you've eaten at either of their other 2 locations which is to say its good
If you show up and this is the case don't be discouraged the food is good and their bar looks fully stocked
You just know you are going to get great food when the place is not much to look at from the inside or the outside which means the ONLY reason they are still in business is really good food & service
He should take his good food service skills somewhere else
Quality Coffee and the Food is a lot better than you may think
The food was delicious and there was about 10food vendors to choose from
Perfect for those who are looking for something RealForget about the exterior the seating or the lack of decor if you want that go to PF Changsbut if you want really good authentic Chinese food with TONS and TONS of options that you will never find the time to finish then this is the place
Stay away from all that and go for the good stuff~ COCONUT SHRIMP ~Quite Possibly the best see picsTheir Tempura Salmon roll is pretty good too but can vary this time it was a little over riced and the rice was on the sticky side but it was still tasty
We also ordered dinner and tried the Kung Pao chicken nice heat and not greasy Orange Peel chicken tasty but a little dry and not nearly as good as Bamboo Clubs and the Honey Seared Shrimp this was by far the best version of these I have ever had the shrimp were huge and the sauce was just perfect
I ordered their excellent fried chicken I am sure Chef Ramsey would like
I would hate to see this wonderful landmark of Arizona with their fun signs log-ular furniture great food and love filled great customer service fade away
Overall I'll keep this place on my radar for when I want some good Thai food that won't disappoint me
Anyhow it's simple cold-as-ice food no packets or small containers of salsa or any condiments of any kind shriveled up tiny limes the worst-ever Mexican takeout I've ever had
A nicely marbled piece of meat correctly charred on the outside leaving a nice flavorful juicy medium-rare on the inside
The fried bananas dessert was a tasty standout
It was AWFUL unless of course you like a bunch of pizza crust with nothing but cold spaghetti inside
On the good side they offer have slightly bland but passable interpretations of Mexican-inspired fast food
The greens were good except they taste like broiled in chicken stock
I'm use to eating greens broiled in neckbone/and or hamhock therefore all the natural flavor from the meat is used as a stock
Started with the egg rolls which were just deep friend and essentially flavorless
Aside from the amazing sake list cool atmosphere and good service the food is not only fun but delish
The claypot Red Curry Tofu is spicy and delicious and the Lemongrass chicken is the perfect cooling compliment
You get decent service in a totally mundane storefront but the food is good
After battling cacti for 5 hours we were ready for food and cold drinks
The food was great for the price - everyone was delighted with the quality and quantity of the food
They serve good beer and serve $3 car bombs all the time - if you don't like the food it's easy to drink until you do
The food is consistently excellent and the waitstaff friendly and attentive
I ordered the roasted corn pizza delicious
You can buy goodies and dessert at the grocery store or gelato over there
All in All I tried this place for food and I will not be going back or recommend to anyone I know
When we left I commented on a dish that someone was eating it looked real good the patron said you can get one to if you come here often
I for one love the shredded beef and both kinds of pork which are marinated to the point of being saturated with flavor in a good way
As I said before I've had much better meals there and I cannot justify the bill when we are not satisfied with the quality of food
The lunch specials are a really good deal at only $8 for a large portion salad and egg roll
The salad and egg roll weren't that impressive thoughI really liked the flavor of the pad thai and that it came with peanuts
Not only is Yogurtini's froyo super smooth and perfectly flavored they have angel food cake flavor
The food was mega tasty and they had a ton of vegetarian options
but over all aside from our lame waiter good experience and good food =]
The curries were not very tasty and did not have much meat or vegetables in them
Food here is for the most part pretty good
The chicken penne pasta and the mac n cheese are pretty darn good
I like this place for a lot of reasons but it seems to be going down in their food quality
Both desserts were chocolate and were good but nothing special
Their pizza is real good and I also had their weirdo version of nachos which was good too
I used to live in Porland and this bar reminds me of that scene; good beer laid back vibe and stellar pub food
I guess may be its business is not that good I have strong feeling that they cut cost because its food quality is aweful
Good service great food served fairly quickly
Pizza Rosa with extra fennel sausage - excellent but not for red sauce loversWhen the waiter set my pizza on the counter my eyes got very big
' & purple rain while you're scarfing down some good fish
Not the straight out the water fresh but the THIS-IS-AS-GOOD-AS-IT-CAN-GET-SUSHI- WISE-OUT-HERE fresh
Though Sakana has 2 other locations in the valley it does not have the flavor of 'chain' sushi
What I didn't see and wish to comment upon;Pros-Amazingly tasty sangria maybe the best in town; really fresh ingredients; prices that won't break the bank and special food
It had wonderful chantrelle mushrooms in it that were meaty and delicious
The katsu itself is good drizzled with a little *authentic* tonkatsu sauce but didn't compare to the other two dishes
Very good value for the quality of food that you receive
The food is actually really good way way better than Golden Corral
Hubby and I love it because you can get quality cooked food which is surprising for a buffet including salmon cheesecake fried fish and more
My mother in law got the catfish I snuk a bite and it was pretty good
It's extremely delicious Thai food if slightly difficult to get a table if you are a group of 8 or more understandable
While in my personal experience at Posh the quality and deliciousness of the food I had definitely justifies the price-tag it should - if the quality wasn't extraordinary it wouldn't rank at all
Overall this is a great family owned restaurant the food is simply tasty and doesn't have that fishy taste everyone worries about when sushi is mentioned
Good job Yen I was getting tired of signing high bills while on a half empty stomach from most sushi places
Chicken wrap schwarma - pita wrap with lots of veggies chicken and a creamy white garlic sauce which was very strong but good
The chicken itself didn't seem to have too much flavor but everything together made it A-OK
Very casual atmosphere and feel but the food quality and portions are quite good
Most items are around $8-10 and it is a very casual atmosphere but you're getting very good food for that price whether you dine there or take it home
For an unpretentious pasta place that is rather fast with their food this is a good place to visit
Ok I know its commonly said that you get what you pay for which is true in the case of the cardboard pizza impostures that sell pies for $6 and flavor their crust
That's a hefty penny for pizza that size even if the ingredients are good quality
The food was all preordered so we had a lot of different things which were all very tasty
I really liked the flavor of the jade red chicken and I didn't want to taint it by putting it in a burrito or quesadilla but it stands up just on its' own
Being Jamaican I liked the jerk chicken it could have been more flavorful but jerk chicken isn't Chinese or Mexican so I won't fault them there
Secondly the food here is pretty good as well
Dishes with fish black beans chicken breasts spinach etc made with delicious Mexican flavors
I was determined to be impressed with the fresh fish I read about and was hoping that we'd found a place close to home for happy sushi time
maybe if I came on a good night he would make stronger sushi rolls and the fish would be just delivered and maybe my whole experience would be speical and I'd be thrilled to have Hana right nearby
He picked Lon's because there are many sources saying it's a great place to watch an Arizona sunset which we found out is simply not true but the food was delicious & the evening lovely
The creamed corn that came with the dish was delicious
It was hard to taste flavor of the meat due to the overwhelming amount of BBQ sauce
POOR POOR POOR customer service over priced food considering the quality and amount that you receive
The aroma and presentation were good but the meat was definitely not tenderloin filet
That said if you want some good fried chicken and waffles head here
Their hotel restaurant was very good and the food fresh the room was adequately sized and comfortable the lobby was beautiful and the hotel overall was newly constructed
I've also dined-in during lunch their busiest hours and they do a great job of getting customers in and out without sacrificing their quality of food
This last time my friend ordered the bebimbop and she said the dish was very good
first off i always order their picasso salad i am not a salad person but this thing is made for a man they are not skimpy with the ingredients loads of chicken cheese and onions with an amazing tangy chipotle ranch dressing this thing is enough for 2 people
The chicken is not the best chicken I've ever had but the best chicken I've ever had was so good that if I told you how good it was you would simply assume that I was exaggerating
There are Macayo's all over the valley so go find one & enjoy their wonderful food
The beef was a little too rough for me and wasn't as flavorful and the rest of the bowl seemed out of balance too much tripe or too little meatballs my OCD self had problems trying to get even proportions of meat throughout the meal
Orange chicken was kind of bland the shrimp were good and the egg rolls weren't so delicious
It's great to be able to go to a place where you can get a lot of groceries including hard-to-find food items stuff your face on a tasty meal and come out not having spent much at all
There is not a ton of seating inside but the food here is excellent
The service is always friendly and the food is delicious
The food is fantastic but also the new staff is amazing
All of the food was seasoned excellently and very filling for the price
The roulette peppers are also fun and I've enjoyed the brown bag chicken sandwich
The food was good but quickly overlooked by the terrible service I've received both times I've been here
The presentation was decent and the sushi was delicious
My husband LOVES the Carne Adovada the Smoked Pork Tamale and the shredded beef enchilada with the smokey red sauce - what can I say he is a meat-a-saurus - but he is also pretty picky and even he was impressed
A wide variety of nice steaks ribs and other tasty grilled meats
If burgers & fries aren't your thing they have Kisras think like pizza minus the cheese and their daily specials are amazing
Overall we thought the food was very good
Thankfully they are foodies just like we are so we ordered up a plethora of deliciousness and the person who waited the table told us we must have did a lot of research ahead of time
Highly recommend anyone to just try this place but don't expect the standard Chinese fare of orange chicken or fried rice dishes
The not-so-good  They seemed to really just phone-it-in on the side dishes
I'll still give the other two desserts at Postinos a try but so far I'm unimpressed
We ordered the Eggplant Rollatini as an appetizer and it was a very small portion though it was delicious
Torched Goodness is a mobile food truck that serves up oh so very decadent cru00e8me brulee
I recently started using twitter and for the past week followed OK stalked Torched Goodness torchedgoodness to see when I would have my chance at one of my favorite dessert treats
For the main dishes we ordered the seabass yum ahi tuna amazing
The flavor of the food was okay but not the best I have had
I wondered to myself what they must think getting the one white guy in the place - then the loud clanking noise of him dropping the cart and the food on the ground told me they probably weren't impressed
A little expensive for the lackluster performance and average quality of the food
Someone who doesn't want any southwestern flavor at all could go with the hamburger chicken sandwich hold the jalapeno mayo or caesar salad
It is pricey but I am willing to pay extra for what I think is good food
The food is very good and definitely not fancy
I recommend the Polish Sausage sandwich and beef sandwich as well had those a couple weeks ago
have a vacation home in queen creek so i dnt  know how to go anywhere else other then to the shopping center where walmart is at this is where i came across the jungle buffet so i figuer i would give it a try i was so suprised how economical this place is and everyone was nice n friendly the place is cheap n has good food i almost felt as if i should pay more
They have a good selection of food and beer
To those as sick of going to LGO Pizzaria as me It was so wonderful to walk into one of our small architectural treasures that hasn't been torn down but actually adaptively re-used and re-imagined into a gorgeous warm yet contemporary eatery
I appreciated the dipping sauces and the hard to pronouncecured meats and delicious cheeses that our waitress was sweet enough to repeatedly pronounce for all of us approaching our 3rd or 4th glass of wine
5 stars but I'm rounding down to three because the happy hour deal is good for food not so much for drinks and nothing I tried aside from the crab cakes makes me want to have a full dinner at Flemings
The food was fresh and flavorful and probably the best mediterranean food I have had outside of Italy
The menu includes seafood meat dishes vegan dishes gluten-free meals appetizers desserts and a full bar
I highly recommend this restaurant for meat eaters and veggies alike
The food I've tried was excellent the space is very pretty and nothing beats open air upscale mexican when it's this nice out in AZ
Lastly I had the Bufalada taco which was surprisingly hearty and had great flavor from the tortilla to the meat cheese and guacamole on top
Both the falafel and hummus are very tasty and I have enjoyed their chicken shwarma pita sandwich too
We sampled the wings some weird little sausage rolls and the corned beef and cabbage taquitos which I must say were quite tasty in a really unexpected way
But a stroll around the hotel gardens after dinner was quite nice
I paid $12 for the plate and when I say it  I said to myself what the hell where is my 12 bucks worth of food
I must say the food is very good but they do not give you a lot of rice or beans which you think that they would
Bottomline Good food  not in the regular mexican fare groupCon; No enough on your plate for the the price you get even if it is a gourmet
On the recommendation of the waitress tried the O toro which I've never heard of before and it was thee best tasting and most succulent piece of fish I have ever ever ever eaten
It isn't fine dining but the food is good and I'm always in a good mood as I walk up to the front door of this establishment
A simple margherita pizza is my test for good pizza places
Staff is friendly and the pizza is about as good as it gets in the Valley
The chicken was very tasty and there was a few tomatoes included
I must since I've probably dropped over $100 here in the past month between the 25 minute drive the ticket price and food; but I've got to say it's worth every penny
The food selection is good - chili's quality but perfect for the movie and dining experience
Which is fine but the first time I went to filibertos in high school I ordered the chicken burrito and it was good but it is literally just a tortilla stuffed with chicken in red sauce
The thin crust pizza is amazing especially the white pizza
I have to admit I am an aspring gourmet in the sense that occasionally I find a menu difficult because I'm not familiar with the unusual dishes and don't know if I will like them while at the same time sensing that they are amazingly delicious and I should just get over it and take the plunge
The grapefruit and hamachi dish was the stand out served as a shot in ceramic spoons
Watching Nobu prepare his dishes also helped us decide on what we'll be having on our next visit the hirame carpaccio looked especially good
The dishes are served tapas style in small portions by US standards because his focus is clearly on quality over quantity so if you lean towards more is more you may find reason to grumble
Otherwise I will not waste my time and stick to truly good Italian food at Rigatonies
5 hours for appetizers and about 2 hours for food
The Ecuadorian fish ceviche was unbelievably good and hearty
The food is worth the price and I strongly suspect that the kitchen performs better when the place is not packed to the gills
The food wasn't tasty when it arrived - and it had taken forever to get the attention of the waitress for anything
I also had a dish that was a pepper stuffed duck and pomegranite that was soo good
The servers are polite and the service is good if occasionally a bit on the slow side but this place is not about the service-- it's about the food
The Chicken Texas Toast and waffle fries were amazing
I don't mind spending extra if I know that I'm getting good food
They truly appreciate your business and have some amazing food
Folks it takes more than good food to make a good restaurant
The rest of the menu looks good for dinner and lunch--plenty of comfort food with creativity and flavor
Or I would get one of the hot sandwiches on a sub roll like the Encore sans ham
The bread still isn't much to talk about but the unique sandwiches it sports like The Blues which is some delicious cajun chicken concoction make me wish I could eat two
Each time I have been here the food has been very good
The meat was not very good and kind of dry the tortillas were just ok
I'm not a huge fan of fast food but even I was persuaded by all the tails of the amazing In-N-Out-Burger
While I can't name all the dishes I've had there I can certainly vouch for the BBQ chicken sandwich and burger and I've only had one dish there that didn't excite me but that's a pretty good track record considering the number of times we've eaten here
Almost after every review she instructs me to have Thai - I guess good Thai food is in short supply in Athens GA
The parking was easy to get into and the store was packed - a good sign of good food
Not just your average ham and cheese place lots of steamed hot specialty meats and toppings
It's so good that you almost expect the weird bald guy from the travel channel to pop into the back and start pulling out gizzards from some unknown asian fish
The veggie tempura roll was warm all of the ingredients were fresh and there was no discernible fishy flavor that sometimes plagues the seaweed at other restaurants
it was a nice leisurely stroll for a good 10 mins
Main ingredient oh how your deliciousness overfloweth and your food ain't bad either
Many of their dishes are served with a crispy crusted soft and extremely tasty bread and on a side note ask them for a side of olive oil for dipping it in
One of their most famous ice flavors is Swedish Fish
I guess its the price that gets me for the quality of food you are getting
The restaurant had a good pizza joint vibe
Dara Thai is probably the best place to dine in Anthem in regards to quality of food
They have an extensive menu with most of the traditional Thai dishes along with Here are some recommendations For apps veggie rolls crab wontons are ok but go with the Satay ~ slices of chicken marinated in curry and grilled
Soups; their Koew Num wonton soup is good however I suggest going for the Tom Ka Gai which is a hot/sour soup with chicken lemon grass mushrooms something else not sure what is but taste good in a coconut milk broth served in a flaming soup tureen
Dinner/Lunch; Pad Thai Kao Pad Kari Panang Curry are all good and you would not be disappointed but I recommend either Pad Gaeng Pa Curry or Goong Gartiem Prik Thai ~ shrimp dish with garlic snow peas onions and broccoli
As for food- we had the fajitas- very good- the steak wasn't overcooked like a lot of places tend to do word of advice though- not good as left overs so make sure you bring your appetite and finish them there
blanket statement- i've done a lot of things for really good food-waiting in line traveling bribing maitre'ds
but I'm not waiting 4 hours for just pretty good pizza
I've learned over the years that if they can make a simple dish of Phad Thai and Chicken with yellow curryIt's all good with me
So as i ordered the the above mentioned they served a bowl of soup and a spring roll with my orderwas very happy with it good flavors and staff was really great
Then it was time for the main dish and i was really impressed with how fast it came out and flavor-full it was
Both of them said their pizzas were very good
I had a nice Shiraz with my pizza which was a good decision
The sushi bar was good too--better sushi than I've seen at other buffet
I didn't notice this until I was already at dessert but other people at my table had gotten it and it looked really good
They had good desserts too which is usually my least favorite part of a buffet
Overall pretty decent food good desserts the drinks are a little hit or miss
I wouldn't mind so much if the food tasted good but
Food items were drenched in a good amount of chile sauce
However the Wagyu Japanese beef they served was very tasty and I usually hate beef
We got our own binchotan grill but the waiter helped us out with cooking the beef since we had never done it before
As I have grown older I seem to be sweating more when I eat hot foods
Their food is fresh and delicious and considering how insane their lunch rush is they do a pretty solid job of getting you in an out of there pretty damn quickly
The chicken breast was tender and extremely flavorful and the sauce was nice and spicy
It was your run of the mill fajita wrap again very tasty and flavorful but not quite as good as my buffalo chicken wrap
All of their famous complete meals come with fresh baked bread and it is great sourdough providing you get a hot loaf soup or a crisp green salad with choice of dressing small upcharge for Ceasar and a beverage providing you order either coffee hot tea iced tea or milk - NOT SODA and their signature spumoni or vanilla ice cream for dessert
The sushi was OK for Goodyear but certainly not to major coastal city standards
Most items on the menu are cooked to order besides desserts and it is also made from scratch they use very good ingredients in their recipes you can't beat fresh homemade for so inexpensive
The potatoes were huge the horseradish fresh and spicy hot
The entire night was terrific and the next time we return to Phoenix we will probably go to D and C's every night because we know the food will be excellent and the service perfect
The goat cheese stuffing and the fig jam however resulted in an overall quite tasty dish
the place smells good and the food is fresh and authentic
I am glad our waiter recommended the short ribs with the blue cheese grits it was probably the single best dish on their entire menu the rest seemed
The short rib was absolutely killer it had a sasperilla glaze on it that was amazing and the meat just fell off of the bone
Finally good taps and food in the Tempe marketplace for the craft beer kind of person
The people who run the place are almost as amazing as the food they serve
We tried the Poutine Crab Cake Schnitzel and my favorite the Cabbage Rolls freakin' amazing
Food came to us fairly fast and was hot
Food had a lot of flavor and had its own personality
The broth was delicious & fragrant my meats all tender & tasty - tripe is not always tender but here it was
This is the first time I've been in a Vietnamese restaurant with good French-influenced desserts although having been to Saigon I know that it's entirely possible
I'm glad I don't have to drive all the way down to Mesa or Chandler for good Vietnamese food
The mashed potatoes are unique and tasty and mostly all dishes I have had we're good
The food was good and the service got a little better but it took the owners daughter to get better service
We had the seafood fondue appetizer which was OK but complete garbage compared to Pappadeaux's
The pitas are fresh and flavorful the tzatziki is kickin' and the gyro meat beef and chicken are always moist and delicious
They have consistently good no-frills Mexican food and I much prefer it over the chain locations that are around
The rest of our table seemed happy with their food- although general consensus was that the breakfast potatoes were not that good bland and a little overcooked
The Summer Time Roll is a deliciously refreshing roll and the highlight of the evening
The California Crunch rolls were tasty the spicy Crab was a big hit with my friend and the Crunchy Tempura Shrimp with eel sauce was my favorite
We also tried one of their many special rolls we went for the Booty Booty Roll not just for the name but because it seemed to have a complex flavor profile
based on our personal tastes we didn't find the  Booty Booty Roll to be Rockin Everywherebut it was good just maybe too many flavors at once I would probably go for something simpler next time
I also saw some of the other food coming out of the kitchen and it looked good and being that the thought of raw fish would disgust my wife I know she'd be able to find something to eat too
Our food came hot and ready I ordered the Seafood Cannelloni - hot and sooo delicious; worth the $13 I paid for it
Great food great drinks and amazing decor  Hanny's had me at hello
the hamachi is delicious and their salads are a great value fresh greens and slices of silky salmon yellow tail ahi and white fish
We've tried a few different dishes all of which were great but judging by the quality of what we've gotten it seems to be the kind of place where one could safely order just about anything on the menu and not be disappointed
The ingredients are so fresh and delicious and there's just the right amount of mint to add the necessary flavor to set these veggie spring rolls apart from so many others
If you're looking for excellent Vietnamese food this is definitely a place that you shouldn't miss
It is $75 per person so it is not cheap but you definitely get your money's worth of food - and the price is similar to what you would pay for appetizer entree and dessert but you get WAY more food than that - a great way to go
Everything was great up to the meat entrees special mention to the pasta dishes - wonderful
My only recommendation if you order meat is to ask them to not add salt or easy salt whatever
Although the food was so-so our waiter was very attentive and did an excellent job
Their burgers are really good too and today I had the Old Town Stack a prime rib sandwich with an onion slaw horseradish mayo on a pretzel bun that was pretty tasty
I seriously gobbled down that summertime roll fast and impressed many
She's not easily impressed with food either
I wish there were ones like it in Central Phoenix so I don't have to drive a half hour for good food and a good dining experience
Prices are moderate for this quality of food and atmosphere and the free valet parking is convenient
The food quality I would put on the lines of cafe cooking/food
I would personally suggest that if you want a place to eat with good food good service was for us good portions at good prices stop in and see Kathy or Mo
If you go just a couple blocks northeast you'll find great Mexican food good service and a great patio at a different restaurant
The red jade chicken was also good as a quesadilla but I think It might be better alone with rice
We perused the NY Times had a refill of pretty good coffee we are coffee snobs before our food arrived which in my assessment was the perfect amount of time
The seasonal pop tart for dessert was extremely good too
Try this pub especially if you love a good atmosphere and pub food
The price is fair and the food is fresh and hot
They gain stars back since the sushi rolls themselves were pretty good
At least the food would be good and the service predictable
He ordered a dish called Mariscos and I took a bite or two and it was delicious
The thought of the rich flavor it never left my mind I can just appreciate traditional Spanish food
I went back last week with a girlfriend for a lunch and had the blackened fish tacos - amazing
For dinner we ordered the steamed white bass & Meatloaf -- so delicious
I'm not a big dessert guy but dude the pecan pie was amazing
They have some really wonderful and unique dishes
Good late night spot for some pizza after hitting up the clubs in Old Town
We came here after going out this weekend for some good old fashion late night food
They have a good selection of pizzas ready to heat up and serve to you
I hear the pizza's pretty good so I may return during the day to try it but I probably won't go again on a Saturday night
50 and they have an excellent recipe for cheesy green bean casserole right on the back that fits the only dish I happen to have at home for a casserole
We were headed for a perfectly nice 5-star lunch at Prime but he saw this place on the way and got into his head the notion that a shitty unclean interior with apathetic if not rude waitress service and mediocre food was what we needed instead of the spotless interior eager-to-please service and delicious food waiting for us at Prime
The chicken was moist and flavorful lots of gooey melted cheese the dipping sauce they gave was to die for
I've had lunch here twice and have really enjoyed the food
Awesome ambiance friendly staff delicious food
they have a full menu of italian ribs chicken burgers appetizers etc
The bread was soft and all the meats pulled pork prime rib Asian chicken were moist and flavorful
The food was interesting and very good overall
Over the course of several hours he whipped up three amazing courses with wine pairings demonstrating how to make each dish and answering questions
The food was amazing the wine was perfect and the company could not be beat
The food itself is pretty good for the most part
I'm a huge fan of their shrimp fajitas as well as the chicken but haven't been impressed by the pork of the Cadillac beef
They definitely make the dish and experience eating at this place and without them I wouldn't it wouldn't be half as good
There can be a wait for your food but please it is worth it and quality takes time- if you want fast go to Taco Bell
Please if you are looking for AMAZING food and a welcoming environment head to Sonora Mesquite Grill- and tell Celina Mr YELP sent you
I've been lucky finding good Italian food places as of late
But in the end the pretty good food couldn't save me from an overall meh dining experience
As for price - any good sushi restaurant is going to be expensive but we've spent as much or more at lesser quality restaurants like Sakana
If you like Sushi at all please make your way to Yasu - it's well worth almost any drive
The drinks came quick and we placed our food order of many appetizers
00 dish without flavor delicate  texture and care in the cooking
actually I've been to Chelsea's a handful of times and I've enjoyed the food and ambiance on each occasion
For me one of the particularly unique and amazing Chicago-style dishes are their hot wings
Wings are no good without pizza so I ordered a slice of cheese pizza too
To top off some really good food the service is really nice as well
They use high quality beef when making them
The food was good not the best Mexican food I've ever had I'm from Texas but it definitely curbed the hunger for a few hours until I got home
Dessert was so delicious I would go to Cowboy Ciao just for after-dinner drinks and dessert
We tried nearly all of them and for some reason they were a far cry from the quality of their standard dishes
Went with the fish special which was cooked perfectly and in a delicious simple Asian sauce
Yes it was a ton of food since the entree also came with rice beans and perfectly cooked sweet plantains but everything was really delicious
It was not the best I've had in PHX but definitely tasty and there was plenty of seafood inside for me to enjoy I now realize just how brave I was to order seafood in this place -- it honestly scares me to think back on it
My gf ordered the recommended chicken dish and lurved the hell out of it I agreed and actually was wishing I'd gotten that instead of the Salvadorian marinated steak which was good but paled in comparison to the chicken
Also served with appetiser and as a sidedish with the food was a bean soup which was good and great for dipping the tortillas in
The meat quality was poor in my opinion
This time we had pulled pork with pickled red cabbage topped with a surprise of black radish on a fresh bun and the most delicious perfect curried chicken salad on a poppy seed bun
The only reason I didn't give five stars is the price of the salads when you add meat to them $18 I had one once and although IT WAS GREAT not worth $18 I don't know if the salad was smaller than it should have been or not I still remember the $7 extra to add the  salmon maybe 2 oz  also we've found service hit or miss when an unexpected rush of business happens  but had mostly good service
The sandwiches are so tasty I have to eat the whole sandwich and I have no room for dessert and MISS the to die for over the top ice cream sandwiches I had once before after the $18 salad I had once
Good food but some very bad employees forgot my phone on the table came back 10 min later and the girl who was waiting my table claim to never have seen it and was very defensive about it the manager Jason told me to stop harassing his employees instead of doing something about it
I think she is called MariaTo bad because the food is really good and I often travel from Flagstaff to Tucson and was planning to stop there more often
The sandwiches are really flat bread pizzas but quite tasty
Seen on the food network to get the Rosa and it was OK but not as good as they made it sound
All in all its good but you'll have to wait 2 hours for pizza that tastes a lot like the restaurant Sauce
The biggest downside to shopping at Photomark is that unlike Tempe Camera they don't break down pro packs of film--if they don't stock or the manufacturers don't make a given film in single-roll packages you're stuck buying an entire pro pack
The meat seemed like it had been boiled and then some sort of smoke flavor added
But for 3 of us 2 soup appetizers 3 sodas 3 pasties and a dessert it came up to just over $40
The selection of prepared foods healthy/special diet items etc is amazing
While not bad the fish wasn't flaky and the sauce peanut something-or-other was so heavy it masked the mahi flavor
There was a pretty good sized meat selection including marinated steak which I chose
I've eaten at this Chompies innumerable times and by-and-large the food is quite good
If you have a sweet tooth and enjoy French toast this is definitely a dish that is worth a try
The Trout - AI was really impressed with this pizza it was cooked really well
The quality of dishes served on the lunch buffet is not the same as it once was
I came in for lunch 3 more times over the past few months with other people because we were in the area but it was unmistakable the food here is not nearly as good as it used to be
Food seemed to be OK and as my game was ending families came in for supper a good sign
The meat had the consistency of shrimp gross and a weird flavor that still lingers in my mouth hours later
So his mom liked the food and that was the point of going here but that does not mean that I have to give it a good rating
The food is delicious the portion sizes are big the price is cheap and the food comes out fast
The food is the most consistently delicious and I still stand by my previous statement that Zipps has the best bar food in the state
When i went date night we had the roman artichoke with bread crumbs great vegetable antipasti good and the meatballs with some spaghetti average
All in all i was mildly impressed with the food
The crab puffs were more crab meat than cream cheese with great flavor
The Curry Beef stew was amazing with an excellent flavor they actually put this in two containers one for the beef and noodles with one for the broth
The Wunan beef had just the right amount of fire to it and was just plain delicious
The quality of food is truly amazing for the price
Maybe I ordered wrong but my dish and my date's were far from outstanding; no great flavors or anything exciting at all about our food
They have good lunch combos and their egg rolls are better-than-average
Very happy with the food and service pizza is delicious
Pizza - deliciousCustomer appreciation - needs improvementHope some changes have been made over the last couple of years
If you're looking for a place to grab some simple inexpensive comfort food and are in north central phoenix this place is worth a stop
The Tacos de Pescado satisfied my fish-taco craving and the Oaxacan Hotdog just screamed try me
The rib meat really does fall off the bone and you can smell the hickory wood and taste the dry rubbed spices with each bite of rib which was mouthwatering and delicious
If this is any indication of the quality of the food at Digestif I will certainly become a devoted fan
Good food but if you do take out check things before you pay
I'll be back whenever I have a craving for good food or for home
Brown Bag Chicken - glad the server told us it was cold huge flavors so tasty
The horseradish sauce was indeed good but there lacked anything GOOD to put it on
We were there for nearly 2 hours because he took so long with everything the food was very good though
Our second visit was ok the service was better but the food wasn't as good
We had dinner last Saturday and as usual the service was great the food very tasty and the portions huge as always
The ones at Eddie V's had no filler and tons of lump crabmeat that was really good
The perogies and cabbage rolls are authentic and delicious and the kielbosa is TO DIE FOR
I just wish I had eaten less beforehand so I could have eaten more of my meal seared rare fish isn't as good microwaved
The food is delicious and the atmosphere is beautiful  I just read what i have typed thus far I said beautiful in a review
The fish tacos FRIDAY ONLY are delicious
The only fish tacos that are better than these are at Rubios but these are very good and you get onion rings as a side dish here but not at Rubios
The mushroom burger with a meat patty and sauteed small mushrooms as a topping for the meat is messy but good
It took about 10 minutes to get our food but it was worth it
The meat was fresh the bread was delicious the giardenira had a little kick and the au-jus was unreal
To start I had a yummy Mexican pizza appetizer $7 made with fry bread black beans and cheese
I went here for lunch based on a recommendation from a foodie friend who said it was good
Chicken Tikka Masala seasoning texture and consistency of the dish was excellent
Chicken was just a tad try but overall great flavor
Would be more awesome if they sliced up the chicken into smaller cubes to give flavor consistency
Each of the meats in it were tasty in its own right BUT there was too much going on
A little on the greasy side they were tasty and filling with a price that was pretty decent for the amount of food on my plate
It can be hard to find a good salmon dish around here and this dish was perfect
I ordered the Yellow Curry with Rice and the Fish Patty with Cucumber Chili sauce as an appetizer
The Achiote  Chimichurri  with the beef tenderloin had so many layers of flavor; I've never had anything like it
The chicken caesar salad was good too
'Spicy Chicken Poblano' poblano chili pepper stuffed with spicy chicken dipped in egg batter then deep fried and topped with a delicious vegetable tomato sauce served with rice and beans
The Vig is a great place to go if you want delicious food a casual atmosphere and the potential to meet a lot of new people
Blue fin tuna flight was their special tonight and it was so delicious that I took a moment to close my eyes and indulge in the moment of the melting fresh fish in my mouth
I've had steak both times I've been there and while it was very good the sashimi rice hotpot and desserts are must haves
I go here for lunch every few weeks the food and service are always good
Appetizers cheese steak springrolls duck pot stickers
Their chicken kabob whether in plate or sandwich form is juicy and delicious
After the server put all our plates down he went to the table next to us who had been seated for about 10 minutes and said they would have to wait an hour for their food and he recommended they go somewhere else
The food was very good and very reasonably pricedIt is an outdoor hotel ie rooms are along outdoor corridor and the garden view was a little misleading
I recently brought my mom last week and she described the food as delicious and today took part in the 3-5pm $5 happy hour delish
the TUSCAN CHICKEN sandwich grilled chicken breast ciabatta bread pesto mayo lettuce tomato fresh basil mozzarella cheese and green olive and pepperoncini relish was delicious
FOODTHE BEGINNING AppetizerWe started with the Lobster Degustation
The food isn't exactly gourmet but the produce is all fresh and delicious and you just know that these sandwiches are made with love
The ambiance isn't much to speak of--you eat at some tables at one side of a grocery store or you can take your food to go--but when the food is this good who cares
I also got chicken saag and aloo gobi both of which were excellent
And there is this authentic french bistro staffed with friendly french folks serving up excellent food
Very good although even better if they would spring for slightly more lean meat a bit greezy
We've tried several pasta dishes and they were lacking originality and flavor
The chicken was decent but once again flavor deficient
It combines the three necessaries for a wonderful Thai dining experience great spicy food cheap prices and charming ambiance
The food was very mediocre unfortunately and didn't have a lot of flavor
But while the food meets anyone's expectations of French culinary quality and professional service it delivers without the stuffiness
I am patient especially when the food is so delicious but the lack of concern from the servers is a bit much
My biz partner had a chicken salad wrap The Deadhead that was completely over-the-top delicious
We had the shrimp ceviche appetizer and various tacos - halibut shrimp pork and beef
There's so much good food and large portions I rarely finish it
This is a great place for quality food a beautiful and romantic atmosphere and cheap dining
The brisket was tender but was lacking the flavor of the other two meats
Well don't tjudge a book by its cover and check this place out The food The entrees = delicious
Price Fairly expensive but worth it for the quality of the food and service
What makes MBB unique is the quality of the food and the quality of the ingredients they use to make it
Whitefish can be difficult I understand that but this was a sad grey about room temp and not very good
The food well the Duck tacos although good the menu should have read Tapa's or appetizer's $4 for 1 baby street taco
At that time I thought I wouldn't be back it was dirty and smelt weird and the food wasn't good
So if you are looking for some good Cuban food check this place out and try the yucca
Our food got cold while we were waiting for the rice
I wasn't wild about the sliders but the chicken and grilled cheese sandwiches were amazing
the chicken was all breast meat with a really good Marsala sauce
The strangest thing about this whole ordeal is the fact  the main ingredient of my appetizer and sushi roll was not even on the menu
Appetizers Angel wings-- fried chicken drumsticks stuffed with noodles and spices
Panang curry-- I enjoyed this but we ordered this with chicken and I personally think it tastes better with beef
The floral/country decor that had provided the setting for comfort food has been replaced with red walls lined with large black and white photos of celebrities like Marilyn Monroe and Rat Pack favorites
There was so much chicken though I took one of the breasts home as leftovers and ate it cold the next day on a salad
The food was exactly what I hoped for fresh and flavorful
I ordered the BBQ Chicken Salad with tasty mixed greens roasted poblano peppers and lots of other good stuff mixed in
If you have time afterward and it's not too hot take a stroll around the place admire the flowers and plants maybe even pick up some fruits for veggies they have for sale out back
To start the pizza crust was good crispy throughout and bubbled up around the edges as one would expect from a brick oven pizza
The most bland flavorless nothing of a sauce that makes a person wonder if the chef understands that there is something called spices that can be added to food to enhance flavor
When I feel like a complete glutton I go for the calzone but be warned - it's about three meals' worth of food
I was very disappointed in the food quality and variety at this price
Perhaps this is why the quality of the pizzas has gone down
The burgers and chicken here are delicious always cooked well and never too hot or cold
Cheese eggs beans potatoes salsa and your choice of meat highly recommend the chorizo
Food was beautifully plated and absolutely delicious
The service was pretty blah but the food was excellent
I've only had their sushi not any cooked food off the menu besides appetizers
Sushi is consistently delicious and fresh
Tyler makes an awesome yellowtail hand roll with avocado; all their hand rolls are so good yellowtail salmon spicy tuna
If you really want to try some great taco shop food I would recommend Los Compadres on 7th Avenue between Camelback and Indian School or Carolina's further up Union Hills
The delivery was right on-time and the food was still hot
It is excellent for I just rolled out of bed and want some breakfast or maybe lunch nothing fancy just stick with what you know kind of meals
It was pretty good here though the numbing flavor that is the norm for this dish was a tad lacking
Previous recent failures includedFish tacos - good fish but way too much of the melon salad on top and soggy tortillasBrussel sprout salad - again could have been great but overdressed and soggy and skimpy on the other ingredientsGreen Chile Burger - ordered medium
Good attentive service but if you are a foodie I would try elsewhere
Menu is nothing amazing I ordered the mango chicken rice plate and there was no real pop to the dish just real bland and the chicken tasted rather gamey since the flavor of the sauce was so weak
Considering all the wonderful Vietnamese food there is in Phoenix I would go else where for half the price
The food was very good but we felt rushed between courses as if they needed to turn the tables quickly
I don't know if it's just me but I actually didn't find the food that amazing compared to the places I've been in California
I enjoyed the flavor of the panang curry although the beef was tough but the pad thai was a little too sour for my taste I like it sweeter and the chicken in both noodle dishes was pretty dry
I did get to try the battered fish from a friend that was mighty tasty and I saw two friends devours the peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream
I kid you not the bread was fresh the cheese was thick and the meat inside had so much flavor
This dish was amazing; beautifully presented and absolutely delicious
Everything in the dish worked; the pasta was al dente the lobster was rich and tender and the sauce was delicious
Their food is always great the chicken can be a little dry sometimes which is why I always get the grilled fish tacos with a side order of hot shrimp
I had the Chicken Cesar Focaccia which was a little dry and not really as tasty as what I'm accustomed to at Zipps
Here's the bottom line after three visits the food is pretty amazing and the service is horrible
I am not gonna lie although I do remember that the sushi was good however the waiter we had was cute and made my experience so much better
So with that said the sushi was good the beer was cold and the company I was with was great
had a fish burger and sweet potato fries that both arrived cold a waiter who vanished constantly but good drinks
Again absentee server cold/uncooked food and again I felt sick for a few days
My coworkers ordered the Chicken Salad and enjoyed it as well- though the lettuce looked a little yellow to me- I like mixed greens usually
Both my wife and I like the cold appetizer salad-like dishes
Off and on I've had a dishwasher soap like residue flavor issue with their glassware especially when they first opened
The service was VERY friendly the food was great and it was an overall good experience
People were friendly and chatting with those around then the food was tasty and came out quick and it was the perfect spot to stop along the Apache Trail
The food/drinks did not blow me away so I have not been back there since but I would be willing to give this place another shot especially since they just put up a new shade-providing gazebo on the patio something they desperately needed
What I want to know is this Is there a good all-you-can-eat sushi place anywhere in Phoenix or the surrounding burbs
I should have listened to my friend who warned me not to go - apparently the last time she went all of their food came out cold and she wasn't wrong with that warning
However given our terrible experience and watching the table behind us send their food back because it was cold apparently most of the food comes from another restuarant next door and they have to go fetch it I would not return to narcisse again free champagne or not
I remember thinking it was good before but I think it's just cause I was not so widely exposed to sushi and plus the ambience - being on Mill with friends during college and the beginning of a night out - was what made it fun
The egg rolls and crab puffs are pretty tasty but my favorite appetizer is the egg drop soup
Your meal will start with and amazing dish that is not popcorn or cornuts but some magical in between
As for my main dish I had one that was tofu with vegetables and rice Lomo Saltado Vegetariano IT had some nice flavors and texture it came with a pyramid of rice
It's a totally edible and as hot as you want it thai which if you're a whiteboy like me you know it's occasionally hard to get people to give you actually hot food
Sure the food is good but out of my last 20 take out orders they got it right maybe once
The food is pretty good the fries are fried in LARD which may sound disgusting but is 'Effing delish
Luckily the food is so good it eclipses occasional sub-par service
I recommend the Diavola pizza with anti-pasta to start
All of the dishes came with unique and flavorful dipping sauces and the salad that came with the egg rolls was a perfect mix of lemon grass carrots and a few other julienned vegetables
It was fun to cook our own beef on a hot rock too
I gave it a three-star rating because the fish and shrimp was very tasty but the watered-down salsa was not my favorite
I used to work here in the late 80's and the kitchen was so filthy that I swore I would never eat there again food was good back then - I can tell you stories
I don't know if the kitchen is clean one would hope but the food quality is definitely poor
First the food came out piping hot I mean steaming and hot to the touch
On my next visit I'd like to try the Kobe beef hot dog
Joe's pizza looked good 2 guests were enjoying it and another table was eating cheesesteaks so we went to Philly Sandwich and wrote that place off as a huge waste of time
Really no complaints about the food but the food is not all there is to a good rating
Food was pretty good and portions were just right
I got the chicken tacos hardshell of course and they were very good - shell had good flavor chicken was grilled not pulled and the blend of ingredients was just right
It is sort of weird biting into this rather cold pita and warm piece of chicken
Enjoyed the charbroiled chicken teriyaki mini plate
Nice Char flavor on the chicken although I found the sauce rather sweet for my taste
I'd give the chicken teriyaki a 3 out of 5 due to meat quality and skin still on but the potato mac salad gets a 4
The food is mediocre but satisfying and flavorful
The egg rolls are also satisfyingly yummynothing special but good
I can't review the food because we just had a couple of drinks but the bartender was very nice and the space is amazing
I've waited tables and I know you hold food so people have time to talk and get appetizers
wonderful concept wonderful service and exquisite food
Food  The spanakopita I had was unexpectedly tasty
In conclusion great food but I definitely recommend ordering a second helping of injera right off the bat if you are ordering a platter for two or more people
They have rosemary ciabatta rolls which are insanely good when heated up
But is this even possible when the food is so tempting and the chicken tastes sooooo good
The food quality has gone steadily down hill the past 8 years
The good was delicious especially the Mexican pizza
In the early 2000s it moved to the current spot and immediately the meat used in all the dishes got horrible like they started using low quality institutional stuff to save money
It was worth it if we just intended to have the Mexican pizza which used to be only $4
Not impressed and I will not be returning if the beer and food were amazing I might come back even if the service sucked but if all three of these important factors are not up to par I will spend my money else where
They serve the traditional baseball stadium food like hot dogs french fries and popcorn
I like trying more city/team-specific concessions when visiting a new stadium and there is a good number of them at Chase Field local chains like Macayo's and Streets of New York pizza
Still the value menu here makes Double Headers a good option if you are a stadium regular or are looking to get some food without having to spend too much money
I actually wish I could roll my body in it it was THAT good
These 4 stars are based on the tasty food at Scott's
The food is pretty good too I liked the linguini
I would recommend this to someone who is looking for happy hour and might have a friend that doesn't want or like sushi
It is an expensive restaurant and I do not like that they charge a high corking fee for alcohol but the food impressed me and it had a nice romantic feel
Overall though it was a great meal and very affordable considering all the food we enjoyed
my comment to my dinner mates was that it was so rich and creamy and sweet and delicious it should be a dessert
I have been looking for great not just good Chinese food in the area for about 2 months now and thanks to my loyal Yelp reviewers and their photos of the food served I took their advice and found a treasure
In spite of the misgivings of the slow service missed food ingredient and dirty tasting hot tea I would still go back
The flavor temperature and preparation of the food was simply fantastic
My wife and I both enjoyed our lunch dishes and would go back and try other menu items without hesitation
Unfortunately there was no room for dessert but they all sounded amazing
I tell the sushi chef to just bring whatever he recommends
i brought the pizza home to my dad and showed him the goods we scored; he was proud of me i mean this is the most coveted pizza in the US people the big O put the gold coating on it he proceeded to eat the pizza in the morning for breakfast warmed up in the oven of course
The food isn't the most filling but it is DELICIOUS
Everytime I think of Postinos Arcade I'll always remember the fun conversation we had with that stranger and the good food
Portion smallQuality cheap fishTaste too fishy I'm surprise that many sushi restaurants are trying to make profit by cutting corner
Making a good sushi is not all that too difficult
Including the rice vinegar soy sauce mayo etc bottom line is that there is no secret on making good sushi
The Rice is not properly marinated The seaweed was very chewy and they are not using fresh fish - or at least get a good ones
I know its the desert but you can still get a good fish
the food from kitchen is actually not bad tempura tonkatsu udonoverall if you are looking for good sushi this isn't the place
It is always moist tender and flavorful especially on an Onion roll and a couple slices of Provo
These rolls would be good if they were not covered in some sort buttery greasy glaze thank you for contributing the obesity epidemic in America
The meat is moist and juicy with a light and non-fishy flavor and the batter/breading layer is fried crisp
Its just like a Federicos Filibertos etc but inside a gas station and the quality is for the most part the same except last time I went today my California burrito had a lot of fatty/non meat pieces in place of the carne asada which wasn't what I wanted
This place wins the trifecta of sushiIt's good
This place has very healthy and tasty fresh food
They have a wonderful Sea Bass with an incredibly tasty olive and walnut sauce drizzled over it -- so delish and the Garlic Smashed Potatoes OMG even my 13 year old picky as picky about food in general son ate these like they were going out of style no questions ask
But don't walk away without having had dessert -- just buck up and find room for it because they have this brownie concoction with coconut that is just sick I mean sick in a good way of course and it is covered with chocolate and caramel sauces topped with vanilla ice cream
You know they have a Tommy's in Maui too we ate there while on vacation a few times because it's so good and because it's much cheaper than hotel food and come on way better in taste
Excellent seafood platter as a starter
I was too full to sample the gorgeous pie but did partake of a light and tasty frozen lemon meringue strawberry dessert
The meat was very flavorful and the cheese was gooey and yummy
But please don't let me forget to mention dessert aka creamy heavenly goodness that is the peanut butter and jelly pastry
I have to say I'm rather disappointed after my half hour + trek to Chandler only to be served cold Chinese food in a cavernous and empty retail location
I would recommend Peter Piper Pizza over this place any day of the week
I've ordered out and dined in several times and their food is delicious
The price is not bad but the food is good
My favorite dish is actually the Tofu appetizer prepared very nicely with an excellent dipping sauce
I think the retail wine selection is less but the food choices are slightly expanded and the quality is wonderful
I'm not from the west coast so to have moderately good fast food Mexican food is a plus for me
She seemed to have a good grasp on the menu as we had a few questions about what dish to get
My mom said the entree was delicious and not greasy unlike other meat loafs she had tasted
Windsor is a fun lively bar/restaurant with a great vibe and good food all at a reasonable price
The food was delicious and the staff was wonderful
However the pizza was delicious and I hated to share it with my friends
I'm usually like meat but went with the margherita pizza last night and I can say I'm impressed
With great atmosphere and good food I'll definitely go back
I have now visited a few times and have enjoyed the Chicken Panang Curry Tom Kha Soup and Drunken Noodles with Tofu
Their ingredients are fresh the vegetables still have some bite to them the chicken was tender and the tofu was delicious
The plating was well done and the dishes are fresh hot colorful flavorful and haven't disappointed me
This dish was both visually appealing and absolutely delicious I've said this about several of the night's items with good reason it was perfectly prepared tender enough to cut with a fork with just the right amount of salty smokiness which went well when paired with the accompanying apricot sake sauce
Food For starters we had the soup which had a good consistency but lacking
The crispy whitefish over dirty rice was tasty but lacking a nice sauce to help the overall dry consistency of the dish
The place does extremely well because the food is absolutely AMAZING
Despite the waits we had to have to get seated and to finally get our food and then the wait for dessert I still managed to embarass myself with the amount of amazing tasting food I devoured
Much more atmosphere inside than you would expect from seeing it from the street the food is also high-quality and authentic and the owners are friendly and service-oriented
The best thing about this establishment is the $3 draft/$3 appetizer happy hours but that is sadly eclipsed by the poor service ambiance and quality of food
My wife loves the ham steak sandwich and the kids like the choice of hamburgers hot dogs or chicken fingers
I would recommend finding a little whole in the wall pho place in which the employees speak little-to-no English and trying their food
Food was good but service was sadly lacking
Outstanding dishes included ahi-tuna so good my husband refused to share ANY with me affectively nullifying our marriage
But food/service/ambience/creativity this fantastic is worth every mile
I really enjoyed our meal from start to finish and I will definitely go back again when in the mood for great Greek food
My wife had a wrap which she said was good my buddy said his pizza was alright
So for someone to suggest there was good pizza in Arizona I had to see it to believe it
I wouldn't compare it to Gino's East but overall it was a pretty good healthy pizza
The sushi is dirty cheap and good enough for the price
There are too many places in the east valley for good sushi to have to come here and beg to get your food
First they have a more interesting selection of fish than I have seen at most Valley stores and the prices seem to be quite good
I will pay for good quality pizza so the price was in line for the quality of the food
For dinner the man got the Linguini with Fresh Clams and I got the Chicken Parmigiana upon the recommendation of the bartender
We use to visit this Pub 10 years ago because they had a nice English waitress and excellent fish and chips for the price
But that has not deterred me from the amazing food
And finally why did they serve the light delicious homemade peanut butter for the s'mores in an ugly wet dog food-looking smear
It's the same feeling as returning home to food and an experience that I KNOW is going to be amazing and satisfying
The food is authentic as I already knew but again confirmed by my visiting friends from Japan and the quality very fresh
The following is a list of our favorites- miso soup- no explanation necessary - spicy tuna roll- catepillar roll- ADORABLE looking and everyone whose had it swears it's delicious
We tried the sesame roll for the first time yesterday and it was surprising creative and delicious
Today I had a #4shredded beef taco and 2 cheese enchiladas and it was very tasty but I'm not crazy about the sonoran enchiladas at all
Chicken Plain Hot n' Spicy BBQ or Teriyaki or Beef Little Once 1/5lb Big One 13/lb or Great Big One 1/2lb
Yes the decor is very tacky and there was a filthy fishtank behind me that looked like it needed a good cleaning
It has a pretty typically long menu - I narrowed in on the chicken satay and it was pretty good with a nice dipping sauce
The food is utterly mediocre I suppose what does one expect from a *factory* and personally I find the portions an affront to good taste
The outside might scare some away and the inside is outdated but the food is good
The staff is GREAT and the prices are right where they should be for good chinese food
I also ordered a Beef and sausage Combo with hot peppers and provolone
The plain beef sandwich was such a pleasant surprise the bread was fresh and soft the meat was juicy flavorful and plentiful
The Combo beef and sausage with cheese and hot peppers was also fantastic
We had 9 dishes including 3 appetizer 3 entree and 3 small deserts
The pork in the buns was the most ormal dish but terribly good
Swanky Vibe W/ Fantastic MusicConsistantly Good FoodGreat Friendly Service & A Price Tag That Won't Bankrupt you
Just came back from this amazing little cafu00e9; went there for lunch with my co-worker who enjoys food as much as I do
The beef was boring and flavorless but quality meat
I think my fellow Oreganymphos would agree; this is single handedly one of the greatest places on earth to gorge yourself with some of the most delicious pizza pastas and desserts AZ has to offer
If you wanna take my word for it dont even look at the menu and order my usual orgasmic orderAppetizer CalimariDinner Big Rig Pasta w/ Chicken Dessert White Chocolate Chip Macadamian Nut PazookieFYI Whenever your taste buds feel like going on a culinary roadtrip make sure you hit up any of the various Oregano's locations located around the state; my personal favs are the Flagstaff and Tucson locations
Overall it was a fantastic meal with great service and very good food
If you want a pretty atmosphere or a Dining Experience go elsewhere but if you want Good Food you have found the right place
I haven't tried all of the menu but if what I did have was representative their food is excellent
The food was surely delicious and prompt you to comeback for more
Whether you enjoy having an entree for example the Walnut Shrimp or the Beef and Broccoli; or you are looking for an entire meal of appetizers this is your place
She wasn't as fast as Apolo Anton Ohno but no one passed out from hunger before the food arrived and she was working a fairly good area
The Monday before last they were out of the pork but were good enough to substitute for another meat
Great location good beer and liquor selections prices on the higher side mixed service lame food
Bottom line stop in for a beer if you're in the area but look elsewhere for deals and good food
Aside from the good food the service staff is wonderful
While it's near impossible to get the texture of chicken in a vegetarian option and this was no exception the flavor was spot-on
The sushi didn't stand out on this visit either making me wonder if the high prices were worth it
This is always my favorite dish to order and with it was a chicken stuffed sopapilla with green chile sauce which I had never heard of but sounded interesting and that was also very good
The amount of food allowed me to take home a good portion of it for an extra meal
The prices are great and the amount of food you get is good
Ya know just when I thought I couldn't fit one more restaurant into my casual Mexican food rotation Rubio's comes along with its damn delicious tacos and its friendly employees and its integration of Coke Zero in its fountain drink machine and the next thing you know I'm up to FOUR very viable options for my frequent inexpensive taco/burrito cravings
El Pollo Loco's grilled chicken is phenomenal as are their salsas and Sonora Mesquite Grill has the most amazing Carne Asada I've ever had the pleasure of putting in my mouth so I'm covered there also
Grilled chicken not El Pollo Loco quality but it's fair avocado and roasted veggies over lettuce with a tangy balsamic dressing
For the whole thing none of that without dressing avocado chicken or anything that tastes good bull I'm looking at you Subway
Basically it was burnt flavorless chicken on a stick
You can't get this anywhere else and the mix of flavors and textures in this pasta dish are unbelievable in your mouth
A good little Italian restaurant while it may not make you feel all warm inside while their indoor center fountain splashes you throughout your meal they have good foods so I'll be back
The chicken on the sandwich was very good as well as the sauce and the bun
The eggless rolls were good too and I really liked the sweet sauce they came with
The food is good but I will say it would be nice to have staff that are bit more oriented towards customer service
None of the meat had that much flavor or juiciness that you come to expect from barbeque
The rest of the menu varies from omelets to brizzas breakfast pizzas to good ol pigs in a blanket
The cinnamon roll was also tasty nice and fresh but not too cinnamony
The food is always very good but they get a three stars at this location
I have done a lot of catering orders over the last eight years and this has been the worst as far as packaging maintaining quality of food and keeping food in containers that keep food at temperature
He also led us towards the unique and tasty yukon gold pizza
Good beer good pizza good service - just have to be a little faster getting them out especially since it was not busy at all
I do agree the area does not look very nice i think its due to some stores that closed just across this hotel but there is alot of food chains to eat out there is even a sports bar across the street never saw anything wrong with this areabut i think at one point in its past it was the place to be at and stay i think this area has been somewhat forgotten in some way not sure how
I got the cheese enchilada with red sauce and shredded beef tacos both were very good
My bf had the same problem of cold bland food
The portions are gigantic but if the foods not very good it's hard to make a dent in your plate
Good news is nothing takes the bad taste out like the corned beef appetizer at NOCA
I also got the turkey meatloaf that while a little dry had a wonderful flavor and consistency
They also had a few rolls and appetizers and pizzas to choose from that were half off
where there is some damn fresh sushi to be had nearly everywhere so I was pretty reluctant to go in but our hotel was nearby and we ended up going to the Kierland shopping center all the time
My Arizona roll okay so I go for fun party rolls occasionally was bland and devoid of any spicyness or flavor
If you don't have a sense of smell this might be a good sushi place for you
Also worth traveling for is the General Chicken w/ Sweet and Chili Sauce this has just the right about of sweet and spice with nice well cooked perfectly prepared chicken stuffed in one of those awesome Asian take out food boxes
In fact all of the chicken dishes are pretty good that goes for the fried rice too ESPECIALLY the pork fried rice which I would shower in if I could
I've tried most of the appetizers as well and my favorites are the Chili Sauce Dumplings and the spring rolls
Also notable the Lo Mein the totally affordable and always delicious Family Dinner Pack in which you get an obscene amount of food for 20 bucks the adorable and prompt staff the way they give you large orders in boxes so it's easier to carry the seeded Chili sauce they provide on all the tables the consistency of it and also the twice cooked pork
Mark and I ordered the squid salad fresh and not too salty the Philly roll standard but good and the Volcano roll--delicious flashing light and all
I have been to other Sushi lounges in this area and most of the places provides fish that had been sitting in the fridge forever at least they smell like it The quality of food in Stingray was not bad as they were fresh enough
For dinner we split the 4 cheese pizza which was also very good
It's probably a little more than most tiny breakfasts stops but knowing the food served was chosen from natural food markets the price was spot on for the quality of food
We enjoyed the food the most disturbing part was when two men in plan cloths walked in with OPEN AND CARRY guns
You''ll find them very good and very generous - but I would recommend the pizza over the pasta
Bottom line excellent food wonderful service and worth the parking challenge
I'd suggest knowing to only have 1 round of sushi so you get the good service
You've changed a lot since then dropping the Crystal Palace half of your moniker but your food is still as good as it always was
I enjoyed the sheer mass of selection of Korean food
Aside from the amazing food the ambiance is just awesome
On the recommendation of some other yelpers I ordered the shrimp diabolitos I think that is how it is spelled and it was amazing and as spicy as expected warning- I love super spicy food and this was definitely on the higher end of spicy- heat akin to the level of the slow burn of an indian vindaloo
What it lacks in decor it more than makes up for with the quality and taste of its food
Lunch or dinner the food will be worth the trip
it wasn't until i was driving by for the zillionth time on my way home from work and needing to pick up a surprise dessert that i stopped into this wonderful little shop
My boyfriend had the filet kabob and it was very good but not as good as the chicken
The food was still as good but my Saturday special had about 1/2 of the chicken than it normally does
Anyway as a Kingstonian I am used to going to a beach area where they cook up the best escovitch fish corned with country pepper habanero and onions and dripping with grease but just finger licking good
Anyway I have other jamaican friends who have enjoyed other dishes here so I have not given up yet and plan to return and sample a few other dishes
Each main course was delicious from the beef ribs my little brother's kid's meal to my catfish po'boy
starts up this italian food gig as a hobby and it takes off like nathans hotdogs
the food is decent and sure is good enough for me
I would classify their hot wings as one of  my favorite foods ever and I am always very happy whilst eating their creations
The Vig is a great spot for lunch dinner or late-night for some damn decent food served up relatively quickly and with a good variety of dishes to boot
I had the Love Me Tenderloin which was this lovely beef dish served with these fantastic marinated onions & mushrooms and this wonderful cheese-y potato dish of happiness
My compatriots had the salmon dish which was cooked spot on and served with an awesome corn-mash chorizo side and the potato pancake which was equally good
The Pad Thai is something that I was looking to try as well and it appears that the recipe is being fine-tuned to be just as good as the dish I had or better
-Portions  We had the garlic cheese bread awesome and HUGE - almost too huge though for an appetizer to the point where it filled me up too much and i could barely finish my pizza
The pizza as well was HUGEEE we got the chicago style - DO NOT get appetizers if you are getting a chicago style because you WILL NOT finish it or even come close be happy with pizza for the next week
All in all - if my guy wanted to go back for the good pizza i'd be ok with it but its definitely not a place i'd drag my friends to on a good thursday night
The burger patty was thick and quality beef the grilled Maui onions superb and the special sauce was better than I was expecting
The sound was fantastic and the screen high quality- I like the option of the back round tables in case you had a group of friends or food you wanted to munch on while watching the flick
The food was good but our server was not so great
Her English muffin was perfectly toasted and her dessert of English muffin jelly and sausage was amazing
The food is always tasty and made in front of you with a relatively short wait
Everything I had was delicious but the best part was that it was so many delicious flavors all put into a dish making it beyond delicious
LOTS of meat I am glad there was a good proportion of rice and meat
The cheese was piled on top of it and I am not sure if it would have matter if there was cheese or not for me because I think the rice chicken and sausage with the seasoning and sauce is good enough for me
I love cajun food and this is good cajun food
We also got a Tomato Ragout and Honey Ginger sauce those came with the appetizers Fried Sausage Ravioli and Coconut Chicken Tenders
We couldn't decide on an entree everything looked too good Mac n Cheese Loaded w Chicken & Bacon
I've eaten here once and yes the food was really really good but I gotta be honest I come here to drink beer
We started with the ceviche which was a mix of shrimp and fish with avocado and lime juice and the guacamole which was a little bit too smooth for my taste yes I like it a little chunky but quite good
I will say that the meat was delicious but so juicy that it was almost impossible to hold the b urger together
The swordfish was actually better than my steak and my steak was excellent
We were both impressed with the service and the food
There were two things that i cared for one particular sushi that seemed deep fried with a delicious sauce and the Mongolian BBQ although my meat was over cooked today
He doesn't drink but for some reason he eats nothing but excellent hang-over food
I've only been here once and both my husband and I were surprised at how good the food happened to be
I feel a small face-lift and better quality meats and produce would put this grocery on another level
I'm not sure what the menu name is but look for the pasta dish with fennel bitter greens acid savory artichokes briny olives - it was 5 taste delicious
The chefs put together dishes using techniques that allowed each ingredient to shine on it's own and at the same work harmoniously with others to make up really good dishes
Just the food isn't what I would ever call good and personally I wouldn't go back there unless I were starving and needed food NOW
I was there for four hours and spent $3 + a nice tip for our attentive bartender for 3 tasty brews and food
My partner was recommended the fish tacos by our waitress - she went for the ones with sea bass - she said they were awesome
The chicken was overcooked and the bed of rice it came served over was saturated in Teryakie sauce that was rather tasty but became snail killing salty after 3 bites
She also caught a snag of hot pepper on her first bite that made her scared the dish was spicy
I hate to be the barrier of bad news but duncan heinz out of the box cake mix tastes like as good as their devils food as does the frosting from the jar
Offering mostly sandwiches salads and chicken plates it's a good choice for someone looking for something quick and fresh
Very good food and friendly staff; prompt service
Other than the fish oil it was fried in this was a good deal
I enjoyed their home made pasta with sausage- the red sauce and peppers were a nice touch and the dish was perfectly spiced
Matt had their scotch beef and it was tender and perfectly cooked- he described it at succulent with a flavorful burgundy sauce
My husband powered down his one and only plate my mother-in-law politely ate all her food but enjoyed little and I sat back and enjoyed my Thai Iced Tea and waited for it all to be over
This one was just perfectly flavored the cheese was melted and the chicken was delicious
So I am adding another fast food chain to my reviews but for good reason
They do an excellent job offering food at reasonable prices often times with a nice discount promo and I can leave with a 6 inch sub bag of chips and large soda for under $6
I'm torn with this place because i love it so much but dislike it for certain things so I'm going to stay positive because the things i don't like can be a personal thing about the music they allow in there it has a HELL a lot of beers it has a grand selection of wine it has no food but who need food when you've eatn before going to the LOST LEAF the music is a hit and miss some days a very kool unique style and other days not good and i think this is why i sometimes have a problem with the music is because with all the great local musicians out in phoenix it should be easier to play this place but it isn't
In the end the reason they are getting 2 stars instead of 1 is that the food was actually pretty good
The fish tacos were very tasty the salsa was good and fresh and I was impressed with the $2 happy hour mini caesar salad that was served on a large plate and bigger than some lunch portion salads at other restaurants
I've been to Sushi Q many times when I was attending DeVry University Tried almost every roll available at the time and they were all pretty good and decent sized for the price
Appetizer + 2 entrees + dessert = $27
We've also tried the Garlic Chicken yummy would definately order again   Crispy Beef good but too much batter for my tastes prob wouldn't order again  Cashew Pork very tasty my husband really enjoyed this dish  We've also tried the mongolian beef which is a bit spicy and the chicken fried rice which was super good though I think it's probably difficult to mess up fried rice
I went with the Chicken Torino and it was about worthy of one star
Food was great - anyone who has ever eaten GOOD MEXICAN food will know this place is where its at
I have recommended Salsa B to many Sun City Residents - most are picky food critics all LOVED Salsa B - they felt the food was good prices GREAT  some thought the prices should be raised all will be going back - all will pass the word to their friends and family - all wish these Great New Entrepreneurs  the BEST OF LUCK w/this One of a Kind Mexican Food Restaurant --- Chili R's and Beef Taco's ARE  TO DIE FOR - I am SOOOOO Hooked
FINALLY some good Chinese delivery food in AZ
I've had the chance to try several dishes at Rice Paper with mixed results but overall this place has solid food and is an overall good experience
If you are any type of foodie or just want a really good meal with great service this is the place to go
It had a great tangy glaze and the beets were tri-colored which made it also a pretty dish it came with fetta and nuts that we had on the side a wonderful way to start the meal for sure
Both were amazing dishes and I have not had fish cooked that well in a really long time it melted in my mouth and had a wonderful fresh flavor
If I would not have been on a cleanse I would have gotten dessert the coconut cake looked absolutely amazing I was salivating when they brought one out to the person next to us and I heard that they are known for their fig-pecan pie
While Urban Grocery does offer a wide range of products fresh meat dairy produce dry goods one could never possibly do all of their grocery shopping here
As soon as I saw the chunky dark chocolate floor mirror I knew the food would be good I went by myself for lunch one weekday afternoon and although the restaurant was fairly empty it felt like it was alive
I ordered a pizza looking concoction with lamb slices and feta cheese and arugula I believe on top - it was very good
Food is nothing to write home about; nothing I had really stands out and it didn't seem the staff had any convincing recommendations
To top my meal off I had a dry flaky not-so-tasty dessert that looked like an afterthought
Glad we did very tasty food good portions and really good flavor
The right crowd was in the restaurant and knew the food had to be good and we weren't wrong
After all of the glowing reviews I read about this place I figured it would be the end all to good veggie/vegan food here in the valley
The food and selection was tasty but I've had better in San Diego
And I do agree with others that it is a bit pricey but some of the dishes were worth it
Anyways the next day the food was better from my fridge I just wasn't expecting a mouth full of spicy hot food
Food-mehBeer-goodAtmosphere and music-awesomeI will go back to Rosie's for the music and beer but not the food
I guess we keep hoping for a good experience Truthfully the food is good and the patio is a great place to go hang out and enjoy a Sunday afternoon
They always have a nice selection of cold seafood pot stickers & sushi bagels & muffins fruit omelets and waffles and of course a nice selection of desserts
It's good and you'll leave full but the final impression will be in the view not in the food
They have good food in the bar to snack on a gated entry pool for guests privacy and walking paths surrounding the resort
While Goldie's does have an extensive menu I would recommend sticking to the classics such as the Monaco Foccacia Golden Wings Bleu Cheese Chips and Chicken Tenders
All around great bar food and a good place to watch a game with all of the televisions
Small family owned and operated with very nice people and excellent food
On Friday's they usually have fresh lobster and fish their lobster enchiladas are excellent
Our teriyaki chicken is delicious and the turkey salad as well
I could taste more oil than meat which wasn't good
The food was really good- we had the macaroni & cheese bites bite sized triangles not too greasy pretzel sticks soft & fresh with 3 dipping sauces & sliders really flavorful
The servers here are super friendly and are great at recommending items from the menu and their likes and dislikes about a particular dish
I have eaten at this restaurant a few times and the food has been consistently fresh and excellent in taste and presentation
The best fried chicken I have ever had and the waffles are insanely delicious
The food and ambiance certainly deserve 5 stars and while this place is known for being spendy I ordered a tasty bone-in filet small one and it was priced a little better than other steakhouses
The Chicken Satay was particularly good with tender and juicy chicken that had a very nice yellow curry aroma and flavor
The other appetizer was Little Mermaid which is shrimp and bacon wrapped in spring roll skin
I have been there on other occasions and the food was good and so was the service
The food at Scramble however is worth mentioning
When the food is quality I won't hold above average drink prices against Scramble
Stax is a great casual burger joint with a good variety of meat choices and side options
but these little gourmet packets of goodness are still 3 oz of meat
The guy next to me got the Southwest burger and he said he's gotten that before as well as the fish and chips and beer battered chicken strips and everything has been wonderful
The lake is stocked with trout during the cold months but the fishing permit for them is kinda pricey you can get it at local sporting stores like Dick's
I enjoyed the flank steak I got for lunch except it was a very small portion and flank steak just isn't the best cut of meat to do very much with
Good deals for cheap food - recently they had a $2 breakfast special consisting of two egg & cheese burritos with hashbrowns
Considering that potatoes are like the cheapest thing on the planet and french fries are possibly one of the most delicious food groups to ever exist this should be standard practice
The food was good but not enough to make me go back with the slow kitchen service and no refills of drinks
Moving on to dessert we tasted a bit of everything and the cheesecake was tasty
Overall a great place to watch the game and enjoy some good bar food
World Market has a huge variety of products from food to wine to toys to kitchen gear to furniture - it's all here in one wonderful magical store
Everyone was so gracious and nice about it - and although our food was out lightning fast it didn't miss anything in quality
FYI - The all you can eat sushi is about $24 per person - definitely a good price for sushi
It was amazing - probably my 2nd favorite sushi place in AZ
The food is good the patio and new bar are are set-up well
My friend recommended this place when she was visiting me in Phoenix because she heard about this place on food channel
The place is very small it reminds me of a very casual good home-cooking restaurant - not fancy but just good food
Their pesto chicken pasta was really good
The food was tasty and the waitress was great
He made a delicious uramaki rice on the outside roll with salmon I think wasabe the real stuff and mayonnaise
On the other side the burgers were average to below average the buns were good though but better than a fast food joint
Supplement the grocery goods with fresh salads olives and meats from the deli counter and you'll have the sort of kitchen that guests never ever want to leave
Good food but horrible stuffy and pretentious atmosphere
There is such an amazing selection of services and foods that one must visit to fully experience this luxury
had the coconut chicken tenders and the beef and chicken soft tacos which were all delicious
My husband loves New Mexican food and this place was amazing
I like the place to look nice on the outside nice decor on the inside greeted promptly upon entering service to be attentive and the food to be delicious
I have to say the food was good not great but good
The service was also good; our waitress wasn't terribly friendly but the food came quickly and she kept the mimosas coming
food is good atmosphere is cool and the music selection was great I heard two songs from Radiohead
A minute after food was delivered discovered no salt or pepper on table but good luck getting someone's attention so we did without
In fairness in terms of cost it's no worse than Mastros Ocean or any other high end restaurant and certainly less expensive than Bourbon Steak but the setting is much more intimate the service much better and the food every bit as good if not better than those other must do places
Good food professional service you will be able hear your dinner companions and you will be well taken care of
I normally stay away from themed restaurants but Texas Roadhouse has a really cozy atmosphere and good food
Our drinks and food were very good and ended up being a fun night
5-star good IMO egg rolls 4 stars and hummus 2
If you like thin-crust traditional Italian style pizzas that are simple and delicious more about the mix of flavors and textures then Grimaldi's is your place
Keep an open mind expect good traditional thin-crust simple Italian pizza and you'll be all good
I was told there was 19 different types of meat options and I think i tried 15 an amazing accomplishment in my book
Food was good the steak nachos were awesome and the burger good
I enjoyed the Spicy Chicken Rigatoni and the Cheesy Bread Florentine while the others had Baked Rigatoni; there were no complaints and plenty in our to-go boxes
Hot pot  oriental version of fondue is more for social gathering than good food
A group friend invited me for hot pot I told them about my prior experience at Asian Seafood; outdated seafood  soak in Luke warm water for several hours It must have billion and Billions of bacteria
but they convince me hot pot use fresh seafood -not outdated seafood Well I won't turn down a FREE meal - all expanse paid meal don't come that often
I will have to admit seafood seem fresh uncooked; hot pot only not the regular steam table I will admit I had a FUN time with my friends
Its sushi so its going to be a bit pricey but WELL worth it
There are various rolls which are all delicious and like another reviewer mentioned each unique in their own way
While I wouldn't say the Italian food is all that authentic it's certainly delicious
The service was awful but the manager made up for it by bringing our entire table free shots and enormous plates of dessert
The shots were basically flavored water but the desserts were moist rich brownies with lots of ice cream
What's odd is that we got free shots again at 2 separate tables from different waiters and free dessert
I know it's a chain and yes it is in a mall but trust me when I say their chicken is delicious
I recommend the double meat because it's only a dollar more
Whether it is fish pork or steak - the tacos are so so good
The foodI am addicted to the super-delicious corn & poblano chili chowder soup
Other recommended dishesAppetizers  tres queso quesadillo crab cakesSoups  the chili stewEntrees  the tilapia dish the pork chop dish the chorizo mac & cheese the burgersDesserts  lime tart tastes like lemon drop candy bread pudding apple cobblerAll of the food is prepared fresh including the desserts
The candied walnuts were shockingly good on pizza and I highly recommend trying it with any combination
I'm a huge foodie and recommend many establishments to my clients and this one is definately off the list
I don't care how good your food is but if the service is bad I will never return
For an entree I ordered the chicken and it was very tasty and a decent portion size
I sampled a few of the other dishes my party ordered and everything was very good
The pasta dishes were especially good but the portion size of the dishes were tiny
For dessert we shared the brownie and it was excellent
Though the food is good they charge a bit too much for what you get
I can't say that I would rush back to this place but the service is friendly and the drinks and food are good
If you're in the mood I recommend strolling around Barnes and Noble with your tea
He came by several times to check on us did an excellent job at stating on top of our food and drinks
I was pleasantly surprised with how good the food is at Manuel's
More importantly though once you're inside Kabuki the service is friendly and helpful and the food is consistently good
Ok I know I'm rather late to try the deliciousness that is NOCA that is for an avowed foodie who lives works breathes in Phoenix
Even when it first opened it jumped headfirst into foodie forums and my general opinion is that if it's too good to be true it ain't true
When the worst thing I can say about any of the foods is delicious then
I don't know how they infused bacon into the meatloaf but there was a delicious taste of bacon with every single bite
As for value and quality I don't feel that the food meets the high expectation generated by the price as most seem to agree with
The few times I have gone I wasn't that impressed with the food and it's extremely loud in here every time I go
The pizza was a good mix of chicken chunks and ranch
The Greek salad pizza just didn't have any distinct flavors to enjoy
This is an SE Asian restaurant run by SE Asians who may not give a damn about being current with excessively unattainable contemporary American service expectations so lighten up and enjoy the good food
The meat provided were goodnot the choicest and comes in varieties such as soft tendon tripe flank and boiled beef
First the sushi rolls were very good on the small side but they were $3 so for that price they were amazing  potstickers were good too
I have to say my first venture into the amazing flavorbomb of Korean food was indeed an awesome one
The bulgogi had a lovely sweet flavor about it that highlighted the flvor of the beef wonderfully
My soup was amazingly hot & spicy with large chunks of beef and tofu
They laid out about 7 different side dishes each of them delicious
Plus tons of desserts and even ice cream plus the food is good
They have been very consistent with the quality of the food which is rare for Indian restaurants in the valley
I would of loved to have canceled mine since they couldn't nail the whole concept of put the cold meat balls in the microwave longer even on the second try
I ordered the primavera it sounded better than it tasted the meatballs might of been good  but they were so cold they didn't have a great deal of taste
Having frequented the resaurant multiple times I'm always impressed with the food quality in correlation to the price
50DOWNSIDESSmall portions by the time you order enough food it gets pricey could get really crowded if you're there at the wrong time just okay egg salad which is made entirely of eggs and not with lettuce like I was thinking the cute Italian breadsticks are flavorless have they not heard of garlic
The sushi is readymade as are the side salads including a deliciously tangy southwest pasta salad and are in a refrigerated grocery-style section along with Pom Kemper sodas and overpriced waters such as Ty Nant Blu and Voss
good food meat and cheese were nice and fresh they didn't skimp on the toppings
oh lord what a good place to get some yummy authentic indian food
The food was not only amazing it was an extraordinarily fun experience
Although a bit pricy the ambience food and experience is completely worth it
The maxim that good food takes time to make has been proven here but it was a minor setback and I will definitely return
I've never had that and I've had a LOT of pizza over the years   I'm a Chicago gal this pizza is just different and doesn't hold a candle to the good Chi-Town joints for 'za
We pretty much had a smorgasbord of as many tasty options as we could and shared or at least tried each others food
The only reason that I don't eat here daily is because I grew up on Greek food but when I don't feel like cooking Z's Greek can give me food almost as good as mine
It's not fancy but the gyro meat isn't greasy or over salted the tzatziki tastes darned good the salads are generous and the fries are always hot and fresh
I still swing by for some Chicken Katsu whenever I get the chance because it is tasty and delicious and katsu sauce is addictive
I imagine getting it in house would make it even crispier piping hot out of the oven but it holds up well if you do pickup the pizza
I haven't tried the deep dish pizza though I have heard it is very good - I like the thinness of the thin crust and I dont' feel as guilty eating it
great food-thai food as good as any I have tasted I travel and have eaten Thai all around the southwest
got my food back to the hotel tasted it couldn't stop eating well except I had to take a breather and had to type this
if you want an appetizer get the the chicken lettuce wraps shrimp and garlic-great spicy noodles w/chicken-unreal
finding hair in food and having the issue with the cold food more than twice is just not acceptable
I had the Green Chile Chicken sandwich and my friend had the Chicken Jack Not  Jill but the name was much more exciting than the flavor
The grilled chicken pasta is pretty good and I'm looking forward to trying the steak or the apricot glazed chicken on my next visit
The dishes are unique and wondefully flavorful
I definitely give it an enthusiastic recommendation and am certain you will love the food
which we did The food was of course awesome but I believe anything is probably amazing considering the state we were in that night
In addition another afternoon after leaving the pool my friend and I were starving and I volunteered to pick-up some food at good old Jack in the Box
Being the only person at the table who liked spicy foods I ordered the harissa couscous and was expecting a hot dish but it was served cold
The desserts were amazing and even though they look small they are perfectly portioned for a full belly
I went safe with a spicy tuna cut roll and it looked good but the consistency was like mush
Also the only thing that looked good in the sushi case was yellowtail and it had excellent consistency but lacked flavor
So food was good but business is deceptive
I had a grilled chicken sandwich tater totsrecommended by my friend and a lemon/berry drink
the food was incredibly hot fresh and delish and spicy
Fish calm me down and since I am kind of a high strung guy anything that can take me down a notch or two is a good thing
I had an AWESOME beef salad here the hubby had the shaken beef he was going to try the short ribs but they don't make them anymore and his was very good also I was gobbling his onions up  I have had the Pho before and I thought it was great but I have only had Pho a few times so I don't have a lot to compare it to still I really really enjoyed it very flavorful and very good flavor
I saw Caramelos meat and cheese sandwiched between 2 tortillas and crisp up on both sides on the menu and decided to stay and order a couple of asada ones hoping they were as good as the ones from  BK in Tucson
Not too good at describing what the food was like but there's the adventuresome part for ya
And now the pluses* The Actual Chicken Excellent
The seasonings were really tasty and the chicken was grilled just right - maintaining its juices and not drying out
Bought a Google Offer this past weekend $20 for $40 worth of food
Their family style dishes are also of good value but each dish serves 2-3 people
And the prices are decent except for the fact that the food is just not good
Now the food  the antipasto appetizer is way more than a starter
-BoyfriendWow I haven't had sushi this good since my last trip to NY-Boyfriend sisterWow did you know that you are amazing
-Everyoneokay so that last one was a stretchBill arrivesI snag billGIGANTIC SMILEDetailsAtmosphere Similar to Sapporo without the sometimes obnoxious Scottsdale sceneFood 5 stars Fresh and very very good
Had delicious seaweed salad and an amazing spicy salmon roll
I had been to Rico's once before when Yelp hosted a Christmas party there and the food was sooo tasty so I KNEW the food would be good
On paper everything looked great grass fed naturally raised beef and good ingredients
The three one star reviews seem pretty unforgiving but I have to tell you while waiting on tires from Discount Tire next door my son and I came over and he had a small chicken teriyaki bowl with rice that was very tasty
My mom said that she hated Indian food but then it came out that the last time she had had it was 20 years ago so we decided to give it a shot
The chicken was good but it wasn't as good as I have had it other places and it wasn't that spicy
Overall the place was good it just didn't measure up to other places I have tried BUT it did change my mom's opinion on Indian food which is awesome
I had the chicken and shrimp which was wonderful
We were so full and got so much more food than I had expected my entree included a soup appetizer of shrimp and a salad that was excellent
It was good but the fish was a bit overcooked
I have to say - the quality of the meat is amazing
For my entree I got the VooDoo chicken which was very good
I saw another table order the meatloaf and it looked so good
Even though it's dirt cheap the food selection and quality are on the same level as other $9-$10 lunch buffets
First off the fish tacos previously discussed were amazing some of the best I've had
Great prices excellent food and a nice patio area pull together for a great package that is going to be tough to beat
The meats weren't hot or fresh like at Miracle Mile so that's why I can't give it 4 or 5 stars
Having enjoyed Havana Cafe we were eager to try this more homespun version of Cuban food
But then again there's the food which is cheap and delicious
Support this guy and his wonderful Asian food
For food we ordered three items off the menu all were good but the surprising star in the food category was the home made chips
We loved the great food wonderful service and especially the piano music
The service is good and the food is Phogettable
Great quality organic whole food ingredients
I forced myself to eat lunch there one more time to confirm that the food is tasty enough to warrant this adjustment and it is
Cauliflower Soup with Currants Mint Queen Creek Olive Oil Shitake Mushrooms was delicious a welcoming dish that made you felt at home but occasional caught you off guard with a nice kick
I tried a small piece of the fish which was wonderful
The main concourse has a large variety of food selection from your typical game day staples to panda express macayo's mexican kitchen and cold stone creamery
I have to say that the wait was worth it but I'm sad that I haven't partaken of the food this whole time due to my tardiness
The food isn't bad and neither is the service but it's not worth what you pay for it
Now look it isn't pretty inside it's divey a weird fish tank and ventriloquist doll are kind of strangely displayed but look past that and see this place for what it is a local joint with real honest to goodness people serving you
Good drink great food great music great atmosphere great service
Their vegetable stew was very good with huge chunks of vegetables and a hearty sauce the peppered raspberry turkey is magic in your mouth the royal is a wonderful sandwich with roast beef mozzarella and garlic pepper and the venice violin with soppressata pepperoncini balsamic vinegar and dijon mustard on a baguette is practically inspired
The desserts are good too but not all house made we destroyed the baklava it's highly recommended
I think I'll stick to my local favorites for truly amazing pizza like Nello's and Four Peaks
I was impressed with the food presentation taste and the unique change from the common sashimi and other Japanese fare from other restaurants
Our starters were yellow tail shooters and a plate of white fish sorry I don't remember the name topped with a hot oil WOW to both starters
Ordered the Crispy Chicken Salad which also had hard boiled egg bacon and veggies and was very good
Not my first choice but good crowd pleaser with more decent food than most chains
Italian beef is a slow cooked roast beef that is thinly sliced then simmered in a tasty au jus
The nice thing about writing these Yelp reviews is I get to thinking about the delicious beef sandwiches and now I have to head back to Lobby's for another one
As for food I ordered the bruschetta and was impressed
The pizza wasn't quite as insanely delicious as it was the first time but I still really enjoyed it
Anyway they have pretty amazing food here
Suffice it to say that the food is pretty good here and I've never been unsatisfied
I'm not much of a foodie however I love to eat so when this place was recommended for a yummy and unique dinner it was a no brainer that this was where we'd go
The mushroom polenta dish was so good that I googled the recipe in attempt to replicate it once I got home
I'm not disappointed with Ray's Pizza I'm just not all that impressed either
I was looking for a burger place that wasn't fast food near my house one day & stumbled upon this tasty establishment
Recommendations The house sesame chicken the house lo mein the wonton soup and The Flaming PuPu Platter of Delight
The service and food is always amazing which it should be because it will cost you
The sushi is average at best but I come back because they have a good happy hour and the ambiance is way better than at your average Japanese restaurant
I wouldn't suggest coming here for sushi except during Happy Hour because their sushi isn't very good and so it's overpriced if you go during regular times
We also ordered the Honey Chicken and the Mongolian Beef which were both very good too
The pineapple and chicken were like 1000 years old and the bread was cold
The soup bowls are massive and delicious and I bring coworkers that probably never would have considered Vietnamese food and now also share my love of it
We had the buffet and it was very good with a good selection of foods
It makes me feel good to know that my chickens are getting a great quality feed and I do not have to spend a fortune to provide it for them
If you have chickens I would definitely recommend giving this co-op a try
and this one it had a good amount of yummy Italian meats
The anything-and-everything salad does have some good items included - craisins pecans egg grilled chicken and a good balsamic vinaigrette dressing
Come in for a sweet tea free peanuts and the excellent rolls
While the food will come in sample size portions the flavor is packing
My God this is the most delicious Mexican food ever
99and a Sweet TeaThe food was served fresh hot and placed well
The prices are reasonable and the food is good
It's seems as if they are scared to give you a good sized portion of noodles and meat
Overall give it a shot and order extra noodles and meatballs to get full
I have the Chopped Pizza Salad and sushi along with some tasty iced tea
The meat was wonderfully tender and flavorful
The food and service were all excellent
My dogs have had both the chicken and peanut butter flavors and devoured them
The wine was great and the pizzas were tasty
Delicious perfect mouthwatering decadent delightful wonderful amazing my thesaurus has run out pizza will keep me coming back over and over again as many times as humanly possible
Also included is a small egg roll which was darn good
Man the food was great I had the number 100 which was recommended by the nice waitress
The beans were great as well which is an important test if you want to know how good a Mexican food place is
The auto picks and portrait pick that MelonFishPhoto did for me blew my mind
I strongly recommend MelonFishPhoto to anyone for any photography need
The food while a limited selection is excellent
Postino's reputation in the Arcadia neighborhood brought me in and the good food and relaxed atmosphere has made me a believer
If you're a foodie like me I recommend coming here for lunch or Sunday Brunch when its more relaxed and not as crowded
Good food at least what we had other things looked good too and breakfast is served all day -- a huge plus
The food was delicious and did not disappoint--the chicken & dumplings had white gravy and the ham complimented the greens I ordered
Overall we had a pleasant time & definitely recommend CB when you're in the mood for comfort food in a family style restaurant
It is really awkward to have to choose to have someone at the table let their food get cold as they wait for their dining companions' food to come out
Food quality is a 4 service a 3  problem resolution time a 3 but the general manager's resolution I'd give a 5
If you're looking for a delicious and healthy alternative to fast food in the Tempe are I highly recommend this place
The quality of the fish is always good and fresh especially when you consider that Arizona is a landlocked state
She can't eat shell fish which eliminates a lot of the items on the menu but there's plenty of good options to pick from
They left everything cut in big chunks which was a little shocking at first but it covered the whole fish and was quite tasty
The fish itself tasted a little dry to me at first but as I got to the center I found that it was perfectly cooked and the salsa continued to enhance the flavor
Pleasantly surprised with the quality of food here
And the food while decent wasn't worth a 30 minutes wait
Marco Rolo - Kinda has an italian flavor to it but it is a really nice combo in a roll
Side note Although the PITA roll taste good it is a difficult roll to pick up with chopstix without it falling apart
Key West Martini - A good dessert drink
I love the graham cracker crumbs around the rimOther foodFried Pizza rolls - These are surprisingly good
Pork Pot stickersBuddha Burgers - The meat in these tastes like quality beef almost as good as Kobe beef
I always order the Famous chicken salad or the French dip but my husband orders many different things on the menu and they are all wonderful
If you tell them it's your first time there they will provide you with samples which in a way served as an appetizer that made me even more excited to try their food
Their blend of Mexican Chinese and Cuban flavors is a very unique and delicious combination and for the money you get a very generous portion of food
The Jade Red Chicken is a favorite; I'd also recommend trying their pollo diablo if you want some more kick
Don't get me wrong the food was good but at this level you are also paying for the atmosphere and the experience both of which are lacking at Atlas Bistro
The pizza was amazing and so was the bruschetta and the service
They have amazing fresh bread delicious sides and high quality food
but the roti was good and the service was awesome yet these dishes made my insides hate me and I recommend that you should be wary once entering the ghost town of India Palace
Combine that with the preconceived notions they have already heard about this place it makes for one amazing pizza
The pizza was really good the customer service was horrible price was okay
There is a lot of food and booze to be enjoyed
The menus have real leather covers and the food sounded delicious
There were bushes and lots of greenery and I later found out from a Foodnetwork special that the chef keeps his garden out here to ensure fresh quality items
The sausage had a great savory flavor leaving you satisfied but not like you stuffed yourself silly with a Chicago deep dish
This place is totally cute inside and i guess i expected the food to be just as good as the place looked but ended up being super disappointed
Their food is downright bland and nowhere near the level of NOLA and we're talking a cuisine that thrives on spicy/flavorful food
as you pass this whataburger you take a look at the restaurant and think how could the food be any good
crazy i know but when food is this good i don't mind
It is not horrendously overcooked and the chicken was juicy hot and tender
For entrees the Chicken was delicious as were all of the tacos
First the food had the green chili beef burrito and was very impressed
Now it's gone and it's pointless to make the longer drive because the food is just not good anymore now that it's a Julioberto's
Overall the food was pretty good but I just couldn't focus on the food
The salad was excellent although I wished all of the ingredients used were listed on the menu- I had to fish out a couple of troublesome items
I love my thin-crust pizzas hot very crispy and fresh-- not cold nor stale and if it's the least bit soggy I am heartbroken
The fourth time here I had the Italian Beef hot sub
The other thing that stuck out was the lightness yet tastyness of the food
The selection of food was very good especially for the natural stuff
So if you are here in Maricopa and looking for quality food and supplies for your pets I recommend Pet Club
I know good Mexican food and this is just not it
Food there was so-so - the scallops were pretty good but simple dishes like the tortilla were disappointing not to mention the portion size was miniscule
Countless years of build up made me expect an explosion of flavor that would take a dozen rolls of paper towels to clean up
It was good but nobody's going to be fishing burger meat from their butt crack
It was a good to very good fast food burger
Tasty gyros chicken shwarma sandwiches and pastries too
On their menu it has family styles and we ordered one and I recommend the ones with sour chicken because it's good
Anyways the setting and food would be best recommended for a date or a business related things
The Pizza was Delicious and the Wings were fabulous
Easy to say i will be back and did i mention the whole place smelled like wonderful Italian food
I love the idea of it; the big margaritas always a fun time but the greasy food usually leaves me not feeling too good after
For food I got the mango crab salad which was amazing
We also had an awesome watermelon salad and my date had a pork dish that was really good too
I tend to be overly critical of VIetnamese food in general since I always had high quality authentic food at home growing up
I think I'm a pretty good cook so I'm most impressed by dishes I don't think I can replicate
The food is excellent and I think appropriately priced
I love going to a restaurant where a good chunk of the food is vegetarian because that is so rare
The meat pretty darn good not fatty and overall would get an A
to the more special dishes in Mexican fare that you don't see terribly often in Phoenix like great chicken mole and offally good menudo
Also pizza hot dogs popcorn and other snacks are also available before and during shows
The food was cold by the time I took my first bite and I wasn't the only one complaining
My faves are the egg salad and grilled chicken hot plate
There is no denying this is great pizza  All of the ingredients are delicately chosen and prepared by the man himself and he manages to pull flavors out of each that should not be humanly possible
Started with a couple happy hour $5 appetizers including chicken and waffles
Fried chicken pieces wafflemaple syrup and hot sauce
I had the cheff's board 2 cheeses 2 meats and some other goodies
The ultra thin slices of meat were tasteful and everything was good
The food is good portions are decent but sometimes lacking presentation and even size
The specials are good the White Tuna is always a winner it is a very fatty fish so don't be surprised it is very good though
The handrolls typically a kid favorite are very good they are big so order slow
Have some fun Sakana is a good place to try some good fish RAW
And whoever that nit wit was that said Arizona has bad Mexican obviously knows nothing about Good Mex food
Anna ordered a chicken arepa $12 with chorizo corn aji amarillo the menu doesn't tell you but this is a hot yellow chili pepper from South America - be warned and Oaxaca cheese
I used to work at a Cold Stone and I get it the food industry isn't fun
They have a great menu full of creative salads sandwiches appetizers entrees and desserts
Food is pretty good but the other partons are rude annoying and jerks
The service was good the food was good not stellar but certainly not bad they did have the Bushmill's girls walking around with free shots which was a big plus
Pros Good FoodGood ServiceFun environmentConsObnoxious drunks to be expected at almost any barParking SUCKS but its down town what do you expect
The last few times we'd gone we went omakase and had a variety of of his excellent sushi and creative cooked dishes
I knew of Crepe bar food truck so imagine my delight when I was checking out hot new businesses on Yelp and saw they had opened a store front just a few miles from me
**I cannot say enough good things about the food from Z-Grill
I came here for lunch and I was incredibly impressed with the service ambience and tastiness of the food
I ordered the Sweet and Sour chicken lunch combination which was super tasty with just the right amount of flavor
I ordered a steaken philly cheesesteak sandwich with cheese whiz which was mighty tasty and very generous with the meat
Food was good but there was way to much bread
My date ordered the chicken hot and smoky
The chucks of fish were very good size and also you had a nice portion for two people to share
They had two rolls cut in half and were cooked and flavored perfectly
I will for sure go again as some of their fish on their regular menu looked very tasty so I'd like to try other items and take advantage of their cute patio
I visit Pier 54 as often as I can -- and while the food isn't amazing it actually used to be MUCH better with some delish pastas it's good bar food great salads
Plate is extremely hot and the food has a thick hard outside cold in the middle
It wasn't the most amazing sushi in town but there was nothing wrong with it and I will gladly be back
We had sausages fish and chips and tasty beer
My toddler enjoyed chicken and french fries from the kids menu
Frying a fish can make any bad fish taste good so I'll take everyone's word for it
The meat was tender & the sauce on top of the lettuce was tasty
This results in a little bit of a wait 5-10 minutes but having fresh chicken fingers is worth it for me
Good food and a cool laid back atmosphere go a long way but annoyingly slow and inattentive service go a long way too
Scottsdale and the food from the cafe is excellent
Our first visit to the Roaring Fork and an amazing experience and food
If this pizza is so good then we will try each one and take the left overs home
FOR A SPORTSBAR Alice Cooperstown's food is reliable and good
Though perhaps not the place you may pick for a special brunch with champagne and chocolate brioche French toast a signature breakfast at the Sofitel Philadelphia the Good Egg is my choice for neighborhood breakfast that offers consistent service and food in a comfortable atmosphere
In addition there are is a good number of health conscious offerings and even those less healthy dishes can be requested to be made with egg whites or egg beaters and non-starch substitutes cottage cheese fruit and tomatoes
Everything is nice and hot when they bring it out although sometimes the sambar a soup-like dish might not be if it wasn't as freshly made
We've been coming here long before the gelato appeared however and it is and always has been just straight-up excellent pizza
Similar atmospheres and rich hearty flavorful foods
It's very hard to find restaurants that serve organic chow in Phoenix and I'm a stone-cold pizza fanatic so I was uber stoked to experience this joint
[This last point is worth mentioning -- I've been speaking about the iffiness of the organic certification for a while as it still allows a fair number of chemicals both natural and synthetic and foods only need to be 95% organic to meet certificate standards
]The pizza verdict The oblong pie was good though the most crucial aspect the crust didn't have a lot to do with my concept of what pizza crust is about
tasty and tender served always over a bed of rice flavored with the natural meat juices and oodles of toasted almonds
Just get it Mike's Way and enjoy the tasty food you receive
I don't know why they had to go ahead and screw up perfectly good food with such terrible service
The act like the good food gives them carte blanche to drop the ball on service entirely
This isn't some crap pasta salad you eat at a picnic this is good food
I had the chicken fajitas which were really good and so much food
95 for everything it was even less expensive than Al-Hana & it all turned out like thisComfortable dining room + lovely staff + excellent service + delicious food + very reasonable prices = Yay I'm a fan
The first time I has good service and a personal pizza that was good
I paid my bill and decided there are plenty of places with good beer and good food
The beef ribs and tri tip were great and I would recommend this place to everyone
The food the drinks the music are all excellent
Congealed cold pizza cut into miniature slices doesn't count as a food sample
The food is always good and they have a good variety of all american food
It's good fast cheap Mexican food that is heavy and greasy and you want to be sure to have no plans after eating so that you may lounge around feeling large
The chips are good which is a huge deal to me as many of the fast food Mexican places have terrible chips
The crab rolls as an appetizer should just be thrown in the trash
Our friends even recommend certain dishes but agree you can definitely go wrong at this place
Finally a decent downtown Thai food place with good lunch prices
It's been a long time since I've had that dish that good
We have always encountered friendly service and excellent food
Typically you will findA wide variety of salads and appetizersSeveral Pizza choicesSix Pasta dishesSix Entrees A GREAT dessert menua nice wine list If they don't have exactly what you like or you have a special dietary restriction ask if they will make it
Good selection of beer and the food is extremely edible
Went here for lunch one day because the excellent Asian Seafood Buffet next door closed bummer
I'm sure this place has some good dishes but I clearly didn't order one of them
TDishes we've enjoyed include the butternut squash ravioli the pasta diviolo the California pizza and the Sweet and Sassy
Good mexican food and lots of local history on the tables
Steady stream of people coming in the door and the food was tasty and hearty
They recommended the Roosevelt Row for art food and delicious beverages
Things I specifically love 1 a stable dependable local outdoor farmer's market on Saturday and Wednesday - full of awesome local goods and repping the people who actually grow/make the stuff 2 a permanent building housing a stock of a selection of said goods open most days of the week 3 although i'm already a locavore discovering new sources for real food like DoubleCheck Ranch's beef etc - i'm a huge fan
But no mater; the food at Rosa's is about as good as Mexican gets
The restaurant is a good size but they seem to keep half of it closed including half the conveyor belt to crowd everyone into a small space where the sushi chefs work
Buffet is modest compared to some but here quality wins out with nicely displayed salads fruits cheeses cold meats fantastic smoked salmon cold shrimp crab and bagels breads etc
I ate at a Greek restaurant which had wonderful food
Pros-Wings and tons of sauces my faves honey BBQ asian zing-Offer low-fat ranch regular ranch and bleu cheese for wing dips-Good happy hour food and drink specials-Tuesdays - regular wing specials-Thursdays - boneless wing specials-Service - I've ALWAYS had very accommodating servers and bartenders including changing TV channel to a different game-Calorie counts on menus - make better informed decisionsCons-Noise level - it's CRAZY loud in here even when there are no major games on-Misters do a better job of cooling down the area OUTSIDE of the patio than they do cooling the actual patio area
Most of them were good but nothing that I would rather go to than just make my own food at home
Not only is the food amazing there is one server here in particular who always makes me feel like family Scottie
The naan and puri were excellent and both of our entrees were tasty my husband had the chicken tikka masala and I had a mild lamb dish in cream sauce
They have good chicken wings at times and the crispy shrimp has been good both times I went there
The sushi chefs are both Caucasian and in typical Barcelona style Danny of Danny's car wash fame and fortune has a legion of staff including the obligatory blond bartender in push up gusseted body corset two bouncers in black shirts doing nothing and several waitresses in black tops looking for a good tip by blowing in your ear
This is really a good place to invite some friends for some food and fun and lots of booze before you go next door to cruise and booze some between dances
But with my first bite of over cooked cold and tasteless meat I was kicked in the meatballs and brought back to reality
My Sis had an amazing meatball wrap with potato salad in it it was also very very very good
If you have a chance to have the chicken meatloaf sandwich give it a shot you wont be let down
We ordered the Hawaiian Pizza which was very good our son order from the kids menu only 3
The food was good clean tasty and generally yummy
Okay let me give it a review run-downfood  goodservice good polite niceprice under $10 for burrito and chips/salsadecor cheesy literally because it is yellowwould I go again  yes maybe in a few weeksshould you check it out  if you are in the neighborhood
She was really cool and recommended some traditional dishes
Staring with the warm Brie flavorful and perfectly warmed soft but not runny; the pork belly with grits was luscious; the assorted meats were complemented wonderfully with dried cherries pine nuts olives and pistachios
The pizza was wonderful I had just partaken of a Rosa at Pizzeria Bianco about 3 weeks earlier and could not see any difference
spent less than $20 each on 2 bottles of wine 2 pizza's and the AMAZING banana and chocolate calzone btw don't ever try to eat that alone
the menu is just appetizers but i guess you can order pizzas from La Grande Orange please don't call it 'LGO' that's lame which is right across the parking lot and owned by the DeMarcos as well
There was 6 of us and not one of us enjoyed our food
Here are recommendations for food to try from Lee Lee's
Not only was the food very good we had the beef short ribs shrimp & grits and some fish but the dining experience was excellent
As far as the food goes it was excellent
My husband had equally good sushi in a dish that I cannot remember the name of
We tried the spring rolls as an appetizer and enjoyed those
I don't mind spending the money if the food is worth it but this was not
What little meat I did get tasted good enough but the portions were scarce
It was good egg cooked very well meat a bit overdone but tasty
I have tried 3 different types of food sushi the sandwich and the hot meals
On the other hand when I had the sushi made before me it was pretty good
I don't know that I will ever crave sushi from AJ's but it is good in a pinch
The hot food  I have liked everything I have bought as far as the hot food goes
Given the size and quality of these dishes the price was truly a bargain
I ordered the meatball sandwich with the potato salad which was really delicious
We had the seafood kibis and kisra/hummus for appetizers
The meat however had great flavor and definitely had a robust lamb taste that a lot of other restaurants can't seem to achieve
The service was excellent and for a restaurant of this caliber the food definitely met all of our expectations but didn't exceed them
I find that the quality of their food is usually pretty damn spot-on
Instead of the industrial strength flavorless slabs of breaded sad-chicken I've found at other nearby Italian places the overall quality is really enjoyable for mid-range Italian food
RigaTony's travels well and their carry-out deals include the salad bread and usually a dessert including their tasty chocolate cake
Not much of an oenophile or drinker in general so I can't comment on the wine selection at all but overall you can have a tasty experience here with generally high quality food all around
I got the carne pizza - its good and I enjoyed it but not sure if its the sweet sauce but when you first bite into it it tastes like a familiar cheap pizza think Lil Caesars Peter Piper I couldn't really put my finger on it but the flavor becomes fuller and more quality later on
The meats on the pizza was fantastic and I do believe the cheese is good
in our currently empty space my wife and I were ready for a margarita and some good food
Such delicate flavors for what I thought was a pretty ordinary dish
Good sushi excellent price but poor service
I am a huge fan of Naples style pies and we have some of the BEST ones here in San Francisco but theirs did not cut it as they lacked a certain crust that is a standard on all good Napoletana pizzas
So on my way home I decided that instead of opting for delivery that I would treat myself to some delicious gourmet pizza
I ordered the assorted olives to get things started which are really tasty and then I ordered a goat cheese pizza
I was very impressed with the food and ate every bit on my plate
So I went with much anticipation a sad symptom of vegetarianism in a meat-eating world when you discover that a restaurant has a vegetarian dish and are quick to assume that the dish will be DELICIOUS
It sucks that you're not able to choose from a variety of selections but Not ALL vegetarian dishes are delicious
The dishes are OVER-PRICED for what they're worth if I had to pay my dad had to foot the bill for a party of 6
I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone who has high expectations of food
Certainly not what I expect chicken salad to taste like but delicious
The place is homey and cozy with the delicious scent of good food all around
Don't let me stop there - the desserts were absolutely amazing
Upper Wine Pizza and Bar has a very chill atmosphere and had delicious food
I would say a small pizza is good for 2-3 people
I spent too much time and money there while a college student but the food was cheap back then and it is delicious
However if you want to eat some darn good vietnamese food this is the place
If you're looking for solid American food that is a step up from greasy bar food this is a good option
Everyone within earshot said this was very authentic mexican food
The food is amazing and the people who work here are fantastic
The food is pretty good but the service is a little slow
not the Brazilian model where they bring the meat to your table and this one FAR exceeded the quality of the other
Salad or food bar I can't call it a salad bar because it was so much more was stocked with high quality foods
Nothing to rave about at all the food was just okay not worth the price tag and we will not be going back
I like food which tastes good not something with no flavor
avoid this place if you want real good food
I dont know who decided it was a good idea to change the name of the business on Yelp it used to be Zzzzas Pizza instead of closing Zzzzas and opening a new business as Piza but it was a terrible idea
So if I had to compare I would say First Watch's menu resembles The Good Egg's menu - although I think that The Good Egg's food quality presentation and flavor is much better
flavors are well put together for signature pizzas
The ice cream is also very good as well as the egg rolls
The food was decent overall with generous portions and pretty tasty pho
The spring rolls were alright the proteins within lacked seasoning and the sauce was your typical peanut variety which provided them with a pleasant flavor
Good food decent service nice atmosphere although you do have to shout over the cougs at lunch
We also tried the pate the pizza nothing special the caprese no good the tomatoes were not fresh at all and a phyllo thing which was decent
Overall I would not recommend the happy hour food options but the drink prices can't be beaten
The food and drinks were pretty good but free makes everything taste a little bit better lol
Service is good food is interesting and you get quite a bit of food for what you pay
Excellent atmosphereservice and most important excellent food
Not only a delicious dish but also over generous in size to be enjoyed again
I wouldn't change a thing about it from the ambience to the server to the food quality
Not bad by any means just not as flavorful as seafood can be
And to all you thriving young bucks this would be the perfect place to take a first date-- classy and unique yet unpretentious with amazing food and a manageable cost
I have had good sushi experiences so many times at this place but one near-death event really helps to wipe those memories away
Food was good just had an egg sausage and biscuts and gravy
I've been to this place for lunch and dinner on other occasions and the prices are really good  but their food is just OK
With my coffee being readied and having already perused the online menu I would be ready to order by the time Samantha returned and with the time just before 700 I opted for two dishes both garnering a good choice and sat back to read the paper and listen to the overhead radio while I waited perhaps fifteen minutes for my plates to arrive
Moving next to my second selection the better of the two by some degree a half order of Caramelized banana & pecan French toast was delivered - a dish that would clearly be tasty based simply on ingredients but actually a nice preparation with the single slice of buttery brioche crisp on the exterior and custard like on the inside topped with fresh bananas crunchy pecans and a thick caramel sauce that tasted good on the toast and equally delicious spooned into my coffee
A couple of dishes that stood out from your typical chinese buffets were the japanese chicken lye chee pork stuffed crab balls on the half shelland some kind of white fish that was pretty good but not labeled
It has been a while since I was impressed with food at any restaurant
To say the very least the food was so good
Their desserts are wonderful and I should note that they will also customize cakes for special occasions and the cakes will rival any bakeries in town
the food is good but the service is better
I've been going to Mido Sushi for about 3 years + and the food is consistently good and the prices are unbeatable
Overall based on food and value I would recommend this place
I love Thai food due to the complex flavors that they use in their dishes
Mint Thai's flavors are superior and the way their dishes are presented just adds to the eating experience
Their other dishes were so good and so much better than other places they still get a 4-star review even with average fried rice
I would recommend this little humble not so flashy kind of place to anyone looking for some good mexican seafood

I was surprised how busy it was at 630 full as was the barWe had a variety of dishes starting with the green chili pork stew and tortillas as an appetizer
Other dishes we had*  Filet Mignon - This had great flavor and was a good cut of meat
I rate this 4 stars for excellent food great service and general cleanliness
It was pretty good-we got the house cheddar biscuits to start which were amazing and then i ordered the Smoked Chicken Artichoke Sandwich and my friend ordered the Pork Loin Sandwich which i'm definitely ordering next time
Their dessert sounded amazing-but we were so full we didn't get any
Very mediocre Mexican food but good service
Everything in the dish was very bland though and I had to smother everything in Tapatio hot sauce for there to have any flavor
I would probably only go here again if a good band is playing here but I wouldn't go here solely for the food
Amazing beers craft food and exceptional service
The ravioli tasted like generic Costco pasta the meatball had no spices to flavor the meat and the sauce was the same generic commercial stuff as well
My family ordered a variety of dishes and appetizers including potstickers veggie egg rolls crab puffs egg flower soup hot and sour soup orange chicken house fried rice chow mein and sweet and sour pork - a taste of almost everything - and we were very pleased overall
the place is great for lunch and breakfast kinda slow service and cheap diner food but worth the price tag
I believe in using good ingredients and creating flavors that you can't get in every other pizza shop
It's cheap mexican food with awesome flavor and lots of good greasiness
The menu is a typical Ethiopian menu with entrees meat or vegetarian served with injera flat bread but all the dishes I have tried have been as good or better than any other Ethiopian restaurants I have been to
I wasn't feeling super good that day or I would have ordered a martini and dessert so I'll have to go back
The Ecuadorian Ceviche is a wonderful dish to order and share
We've been craving really good Chinese food that would satisfy our spoiled pallet from Cali
but if you ask me you are compromising the quality of the food for that few dollars you are saving
= NO*Location = good right across the street from Mekong Plaza*Food = the extra $2
The reason this restaurant gets 5 stars is because of the good food to price ratio
Congratulations on a good food for a good price
this was a vegetarian earthy mushroomy sort of flat breadWe tried a chicken taco plate and received three very stuffed two inch tacos that were very tasty and good
For our side dish we picked the Esquites - sweet corn queso Fresco chipolte lime  this maybe was the most layered in flavors out of everything we triedit really was out of this world it really popped
The food was good and about what I expected
The food was very good service spectacular ask for Dane
Staff is always nice which is an added bonus when you get that in any of these types of non tipping establishments and the food is always good
Authentic Italian food we had friends coming in from Chicago and I came on here to find a good Italian Restaurant just by reviews
I recommend the tuna nicoise salad with pine nuts for lunch and every pizza on the menu is better than the next for dinner
Several people had recommended Oregano's for their Chicago-style deep dish pie so this particular Thursday night my coworkers and I came here for their stuffed pizza which takes 45 minutes to bake
The food is filling delicious and definitely satisfying
A wonderful collection of made from scratch pasties say Pass-Tee unique desserts and some of the best examples of the brewers arts to be found anywhere on this side of the pond
From the traditional Oggie with beef onions potatoes and rutabaga with a lovely red wine gravy to the adventurous Lamb Vindaloo with basmati rice potatoes lamb and a wonderfully spicy vindaloo sauce all of Dean's creations are worth trying
I cozied up to the bar and was happy to have hot tasty soup and an egg roll immediately placed in front of me when they brought me a menu
The main course was served extremely promptly and the entire dish was wonderful
The food has excellent flavor and the dishes are inexpensive and loaded with veggies
I usually over estimate a food when someone tells me it is good and it never ends up meeting my expectations
The food is hit or miss except the Hot Dogs are always good and contrary to what another Yelper mentioned the Hot Dogs are fresh
Atmosphere - nice but rather sterile and cold along with the seats under the A/CPricey - yes for what we got and the rather bland taste Fish & Chips / French Dip
The Yardhouse is hands-down a far superior place service food quality and just all around better than BJ's
As many others have said the proof of how good the food is in the tortillas
I figure that has to be a good sign that it is worth it to her to hoof it in and out of that place for that much food
They do make some pretty good chicken tacos but you only receive 2 small tacos and its about $12
The staff is very nice and the service is good too bad the food does not match
Being Mexican & always on the hunt for good Mexican food not that water down stuff sold all throughout the state we gave it a go
The food was flavorful and the shrimp were a decent size
This unassuming pizza place is right down the street from our house and provides a quick go to for some good food and excellent service
We had such an enjoyable time sitting on the patio having a couple glasses of wine beer for the guys and eating from very tasty food
Since this place is so close and better than other pizza places near us mainly humble pie we will be frequenting here whenever we have a hankering for some good quality pizza
Driving by yesterday afternoon reminded me I haven't had my chicken fried steak fix in a while so we ran it by the kids got the thumbs-up and we all piled in for some good ole home cooking
I had the Rei-Shabu rare sliced beef on cold noodles Dad had pad thai the brother had pork katsu and boyfriend had hakata pork ramen
My beef and noodles were delicious not as rare as I had expected this was a good thing I was a little nervous after I ordered it the summer rolls were good but the Cajun soft-shell crab was AMAZING
The pizza dough is also made daily and the wonderful flavor of the pizza sauce is great
I had Thee Argentine with thyme fries and she had the The Green Burger; my sandwich was unbelievably good strips of seitan mock steak sauteed with caramelized peppers and onions vegan mayo and a spicy chimichuri sauce all on a scrumptious sub roll
This is a pretty good deal consisting of three tacos of your choice loaded with meat chicken and carne asada on flour tortillas and then chips and salsa is served with the dish
Great burgers and their grilled salmon and pizzas are delicious
Anyway the food is awesome worth trying if you don't mind the price tag
The mustards were VERY tasty but I didn't care much for the color of the horseradish mustard; kind of purple-ish
The food however was not as good as it looked
Beer battered onion rings win for the appetizer the Philly wrap or beer battered fish and chips are my choice for the entru00e9e and desert is their bread pudding takes 2 to eat it
The pizza is NY style and really good and rich
They offer a Garlic and Olive Oil pizza that is so good
The bottom line is that the food is good and cheap and the place is real
You can't go wrong with their fresh pastas or seafood homemade garlic sausages and wonderful desserts love the semifredo
We stopped by on a Saturday afternoon to enjoy some of their famed Pumpkin Porter and some tasty food
The beer was as good as ever and the food was quite a surprise more than the mediocre bar fare we had expected
Their food tends to be a bit greasy and overpriced however the salsa is excellent
permeated the entire restaurant and I just about lost my appetite which is not good when you are paying $8
bottom line fun place good food but limited veg options
its not the best but its a nice environment and the service is really nice and the food is pretty good
Restaurants offered samples of their delicious food and businesses offered things such as 5-minute massages
The pizza is good but the wait is just too much
When this place first opened they had some really good Mexican food and service
Not the healthiest choice - but who ever said pub food was good for you
We sat at a table for sushi and waited no longer than 10 minutes for a table - amazing for 8 pm on a Saturday in old towne
The seared tuna was cooked and cut perfectly - just the right temperature with a peppery rub the rolls were a decent size with thick cuts of fish and plenty of flavorful crab and the mussels were a tad overcooked for my preference but the creamy texture and buttery flavor still made it a winner
We tried it out so I can assure you that the most important thing is Same good old Chipotle food
I recommend the spinach and artichoke dip tater tots steak salad amazing and margherita pizza
Softshell Shrimp - 3 crispy shrimp with curried green papay Awesome flavors on this oneWhitefish Carpacio - covered at the last second with sizzling hot oil soy sauce etc
we used to do a dish like this where I cooked and this one was the dish I enjoyed the least - but still enjoyedTuna TatakiMushrooms - en pappillote - great umamiLamb chops - red pepper sauce and curry - this one rocked as wellFoie Gras - with pearsDessert was extra but comp'd
The food was excellent and well prepared
The quality of the fish  that is served in the sushi is incredible
I highly recommend this place if you enjoy a nice strong IPA and some quality sushi
This location has been around long before many other restaurants graced Scottsdale and they continue to have good service a lively crowd tasty drinks and good food
Z Tejas recently introduced a skinny menu and although the skinny menu for food isn't that big the skinny cocktail menu is quite tasty
In summary this is a great spot to come for drinks with friends their tasty cornbread some queso and an entree such as their chicken sandwich with avocado
It may seem pricy to pay $16 for a personal size pizza but that's what good pizza goes for these days
Best pizza in AZ but not really worth all the hype and the wait
Very light on the basil this time and the Wise Guy sausage was excellent on this one pizzas there
They're about 12 size pizzas which are good for individual pizzas especially since the crust isn't exactly thick
Sitting in the restaurant with the front open to the elements I long for a cold and dreary day for this dish to brighten
If there were any criticisms of this dish it would be that I wanted some sort of sauce for the spaetzle as I found it tasty but a little bit lonely
Over all the meal was good - 2 huge slabs of chicken fried steak real mashed potatoes tasty biscuits and a Shiner Bock or two to wash it down
Sure sometimes their credit card machine is down I would NEVER eat the food and the new local is kind of shady but hands down the coffee is delicious and addicting
The food each time has been pretty good however the service is always lacking
There are certainly better places to go as far as the food is concerned but this place is definitely a good lunch spot any day
I was able to taste lots of yummy goodness off their menu they had a white and red sangria station set up so I grabbed a glass of the white sangria and started tasting the food
Sushi was surprisingly good considering Sakana not being one of those hard-to-find authentic Japanese eateries
The quality of food though somewhat balanced it out and the reason I'm giving this place 3 stars
I don't know what they do to the chicken breasts they make their sandwiches with but man they are good
The food tasted good and came out really fast
The beef noodles have a good salty taste once we tried the shrimp with mango on the chef's special board and I will not try it again
Food - 1 star Pulled Pork Sandwich & chips - $5*This pork slop was not very good
The food was really good and such a unique sampling of traditional Mexican food dishes with a twist
The chicken was tough but the sauce was deliciously spicy
Eating at Benihana reinforces my commitment to eating food I can feel good about--fare that Benihana does not cater to
Each roll we tried was just a little bit off -- either the spice wasn't right or the mix of flavors just didn't work
The Mock Chicken wings are delicious and they even come with a delicious vegan cucumber mock ranch dipping sauce
However thanks to their good beer list and given that most suburban peeps wouldnt notice the difference between fresh never-frozen and frozen fish
If you just want a good beer in the neighborhood and a passable roll to fill you up then this place is perfect
Co-workers have really enjoyed their salads as well the pick-a-meat with grilled chicken
took forever for our drinks to get there food wasn't expensive and was semi-tasty
i got the chicken taco & rice it was good
A good amount of meats if that's what you ordered and fresh vegetables as accompaniments
The room service is great the food is tasty -- it's the perfect place to unwind
Either way the pizza more than made up for the appetizer
Highlights+ Food really quite good with fresh ingredients nice presentation and perfect portion size
Sure this place is not cheap but it's not that more than going to a regular steakhouse and the food quality fresh
The service and food are consistently excellent
The salsas were fresh and delicious as was the tortilla on my fish burrito
I grew up in Phoenix I know good Mexican food this is NOT it
The chicken salad sounds very simple but was extremely delicious
The portions were out of control the berries were very fresh and the food was very hot when served
Service 5Food 3Cleanliness 5Atmosphere 4Value 3ProsFriendly StaffComfortable settingFresh IngredientsConsPriceyFood of Asia has been the flavor of the month
The right dishes let me pack in the good calories on cheat meals but limitthe nasties
We really thought it would pack more flavor; however it just tasted like seasoned chicken on bread with some cheese on it
The menu is varied and full of varied salads meats and pastas and the appetizers are just as good if not the best part of the menu
I then had the steak salad with perfectly prepared meat and my friend had the seared ahi tuna which she kept saying was wonderful
The beet salad with chicken - which was amazingly moist and tender - was wonderful
Food and drinks- The food was average tasting with an okay amount of flavor
The price isn't really bad for the quality of food you're getting
But the quality of their produce and meats are poor and it is a little bit dirty a this location
This shack goes through its spurt of being good and average but to be honest through our venture with this business we have never had an awful experience with the staff or the food AND the price is soo affordable
The Hawaiian butter fish was very good and light
I felt the prices were rather high for the quality of food
If your in the south east side of Phoenix you have to try this place be ready for the wait though I had a 25 min wait for food but it is 100% worth it
My fiance had a pork dish with rice and beans also delicious
The appetizer was delicious; a great selection of cheese meats and some grilled artichokes
There are not enough words to describe how good the food and experience is
Food AverageService GoodAmbiance Poor - feels like an akward size cafeValue GREAT
Good food but an oddly small menu with no appetizers listed
While it was good and somewhat German in composition I'm just not sure of German food it was
Their sandwiches are fresh they use quality meats and seem to have learned the art of self-humor in their marketing Subs so fast you'll freak
nor is it about the food which was very tasty
As for the food my steak was good the salad was fresh and the dressing pleasant
I am giving two stars because I think the place is well designed and the food is not great but good
Healthy affordable food great staff good atmosphere
One thing that I enjoyed was the unique toppings for the pizzas
The food is full of flavor and the portions are perfect; when you sit down you are served croissants and jam before ordering you meal
When on business in Phoenix during the hot summers I often stay in resorts so I don't have to leave the grounds to find food or entertainment
The mashed potatoes had country gravy no meat in it and was perfectly flavored
They did pretty much try to cover up any real flavors with the mountains of melted cheese she ordered the penne something-or-other dish
Let me tell you about authentic Salvadoran food warm gooey pupusas fried yuca that crackles in your mouth savory rice and beans warm tortillas with your food cold and perfect horchata to wash it all down and perfect oh just perfect soups
It was the best burger I'd had in a long time just succulent and juicy and with a good meaty flavor
The kitchen called it out she turned and saw it was out kept bullshitting with her friends at the bar came over 4 or 5 minutes later and brought our cold food
The flavors in the food is nothing special and the only thing on the menu that excited me is the mussels and fries since I lived in Paris for a while and thats like the Mcdonalds in Paris - Mussels and Fries
The food here is EXCELLENT the beer is VERY good and I've had both good service and slow service
I want to enjoy a good craft brew with some great food
And the actually spinach tortilla and veggies were good but the chicken just dragged the wrap down
Regardless I would recommend this joint if any of you are close by and stop for some heart-stopping food  - enjoy
They make up food that's just as good as all the others
It's not fast food and you may have to wait a bit as they cook your order but it's definitely worth the wait
The wait staff is incredible the food unbelievably good
The wine selection is as excellent as the food
That said I opted for the Chicken Parmigiana--which is my standard litmus test for assessing the quality of any Italian restaurant
We enjoyed great wine and great food--all very reasonably priced
I was in the mood to find a new sushi joint when I came across this restaurant that had almost to good to be true reviews
Food-wise the menu is kinda geared towards comfort and southern style offerings including mac-n-cheese scallops with bacon and corn grits dungeness crab cakes with complementary slaw pork-belly etcAgain overall good place to go for a casual and relaxing drink or two
Both were served piping hot but the Orange Chicken was so tough it split my plastic fork at the very first stab
The music isn't really my style but the acoustics are pretty good for rock and roll and there's room to dance near the stage or just mingle around the pool tables and high tops
00 for a shot of Jim and there is no food available but plenty of restaurants in walking distance if you need something to soak up the booze
We enjoyed several half off appetizers 2 bottles of wine Arnold Palmer ice tea and three kinds of desserts
I do enjoy the food -- the Udon noodle is good but there wasn't any of the Japanese beer left for me to order
Their grape leaves w/ lamb are fantastic love the hummus garlic sauce is very potent and wonderful the gyro plate as well as the chicken shwarma are A++
The sizzling plate came out and my eyes widened at the wonderful smell and beautiful the strips of meat
Things we tried and were also very tasty carne asada chicken enchiladas shrimp chiveche salad and chicken and avocado salad yum
For lunch we split the beef tacos and the chicken pita nini with the jalapeno pesto both on the recommendation of our waiter who was very attentive
I thought the Caesar salad was probably the best food of the several dishes served and while others at my table seemed to like it I'm not exactly eager to give it a second shot
Everyone enjoyed the tapas so much that we kept on sharing plates with the rolls and the delicious shrimp stuffed eggplant which was as good as it was beautiful
Our food was delivered to our table and we enjoyed our burgers
I walked into this dirt hole holding my breath and tongue and willing to order something in the hope that I could find some good Mexican food good Mexican food is actually an oxymoron anyway I stood where it said order here
The food is consistently wonderful flavor and they have large portions
She doesn't get any people food and has not become a begger yet therefore she's a good dinner companion
The food is not mind blowing but it's good
Honest to God the Hot Pot is a FULL SIZE COOKING POT filled with chopped up chicken on the bone with skin  if you order chicken vegetables such as bean sprouts cabbage  hot broth herbs  oil  and spices and lots of those Szechwan Peppercorns that have an illegal drug like effect that makes you crave it
I had the water boiled fish that I tried to order last time it was very good and lighter than the water boiled chicken I was given last time both those dishes seemed very mild and far less tongue Thrilling compared to the Chicken hot pot but they were also flavorful and were lightly tongue thrilling
Scallop lomein duck spring rolls potstickers and several other hot delicious looking entrees- Brick Oven Pizza - Spinach mushroom & artichokes
The chicken has always been moist and dish is always flavorful
My girlfriend got  french toast because she is a bitch and has to be super toned and fit with out working out or eating goodwhich came with chicken apple sausage
Now if the pizza was amazing I would still think it was expensive but worth it
I would recommend if you want a great glass of wine without food Cork is the place though our waiter Winston had difficulty remembering what wine was ordered at our table
The second reason is the hot food counter
Seriously though - the food is really delicious
I mean aren't you supposed to magically turn into a hot manga babe when you eat sushi
The food is well spiced and flavored but the main problem I had was that some dishes tasted exactly the same
I really enjoyed my Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio as the pork had a delicious lime like marinade to it and the egg rolls were crisp and fresh tasting
Want to have an inexpensive lunch and don't care about atmosphere but rather just good quality food
The cafe is very charming and comfortable we definitely had a good time getting dessert here
The inside atmosphere is nice jazzy/loungy my French Martini is gone in 60 seconds the food is pretty good
He got the seafood pasta which WAS spectacular that sauce was delicious just wish it came with some bread or something to sop up the remainder
The food is amazing and you can pretty much create anything you want if you order it right
Hopefully they get that all fixed up because the food is amazing and it would be a shame to lose this restaurant
I completely agree with the other reviewers - the food's delicious and the boss and I resolved to return several times and go down the menu tasting each different thing
I'd have given this my usual 3 ranking but decided on 4 because it's reasonably unique the food really is delicious and the owner is super friendly
I'm okay with a small expensive plate when the food is amazing but this really wasn't
I literally got yelled at by the owner for trying to spend my money at this place and the $3 I paid for the cold lifeless pizza was $3 too much because it was awful had obviously just been hanging around for hours and literally made me feel like I was digesting razor blades
People are willing to wait for good food I suppose
For all the press it's gotten the food better be damn good
The food was delicious and unique in flavor
The food was awesome and the wonderful ladies of Scottsdale are entertaining it's saturday morning and ladies are rollin in this place like it's a fashion show to top it off one lady had to reapply her mascara a few times to make sure she was breakfast chic
If they had been the most delicious thing ever I wouldn't have cared but I didn't even take the half of the food I had left home
Great food great company and amazing scenery This place is cookin'
There's a lot of good food to eat around the area4
The bagels are a must have staple in our freezer daughter uses them for breakfast sandwiches etc the ice cream sandwiches are soooo good the pizza crusts are amazing - they are some ones that Barros uses I love those
I had the fish tacos which was absolutely delicious
Lastbut not least the food was delicious
All of the food had to be served from one end which was kind of an issue with the gigantic hot bowls of steaming pasta
And as I mentioned the food was delicious
However the Sushi was excellent AND very affordable
Though the menu is fairly extensive we stuck to the basics and had shrimp nigiri no brainer 2 lobster rolls excellent a Caterpillar roll fighting over who got the last piece edamme 2 glasses of a decent Chardonnay for me not my daughter and finished off with some white rice strawberry ice cream
Pros nice comfortable casual room; varied appetizer buffet- we especially liked the Kobe sliders and the salads; the complimentary duck fat fries; the skirt steak and salmon entrees were both outstanding and perfectly cooked; delicious sides- grilled corn smothered in a zesty sauce grilled asparagus baked beans; dessert overkill with apple crisp root beer floats and chocolate slivers and pecan cookies; mostly great service they brought me the wrong entree at first
I'm always game for interesting flavors and combinations and for the most part True Food gets it right
Most of the plates have subtle flavors so if you prefer robust and spicy True Food probably isn't for you
It came with a lot of rice and there was way too much food on the plate for me to finish but I think without the apps and bread it would have been a good portion size
I think I would have liked the meat itself to be hotter but the pork was tasty and I enjoyed the BBQ sauce
But I know that's just me and doesn't really take away from the quality of the food
Even so the lines at the concessions weren't too long and while there wasn't much of a food selection there were the baseball game essentials hot dogs and beer
I enjoyed the delicious food and the quick service
The traditional beef was nothing too amazing a little dry to tell the truth
But the food is REALLY good and very inexpensive; everything is freshly made to order and is very authentic
The tofu is always perfectly crispy the dishes especially the chow fun are excellent and the drink menu is fun and creative
Our shrimp puff appetizer arrived - and to our surprise and dismay would guess that the pastry portion was a Pillsbury product rolled out thin and fried
After another long wait our entrees finally arrived and again while the portions were generous the anticipated flavor and quality of each of our dishes just wasn't there
Sorry to say - we will not be back and instead will return to our other 'tried and true' Asian restaurants where we are assured both good service and flavorful quality food
The burger was nothing to rave about although my dad said the kobe beef burger was pretty good
- but tried one of their new fish tacos today and I have to say it was delicious
Lunch Specials are affordable food is pretty good
Felt like it was just taken out of the bag and put on a plate with some chicken out of the fridge yah chicken was cold
The good about  the food that day was the pretzel was good but that's hard to screw up
I don't think I'll be returning between the service and the so-so food I wasn't as impressed as I really wanted to be
The menu was a little confusing and little pricey yet the quality of the food is there and considering the location of the restaurant pricing isn't an issue
This is where I swig down a cold Tsing TaoAnd the chickens feet
The food is splendidly greasy and mostly delicious;  the perfect stop between bars on Mill Ave
I really enjoyed my Salmon Roll and Macau Shrimp and Noodle Soup Combo $9
95 which had 6 delicious sushi-type rolls and 8 oz bowl of soup chunky enough to nosh with chopsticks
All in all the great variety on the menu good service tasty food unique atmosphere  and moderate prices make this a solid choice for lunch or dinner
The food in general is very good and always tastes freshly prepared and made with love
Beef chow fun isn't my favorite noodle i prefer chow mien but I went with it and it was good
The plates were brought over from Green and probably played a hand in why the food wasn't hot but it was more likely due to it being pre made quite possibly the day ahead of time and not heated well which in turn made for a very dry tofu scramble
I may be pointing out the obvious here but Nami should stick to being a coffee and pastry shop and let real meals be at Green where food can be served hot from the kitchen into a dining room that can accommodate more people
Looked in my friend's neighborhood and found Sarajevo  Saw good reviews so that's where we went since neither one of us had ever had Bosnian food
The food is soooo good and the people are so nice WHY aren't you Yelpers doing your part
My chicken tikka masala was very flavorful but only slightly spicy The waitress told me they make their curry in-house I assume they make it only mildly spicy to accommodate all diners I was impressed
Low prices good food with good selection reasonably priced and served at all seats reserved seats if you want them good servers who work at staying out of the way clean new and nice but unpretentious
Great food fun atmosphere and wonderful service
Your pets deserve good healthy quality food and this is definitely the place to get it
I definitely will return to Hillstone if only for the amazing food
I was really jazzed all week to try some cool food trucks and I ended up leaving having had waited 30 minutes for half a hot dog that my boyfriend and I shared
We have had some instances of meals being too hot/spicy for our table so be sure you mean spicy when you order a spicy dish
is quite good but reminds me of Orange Chicken it's not Chinese-Chinese but Chinese-style American
The beef is outstanding and I did one of each but next time will probably do all beef it is so good
If you don't like HOTTT food then you can still eat here and get great authentic New Mexican Food but ask the server for recommendations that are not hot
we came here as three girls and ordered at least 5 appetizers on top of dessert and wine and the bill came a little short of $60 dollars
and getting our food cold calamari and the server looking at me like I had my head sewn to the carpet when I asked him to fix it - killed it for me
While the menu is limited here this allows them to specialize more in those certain items and as a result the dishes are excellent
They packed a lot of flavor in that seemingly simple dish and I will definitely be coming back here to try more of their entrees
THE GOOD * Great Sindhi biryani - the rice is flavorful the chicken is tasty all in all a great dish
* Chicken boti tikka boneless pieces of marinated chicken grilled in a clay oven - also tasty but have had better elsewhere* Naan - Really good stuff
So in the end here's the equation1 Pretty Good Food - 1 Dubious Dining Room - 1 Surly Aunty Type - 1 Singing/Shrieking Girl/Guy While Eating Curry On The Matterhorn Which Makes No Sense - 1 Overly Randy King of Ancient Sri Lanka Who No One Really Needs To See = 2 Stars

Well we split the three meals between the four of us - The chicken was may favorite - served with delicious potatoes
When I saw it on the Food Network show it looked amazingly delicious
Pretty soon she returned with two complimentary scones and our money back for the hot food
The food here is okay - the scones were great the hot food what you would expect from a breakfast bar atmosphere
I was good and did not consume all of the fries but the salad and chicken were history in just a short time
The portions were huge platter size and food was amazing
The staff makes you feel welcome and the food is wonderful
Most meals come in combo form with rice soup Winter Melon at the time we went delicious an egg roll and some pickled vegetables
And let me tell you the food is pretty good
mind you it is bar food so it is greasy delicious and big portions

I have heard good things about their food from other people
I'll miss you Parlor Pizzaenjoyed our little affairbut I'm off seeking douche-free pasturesman
Considering there are no meal items over 475 calories the food is delicious
The food is amazing and always exactly how I like it-delicious
A few times I had less than stellar service but since the food is so good I continue to come back again and again
OK I'm not used to getting so much tasty food for so cheap
The babaganooj was the best I've ever had the beef kebab sandwich was really delicious and so substantial that I almost regretted having ordered other things
Sometimes the food is really good but other times it's off
One thing I have a problem with is using coupons here I had a coupon for a pizza and also ordered an appetizer at happy hour half off
When the food is good though it's really good which is why we return
The place is a dive though but you know what they say about divey places having good food
Good place for veggie heads or folks who eat fish
Can't speak for the chicken or beef but have been with friends who enjoyed that stuff too
The Tom Kha Gai Soup is excellent as are the calamari fish and noodle dishes
Easilly the best Thai food I've had in Tempe I would heartilly recommend Thai Basil even if it's slightly off the Mill festivus

The food is quite good and reasonably priced for a James Beard award winning chef
I tend to like Greek food so I ventured over and enjoyed a very pleasant lunch
The flavor texture presentation and everything about Dominick's steaks along with all of their other dishes is phenomenal
The food was good - not outstanding but good
The food was good but the best part was Kailey our waitress she was exceptional
I've eaten alot of Indian food  and while some of the items may not be 100% authentic I still thought the flavors and quality were great
I admit sometimes I do like that greasy fatty Mexican style food but Carolina's is just as good without all that
Horrible service first time here and the service was horrible from the moment we got there we had a birthday party for family birthday when we got there we had to wait  over 20 min because the ladie on the front desk didn't want to do her job and had to wait for someone who did so they can show us where the room was after they take us there the food wasn't ready even that we make sure to let them know what time we will be there then we went to play on the video games and were told that  we can leave our stuff there due that it was a private room and only staff member had access well at the end of the day a present that we give to the birthday boy was gone and it was an iPhone after we call the manager to tell him what was going on they start accusing us for living our staff there instead of helping us to look for it will never come back to this place or recommend it to anyone even after we spend almost 1000
Absolutely worth stopping by and getting a pizza if you are in the area and there is a small or nonexistent line
As a matter of fact I highly recommend the fish tacos
Having visited the land of fish tacos AKA Southern California I developed an affinity towards this tasty delicacy
The only thing that was good about this dish was the white sauce which we used to dip the Calamari in
The Calvano was good it was almost like eating a pizza just as Elaina told me
salads and other food that I tasted of our friends when they finally got there were good as well
The chicken quesadilla and the ahi appetizers were very good
The ahi was a sushi type appetizer with a soy based sauce garnish and chop sticks
Foodwise there is a wide selection of baked goodsincluding some of the best bagels
Great server good food and of course TEQUILA
All was going well we ordered margaritas a round of shots and some food
Being so close to Kai which is also located at the Wild Horse Pass I figured this would be a pretty much win situation; don't get me wrong the food was good but I've had better
and it's good for a free lifetime dessert every time you visit and have an entree
I got the Italian Chicken and Portobello Sandwich and after the initial laughter at my table died down about how small the portion was I dove in and found it quite tasty
Good lord I'd died and gone to heaven with a dish like that
My wife and I are both in the restaurant biz and so were many of the guests we all came away impressed with the food quality
And the food was really good - all four dishes that our party of four ordered were really good
It's good to note and they do so on the menu that Asian Grill only uses white meat when it comes to chicken
There is a restaurant that charges fair prices and provides exceptional service ambiance and delicious food all in one visit
My seafood ciopinno was very good as well - a solid dish
We then tried the carrot cake for dessert and it was tasty
It was a very good price for 2 appetizers 2 entrees 2 glasses of wine dessert and tip
Food isn't the greatest but it tastes pretty good when it is 130 am and you know your only other choice is a long line at a fast food place
It would be nice and very welcomed change to see some quality foodie type places added to their line up
The food quality sucked badly took over 30 minutes as I was waiting in the restaurant
Food was cold crying tiger steak was little bits of fat didn't even look like the picture on the menu drunken noodles were dry and lacked of seasoning had no vegetables pictured in the menu shrimp was half RAW in the papaya salad
It took almost an hour to receive our food - it was good but not worth the wait
We also ordered a bruschetta plank - for $12 you get 6 huge pieces of bruschetta a really good amount of food for the money
Overall I say the price of the food is good for the portions you receive
It had some tasty sauce on it just a little not too much sort of around the fish
Simplicity dominates the small menu at America's Taco Shop and the focus on quality is evident in the food
The only reason I let the quality of food and the diet pepsi on the bill slide was because I knew it would take waaaayyyy too long to wait for a correction
The gyros are quite good and contain plenty of meat
Niro also serves other chicago style fare italian beef hot dogs etc
Four peaks is a staple go-to brewery to sit back with friends for a brew and even have their good food which is very hit or miss at most breweries
While most of the food seemed more Americanized there were some Dim Sum favorites hiding among the aisle of deep fried goodness - pork shui mai soup dumplings and salt & pepper squid
It has been featured on the Food Network Diners Dives and Drive-ins and for good reason
In a location like this the food has to be good or they will end up like the other tenants around them-here today and gone tomorrow
When we dine in the passion bread is a nice complimentary touch pizza is pretty good and wings are yummy too
We moved to Utah about 10 years ago and searched for food that was as tasty as it is here
There are several things worthy of complaining about but the food is so good that it makes it all worth it
Great food good portion sizes great prices
Foodwise $8 got us  sliders sweet potato fries with a tasty spicy ketchup and the Hot Bollix Spicy Potato Balls- deep fried mashed potatoes with bacon scallions and Irish cheddar
I usually get one of fruit-flavored sodas that come in the glass bottles from the refrigerators next to where your order your food
And the tSoynami's are really good but closer to a dessert than a drink
I would not recommend a vegan pizza unless you know what you are getting yourself into
This place has great food good service and excellent outdoor atmosphere
Not only is the food delicious I usually get a jade red chicken quesadilla emerald chicken jerk fried rice and refried beans but you get a cookie with it
We enjoyed the Bruschetta  Pesto Pasta and a 'make your own pizza
It's not too pricey but if you want to enjoy the Bruschetta pick four be ready to dish out $12 buck for that appetizer
I'm always up for a good sushi night and with Cafe Wasabi so close to home I tend to go there frequently
The service is quick and the food is worth it
I would certainly recommend it to fellow sushi-lovers
The flavors had just soaked all the way through the meat totally an insane dish
We CANNOT wait to come back and try their Four Square deal - from 4-6 you can get 1 free appetizer and 1 dessert with the purchase of 2 entru00e9es
Great beer good food and awesome live music
The food is so good tho and the beers if you wait 10-25 mins for them are VERY cold
the volcano appetizer sedona roll and Mochi Icecream which I am becoming addicted to were all wonderful
Ok ordered a couple of different sandwiches main dishes and appetizers
The key thing in my opinion is that when you eat Cuban food it should be full of that delicious Caribbean flavor and flair and light up the taste buds in your mouth
We will be back here for sure and recommend that you try it for great quality flavorful quality family style Cuban food
Anyways aside from being family owned its actually pretty good food
The entrees 2 filets and 1 prime beef short rib were beautifully presented but again the flavors did not hit the spot
Although I enjoyed the sides on my plate I had a really difficult time putting down the short rib due to the sweetness of meat
That being said the staff is very nice and the food was good
Gus Belt the founder of Steak n Shake was a quality restaurateur who owned a restaurant/gas station called Shell's Chicken
My chicken panini had well cooked meat fresh cheese and good bread
Do you like tender fall-off-the-bone stewed meats that are rich with flavorful spices and unique to the average palette
#1 The fish was low quality especially for the price
If this place only served sushi it would be 0 stars but since the decor was okay and I enjoyed the setup I decided to give it 2 stars
Our food came out quickly the service was attentive the prices were reasonable and I was REALLY impressed with the taste portions and quality of our dishes
That's worth celebrating even if the food was shitty
We went late- 830 on Saturday night- but were pleasantly surprised by the friendly welcome and the full array of hot buffet and sushi choices
The buffet foods were tasty and fresh the sushi was pretty and delicious try the Shaggy Dog
I have been eating at this Waffle house since I was a teenager and it has never failed to provide good food
The meat is not organic or all natural even though it is a good cut it still comes from cows which have taken hormones chemicals and were grain fed
this poses a problem and the staff at Fleming's was not helpful when I asked them about there lack of meat quality
The service was great but the meat quality was definitely lacking
The pizza is passable but not a million miles from a toasted lavash cracker the beer is all right and the pizza cookie is pretty good it's basically a cookie half-baked in a deep-dish pizza pan
The food has always been delicious we're pretty snobby when it comes to any kind of Italian fare
I was so overwhelmed I just went for the Argentian sandwich-fake beef strips with hot sauce and fake cheese added WITH a choice of sides for 6
The chicken fried steak was crisp not too much breading and the gravy was good
All tacos had little meat; did not hold their heat well; and I'm from Texas so any taco with this little rib-eye is worth skipping
Not my cup of tea but if the food is good we don't mind
The portions are reasonable the service was great of course it was pretty dead that night & the food is quite tasty but not gonna change your lunch/dinner plans regularly
Now I gave it four stars not because I'd call it a four-star restaurant but for what it offers considering it's fast food and for the good manners
The flavor of the shawarma was good but I was really disappointed in the chicken
Everything from their service to the quality of the food to the bathrooms to the piano music to their professionalism it's just spot on
When we finally did get our food mine was cold
Pork belly pastrami appetizer the traditional chopped salad and creative main courses of the scallops/grits and meatloaf/yukon gold potato
While it may look practically abandoned on the outside there's some surprisingly good food being served on the inside
I got the hot & sour soup and the eggplant w/chicken
I'm really hoping this isn't the best Chinese restaurant in Phoenix because the service sucked donkey balls and the food was nowhere near good enough to make up for it
We all agreed that the food was as good or better than any other place we have been to
The parpadelle was a good minimalist dish
The desserts are not very imaginative but were tasty for what they were
I grew up in San Jose in an area where there was a decent Indian population lots of good Indian food spots and moving out here to AZ I was worried if I was going to find good some Samosas or Chana Batura
Food-wise a group of us started the night with ceviches and the millionaire taco- HIGHLY recommended
The salmon was moist and flavorful but the cold side dish of a red lentil under a plantain was horrendous; I couldn't bare to take more than a bite or two- I've definitely had better salmon for under $26
Kobe skirt steak was tender and very tasty but again the cold side dish of sliced onions was nay-ok
Dessert wise- the chocolate taco has received plentiful raves but more cute to look at than delicious to eat at
Call me a food snob but I didn't think my meal and overall experience was worth $50 per person tip included
Had the Machacha Burro and it was all shredded beef but damn it was good for 3
Overall good service great atmosphere and good food
The beer selection is decent service is good and I really like the food
It was a little expensive for the quality of the food
I ordered a meal that came with a soupy/slurpee/sludgy egg drop soup soggy cream puff decent egg roll boring brown rice and flavorless kung pao entree
The appetizers were crab sushi roll and Kobe beef
To give them credit the breadcrumbs on the flattened fish sticks were well seasoned the fish was very light and cooked just right and the fries were pretty decent but was this worth a 20 minute wait at a drive-thru or conversely sitting at the tables out front where it smells a little not that great
We finished it up with a chop salad - perfect blend of flavors - and a promise to return for one of their desserts another time
The pricing is very reasonable for the quality of food you get and the great service
This was the first time I had the Japchae noodles and I thought they were pretty good but reminded me of the Thai dish Pad See Ew
Steaming hot with a blast of flavors and spices; it warms my soul - Seafood Tofu Soup for the Asian soul I'm working on the book haha
But once inside service is stellar and the food is delicious
The food was all delicious but what really distinguished this event was the personable attentive extra-mile oriented staff
I was pleased with the flavor of the sauce and the meatballs
Situation Wedding AnniversaryApp Brie BruleeSalad RoquefortMe Lamb ShankWife Sea BassOutcome So few times have I ever run into a place where the food is so good it puts pictures in your mind
She brought the food out while it was hot rather than letting it sit in the window and the crappy food wasn't her fault at all
In a nutshell our server was efficient  the food was good   the decor was nice  but there wasn't any cascading chocolate waterfall at the entrance to the restaurant
Very well priced with great drinks and EXCELLENT food
From the presentation to the flavors to their spin on classic Mexican dishes this place is where it's at
I think service has improved since I was here last and food remains authentic and excellent
But I really liked the food and the flavors of this food
A kind of nicely flavored beef broth soup
Pork Bun pork and egg rolls on cold vermicelli noodles - I was most surprised by this one
Cold noodles and fish sauce makes me say meh but I really liked this dish
Everyone had great stories we had a friendly competition to photograph all the delectable food and we each listened in mouth watering awe when Isaiah brought us one new often local/organic treat after another
I really enjoyed each of the 12 courses brought out my favorites being the house made mozzarella beef carpaccio diver scallops and braised short ribs
I couldn't believe there was dessert too-my favorite red velvet and an equally as tasty flour less chocolate cake
The BBQ Rolls and accompanying sauce were pretty good - simple light and tasty
CHASE Stadium picked up hot dogs off food vendor overlooked at monster rally going on walked around museum areas and etc
Pretty good food in a nice looking restaurant
While they use good ingredients I find they don't roll their sushi very tightly and it tends to fall apart on me
Their chicken dishes all have good flavor and they stand apart from each other; although some dishes had dry chicken
If this place was nicer and had a better vibe to it or maybe the rest of the food came close to matching the wings/fries I could throw in the 5th star but as of now it gets a quality 4 star just make sure you know what you're getting into
The concept was definitely cool and the food looked good in the pictures
We stopped by for some appetizers and boba/desserts before a dinner event
The spring rolls were poorly made loose and the sauce wasn't that good
The cocktail sauce was spicy with lots of horseradish which I enjoyed
As for the chinese dishes I recommend the pepper steak the meat is very tender and chewy
Ever since I tried their Hot Night sushi on a trip out here to visit with friends I have been addicted to fusion sushi
overall i liked my food not impressed with my lady's food and would go back but i'm too old for that loud stuff
The prices for lunch are quite high but the food is really good
This location is clean and has relatively good service and the same Denny's food that you'll find at just about any other
I've always thought this place had good food and that the prices were fair for the huge portions so I was super excited to find one here in Arizona
I usually think the dish is worth the $15 but this definitely was not worth the money
The food is wonderful if you know what you like
The rest of the family had spaghetti and meatballs that was good lobster ravioli it was ok veal marsala mom said it was really good and chicken marsala dad said it was really good
The dog itself was huge and had a good beefy flavor
My husband's Marriott burger was good though and the food was served fairly fast considering it was room service
They deliver high end quality pet food all around the valley for free
Lord knows anyone who dares open a restaurant these days has a lot of challenges but I can't recommend this new Vietnamese spot simply based on the food
Pho broth is the holy grail IMHO with it's deep beefy flavor combined with the sucker punch of star anise clove and cinammon-it's probably the most soul nourishing dish that I've experienced when done well
If you know Chompie's this is a more updated location with the same quality of food
The service was terrible and the food quality is very poor
We probably would have spent less and had better service and received the same quality food as Burger King
If you love appetizers go for their happy hour where all appetizers are half off and select sushi items are at a special price as well as drinks
Also if you sign up for their email club they send you a certificate for a free appetizer or sushi roll for signing up and a certificate for a free entree on your birthday
The food was all just as good as it is at the other locations
Sorry but I am always disappointed with Famous Dave's primarily due to the low quality of the meats here
Pat ordered the Chicken Alla Sorrentina which though he thought was only ok I thought was fresh flavorful and wicked tasty
The food was pretty good better than your typical brewpub too
The food was cold and some items were not cooked all the way through--maybe a product of them being rushed to our table for some reason
Finally fifteen minutes after the food arrived the server came by and provided us with side plates for the shared appetizers
Of course it took forever to get our check because the server pulled another disappearing act for about 20 minutes and when the check came we were shocked at how much all this awfulness cost almost $90 to be fed cold food and bad drinks while being ignored
For a good piece of steak or a nice piece of fish I expect to pay much more than $12 but there is something about tacos maybe the fact that I can get spectacular ones at Loco Patron for $1 and $2 on Tuesdays that makes me not want to break the bank
[I am not a connoisseur of Chigaco dogs or any other Chicago-style food but my friend said his was very good and that is a big deal coming from him--especially when missing the kraut
The food is quite good  and they have all the regular dim sum fare as well as fish for the cantonese banquets
The cold dishes were good but my favorite was the shrimp hotpot
The food is outstanding-I highly recommend the 3-plate/$25 offering
So I can't really rate the food here but it sure as heck doesn't look like good Mexican to me
As Eric noted the service can be a bit slow but It's excellent food prepared with the best ingredients
Among my favorites are the 1 wor wonton soup normally an appetizer for two made red with spoonfuls of hot chili sauce 2 the chicken noodle soup which has nursed me to health through many stomach bugs and influenzas over the years 3 the bbq pork ribs and 4 the shrimp and vermicelli clay pot dish
Some of the other dishes I have tried tend to be on the salty side and a little unbalance flavor profile wise
So I had a chance to talk with the bartender take my time looking at the different types of beer and getting recommendations not just on beer but also on the foodIt was obvious that the bartender loved talking about the beer
Great place - the service was very good the bartender very helpful the food was delicious and the prices were very reasonable
30 minutes later after one reluctant soda refill no offer of chips or salsa and a cold plate of food with 3 1/2 bites taken still in front of me I debated asking to speak with the manager
The fish was huge with a tasty batter not at all greasy but a tad overdone
It's great for things like cereal canned goods dairy and general processed foods
But their vegetable and meat selections are admittedly not good
The restaurant is quite small and cramped but the food is excellent
I must say the food was piping hot which is always a plus for me I like my food hot
Tucked away in a market this place services excellent middle eastern food
I do love Chino however I am taking off a couple of stars because the last few times I have gone there the food didnt seem very fresh but was till tasty
A couple dishes I am not impressed with at Chino The egg foo young the chili relleno had crushed saltines on it which I was not keen on and the gringo chicken kinda dry and bland
I do wish that I could go there again and have the food be fresh and wonderful like it once was
Waaaaaaayyyyy too much food but it was good
Altogether very good Persian and I would recommend it to anyone particularly if you've never tried Persian food before and want your first time to be memorable
Same predictably good food as Sens in a very pleasant setting with the always friendly staff
The first thing I noticed was the overwhelming smell of some amazing foods and also the stages with entertainers all around
My friend brought me on this little adventure so she had all of the food recommendations
I can't even put in to words how good the food was
Me and the family go here at least every 2 weeks to get some of their delicious Gyros they have a gyro special every day and for the price you get plenty of food
Thought I'd head over to Truckin' Good Food and place my order since a crepe normally takes 12 to 15 minutes to prepare due to all of the people lining up for their fix of French delights
I've tried a couple of the sandwiches and they were fairly tasty - good bread fresh meats & veggies made well decent flavor
The kobe beef and kim chi dumplings butter fish tataki with white asparagus and yuzu robata grilled pork belly with marinated beet roots the unagi flame seared salmon toro and the prime rib eye steaks were delicious
The pretentious vibes and the condescending waitress can be looked over with the excellent quality of the food
The food was seriously out of this world good
But if I had to suggest something to a meat-eater that is venturing out into unknown territory I would recommend Thee Argentine Po Boy
Don't ruin all that perfectly good food while ripping people off there's just no point in it
Every once in a while Crate and Barrel hosts registry parties and you should definitely go to these-free food drinks tips and demonstrations make it worth the drive to the mall on a Saturday morning
The food's good enough for parents too the decor is nice and the people watching is some of the best in the area
This time around we had perfection for service and really good food
The food is not bad I had the BBQ chicken salad today my buddy got the sliders and I have had the wraps in the past- all actually pretty good
I'm pleased to report that the food here is worth a try when you're in town
While my visit to pick up take out was kind of drunken blur the amazing food I ate from Diamond's after a few hours of harder than intended  drinking were JUST what the doctor ordered
Since I also went there for dinner serves food family style I also tried their Orange Chicken Sizzling Rice Soup enough for 4 bowls and a Shrimp dish the name escapes me now -- they were all *very* good
We had a greek quesadilla too it was good meat was tender but could be improved slightly maybe add some feta cheese
If the raw fish isn't good well then why eat there
The seafood soup was very tasty which included fish squid oysters onions etc
One dish was very close to a good ole Irish beef stew
It would not be served on a delicious roll and topped with gooey melty cheese and a thick slice of tomato
We enjoyed some very tasty sashimi the ahi was a standout and a couple of their custom Kona Rolls
- The Food and beer selection is AMAZING- The atmosphere is great - not too college-ey not to snooty like Scottsdale - but a great mix of college young adults and families
They have an amazing list of UNIQUE and appetizing rolls which compensates for their smaller size
No friendly smiles or warm and fuzzies but wonderful food
I can't say that I'll be a regular here anytime soon it's a bit of a drive from my house and there are other places that are basically as good but cheaper but you can count on seeing me here from time to time smile on my face and meatloaf in my mouth
It's an amazing Italian guacamole with a thin-crust pizza for dipping
Most people would be skeptical but the meat selection and quality here is really good and their produce prices are awesome
The food is always amazing and never anything that is on the regular menu and the wine is perfect
The food was yummy- I highly recommend along with everyone else that has reviewed already the bruschetta
I've tried both the lemon and tangerine chicken apparently I could not live without citrus and while good they cannot compete with the green curry
I had the chicken pesto sandwich while tasty gave me a bit of food poisoning
The rest of our group enjoyed their eats the famous meatballs burgers and pizza
while tasty each dish comes with two sliders the size of half dollars
Excellent service delicious food with ample portions and overall cool ambiance
The beef is good and the fries arent too bad either
There isnt a person wearing a Bears jersey out there that isnt going to tell you that a beef needs sweet and hot peppers and needs to be extra juicy
My husband and I had been here shortly after they opened and really enjoyed the food drinks and atmosphere
I'm not sure how many times I told him how good the food was but I know it was a lot of times
see photosChicken was tender crisp to perfection and sultry
My bill was $50 for all that food and it was worth every single penny
The food is high quality for low cost almost diner prices
Over the years I have been to various Bandera restaurants numerous times and the food and service are always consistently good
The bar also has the reputation of a world-renown cougar pickup joint --  But if you can get past the obvious pretentiousness the food and atmosphere are always excellent
The to-die-for Veggie Burger and Chicken Enchiladas are stand-out good items on the menu
It looked interesting and the food looked like it could be pretty good
Good food good portion size good price
This buffet had your typical indian selections tandoori chicken lentilscurry chickenmixed veggies that were real good and some ground lamb burger that was just ok
You can have really good food but if you have crappy nuoc mam your food won't taste right
Its got that 'in scene' type of feel that I've always dreamed of being a part of but I'm just too lame to fit into Anyway none of that means anything if the food isn't good
If you like this type of food i would recommend trying it out
If you want really good Mexican go to Los Dos Molinos not super vegetarian friendly but a few options -- meat eaters and lovers of spice will especially like it here
I had a buffalo chicken wrap which was actually pretty yummy and their french fries were plentiful and delicious
Give yourself at least a good two-hour buffer because this feast will leave you in a food coma for sure
However that makes a mess on me so I get the bowl instead and this place is great for filling up on good tasting food on the cheap
The kids and I had a large pepperoni pizza that I thought was pretty darn good
Of course not what we got was pretty good food and a lot of fun
If you want a good handmade brick oven pizza look no further
The package included facility rental food and drink for 50 people LUX Catering three appetizers  two entrees one salad one vegetable one starch basic bar service and a bartender a DJ and Master of Ceremonies for 5 hours a cake for 50 Nancy Rae Cakes ALL of the flowers for the whole event a security guard and a choice of linen colors for the tables and a coordinator to make sure the whole thing went smoothly
-The LUX Catering food was quite good and we enjoyed everything and our bartender was friendly and accommodating
2 The Easy - Their pre-made foods look REALLY good
We've had great successes with their fruit veggies pre-made food bakery and even their meat though a few thought it's wasn't a particularly good cut of roast I'm willing to let that go for now
I peruse the selection of food available and am actually impressed with their variety
A small dessert section is available but a very cool self serve ice cream area that includes eight flavors
Overall a large selection but lacking in flavor for a lot of food items
I can't help it some fast food is just good sometimes
and of course I had a few bites cuz her food always tastes better and yeah that thing was actually good
The meat here has absolutely no flavor
I am not sure how you suck the flavor out of meat
Amazingly this was the first time I had a Chick Fil-A chicken sandwich
I ordered the deep dish Vito's special since it was highly recommended and went to pick it up
Pizza was super tasty smothered with rich tomato sauce peppers onions and sausage on a soft cheesy perfectly cooked crust
Everything from the seasonal and LOCAL fruits and veggies to the frozen organic meals to the fresh sliced deli meats to the local baked goods and brick-oven pizza made just the way you want it even with goat cheese to the Watering Hole where you can try 30 delicious local and craft beers to the in-store restaurant and grill to the
Not the best sushi I've ever had but they have some creative options on the rolls and some kind of taco appetizer like little mini taco shells with raw tuna and mango chunks in there
A friend from work recommended it to me saying it was the BOMB chinese food
I ordered a bacon cheeseburger was not asked about how done I wanted it what kind of cheese or anything -- just boom bacon cheeseburger NEXT and my fiancee ordered the chicken finger appetizer
What a better way to spend the day than good service excellent brunch food bubbles and a best bud
One word of advice though bring your own food and drinks as prices at the Zoo concession stands are fairly ridiculous $6 for a hot dog
Veggie burger chicken lollipops and sweet potato tots are recommended
The appetizers are pretty decent but I had the chicken fried steak and it was inedible
I have spend literally hours at this place working my way though the menu and all I have found is great well executed delicious dishes
I have also been there once before for dinner and thought it was really good I had the half roasted chicken and it came out super moist
And let's not forget about the great food and the wonderfully adorable bartenders and servers
The taste of pho beef noodle soup is authentic and delicious
This place is ok for fast Thai food when you are am craving Thai and you just can't drive to the West side of town then this place is good enough to kill the craving
Having had In-N-Out burger for lunch and wanting something light I remembered Leeanna's statement that she never even tried the pizza here since the salad was that amazing
But if you are a veg than you have horrible taste in food anyway soo Im sure itll all be good  I say that lovingly Im a vegetarian sometimes
I was dismayed at the lack of good food near my hotel but then I discovered Lalibela
Neither meat is anything I'd recommend or buy again
My copilot on this adventure said her chicken tacos were not so good either and when we got back to the office she noted that we won't be trying that place again
The meat was falling off the bone good but it was the sauces that really made it unappealing bad
We enjoyed the dessert an apple tart thingy and some sorbet before finally paying the bill and leaving
Our server was very nice and he cannot make up for the food not being excellent but I think we were all put off by the bill and him saying good night before we were even done eating
The food is delicious and the portions are very generous
I enjoyed a nice Thai curry dish while my better half enjoyed sushi
There are a lot of good food options and some laughably bad food options a decent mix of stores and boutiques and a really nice movie theatre
There are good fast and slow food options including The Keg Red Robin Smashburger Lucille's BBQ CPK Paradise Bakery and Chipotle
The fried rice was pretty tasty and I loved the fried delights - egg rolls crab Rangoon shrimp
I did not try the sushi but it did look good
We were both very happy with the quality of our food both very fresh & tasty
Loaded with meat free refills and an excellent environment
We ordered the appetizer called the BBQ chicken nachos
The beef was fresh enough for it to get that way as you bite into the beef and tastes good in the process
Mi Comida is a south american restaurant offering Peruvian Colombian and Ecuadorian dishes- of such quality and sagacious cooking method you'll feel as if your very own south american grandmother you never knew you had cooked it all for you
The food is so good in fact i'd subsitute it for human relationships any day; this leaves you and your wallet satisfied happy and full
The meat selection is not only good the taste is out of this world
Thank you HABIT for not only providing really good fast food but also contributing to saving the world's environment
the food was good; i had the shrimp quesadilla
You get a real urban setting here and delicious food
The adventurous side of myself tried Kibbeh an appetizer that is made of ground beef pinenuts cinnamon and then fried
The fried catfish was perfectly cooked and also got a smattering of that delicious sauce
It's classy spacious and the food is excellent
Not as good chicken tikka as a straight up Indian restaurant of course but still phenomenal and the pasty just made it that much better
There are some real surprise dishes well worth the wait for them to cook just like you would at grandmas house
It's the whole package of the location the vibe the constant crowd and of course - the amazing food
As for the food for the appetizers we had the choriqueso which is sort of a Mexican cheese fondue with crumbled mexican sausage
We also had the barrio pollo which comes in a cream sauce with green peppers I thought that was good though the chicken was in strips not shredded which would have been better
It is also a hot spot for drinks so once the sun goes down the music goes up and the drinks flow Woohoo let the good times Roll
If you're having a meeting here the catering is absolutely outstanding - some of the best hotel food I've ever had and that's saying something
While I did that he proceeded to tell me of about 3 or 4 items in the menu appetizers dessert etc that were no longer available
My wife and I have been looking for a good quality no MSG using old fashioned Chinese food restaurant in the Scottsdale area for quite some time
The owner is almost always there and extremely friendly and the food is tasty
So If you are looking for some simple yet very tasty Chinese food I highly recommend this place
Good draft and bottle selection with nice happy hour deals on well drinks but stay away from the food
It was at this instant that I decided this just wasn't worth the wait no matter how good the food is
The food quality has consistently been good
I had the smoked chicken spinach salad and it was delicious
The dressing was tasty the roasted peppers were a good addition and the chicken was well-cooked
Food was good for bar food but the entertainment was some of the best I have experienced in the valley
I have been before on a Sunday evening when there was not much activity and the service then was quite attentive and the food was wonderful
I have had the wood-fried pizzas on both occasions different toppings each time and loved flavorings
Early morning commute less than 40 minutes from Peoria a minor detail to enjoy food this good
So when I heard they were offering $40/pp during RW PLUS a free dessert normally $48/pp and no dessert it was too good to pass up
I've been to Modern Steak a few times for dinner/conference meetings and have always enjoyed the food but I had just gone there recently to celebrate a friends birthday and got to experience sitting in the dining room for the first time
And that's when I got the full flavor of this meaty enormous yet charming country restaurant/bar/event facility/iconic Phoenix restaurant
First the food and the prices were great and the sausages were very good
We were even too full to try any of the desserts that I am sure would have been amazing speaking from experience at other Fox Restaurants i
and the Haru roll crab salad mix wrapped in tuna with acovado on top melt in your mouth good
The hotel food is obviously expensive but it is good and convenient
Food was amazing as usual but service was so incredibly slow
nachos are amazing wings are great margarita pizza is wonderful
This review is based on ordering many things from the overall menu over a 1 year period however one item there deserves a 5 star rating which I will get toOverall most of the items are fairly americanized and not traditional which you expect from a fusion place - however most items are very average and for the price I do not feel you get good value here That being said the one item that does stand out here is their Shrimp Tom Yum Soup which i feel deserves 4 if not 5 stars - it is excellent and flavorful with a lot of shrimp - make sure to order a side of steamed rice with it medium hot and you will have a stand out dishIn general their soups are solid but the only thing I have not found better somewhere else is their Shrimp Tom Yum soupGo for the Tom Yum get your Vietnamese soup from Khai Hoan down the road a few miles
As with a lot of hole-in-the wall Mexican food joints the location is shady and the food is greasy but it is good for late night weekend hunger all-nighter studying food and drunken hungriness
This place always delivers amazing food and service
the middle-eastern flavors of the dish didnt seem to complement the fish all that well
and the filet itself was good but was drowned in an overpowering mustard sauce which overwhelmed the whole dish
Overall good food in a cute environment
5 stars rounding up because of the desserts and the restaurant's participation in such a good cause
The most recent time the burger and flavor of the meat was good but it was a sloppy mess
restaurant is right next to the mall so prepare yourself to walk off the excess meaty goodness
The chicken was flavorful the toppings were fresh and you had two choices for rice sweet or Spanish and beans refried or black
Copper-kettle banging or not the food was good and a great price
The food is just average nothing to get excited about or even good enough to earn a return visit on it's on merits
The sushi and tempura were delicious but just knowing that the $20+ rolls were lurking on the menu made me feel strange
Hearty sauce made my cheese ravioli dish simply wonderful
This pizza had the crust that he anticipated last week not good
But the pizza is dissappointing and not worth the $20 for a large pie
While cold pizza is great at 7 AM after sleeping one off it is so much better when still retaining original heat
it looked amazing and he ate the entire thing along with a cup of chicken noodle soup
Metro Brasserie fills a HUGE void in this town by offering delicious French food at a reasonable price
It's fine to under-promise and over-deliver but this menu is a clunker and it gets in the way of the excellent food
The Shack serves up some pretty good tasting meat
The salsa was super tasty and the food was delicious
This is a place that I recommend to peeps when they want good mexican food and don't care about the looks of the place
And that goes a long way towards what I think makes Mexican food good
Their margaritas are addictive and my favorite restaurant item is their pollo asado- it is a mustard-marinated chicken breast that they serve with the requisite beans and rice and it is mucho good-o
YOu just have to look past the icky surroundings and realize that GOOD Mexican is not about the location but about the food
Both chicken dishes were so tender and flavorful and the spinach was so good that after the first bite I knew I was gonna get more
There ballpark is way out in goodyear if it was in phx or scottsdale i would prolly come back
The meat was moist and flavorful the bun held everything together
I had a good time here and the food and service was fantastic
High quality food but at a bit of a high price
Overall though I felt the food was of high quality and it was a relaxing atmosphere
Ordinarily I get the sausage and carmelized onion pizza and it is really delicious
My wife always gets the wild mushroom and truffled arugula pizza and although you know my perspective on arugula tastes like fart she insists it is the cornerstone of her very existence in her words it's really good
So the waitress came and said that if I liked that dressing they have a secret salad with the same dressing and all sorts of italian cold meats in it
Plus with their salads they serve a nice little bread roll which is pretty wonderful
The pizza's is mediocre albeit very good crust but  decently sized
The reason I write this is because the food doesn't suck and it's worth it to go on Tuesdays during happy hour
It's a great deal and the price more so matches the quality of food
The meat is tender and flavorful and delicious
It was hot not luke warm had good flavor and bits of chicken
I'm a burger loving kind of gal and am always on the hunt for a good peice of meat
Ample menu of items to choose from with a small variety of burgers a hot dog or two and some chicken options as well
After having take out from Sala Thai a few times I can say that the quality of food is hit and miss
The eggs rolls are bland and their pad thai lacks the rich flavor that other thai restaurants serve
good quality pizza alot of sauce and lots of toppings
don't get me wrong it's a very good pizza
The Chicken Milano salad with corn hearts of palm bell peppers shredded carrots grilled chicken looked fresh and tasty
As if this wasn't enough food between us our very friendly waiter inclined us to indulge on a side of potato au gratin which was the richest and creaminess plate we've enjoyed in a while
- flowers minus the designer baked goods minus the bakery deli cheese and meat sans the counter check out the price on the brie and a small drugstore with vitamins a baby section and paper needs
Overall the food was good we both ordered the chicken fried steak but the service was poor
Decent drinks cheese/meat plate was standard but good
Despite the coupon savings it's no deal for poor quality food
I love me some spicy food so of course I order the Bombero burrito it has great favor and to some it packs heats but for me its lacking in the heat I like to have that eyes tearing up nose running cuz its packing heat experience but it's a great tasting burrito its smokey and perfect burrito just add some hot sauce to it and BAM
Papago is a strip mall microbrewer with pretty good food and great beer
I ordered the green beef burrito which was excellent
Don't get me wrong I enjoyed my dish and it was priced appropriately at $8
I had a calzone that was warm on the edges but the cheese in the middle was still solid and the meat was cold
The food was tasty and I was surprised how it wasn't that greasy at all
The dining experience reminded me of my visit to the French Laundry - the standard for a high quality dining experience with unparalleled food decor and atmosphere
I highly recommend the sushi platter  - presentation looks more like art than food and the palate is unreal that there can be so many different flavors and textures from fish I've eaten a hundred times
They get it - they know soy overwhelms yellow fish they know just how to make the cut of sashimi that melts like butter in your month they know how to balance the flavors in ways I have never experienced and which I found truly insightful and enthralling
Other lobster dishes we ordered were the lobster bisque creamy with lumps of lobster and the lobster Mac and cheese which arrived at the table steaming hot and the cheese all melty and perfect
The tab was a little more expensive than we expected but the quality of the food and the customer service was top-notch
A piping hot serving of traditional Punjabi Butter chicken Makhan Wala Murgh served over Basmati rice rounded out my meal
I am glad their priority the quality of the food and service
The meats included sausage  pepperoni and proscuitto - very good
We also had a chocolate chunk cookie with ice cream for dessert and that was unbelievably delicious
Came here for lunch yesterday and the food was pretty good
We shared a bowl of the split pea and it was good not great but good the insalata salad was fantastic as well as the margarita pizza with fresh heirloom tomato's
The service was quick and friendly and the food was good
Just like a sushi menu you mark off what cheeses charcuterie meats cold veggies raw bar items you want and they bring them out with sides of breads spreads and sauces
Hard to get good cured meats here and I'm already trying to plan my next outing to AB to get my plate of salumi and proscuitto on
I couldn't stop smiling and we enjoyed ourselves so much because the food was so good
New Mexican food is the cuisine and they give big portions and rich in flavor -
Although I am not  a vegan or vegetarian it seems as though all of my friends choose to live the lifestyle and as long as the food is tasty I'm always up for something new
All the desserts were so good and you knew they were fresh
I am a huge fan of the kalbi short ribs its a good portion and the meat is always tender
And if it is not quality meat just return it for a 200% refund = one of the only reasons that I will try to get meat here
Don't order fish and chips and expect it to be good
The food took awhile but when it finally got to us it was pretty good
The others in my group had the Zinburger and the Plain and Simple burger both of them really liked them saying the meat had good flavor and was cooked well
One of the girls had the Chinese chicken salad and also thought that it was really good
But overall if you want good diner-style food that's pretty inexpensive check out Harlow's Cafe
the korean family that runs this place is super sweet and has done a great job of providing quality sushi for a fantastic price
It is that good love the food the drinks and how snug it is
The menu is creative without leaving out good fundamental dishes
I believe I can separate my feelings on management/service/food so onto the food chips hot/mild salsaSuper tasty
At least it wasn't 3/4 tomato shredded beef tacoIt was decent but nothing amazing
The enchiladas have a zing to them the mac and cheese is cheesy goodness the Brussels sprouts are perfectly cooked with just the right amount of seasoning and the vegetable dish has the right amount and style of veggies to make you want more
Their pizza is super tasty and it's cut into squares so you get those 4 fun trianglie corner pieces along with the big square pieces
Their specialty pizzas are also very good
I knew SOL was not going to be the my favorite style of Mexican food but what I didn't know was that their style involved no flavor
I have no idea how they were able to extract such little flavor out of it or why according to our waitress it is the most popular dish on the menu
The food is good; the wings are pretty much perfect and the pizza is good
I don't see a James Beard award in the future unless they give one for consistently delicious honest comfort food
The waitress was wonderful the music fantastic area very nice and the food good - what I got that is
I want stuff that tastes good and I am particularly thrilled when said food is stuff I cannot make
As I would never have the patience nor diligence to come up with trying to make food without meat taste GOOD this place wins
Also some of their premade foods like the veggie eggrolls are sooo good
I don't plan on going here too often because the food is too delicious and will make me fat
Food is good with a large variety of choices and creation
During our appetizer Pesto chicken flatbread server asked how we liked it and My Boyfriend replied I don't really care for it
The meat on the dish was goodbut the noodles were a little crunchy from heat lamp+plus no sauce
The shredded beef was absolutely delicious
I thought my spareribs were excellent and meaty but Vicky T
As we relaxed with the good food good drinks and good company we joked about hanging out until happy hour started up again at 9
I may be a little picky and love good Mexican food but I find that my food tends to be bland and definitely leaves something to be desired
I was really impressed with the food very moist chicken cooked perfectly
I'd highly recommend the Egg & Pancetta Buffalo Chicken or the Yukon Gold Hot Potato Pie pizzas
They smoke their meats with a home made rub and its damn good
Once the pizza finally arrived it was a tasty thin crust just how I like it but nothing to special to Yelp about
They never seen to get my order right food is always cold and never fresh
Whatever it was always delicious and just the right amount of food well cooked and well-flavored
The food was good the staff was great and we all left full
food was appropriate as the torta provided a massive yet tasty introduction to pork turkey guacamole and a bunch of other hidden great tastes all in one sandwich
The carne asada quesadilla blew us away-- HUGE in portion amazing meat and super flavorful
I sat at the bar which has the best views and enjoyed the amazing calamari best ever and the beef carpacchio
The food quality certainly does not suffer despite the mad rush to make it for the screaming fans
I had a salad with chicken and avacado that was pretty damn good some sort of SW Cobb
Eatin buddy had the quesedillas which were apparently rather good and chock full of chicken
The Emerald Chicken was also very good as was the pork fried rice
Nevertheless the complimentary cookie for dessert was a good way to end my Chino Bandido experience
The quality of the food at such a reasonable price is something we will remember
The food was definitely good but we were not blown away
The food is simple flavorful and straightforward
I also usually pick up some cheese and always am looking in their frozen food aisle for something that might make a good snack
Best of all the food options here are wonderful
htmWhile you are in Coolidge I would recommend the Gallopin' Goose for drinks or bar food and Tag's for dinner
I've been here a few times now and every dish I've tried has been very good
The chicken ones were tasty but too greasy and the Chocolate ones lost all the filling while cooking
This is good and bad good because I realize as hordes of other people do that this is some of the most innovative Mexican food in town; bad because tonight I realized the in-crowd often is in its lust for a good meal downright rude
I guess their food is pretty good but off the top of my head I can think of 15 other restaurants with better pizza
Don't get me wrong I enjoy hanging out with friends drinking and having a good time at Ra but I solely do not go there for the sushi
The meat is flavorful and accompanied by soft bread mayo guacamole lettuce and sliced jalepeno the whole thing is heaven
The food here has been consistently good and it is definitely my spot to hit up when I am in the valley
The food is good but not outstanding or anything
Some of the people might have been arguing to get a discount on the expensive bill but given that most of the individuals were either on expense accounts or on vacation at a $250-850/night resort but I think most of the arguments were rooted in slow service or food that arrived cold
Got the food home and the chicken sandwich was amazing
Considering the massive indoor mall is pretty much a dieing part of our culture Fashion Square is wonderful for what it is; a place to shop eat and catch a movie in a climate controlled environment although the theater here is pretty bad so I would recommend skipping the movie unless you're going to the small artsy theater just outside
Three battered buffalo mock chicken patties nestled between tomato slices arugula and Green's amazing vegan mayo on a toasted vegan hoagie roll along w/ a side of thyme fries
Don't get me wrong- it's the combination of cold/ solid and slightly melted and slippery that makes a frozen dessert a success for me but tsoynamis generally make me wish I'd saved the calories and visit a gelateria instead
these were tasty but they weren't very warm-canteen wings $4 6 chicken wings smothered in either buffalo or tamarind sauce we got the buffalo it was good and served with some rubbery celery sticksThe food on the happy hour menu could use some improvements
The food is very good and their steaks are a good quality in both cut and taste
ok maybe not 8 or 9Beef Ribs Duck Battered Fish Carpaccio and Tofu were all excellent with LOTS of Sapporo
Anyway I got the Teriyaki Chicken and an egg roll because nothing else really sounded good
The chicken curry has no flavor or spice
Food is still good but the service was bad this time
The seafood tower featured totally fresh and delicious oysters crab legs claws and huge shrimp
I'm not a dessert person but the warm butter cake should be illegal it's so good
When I ordered my taco platter I didnt even specify what delicious type of meat I'd wanted she looked at me smiled and knowingly suggested the carne asada to which I heartily agreed
The chicken tenders were well seasoned and tossed in a hot wing sauce that wasn't very hot
Other little things to noteGood There's quite a few sand volleyball courts the clubhouse food is pretty good the view from the clubhouse is great there's batting cages
Save some room for dessert as you don't want to skip this amazing dish
I got the chicken quesadilla and it came out cold and soggy and my husband got crawfish and spinach enchiladas which he loved
However I think what the place means by original is a hoagie long after it was filled with fresh and delicious foods yet before it was expanded upon by places like Subway
Our main course was the Lentil salad with chicken and tabolui salad - sooo good
I can't speak on the quality of the ingredients but the dishes are well prepared good to look at and good to ingest
Edit After checking out a lot of other sushi establishments this is still the best one in terms of food quality service and value
Spinato's does have an NY style pizza and a Sicilian pizza and the latter is actually pretty good
Its good pizza it filled me up it was tasty but pizza is a competitive market
Love this Mexican food for a dinner out on the weekendsMy husband LOVES hot and they have hot and I like it mild and they have that as well the green chilis are so good I cant even explain to you how good they are
Real authentic food and not a bad price for good food
Once we finally got our food I must say it was really good
They have veggie options and all kinds of sides and unique drinks and a variety of tasty desserts
I haven't had dessert there yet but my friend says they make delicious desserts
The service was ok both times but the food has been hit or miss first time everything was very good and the chef made the rounds to check on everyone's food
Okay there are some hardcore Mellow Mushroom lovers out there and I get why this place has the most creative and delicious pizza combinations
It sounds weird and possibly gross but it's really yummy -- the pizza is pretty light and the flavors are subtle
You will find great southwestern atmosphere a beautiful patio good service pleasant outdoor service with great views of the mountains plenty of  good food for fussy eaters and lots of history
And with all these questions and concerns I would certainly return since the food is soo tasty
Therefore the little dessert shots are a clever way of keeping dessert also under 475 calories
if you REALLY want good Chinese food here bring someone who can read/speak Chinese and order off the menu
I do know we usually get a dish with bokchoy and mushrooms and a tofu/mushroom dish SO GOOD
Service is fast the bathroom is pretty clean the food is tasty
For a la carte options I recommend the Singapore noodles thin rice noodles stir fried with seafood and bbq pork all in a delicious dry-not saucy yellow curry sauce or any of the chow funs flat wide rice noodles stir fried w a variety of meats/veggies
Come to think of it this location was quicker and more efficient than Arrowhead resulting in hotter fresher food
All the food was fresh; nice generous portion of green leaf lettuce good-as-can-be-expected tomato 2 slices and the waffle fries were in the exact correct place on the delicate Greasy-Crispy Spectrum
But the food is so good that any effort to protest them by not going the rest of the week would be short-lived
When I go in I get the Ice Dream; exactly what part of the cow that is I do not know but it's sad to think they get those cows' hopes up by making them stooges for their EAT MORE CHIKN mock-protest marketing campaign only to steal their dreams from them one way or another and freeze them up for a tasty frozen dessert
The rice dishes are amazing - with wonderful texture and complex taste
I was looking for something approaching good Indian food in the Phoenix area and must say I've found the place
The place was empty at the time Wednesday at 5PM so I was a little nervous but the food was really good
I'd say I'm knowledgeable about their food and let me tell you it's pretty damn amazing
I ate a chicken sandwich at the Farm Kitchen for lunch and couldn't be more pleased it was delicious
The menu carries a good selection the food is fresh and the desserts
This place is that hole in the wall that you are surprised and delighted how good the food after your first mouthwatwering bite
The food is very high quality which you'd never expect
and I have to say I am not too impressed with this place on this trip I ordered the Crudo Burro - Tender machaca beef combined with a spicy light green tomatillo sauce with beans
The beans had no flavor really I covered them with salsa the burro had way to much extra tortilla but the meat in side was really good could have gave me a pile of that on my plate would have been a better meal
The food is good but we don't wait an hour to be treated like that
They have some ok teriyaki white chickenneeds more sauce kind of dry and terribly flavorless chicken fried rice
50/50 chance of getting excellent food vs
Excellent flavor to the meat - sauce could have been a little more spicy though
We ordered Lettuce wraps and the food was cold and I swear the chicken must have been 3 days old
But again the chicken was tough and the soup had no flavor
The play of flavors in this dish was excellent we'd go back here just for this dish alone
This time I had the chicken green chile soup which was delicious full of real chicken flavorful chiles and celery
I also tried the el heffe style on a chicken sandwich which was good
One thing I did think was really cool was the little cinnamon flavored hockey puck you get for dessert
The smoked meat was good however the smoke lasted all day and in to the evening where I was then forced to eat a few TUMS
The smoke flavor to me was so overpowering that the only way to know what you're eating if you close your eyes is by the texture of the meat
The roll was soo delicious and the tea was surprisingly good
the first time just randomly chose the chicken achari and was completely amazed the flavors exploded across my palate with the subtle heat in the finish was like nothing I've ever experienced
I initially thought it was good but maybe not great when I first tried it but found myself going back and trying the pork instead of the beef and that is when I connected with this place
I think that basically they are more of a quality than a quantity place which is a nice thing to see in a place essentially offering fast food but not junk food like at many corporate fast food joints
It doesn't matter if the food is good we weren't even able to get to that point
You can even see and walk over to the gardens and chicken coops where some of the wonderful ingredients come from
The food completely lacks seasoning and flavor
My chicken sandwich was hot fresh and had great toppings
and food that was worth eating again and again
Don't forget the pizza the crust alone is so tasty buttery and herbacious then add all the tasty creative toppings and you've got a pizza masterpiece
The food was so good i'm not even going to remove a star for the flavorless lime mojito
The meat was fresh the bun was delicious and the sauce---yum
Couple the food with live entertainment on the weekend and you've got a recipe for a Cajun good time
My initial reaction was to upgrade my review to a 3 but after further consideration I've decided 4 stars is more appropriate considering the quality and price of the food
But when we finally did the food was great not your regular pub fare and all the beers were wonderful
It's a nice room the service is always good and the food is definitely a notch above most Vietnamese places
I savored my Delux burger and tried my gf's Panini Chicken sandwich - both were delicious
The first time was a year and half ago and was great- good food and service
The second time was about 10 months ago and the food was good but the service was not
The restaurant on site was good fairly quick service decent prices and good food
I wish the food had lived up to how delicious it sounded on the menu
There are plenty of food options within walking distance of the theater hotels & a spring training field
We followed Alfred's recommendations and ordered the more Burmese dishes vs other dishes with greater influence from bordering countries like Thailand and India
Excellent food and service at a great value - we'll definitely be back
Again all the meat was perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked with a wide selection of unbelievably good choices
I haven't fully explored the menu yet but I'd recommend the Chicken Lollipops ya I said that right or the Animal Fries
Just for me the flavors weren't all there on the meat
However I did have the brussell sprouts as a side dish and was not impressed
The quality of the food and flavors are all top notch
I got the seafood soup one which was a bit bland without me adding a bunch of sauces and pepper to it but the beef noodles with oyster sauce that my brother got was quite tasty
Maybe after that they can work on salmon flavored ice cream for a dessert menu
This food was just plain lousy tasteless grotesque cold and supremely awful
Had some chicken-part nuggets dipped in sugar sauces of your choice an Angus burger and the fries were cold gritty and tasteless
If you want good beer and good bar food with good friends and friendly staff then you are good to go
The food is good and it's a different experience
They had a good selection of different foods a TV playing the basketball game that was big enough to see but placed in such a way that it didn't demand attention or take away from the dining
If you're in the area and desperate for Indian food or if your friends want to eat at the nearby Heart Attack Grill and you can't stomach the place this is a good standby restaurant
The Farm has salads sandwiches soups baked goods and desserts but their main emphasis is sandwich
I love ordering their food Thai-Hot thats the hottest you can get here
He really enjoyed it and said it the meat was tender
Their cowboy beans were average at best  My wife had the all white meat fried chicken fairly good and lots of it 3 breasts with the bone deep fried but we had to ask for some gravy twice and then received half a shot glass of tasteless milk and flour white gravy enough to sparely cover one breast
My daughter had a delicious spaghetti and meatball dish we all started with very good fried calamari and my dad and I shared a pizza
Granted with that price came a super tasty plate of mixed sushi options
Later I had the meatball which is good but I the italian is better
The Ahi wonton cups hummus trio and desert ridge summer rolls are amazing as a starter
My tacos dish was the only one that wasn't hot
It's not typical Mexican food it's supposed to be New Mexican food I think; but it's good food that will make you happy
Relative to my expectations the food was amazing
Both the beef and chicken were high-quality nothing was too greasy and despite eating much more than I should have I didn't feel gross after the meal
Judged more objectively the food was good but not great
None of our dishes was particularly flavorful and I was disappointed to find that the Mongolian Beef--billed as spicy on the menu--was utterly bland
The food on the other hand was not delicious
We got wing-in spicy bbq which were TINY with over-cooked stale meat and boneless honey-hot wings
THese were huge strips of white meat chicken and the sauce was tasty
The buffalo chicken sandwich was delicious and the sides were pretty good
OK so they said 'hot breakast' which consists of coffee and a waffle iron but the also have some cold food options such as bagels toast fruit or cereal
While the pepperoni/mushroom pizza and antipasti salad we tried were good they were not Great
My boyfriend and I visited recently and we were super disappointed to find that the food quality has been reduced
Although BJ's does do a good pizza nothing about the restaurant or service really stands out to me
They have mastered this favorite dessert of mine and it is offered in four different flavors
This place has amazing pizza and great service
Special requests don't scare them the service is great and the food is tasty and hot whether you're dining in or taking out
Like Hello Kitty chocolate cookies and fish-flavored corn chips
The BBQ spring rolls also took forever to come but were pretty good
The grilled meat would've tasted good if only they didn't over cook everything not to mention that it came with rice see pic
Making sure everything was good with our food and drinks
We started with medjool dates with chorizo served over a bed of arugula great fresh and hearty flavors and the parsnip and potato fries with mushroom gravy this was the only dish on the bland side
Our main courses were split between the two of us and included the times mac n cheese with lobster incredibly delicious topped with fresh tender lobster meat and the citrus brined fried chicken with white cheddar waffles the waffles were fantastic as was the flavor of the chicken I just was a bit disappointed with the veiny dark purple splotches throughout my thigh piece but the breast and drums were perfect
I've eaten here for a good while and I've never been disappointed with the food
The benefit here is that the service was pretty good but if you're looking for pizza walk on by
We stopped by after our Ikea trip on Saturday and had some seriously delicious food
I ordered the Bistro Classic pizza which was amazing the tomatoes were plentiful and delicious
You're willing to stand out in the hot Arizona sun for an hour for the best pizza ever right
The pizza is absolutely amazing and you will not be disappointed
Some of the other very tasty dishes and appetizers were the scallops bruschetta and mussels
I went right after it first opened and even though it was so shiny and clean and didn't have the urban feel I love so much I can't deny that the food isn't just as delicious
The food was good and I liked the salsa which had quite a kick to it
The food is never why we go here so I am not going to comment on it in this review it is neither good or bad just average
With mediocore food and bad ambience our experience wasn't all that good
Most of all the pizzas are creative fresh and delicious
He even recommended different combinations we should try and was honest about what ingredients we probably should not combine on a build your own pizza
We also got the mushroom pizza with truffle oil solid B+ and a build your own pizza with shrimp speck Gorgonzola ricotta and maybe some other things that I can't remember but it was delicious
They are meaty not breaded with many flavors to choose from
They usually have unique and wonderfully tasty desserts but the carrot cake was just average
My Chicken Slaw Salad was fine good but again not great
The pizza is also pretty good but you can get better other places
Their tarter sauce is also really good important if you like fish and chips
My dad said the food at FEZ is a flavor explosion
ProsGreat Hashbrowns and made from scratch foodGood specials to keep things mixed upGreat company and serviceConsGuy up front says a little over 35 minutes but really means an hour and 45 minutesPricey for some dishesInteresting people around while you wait to get inside street walkers etc
It smelled and tasted fishy not in a good way
Food prices are cheap portions large but quality and taste are not lacking
My mom later claimed that her chicken wasn't very good and my Dad liked his steak OK but nothing to go back for
But if you go go to have a good time around folks also having a good time and don't expect the best food ever
Vincents has a ton of different pizza by the slice all day everyday plus a full menu of appetizers entrees salads and dessert not to mention some family meal deals and they even deliver
I've tried 4 different kinds of pizza the garlic knots which by the way I saw them making and actually hand knotting the dough right there and one of their chicken Parmesan rolls which is the chicken sauce and cheese with dough wrapped around it than baked really really tasty
Naturally good company and a bowl of meaty olives are a given
The Neapolitan style wood-fired pizzas are gooey goodness one and all
The chicken that arrived in the main course was extremely good and the mushrooms that accompanied the chicken were excellent
Yes it will smell like smoke but it is not overwhelming in the least and the pizza they have for appetizers is quite tasty
I have tried most of the pizzas all have been excellent
Basically you'll pay ridiculous prices but the fish quality is actually good
General Tso's chicken like said by others had no spice but was tasty and well prepared
I wasn't impressed by the crab rangoon as I'm usually very critical on that dish as I cook my own Chinese food and normally avoid anything I make myself on a regular basis
It helped that this was right near my old house but even if it wasn't i would have traveled far and wide for Wineburger's fries and beefy goodness
The pizza while thin and crispy is really salty and the starter plates again quality ingrediants but nothing mind blowing
The foodis reasonably priced always served hot and the service is great
They had great free salsas with chips heaps of salads a consistent and attractive wait staff great bartenders and delicious food
Unfortunately they seem to have a hard time keeping some of my favorite items in stock I wonder if this is a result of some of the import restrictions/delays that have been a result of the recent quality issues with food and toys imported from China
The service was attentive and friendly the food was amazing and the prices were reasonable though the bartender encouraged us to order waaaay too much food not that I minded We ordered-Edamame surprisingly large portion-Shishito peppers really good but WAY too large of a portion - I hate wasting food and we only ate like 1/3 of these - only so many peppers you can eat
-Flame Seared Sesame Salmon Nigiri - this was the highlight of the evening - this literally melted in my mouth and tasted so delicious I almost forgot that I was eating sushi in ScottsdaleThe service was really great - we sat at the bar which was large and spacious
I might end up buying some bottles because I thought they were so tasty- the staff knows their stuff- the caprese was great- it has a very laid back attitude when wineries and wine tasting usually exudes this air of elitism- would be cool to have a private party here which they do a lot of- tasting 5 wines for $10 is pretty awesomeCons- it is kinda weird to be the only people in the place no matter what day or time it is- i don't need to watch you put on rubber gloves and make my food you can do that in the back
the food was good not unlike food that you could obtain at scores of other places around town
I couldn't finish it; there were two whole chicken breats a mountain of *amazing* fries and a fat slice of watermelon
If I wanted amazing sushi then I wouldnt have gone there - I would have spent a $100 at an expensive sushi bar
BUT I was craving eel sauce and ginger and plain old sushi and I was on a budget- It was delicious and didnt disappoint for the amount of money I was spending
That included appetizers sides and sushi- 5 rolls
The infinity pool was gorgeous the bar and its big fire pits incredibly sexy and the food was good too
But how can food not be good when you're sitting outside on a gorgeous terrace looking out over the desert or back up toward the mountain
A really nice Chinese restaurant in Arizona  It was recommended by people in my Chinese church and it makes me feel like home Hong Kong every time I go there the food the music the people
Their sushi not so good but decent when you're looking for $3 rolls for happy hour
A couple words can easily describe my review on Malee's oily food cold & incorrect orders and a cockroach
My fiance and I are frequent Thai eaters so I thought I would be a good opportunity to get some great food at a discount
Although both dishes were somewhat tasty they simply didn't hit the mark
The burgers and BBQ chicken sandwiches at The Chuck Box are DELICIOUS
Despite the streams of sweat that were rolling down my temples the noodles were delicious
I highly recommend this place if you're in the area and love authentic Thai food
We usually split a few appetizers and share a bread pudding dessert which is more than enough for dinner
They are absolutely fantastic; the meat is extremely tender and flavorful
She had also suggested the Ribs which we probably should have ordered too instead of the tillapia ---- the fish was good but just not as wow as the other food on our plates
Anyway we were hungry so we decided a pizza sounded good
Nello's is in the same shopping center so we decided a pizza sounded good - plus they had beer
My wife really enjoyed the spinach salad; and the pizza toppings were above average
We had a caramel macaroon which tasted like a crack-based sugar cookie an almond croissant which was a bit lemony cinnamon butter roll-ball things essentially donut holes and a chocolate cookie which was hardish but somehow still addictively delicious
Aside from the quality of their food and coffee drinks the staff is nothing short of amazing
I wouldn't necessarily recommend the place solely on the food or atmosphere but it was a nice spot overall
The flavors of all the dishes I sampled blew my brains and the cost to quality was insane which means the food quality is excellent and the price is insanely cheap
They must get a lot of business otherwise I cant see how they can make any money turning out this amazing food at such a low cost
Now before you judge about the orange chicken F U it was amazing this isn't panda express this is high quality deep fried and battered chicken
the good for kids part I would say yes as far as the setting but I don't know a lot of kids who like Thai food
And not just that was a good meal great everything was tasting perfect had great texture and the owner answered any questions I had about the food
If you are in the mood for some perfect Mexican food and want to try something just a little bit different head on down and get some amazing food
Meh on the enchiladas and the red chili beef's flavors were too muddied
To start it's clear that the owner Bill who also owns Copper Star Coffee really cares about this joint the people he serves and the quality of the food
Also I am not opposed to paying for food that worth it but this BJ's I could not justify anything
Go to metro center now they have a wonderful food court
I can come with friends hang out have some delicious pizza and of course finish with some gelato
the food was quite good and probably would have been even better if we wouldn't have needed to wolf it down
Bullet points to the rescue The Good -Nice server and prompt service -Good ambiance -Great patio -2 of 4 meals were excellent The Bad -Sub-par carnitas--overcooked cold and no flavor to top it off -Bad fish tacos--cold and not much going on The Ugly -Plumbing issues in the bathroom
Desserts were tasty but very standard steakhouse fare - carrot cake ice cream sundae warm chocolate cake
That's probably true considering the number of people out here who think Ra's sushi has something to offer other than the legions of hot waitresses
I ordered the Roy's Trio and it was excellent especially the butterfish
The cheese sauce and the calamari were good but lets be honest here almost any similar deep fried or creamy fatty foods would be delicious
Overall it's good but I would say a bit over priced and some of the heat of the dishes takes away from the flavor
BUT the food is simply great and worth waiting for
Presentation was great but the food was missing the real Thai flavors & covered with tons of sodium-rich sauce & oil
The service is always fast I always use the drive-through and my food has been hot and fresh every time
Ive not been inside so I cant speak for that aspect but the service and food quality is above average in my opinion for McDonalds
This place is so good the rice is fantastic the food is very good
The pizza was thin crisp greasy and delicious
Although the food and beer were good the service kind of sucked
if you enjoy delicious mexican food at a great value try si senior
they have an extensive menu tasty dishes and it's a family environment
dessert is included with dinner it's a freshly made puffed pastry so beware it's served piping hot but its lite and delicious
On top of how good the food is their customer service is excellent
The food was delicious I love their fries
In the most unexpected of downtown areas this cafe blends in on the outside but stands out with it's relatively classy interior and of course with it's delicious food
My brother had some meat dish but as a side were chipotle fries which were golden on the outside and the inside quite possibly some of the most delicious fries I've eaten
I had half of it the ingredients were fresh the beef wasn't spectacularly seasoned but it was good nonetheless
All of Elmer's burritos are good - big soft flour tortillas wrapped around savory bits of spicy meat and creamy smooth beans
This dish is neither complicated nor gourmet but it is tasty satisfying and comforting
We also ordered a volcano roll and a rainbow roll the rainbow roll wasn't that good the shrimp on it was chewy and the avocado tasted a bit old
And the mustard sauce that accompanied it made a delicious piece of meat even more amazing
As good as it gets for South Indian food here; Indian authentic would of course be much better
I definitely recommend trying the Carnitas Burrito chimi style and my husband absolutely loves the Chicken Burritos az style
Heck even Guy Fieri dishes out only good things to say about this place
I love love love the chicken & hummus appetizer
I always leave this place feeling rejuvenated and healthy - you can FEEL this food is good for your body heart and mind
If you're looking for a pub-like restaurant that has good prices pretty tasty food with a good variety of items on the menu and excellent cocktails Keegan's is your place
They carry a wide variety of good quality dog and cat foods
The meat was lean and flavorful however tasted very charred
Some of the inner pieces tasted good though the meat was seasoned with too much salt
The food was okay - I kept thinking This would be really good with
The pizza is WONDERFUL and so are the salads
Highly recommended for the casual atmosphere fast service great food
They both found the dishes quite tasty and easy on the stomachs with only the complaint of the sanbusek's small portion size
For dessert we had a frighteningly tasty coconut custard dish with sweet sticky rice
If this pizza was not as good I would be angry I think
The restaurant is family owned with fast tasty home style food and friendly service
I have not been there in a while but when I went I got grilled lemon chicken with hummus and it was so tasty
Have always enjoyed the food and they are good with soft drink refills
The display cases showcased all the delicious pastries cakes and salads and I like the fact you can watch the cooks make all the sandwiches flatbread pizza etc right in front of you
I've had so many chicken and egg salads that are over flavored but this one was just right
I eat at plenty of places with just-okay quality of food but I go back because of the atmosphere or service
I could get the same quality and half the price at Food City no joke
and I love their fries when I feel like indulging but love that they have side salads and fruit to choose from too if I feel like being good Their dessert is probably my favorite part though
I have nothing to complain about regarding the food itself - for me it has consistently been good the servings ample and the prices reasonable
I love char grilled food so I enjoyed my hot dogs
Beer is still good but now the food is really good
The lunch special started with a chicken vegetable soup that was really simple and tasty
Food was tasty just the right amount of spice and served with a small egg roll
I had the leftovers today for lunch and it was another full meal's worth of food plus the noodles had absorbed all that extra gravy overnight so it was even tastier today than it was yesterday
Good selection of food and the non-stop Mimosa's are a nice touch
For our visit they had two salad selections a few unique appetizers belgian waffles made-to-order omelettes roast beef crab legs a very good sea bass and plenty of sweets just to mention the highlights
First the food is staged in the lobby of the hotel with the dining areas off to the side
There are just too many good things to choose from and even with small portions from each tray I had to skip several dishes because I had gotten too full from all the tasty stuff I've taken
They also have a centrally-located area for sushi good sushi - for a buffet that scores major points and edamame and the main buffet area also offers crispy veggie tempura to complement your sushi if you feel like giving your meal a Japanese slant
I enjoyed the seafood dishes a lot especially the poached fish dishes and the clams
They have many amazing dishes there I can't say which one I like best
and also they have a great appetizer that is a tomato stuffed with either tuna or chicken salad
Anyway it didn't go to waste and boyfriend enjoyed it enough to eat that dish too
I usually order green chicken curry and it's always consistently good although I can't see how you can mess up a curry dish
I recently tried their seafood combo and the broth was so good
I usually order a 2 but I have experienced my 2 dish being hotter than a 4 dish
Three of us girls rolled out late on Sunday morning and enjoyed the practically empty Cheesecake Factory by the Superstition Springs Mall out in East Mesa
The food of which I've had the scramble noodle kugel honey cheesecake chicken sliders style of bread is too hard pear+pecan salad is all DELICIOUS
With $1 sake and 1/2 of many rolls nigiri and appetizers it's worth eating here from 4-7 or for a late night sushi fix during reverse happy hour
The sushi itself is palatable which is why it's only really worth it to go during happy hour
If reminding myself that cheap sushi and a good buzz is worth it doesn't work I'll cut happy hour short and probably won't return for another few months
We shared plantain and avocado spring rolls for an appetizer excellent
I can't get over the no-frills cafe-esque atmosphere with purely good veg head food
From the most amazing jalapeno cheddar grits to the banana split we shared for dessert
I could tell it was good quality meat but when it's too cooked I just can't enjoy it as much
Dustin was our server for the evening and we enjoyed all the info he shared about the ingredients in the food and the wines
I still love the place I'm still glad it exists the service is superior and I love the use of wonderful-tasting fresh local ingredients but that dessert didn't work
Thank goodness for the other 7 courses including a whole fish we picked clean
In spite of the poor dessert choices this time around I'm convinced that people who think their food is overpriced or overrated have poor palates and probably rarely venture outside of chain restaurants where the food is laden with corn syrup MSG and other fake flavors
I get the orange chicken like so many other people- and it's delicious
The meat was cooked perfectly and full of flavor even with no sauce which they charge $3 for
Started with Fire Cracker Shrimp Crispy Calamari and Wings as appetizers the wings were DEFINITELY my favorite though all were great then moved on to the spring rolls filled with Tuna Soft-Shelled Crab and Shrimp
There are far too many other restaurants with fantastic delicious food and tasty drinks PLUS FRIENDLY accommodating staff
I also get the entree add on which consists of an egg roll 2 crab puffs and your choice of won ton soup or egg drop soup for a small added fee as it is worth it
Two Hippies also can make any of the taco flavors into a burrito like the Red Beef $5
The fish was so strong I could only manage a few bites even with the delicious red salsa it couldn't help that poor fish
The chicken taco was a chicken taco good with a nice balance of veggies and meat
Beach House also serves up several different topped all beef hot dogs
I'm not sure where they get their hot dogs but the meat in this one was just so tasty the toppings only added to my pleasure
One waiter as we paid our bill inexpensive by the way- $30 for drinks appetizer 2 entrees and dessert said that this is the only restaurant he's ever worked in that he still wants to eat the food at the end of the night
I was a little disappointed because I didn't expect a fast food place but the service was great and the food was very good
We also sampled some HH foods which were half off-Deviled Eggs pretty simple and tasty-Cheese Plate with manchego and gouda grapes and caramelized pears
good for quick grub at lunchtime in North ScottsdaleLunch was good I had the chicken club - the service was brisk and friendly shocker fair prices and the du00e9cor is excellent - has a genuine Irish Pub feel to it
Though this restaurant isn't quite as good as Green I'm biased toward American-style food anyway its food is unique tasty and inexpensive
Now for the food; the spaetzle had no flavor the duck was way over cooked and the sauces were lackluster
Not only was there not much buffalo flavor there really wasn't that much food
and the quality of food has really gone downhill as time has passed
Friendly service cool atmosphere and really good food - and I definitely felt like we got our money's worth
Food highlights were the Escargots & Braised Short Ribs and a truly excellent wine list
its a funky small cozy space with a good HH and good HH food tough combo
Been here at least 4 times the last time we were in they did not have the wonderful spring rolls
I do care about good service and good food which are two things you will get at AT
The new flatbread pizza appetizers are quite good and although the pizza isn't a traditional Chicago thick crust it still makes for a good thick crust pizza
this place has good food good service and yes quaint if you like that grandma house thing w/lots of kitch
The Teriyaki Beef Bowl & the fried dumplings Gyoza are very good and very reasonably priced
The Panko Fish is also quite tasty but I've had better fish at other nearby places like Karim's so I wouldn't bother to go to Blue Fin for fish
I've also had the Chicken Teriyaki Bowl before but didn't find it too tasty
Generally I am not a fan of big franchise concepts but I have to say that the quality of the food was excellent considering it comes out of  a system kitchen
At first I was not so sure about Carne Asada on a Pizza but it was surprisingly good
The Thai Crunch Salad was quite good as well and probably for the first time I noticed that all the ingredients mentioned on a menu item were actually in the dish
This is an easy place to get good traditional Mexican food for lunch
I usually get the beef taco combo which is consistently good and includes moist refried beans and rice
The food was pretty darn tootin' good too but the beer
While being busy is usually a sign of being good I just don't enjoy ordering my food and then waiting around for a table plus a couple of times I had the wrong food brought to me and it took a while to flag someone to correct it
The place is really nice great ambience and the food is very good
- The food was a festival of deep-fried artery-hardening goodness that you can only find at fairs and some sports events
It's a little pricey for pizza but when you order it fresh it's worth it
I recommend any of the specialty pizzas my favorite is the classic American or the calzones
The food has a lot of flavor and is well prepared without it being heavy
The Bad -The food really isn't very good
The food was delicious and everyone was happy
The quality of the food redeemed D&C's from my first visit in 2003 when I had their ribs and found them wanting
The lemonades are delicious the guacamole is ok needs a little flavor  but the other food is good
I've visited this spot a few times via friend recommendation on the food
Overall I would love to come back and would recommend this place to anyone who likes some good fried chicken
So you know they're good if Whole Foods is sellin' em
Flavorless rice beans were salty the enchiladas had some kind of dense stringy beef-like dry substance inside with canned enchilada sauce
I am a very simple eater I like good food and want it to be reasonably priced
I also tried the Jadori chicken and it too was wonderful I had not ordered it - it was half a chicken and I would have ended up with it in my lap
The Italian wedding soup with a meat ball is so tasty
The Big Ravioli is really good and stuffed with lots or cheese meat and topped with marinara sauce
We had some chicken enchiladas with green sauce on the recommendation of our server
The quality of food the variety and the cost you can not beat
I usually finish my food because it's delicious but I barely ate half at this place
The drinks are excellent and the food is great a little rich and over priced in some areas
The food steak wrap was very tasty as well
In sum the food and beer were excellent but this particular waitress was terrible
The food is good very unique and the employees family are super friendly
A lot of dishes take 30+ minutes but thats what good not-premade family crafted food takes
All of the main dishes I've tried were good cabbage rolls schnitzel etc
Really good food with wonderful views above the lake
The food is tasty and the service is exactly right
the lemongrass chicken cant remember the full title was amazing
we had this other thing where they bring you the hot stone and you cook your own meat
it was alright but the stone only stayed hot enough to cook the meat med rare
First class service caring staff and excellent food
Savory thin-sliced beef cooked in a flavorful Au Jus then stuffed into a delicious Italian roll
i love that my food always comes out right and that my server checks back a few times after we get our food to make sure all is still good
I typically blend meats for my burgers and add herbs spices etc to enhance the flavor
My bottom line is this will be a nice neighborhood hangout with a great bar and well above average food for a bar but it's not worth a drive
There were good sized chunks of tender beef in the burrito a ton of cheese on top extra sauce all over and generous dollops of guac and sour cream on the side
The pizza at Humble Pie is unique but has such a good crust it's unbelievable
The last time we were here we have the pizza cookie and it also was amazing
I spend summers in Oregon and the food truck craze there is amazing
I had the spicy tuna roll and the flavor was just blah
Food is good though not the best I have ever eaten
Seaweed salad = good tasted just like one from our local sushi restaurant in Modesto
some of the rolls and appetizers are also 1/2 off but did not show up on our bill
Catepillar roll yellowtail nigiri and gojira roll were good but nothing spectacular
The salad was disgusting and wilted but the rest of the food was pretty tasty
Mimi's may be a chain but for all that the food is quite good and reasonably priced
Great food plenty of sitting room good lighting and friendly staff
Even good restaurants these days fall short of truly inspired flavor and this dish loaded with fresh seafood in a delicate yet savory broth was just amazing
The food is amazing the room has snap but it all comes together with a diverse crowd unassuming yet hip I hate that word
Their croissants especially pain au chocolat are truly five-star and the rest of the food is generally good but I'm still quite wary of the staff
Meat is so soft and tender and flavors are WOW
Owner says he only uses fresh and high quality meat
The lunch I had here was delightful but the wonderful company Rand H and Mike C  and the pleasant atmosphere of the establishment are probably more responsible for that perception than the food itself
I found the quality of the food here to vary greatly from one dish to another
There was a chicken-and-mushroom dish that was truly spectacular and  there were two kinds of fish one fried the other poached both good; and this for me is truly a plus as not too many Chinese buffets serve fish
Most of the other dishes were adequate and the desserts were mediocre and of store-bought quality
The food here is good but I hate the wait
My husband Joe also likes the basil chicken but he doesn't order it as hot as I do
This place has amazing food separate menus for lunch and dinner and a full bar
I am not normally a chicken taco kind of gal but I found this chicken to be wonderful
I just ate the chicken out of the tortilla but I am sure it would b good wrapped in the blue get it
Next time I think we will split an entree and try a dessert or appetizer as well
While i was there i noticed that the bartender kept making shots and serving them to the old dude that was making the food
But I hope that more of their $9 - $10 sandwiches feature more than just dry and pretty flavorless meat thrown onto some bread and sent off to the customer without a second thought
The produce is always fresh they have an interesting selection of frozen items including some great appetizers the meat department is outstanding - I've tried a few different kabobs from here spicy kabob rocks bakery is great nice selection of hard to find dairy items like fig yogurt fair cheese selection including a local fresh burrata and mozzarella that will knock your socks off excellent selection of wines and craft beer and a floral department that has exquisite arrangements
Every entree is served with a bowl of soup a generous portion of rice and a small but tasty eggroll
Their bathrooms are awesome and unisex so European ha ha and on both occasions that I've eaten there the food has been delicious and fast
Quality meats that are don't right with a good rub and slow cooked with a delicious bbq sauce
Its a house blend of sausage wraped in bacon and deep fried served in a very good roll topped with sweet & hot jalepenosonions & bbq sauce
I believe we also tried the truffled mac and cheese and a spicy ahi tuna roll which were very good
Add on a few drinks between the two of us and it was SO MUCH FOOD BUT OMGAHD SO GOOD
They sell a very good Chicken Caesar Wrap which my wife enjoyed
If you are in the north Scottsdale area and looking for quality quick chicken definitely check this place out you will not be disappointed
Jerk chicken was close in the race but something told me I wanted the good stuff
Their bakery is out of this world their food is very good tacos tacos tacos
It was my boyfriends birthday and we were trying to find a new pizza place worthy of us not going to oreganos anymore
I can't recommend the food here highly enough
Also the pricing is very reasonable for the quality of the food and service
The beef sandwich at this location was just really not that tasty and the fries were very limp and greasy
They offer a decent sized menu of desserts and hot food but with a name like Sugar Bowl it is obvious that this place specializes in sweets
Everything on the dessert menu sounds delicious
My husband ordered a beef with hot peppers giardiniera and they were far from hot
The pizza was very good but not amazing
The place has been there for a long time and serves consistently good sushi
The cost is cheap but it should be cheaper considering the quality of food is so poor and the taste is so bland
Luckily I had a sense of humor so when I ate it I said Man this is so disgusting that its good  All I am saying is if you like good cheap hole in the wall type food this place is not for you
Tasty tender thigh meat topped with veggies and cheese
The food was authentic and delicious- best Italian food I've had in the Phoenix area- maybe in the U
Needless to say we had to be rolled out but it was amazing and I will definitely be back soon
I highly recommend also taking their all you can eat sushi making class if you are looking for something fun to do
The food's pretty good the music is always substantially better than anywhere else I go and I'd rather look at hipsters than Scottsdale folk
The Fish was bit over cooked and too firm the beans and sauce lacked much flavor
Overall the service level was very good and the food in my opinion was also above average
Today my wife and I opted for an entree we'd never ordered before the Bourbon Street Chicken & Shrimp with a side of broccoli and Spinach and Artichoke dip for the appetizer
The shrimp were delicious and the chicken was AMAZING
We asked for our daughters sake if we could have her food first after the appetizer and that did not occur
The food is good and they really do a great job offering a lot of vegetarian choices
We orderedAntipasto - My bf's favorite vegetables were roasted perfectlyRosa Pizza - My favorite the red onions were not overpowering and the crunch of the pistachios were greatWiseGuy Pizza - Sister and bf preferred this one over the Rosa the Fennel Sausage was very flavorfulThe wait is a bit ridiculous
The newly remodeled restaurant puts out wonderful and consistent Vietnamese and Chinese dishes
The egg rolls are delicious wrapped in green lettuce dipped in fish sauce
Every dish I have ordered so far has been delicious and satisfying
The talent in the kitchen is apparent in the complex flavors found in some of the simpler items found here such as the amazing cornmeal laden bread and the perfect meatballs
I had a beer a shot and a DELICIOUS Italian Chicken salad
They gave us a dessert on the house and we called it good
As always the gyro was stuffed full of meat and had great flavor
Loved the semolina thin crust and the duck confit gave the entree a great smoky flavor-- I thought perhaps there were lardons included in this dish too but all the smokiness came from the duck
Excellent dessert-- I totally recommend
The amount of chicken on the two taco plate was amazing for $6
Though the food was good I found it overpriced and certainly the charm you would expect from a neighborhood hangout like the Havana Cafe was totally missing
I had been to another location and while the food was acceptable there not good just acceptable it was HORRIBLE here
This is a cute little restaurant - and yes the apple tart we had for dessert was delicious
the man had the filet and i ordered the lamb what else - while the food was tasty i wasn't exactly blown away
The chicken glaze was different and was so good and really could stop to think of what ingredient might have made its mightiness
I don't know how a pizza place that that been on tv stayed such a west-side secret but this place has and it's amazing
The food is excellent carefully prepared quality ingredients
I think if you're hanging with the boys tonight for happy hour I would recommend this place -- otherwise go elsewhere for food
As for the food it was actually pretty good
The BF got a grass fed burger with cheddar and it was really tasty the meat was very good and the burger was a good size
If you want the quality of a fast food burger and fries but want a nice place to eat at
The wait for the food was average and pricing compared to others is slightly higher but it is very much worth it
It is truly a hidden gem good food humble restaurant and great food
How could someone that doesn't love America give us such wonderful food
After the National Anthem finished playing it always plays every time I eat there but this particular time I was solo I was serve a Lebanese beer Almaza or something like that that the owner recommended to go with my dish which he also recommended
Going out for good food when ever the urge strikes you is one and strippers is the other
Where can an ASU student get some healthy food that actually tastes good on campus
None of the food was hot and only when the seafood was pushed off my enchiladas was i able to choke them down
I love the stuffed pizza burger it's a pretty amazing take on the classic American burger
The one that let's you think that ordering FRIED Calamari with artichokes FRIED catfish I think and FRIED Alligator is a good idea
Yes it tasted like chicken and it was delicious
It's just a neighborhood diner/restaurant where you will see your regulars the wait staff hanging on their days off and oh yea just plain good unpretentious food just like the decor and patron
But the flavors were just like I've had it in France great dish
such a blast the food was great I split the BIG UNIT with two other people it was really delicious and the toppings were awesome
Really good Mexican food should have certain characteristics and Los has mastered all of themThe salsa is amazing spicy chunky and full of flavor
They have pretty good prices for food but maybe there's a reason
But who really cares about du00e9cor if the food is good right
The service was good and the food was decent
I was hesitant to try the smelly old fish from last week but someone ordered it and shared and it was super duper tasty
If the meat doesn't have any flavor why does anyone believe that a good salt lick is the way to go
Sure it's easy to look down on everyone who thinks they've had good sushi after eating at Ra or Zen 32 - but forgive them this is Phoenix and they're still learning about sushi and that's okay
In fact you'll be surprised at how awesomely fresh clean and flat out delicious your food will be
If it's just you and a friend I'd definitely recommend sitting at the bar and not only watch the sushi chefs work but actually talk with them
The sushi rolls are always consistently good but the thing that lacks is service
For cooked seafood in Arizona this is as good as it gets
We've enjoyed the following dishes- Scallop in cream sauce with crab/shrimp Perfect dish esp
Rock 'n roll and blues cover the guys are damn good
Even though the place was packed our food came quickly and was piping hot
The menu is small but i have had various items on it from the steak sandwich The Ribs Chicken Fried Steak and the Burger and they are all worthy of the 5 star
its a bit pricey but you get plenty of high quality food for your dollar
The food is actually pretty good for AZ standards that is
As for food we got the free guacamole by checking in and it was really delicious
The ingredients are fresh and the meat is top quality
Since then we have been here 2 times and both times the service has been fast and the food delicious
The food is fresh and tasty - for both breakfast and lunch
I tried a bite and it was really good - it wasn't fishy tasting and the plating looked really nice
I surprisingly enjoyed my pizza and my friend seemed to enjoy his as well
This used to be one of three Indian food places I enjoyed in AZ  5 years ago
The food well papadam was great cheese pakora was good but I felt like it was lacking in flavor
I didn't have any but my date said the chicken tikka misala was amazing
Chicken picatta was excellent with tangy lemon caper sauce
Will go again and recommend to any one with taste for Italian food
I wasn't a fan of the pate' but it was a combination of pickle horseradish and mustard flavors with chunks in the loaf
All in all we had a wonderful night with fabulous food and fun friends and we didn't want the night to end
-Great food large portions and fresh ingredients-Best bacon I have ever had-Friendly Staff and excellent service-Small venue-Long wait if you don't arrive early If you come solo wait is much shorterIf I ever get back to Phoenix I will be go straight to Matt's
We ordered a lot of food and shared with each other and I have to say that everything I tried was really good
I had the margarita pizza which was good my friends had a pasta with chicken and they loved it as well
So if you are traveling with children aren't fast on your feet or want time to grab some food I would recommend booking flights that have a longer connection time
Black And Bleu Quesadilla - A+Blackened Fish Tacos - C Chips - A+Salsa - AI will be back to this spot for sure an all around great place for a good meal
The place lighting and food - all excellent
I do appreciate that the beans are lard free and the margaritas are surprisingly good they are in one of those margarita machines so I had my doubts but the food has been just - ok
It was amazing that it was an appetizer as  it was a whole rectangular pizza
I had the beef with bacon swiss lettuce and jalapeno aioli and it was very tasty
+1 for the great food +1 for a good mix of music -2 for lousy/slow service that started in the kitchen
The beef was so moist and tender and the pastry wasn't sweet but had a wonderful savory quality
Now there were 15 main food selections for everyone to reach in front of each other to get including Huevos Rancheros cheese enchiladas Chile Verde chorizo Santa Fe Chicken sausage bacon beans & rice of course & much more plus a good number of toppings available but no salad or soup
life is good exceptional food is bliss and Kai should be a goal for everyone to splurge on
She is nice and attentive and the food is good
Besides the Pho and the lemongrass chicken I haven't been too impressed with the other menu items
Otherwise I just can't say enough good things about their pizza
Had a grilled chicken sandwich on sesame seed roll it was really good
She said the mac and cheese with blackened chicken was amazing so I went for it
Was I supposed to use the white sauce or the red sauce to flavor the fish
I was very impressed with how well the food tasted here
I had the spicy chicken my wife had the honey chicken and both were excellent
The bass is grilled to a near char -- yet beneath the skin the meat is white moist and flavorful
All that changed once we got a good dose of the service and food
The pizza bread according to her was delicious
In general we have found the food to be good though at times inconsistent and unexceptional but acceptable when in the area not a destination eatery we'd drive to otherwise
The other pizza was good all of the peppers and onions made it sweeter and I wish the sausage and pepperoni would have added some spicy/saltiness to the pizza to balance that out
If it is too spicy you can't taste the food quality right
In a nutshell food is good service bad spicy factor too much
their food options were exceptionally tasty and would be a dining option even if you didn't go to the museum itself
I wasn't expecting such good food from here
Food quality was also 5 of 5Pricing was great too
I have no complaints about this place service was great food was good and happy hour prices were decent
The vesuvius calzone/pizza thing truly is a giant volcano of deliciousness
