What I enjoy most is their meat selection and the fact that they have a generous helping of not too tart italian dressing and mayo on their subs

During one restaurant week several years ago I was served overcooked chicken on what could only have been canned peas and corn-we never went back for the regular menu I was impressed by Lon's
he made a personal choice to eat the fried but I think there has to be some portion planning on the chef's part as well or at least a warning Caution you will not be interested in any other food item after consumption of the calamari
It's a funky artsy place with healthy food that tastes good and a huge selection of food and drink
The cheese steaks are the focus of the menu with sandwiches and typical bar food

Nothing on the menu was less then $11 for a combo dish
The prices on the wine are great but the menu is a bit confusing and the food has potential but it needs allot of work
What Panne Bianco gets right is -quick polite but personalized service-a great short menu with no surprises-great to go options-big portions when a sandwich and a drink cost $12 it better be good-close to my work wishing they would move into my work's cafe space-its right by lux-its food that any single person could make at home with a sandwich press but doesn't b/c high quality bread and the like go bad too soonthe somewhat bad-wierd hours and parkingkinda high pricesno place to sit and wait

Some things that shine as stars on the menu* the hummus - served with fresh veggies and house made nan* barley soup when it is one of the daily soups - this stuff is loaded with vegetables and barley* angel hair feta or spicy chicken garden salad - both are HUGE and crammed full of the most amazing organic vegetables found in phx then lightly tossed in the house dressing that is crisp and brings out the flavors of every ingredient*purple shoots - asparagus and eggplant topped with sautu00e9ed onions garlic scallion tomatoes fresh herbs lemon juice and feta cheese*herb stew with chicken - I don't even know how to describe this one but it truly rocks

The menu might look giant but all the dishes are just slight variations of each other
All that being said;PROS great chips and salsa              usually great servers               managers have been very pleasant and accomodatingCONS  decline in food quality               hostesses are not very friendly               menus always feel very oilyI think that we will probably try a different Arriba's location in the future
I usually only review a place that is exceptional or poor but since the choices for good Chinese food are so scant in the valley one has to make concessions

Originally the size of the piece of fish on top of the nigiri was quite small
I will most likely avoid the specialty rolls as I didn't particularly care for either of them and they are normally $10+ on the menu

Add mine to the list of 'damn the food is good here' [as long as you order the right thing] and the guacamole is delish

They pretty much follow a recent trend in keeping the menu simple with only Ribeye steak or Chicken for the philly sandwich some pizzas hogies wings and other stuff

Both the fried rice on my husband's dish and the stir fried noodles in my selection had a strong fishy smell and taste
I'm not sure if the free food buffet they had was a true sample of their menu or not
I was impressed by the variety of food they had available most notably the Teriyaki beef which is among the best I have ever tasted
An Asian grocery the size of a Wal-Mart is pretty awe-inspiring all by itself but there's really much much more to Lee Lee than aisles of noodles and spices and lentils and rices though they do have these as well in spades as well as all the requisite weird seafood and meat products that make Asian groceries so damn fun

The selection is everything from BBQ chicken and fries to a sushi & tempora stand Mongolian wok plenty of sea food crab legs 15 different kinds of shrimp all you favorite Chinese buffet items and some strange surprises
Their food selection isn't that large so the only thing I've tried was their cheese and cracker platter which was perfect to snack on

The food portions are very large so we have started ordering off of the a la cart menu
Before you go and lose all respect for me keep in mind this is coming from a vegetarian's perspective whose choices at most chain restaurants are a salad with iceberg lettuce drenched in dressing with more calories than super sized fries at Mickey D's and a minestrone soup that may or may not be made with beef broth

Dessert was the farina with apple dish different just OK tres leche cake very good and apple cobbler again good but small portion

The roll menu is quite limited but all are good including the salmon skin which was my first experience

There was a much smaller food menu available but they are Ready-N-Rolling Rock-n-Roll Rest-N-Relaxation pick one or make up your own definition
Since we had another dessert choice in mind we took it home
Changs there is a great variety in food and in price ranges as well
It sounds like it is a heavy pizza gut bomb but this pizza was not since all the meats were thinly sliced but generously portioned
Apparently they used to have this ravioli dish that was amazing but for some reason they took it off the menu which greatly disappointed my husband so I'm docking a star for that
There's a nice list of lunch specials to choose from and you'll have your soup and spring roll the minute you sit down and a gigantic drink so you're never waiting on refills
Yes the prices are a bit high compared to serving size but I felt it was worth it given the complexity of the recipes and the fact that this ice cream parlor needs a liquor license Desserts in sit-down restaurants cost considerably more and are not usually as good as this ice cream
Overall I have to say the food I had was good and I do look forward to trying other menu items in the future
I knew some of the names of things as did our waiter but when I ordered by reciting the description of my selection both he and I kind of rolled our eyes at the ridiculousness of the situation
The sushi quality and variety wasn't bad either
The service is great and the selection of food outside of sushi is large as well
They definitely cater to a variety of tastes so if you aren't in the mood for sushi you can still find great food to satisfy you
aside from the line and it taking 10 minutes to get our name on the list the food was definitely worth the wait
The only problem that I have with Arrowhead is that it's lacking variety and pizzazz

This Korean owned market has a good selection of Korean Vietnamese and Indian foods
The selection of fish was good the fish looked very fresh and it was clean well organized

Would give it a higher rating if it either the food portions were bigger or the prices were cheaper
There was a pizza and wine special every Weds apparently but we opted to go order from the menu as i had pizza for lunch
I ordered a dish on the new menu a lot more options than before that came with a short description in English and had a photo next to it
I also like that they have a vast menu so even people who are not comfortable with sushi can still find something they will enjoy
Very small portion of edamame and fairly tasteless spring rolls
We had a set menu due to our party size but from the looks of everyone's faces while dining I got the impression that everyone liked their food
This is an upscale pizza place with a large gluten-free menu
Two decently sized crab cakes made with jumbo lump blue crab meat
I'm sure there's some good desserts at Ruth's Chris but we didn't even look at the menu
KILLER dessert and wonderful selection of draft beer
If you want to venture away from the burgers on the menu I suggest getting the grilled cheese and adding chicken and bacon to it
From the wood fired pizza to the delectable salads everything on the menu is worth every penny
I stopped by for lunch on Saturday and hadSpring rollsKatheaw Cha large flat rice noodles stir fried with Katna broccoli carrots beef and shrimpTamarind-based soup forget the name and I can't find it on the online menu - I think it had lemongrass and a little bit of coconut milk for creamy texturePoat Ang roasted corn dessertThe pace of the meal was a little slower than what I'm used to but the servers brother & sister team were warm/attentive and the food was delicious
The menu was pretty extensive but when I saw I could have nothing vegetarian on their appetizer menu I knew it could end up being a Tums night so I didn't give birth to a food baby in the early morn-translation-almost all was gonna have meat in it even if they took it out
They have a wonderful selection of meats and do not charge you extra to replace meats in the combination plates like other places
They have quite a diverse menu and serve many different dishes
Well we all  went to a going away party here at Casey Moore's Oyster House and the place was fairly nice lots of security around  but very limited parking we parked a few blocks away and had to walk in food was good but my onion soup was way to salty though and the dip sandwich was by far the worst item to order on the menu just sliced meat and bread  and I had order it
They have a decent beer selection where I was happy to see the Dogfish Head IPA on tap
We ordered the apple galette for dessert and I envisioned the french tart with the flaky crust and caramelized apples glistening atop
In all fairness I think some of the other dessert choices would have been more unique to St
It has a wide variety of foods and other products
Was hoping for another sushi joint to add to the list but not sure this will be it
I was quite surprised to find a really nice extensive menu with very tasty dishes
i got an email with a note about the newly added happy hour menu both regular and reverse and was excited to go try a sampling of the artistic sushi i savored over while reading reviews and sampling experiences in the local zines
The menu offers unique and elegant dishes that excite the palate
Portions are elegantly presented and leave you satisfied - yet allow room for dessert
I love chicken strips so I was thinking this would be like the In and Out Burger of chicken strips- simplified menu for an amazing food product
We had steak pork chicken fish and portabello mushroom as our menu options
Went during lunch with my colleagues so could not try off their wine/liquor list but the food and decor did not fail us
My biggest criticism however would have to be its incredibly unhealthy take-and-go food selection
My hubster ordered beef lazy tacos and I had the waitress surprise me with anything off the gluten free menu except salmon
Would it be so hard for them to put a combo-type offering on the menu so you get an entree platter with a side dish
Had it dozens of times and with only one exception it was always crisp and fresh with great variety in veg/meat/cheese
Other than the food they have a limited selection of vegan groceries and natural drinks
There was a lot of sushi selections and even desserts like cream puffs
The Food we ate was DeliciousThe items we tried were not necessarily something I would have ordered on my own but with our pre-fixe Yelp menu we were served a generous assortment of appetizersmy favorite was the butter-fish tataki and calamari
The menu had quite a few seafood choices
Note that the pictures of the food on the menu do not do the actual food justice
It has everything from a soft rubber padded playground swings slides sand water features two sizes of trains that run both fun to ride a carousel stores food shade sun air room to move around and mountain views
You have the choice of all kinds of meats and toppings plus killer shakes too
It ended up being a little too much food for us as the portions were pretty large
The Tangier burger was amazing with garlicky hummus tasty manchego cheese pesto oven dried tomatoes that thankfully were not over-dry and chewy and a half pound of delicious beef served on just the right proportion of ciabatta bread
A comedian who came up on stage to entertain while the judges and producers were debating the semi-finalists gave some non-sensical explanation about how the rules had changed and that they had in fact made the food we ordered but the staff got to gorge themselves on it in the back
We spent some time looking at the menu because there is definitely a variety of foods to choose from
Overall I give Ocean Prime 4 stars because the food was tasty the selection of foods on the menu was great and the ambiance was excellent
The menu is pretty impressive with all sorts of sushi concoctions that I have never seen but I like my sushi pretty standard and not too crazy so I ordered ironically the Crazy Horse roll which is tuna yellowtail and salmon rolled with avocado and topped with tobiko
I don't have TOO much to complain about regarding the size of the rolls they were decent or the taste it was ok considering this is tempe arizona but I think I was most turned off by the service and prices of the restaurant
I also made a better choice for this order and went with roasted chicken served over truffle macaroni and cheese
The hostess informed that the patio seating was limited to sushi menu only
After relocating to Phoenix he'd been jonesing hardcore for non-commercial non-fussy sushi in epic proportions served with a smile
C-Fu  not only has the standard menu items such as Sweet and Sour Chicken Mongolian Beef and Chow Mein but they also have some unique items such as Shark Fin Soup several duck and ostrich dishes and sea cucumber dishes
The prices are reasonable portions are large- def family style and when the brothers asked for the Vietnamese equivalent of Chinese dishes bc they only know the Vietnamese name and not the Chinese the lady not only understood but was able to suggest dishes if she didn't have the exact dish
They have a big menu with several combination plates all with rice and beans breakfast food served all day and some great a la carte options if you don't want the full meal
If Pirates took over your school cafeteria and gave you a choice to walk the plank or eat their fish & chips better put on your swim trunks and practice your backstroke
There are several sizes extra meat is available and if you are getting it to go I'd say go for it
They did have a variety of other things to eat so definitely check those out if you aren't up for a beef
The main courses were very flavorful as well and were the perfect portion sizes to ensure dessert would be the cards
Touch of Thai has an extensive menu that includes beef chicken pork seafood and dedicated vegetarian sections
Although all of the dishes had their Thai names listed next to them there might be some truth to that criticism
They have a wide variety of foods all delicious
I've been to the Pita Jungle in Chandler twice and on both occasions had excellent food great prices given how good the food was paired with huge portion sizes
The dish I had a homemade egg noodle pasta dish with a variety of fish and shellfish in white wine scampi sauce was good
I have made a better seafood pasta and the portion was pretty small so I had to resort to dipping fresh bread in the sauce
Portions are big Price is small Food and staff is great
Despite delicious food and an impressive wine list it hurts my heart to say that this place isn't worth the trouble
The menu also gives very vague descriptions making it nearly impossible for anyone with specific food allergies
As far as the happy hour menu goes there is a good selection of sushi rolls to choose from
Need to knock it down a star though because the Happy Hour food menu looks more like it belongs at Uncle Sam's than a Michael Mina Restaurant
Like I said best cocktails around and I'll keep hoping to find more appropriate food on the Happy Hour menu next time
The corned beef taquitos and the cod with chorizo are some of my favorite things on the menu
They focus on all types of breads including a variety of loaves rolls and some baked goods
#15-House PHOnomenal- decent broth not too fragrant a little stingy on the meat portions but overall a good bowl of phoIf you like lechee they have a drink pronounced hot-ee and it has little pearls of lechee juice and tons pf basil seeds
The crust is simply amazing and their pizza choices are amazing
Seeing the fear on their faces when I inquired about Mexican food I knew it was best to stay away from that portion of the menu
The food quality is really good and I may update again as I make my way through the menu
The menu offers mostly sandwiches burgers  various meats and some salads
50 Golden Buddha pretty much offers mainstream selections from dumplings and chicken feet to rice and noodles
However if you can score a seat the HH menu is great and we consistently munch on the veggie rolls and avocado egg rolls
As pointed out the wine list is solid   not stellar and the ambiance  food  decor and service have been above expectation  Nates attention over lunch was above and beyond
The lemongrass dish while a bit meager  -- 13 bite-sized pieces of deep-fried yumminess on a piece of lettuce -- was really tasty
One of my grips about Chase Field is that there is nothing overly special about the food or beer selection
When I had heard of Geisha it was for the cocktails music and people I had very little about their food however it was delicious and we will definitely go back to try other foods on the menu
After trying her dishes I wished I wouldn't have ordered all of my selections but they came recommended by the server
Nice selection of sushi named in the menu reasonable prices very fresh fish great quality quick and attentive service and super tasty
The menu is varied but small enough to where they can make each dish perfect
So the experienced chef to whom the menu was handed said you want saba sushi
well the only food on the happy hour menu is the sushi
you order at least 5 items off the sushi menu
Table were a little small given the sharing design and small dishes menu is my only feedback
Don't expect the meat and cheese to overpower the taste since it's such a meager and marginal portion of the entire sub
They have a generous selection of sushi and dessert
There are numerous interesting dishes on the menu and most of the dishes are heaping with food so the prices are not that bad
The food is good; my friends and I would always get a variety of appetizers and share them
I had the machaca beef which was well seasoned and a huge portion that I was not able to finish and I really skimped on the beans and rice because I could see how much beef there was
We went here and ordered a variety of food an appetizer a soup a salad 4 entrees and a dessert
The beer selection is not supurb but a lot of the meals some with cobbler for dessert
I just glanced over the menu and it pretty much looks the same so I'm assuming the food is just as good breakfast and lunch-wise
Great dough coupled with the finest of ingredients prepared in a minimalist style that lets the food do the talking
The market stocks a unique variety of foodsand has a pretty solid beer and wine selection
I noticed lots of local foods and a good selection of Arizona beers too and not just the standard Four Peaks offering that you can find in most stores

Next on my list is to try the Croque Monsieur because if it's anything like the food I've already tried then I know my taste buds are in for a treat
For dinner we all opted for different dishes so we could try a variety of menu items
Most guys don't really mind messy food and I am among that list
I find the portions to be reasonable and the quality of the food top notch
I don't think I am a truly jaded food snob I like pretty much everything and I don't think our selections were the dogs of the menu but I just don't think it was great which in MHO is what a dinner that costs more than $100 per head should be
I ordered the Shrimp & Bacon Quesadilla off of the appetizer section which I though was a nice change from the standard chicken quesadilla which they do have for traditionalists
They both really liked their dishes and like the quesadilla both portions were big and required take home boxes
It was hip fun and the food was realistically priced and absolutely DELICIOUS
It gave me pause at first but the appetizer I ordered Fried Imperial Rolls was excellent although the portions were small
Pizzas are good size one feeds two but make sure to baseline with a white and a red on your initial visit
Overall it was okay but the chicken portion was very small - maybe 2
The first time I went there I got two 7 inch pizza's I'd say this is a personal pan pizza size
They have a great revolving selection of about 30 Microbrews on tap and make some pretty good pizza Thai Chicken and Buffalo Chicken pizza is where it's at
Menu has variety ranging from Mexican food fabulous
I also really enjoy the fries at this place and they also have some really good desserts that are fairly large in portion
I thought the dessert would be around the size of my fist like some other restaurants do but it was much larger which I think is awesome
I see that there are spring rolls on the menu as well
There is food to buy but it's limited selection is like a cross between an expensive 7-11 and what you would find in Mario Batali's Food Network kitchen
Like so many others have noted moving to PHX made me realize how good I had it in Michigan with an abundance of solid choices for Middle Eastern food
This 3 meat Frybread is a good choice if you would to sample each of the beef options in one meal
The menu is big and the variety of choices includes chow fun noodles my favorite tofu aka bean curd dishes galore delicious shrimp toast and tons of yummy seafood choices
The new Nimbus in Tucson has set the standard to me for the fish portion and this did not top that
Albeit a bit pricy the artisan pizzas are the best I've found in Phoenix which means I'm adding it to the best of Tempe list
The food selection has gotten worse & the price higher
Prices are not bad either and by the looks of the Happy Hour menu very good prices to get your sushi on
In addition to the freshly cooked food La Tolteca has an extensive selection from the bakery
*Side Note* If you love exotic meats Stax offers a selection of exotic burgers
They seems to switch the variety of sushi rolls too each time I've been there
Today since it was Sunday there was a lot of variety of cooked food too
I'm praising the variety of food as you can tell

From the regular menu she ordered the dragon roll & the yellowtail
Three generous sized flour tacos filled with fish veggies and rice
The lunch food items are well priced for what you get too with generous portions
And for some strange reason it makes the list of places to dine when hankering for authentic Mexican food
The food was average portions small to average
The selection of food is realllllllly good
Oh did I mention the $3 drinks and food menu
My favorite dish and its not on the menu is the Sizzling Shrimp
The food is inversely proportional to what the place looks like on the outside and I'm telling you it looks like a ramshackle dump
My dish was actually on the appetizer menu and let me just say I was in heaven when my dish arrived
A word to the wise if you order a side of chicken let it be known that it will be a small portion for $4
The pizza is the best thing here there's a bunch of choices or you can build your own
I love that the menu offers new dishes often and the specials on Taco Tuesdays has me coming back once a week
The portions are very large and most of the table did not finish the dish completely saving room for the main course
Unfortunately however the food quality and wine list do not compare to Houston's and I would have gladly paid the extra $50 to have simply dined there
So much flavor in such a little glass with a fun little spoon to eat your little calorie filled well in comparison to the full size dessert
I can't even stress to people enough though that this is on the polar opposite end of Sweet Tomatoes both in quality of food and selection and they are about the same price
It may sound inconsequential to be so impressed about someone's opinion on dessert selection but I thought it was really cool
The BF and I both wanted to try the White Sands Chimi after all the awesome reviews on Yelp so we agreed that he'd get it give me a bite and I ordered the Arriba sampler which was like 8 appetizer sized chucks of really greazy indistinguishable and pretty tasteless finger foods
This time was very laid back great music great Happy Hour prices food was excellent and had a great variety of appetizers to choose from
However although we enjoyed it I wouldn't really say these dishes are worth $15-$20 per plate either in flavor or portion size
As far as the food make your own choice but be careful
To my surprise the $5 basket could be a burger or a chicken sandwich with your choice of 3 toppings and came with fries
Very authentic Mexican food and the portions are huge
The food selection is diverse and uniformly excellent
They have a good selection of mostly beers but the real focus here is the food
The hair the 1-2 star margherita and the non-existant meat selection I can only give a 3 star rating
their menu is HUGE and they serve breakfast all day plus burgers and chicken sandwiches and such
The menu six pages long devotes one half of one page to its two hamburgers signature and classic one and a half pages to other food and four pages to various types of booze you've never heard of
The food is always delicious and the portions are enormous
- 5 starsDefinitely a great place to go for sit-down in Scottsdale Fashion Square but stay away from the rolls and stick with the main menu except give the salmon wasabi sashimi a try
I am not a huge Italian food fan while I enjoy some good ole spaghetti every now and then when given the choice you are more likely to find me munching on some chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant
The menu is HUGE spanning from pasta to filled pastas  chicken and veal dishes and even pizza
The rotisserie chicken dinners ordered were off the menu but the kitchen readily accommodated us
Uhm maybe since they do have a couple good beers available they serve fresh fish and they have a pretty wide selection of oysters to pick from
nigiri sushi and sashimi along with a salad and miso soup The sushi and sashimi are chef selections and always presented beautifully created fresh for you in the moment by the sushi master I was going to go into detail about what he made for me but you know what your sushi experience will be different and you should go to Dozo and try all of it
If you've ever been to New Orleans and had a po-boy you'd know that they are obnoxiously oversized and stuffed with lettuce tomato and your choice of fish or meat
Our guests all loved their steaks and seafood choices and we topped off the dinner with Key Lime pie
The service aside I was impressed by the prices of everything very reasonable nothing over $20 on the brunch menu except for a few specialty beef items most everything mid $10s
Regardless of the size this place is wonderful it's clean and the staff is so friendly and the food
Yesterday I went to buy some chicken and pork chops that were on-sale and just couldn't resist getting some menudo for an early lunch
Nope they were just regular ole fries a mound of it with two small portions of the fish
They have even more dishes that they can make for lunch specials than the ones they have listed so make sure you ask
Food We decided that my husband would order an ala carte dish and I would go with the tasting menu to get the full effect
Some menu items are fabulous they have the best chicken wings in the valley in my opinion
Also there cheeseburger pizza is great without some items for me pickles onions The salads are always fresh the chili size is good the pot roast is some of the best I have ever had
On the Cafe Express menu it states that if you don't get your food in 15 minutes it will be free
Most importantly the new menu no longer carries the amazing churros that Prado used to serve for dessert
The new menu features desserts from the Julia Baker chocolate shop next door which we also visited after dinner
Among others T Cook's and Lon's at the Hermosa offer the same fancy resort feel and have better food in my opinion now that Prado's menu has changed
They have a great selection of chesses oils wine by the bottle or glass chocolates sauces drinks coffee bar and fresh made to order pizzas and sandwices
I had the Nutty Mixed Up Salad minus the chicken which consisted of organic field greens grapes feta cheese walnuts dried cranberries pumpkin seeds raisins and organic apples served with a balsamic vinaigrette on the side  It was a generous portion and only $6
org/wiki/List_of_common_misconceptions#Food_and_cooking so we asked for it anyway
Only downside was when we actually ordered 2 desserts that was 1 too much for 2 people - other portions were perfect desserts are LARGE
Make sure you order an egg roll- they are super crispy and massive I swear each one resembles a small burrito in size rather than your standard wimpy egg roll
Flipping through the menu you can find Taiwanese food Cantonese food Shanghainese food  and a myriad of others
I felt the lunch menu was perhaps a bit overpriced given the quantity and quality of food
There were about 10 peanuts a 1/2 cup of sauteed green onions and about 4 medium sized shrimp to go with fried rice that had nothing in it and an egg roll the size of my thumb
The skins came the size of a peresonal pizza and had the deep dish crust looking like a pizza but it was filled with mashed potatoes and topped with bacon bits
They have a great selection of meats and they are cooked perfectly
There are several made-upchoices including the original pizza of New York  the Margherita
There's also a full Italian menu but we areserved  only pizza and wings
The server actually came out with the dessert menu and told him he could choose whatever he wanted
He was a little upset about the dirty food smeared menu but excited about the free dessert
So many other things on the menu that I'd love to try -Hummus w/Seared Ahi TunaRoasted Red Pepper HummusFalafel PlatterChicken Del SolYellowfin Tuna Honey Sesame SaladBlack Bean BurgerGlazed Chicken Lavosh Pizza
But they gave me so much of it that I ended up with enough beef to satisfy my personal portion requirements
If I remember correctly all the poached egg dishes were priced the same regardless of meat choice so I had to make it count
Their menu features cheese and charcuterie plates flatbreads burgers and other comfort-style dishes
I looked over the menu and pledge to return for food and report back
Hula's food was not great but it was good and the portions were very generous
Lately the quality of the food has gone downhill and the portions leave much to be desired
We usually do pizza Fridays and of course Spinato's is a very popular one on the list
40 retarded the selection is 4 or 5 dishes which include chicken fried rice fried noodles small freaken veggie egg rolls and some pepper chicken WTF seat selection is not bad but you see drunk indians go behind the gas station not to mention if you need the restroom its a door that goes outside to another door smh this is NOT place you wanna go sorry but i will never return
When I asked the girl who was standing around handing out menus where I could find the rolls she was clueless
As mentioned by others the food was pretty good but the portion and price was not
We were a bit disappointed to see that the HH menu was a bit different than before; instead of just all the sushi and apps and pizzas being half price they were bunched into groups by price
The biggest bummer about the sushi was that most of the rolls that we wanted weren't on the HH menu especially since they were only $6
Beyond the food I always take it upon myself to really explore the specialty bar menu to see how good their bartenders really are
I haven't tried their pizzas yet but they are definitely on my to do list
There are lots of vegetarian options on the menu but when I tried to modify them to be vegan ie no cheese no mayo no cream the server told me the dishes wouldn't taste good and discouraged me from getting them
The food portions were so small I was very disappointed that they charged so much
When we sat down the waitress was prompt with the menu and gave us some time to order which is rare in a quick serving food joint that's packed
Since I've been a regular in 2004 the menu has changed very little if at all I haven't noticed anything chagned but then again I'm not exactly perusing the hamburger/beef section of the menu
If you order off of the regular menu they bring food to the table
To be honest it's not our favorite pizza but it's one of our favorite sit-down pizza joints because of the atmosphere value variety and service
Takamatsu restaurant is combined of Japanese & Korean menu and the sushi
The AZ Restaurant week ad for this says During restaurant week guests will also choose from a selection of 12 decadent desserts
The prices are on the high side for the portion sizes but the quality of the food is superb
And pay attention to the heat levels on the menu; some of the dishes are HOT
Food portions are great as in definitely a LOT more than they would serve in Japan and everything on the menu is just super affordable
I just moved to Scottsdale from San Francisco four months ago and I've been pretty disappointed overall with the selection of food and the worst servers in all of the country are found in this entire city
So I paid to wait almost 2 hours listen to my kids whine drive there twice be ignored by employees disrespected by  management only to finally be disappointed by the corn meal pizza
wow i gotta start saying that i had the best salmon i had for a very very long time i usually dont order fish when is beef on the menu lol i am 100% beefy person but what it got my eye it was cause it was serve with cold couscous and some pickle veggies that made me very happy  we had a pitcher of sangria n it was very tasty as well
Positives There was a wide variety of salad meats and sides that come with your meal; drinks and dessert are not included
Menu is loaded with just about any and every dish you could imagine
My problem is the limited menu during lunch time and the quality of that food
That probably explains why they have pizza on the menu
The noodle dishes here are eight or nine dollars and have huge portions
Their happy hour menu was great - $5 pizza's wings bruschetta and more
If you are wanting to listen to modern Irish jigs while eating delicious food who doesn't
The meat selection was up first to put in your bowl
The Rhumba SaladA fresh flour tortilla holds a bed of fresh greens and your choice of pork chicken or beef
They should also include on the table a selection of fish sauces and spices to add to your meals and appetizers
Full size grown up food is always amazing
We opted for the five course tasting menu with the cheeses in lieu of dessert $82 and I ordered a half-bottle of Minor Viognier $29 from their well-chosen well-priced wine list since Peter doesn't drink wine
Sent home with the menu tied in a blue satin ribbon I can tell you what we chose among three or four options per coursePeter's choicesBigeye Tuna Tartare with watermelon edamamel daikon wasabi-coconut pana cotta lotus root chips lychee and chili oilSoft shell crab with lime fried green tomato red onion marmalade lemongrass ginger sauceKing Clip with wild asparagus ramps pattypan squash roasted fingerling potatoes we asked for those to be left off and they were spring garlic and rouilleRibeye steak with egg yolk ravioli broccoli maitake mushrooms baby bulb onions and hollandaiseMy choicesSteak carpaccio with an heirloom tomato tart mozzarella cream cucumber balsamic vinegar basil and charred red onionCorned beef TONGUE Reuben with sauerkraut thousand island dressing a cornichon and french friesCopper River King Salmon with giant gnocchi sweet peppers tasso ham sea beans orange and mustardThe same ribeye as Peter--we both had to have it
I would go into more detail about the food since what is listed above is in THEORY what we were served but in actuality was not since Binkley is an adherent to the molecular gastronomy/Wylie Dusfresne/Adria/Michel Richard style of cooking
Beef selection was decent enough and I picked up a flank steak for less than $5/lb
I opined on my five-points requirement to get on my sushi-worth-eating list and those first visits did not fail to impress
With that dish you get all the benefits of their great chicken but with the added variety that enchiladas offer
Unfortunately we missed the other side of the menu and will have to wait until next time to try the warm dishes
Ordered a BBQ chicken salad which was adequately portioned and tasty
The chicken was a little dry and the steak while good was not cut in to easy to eat sizes and frankly making up your tortilla was not easy
Other menu items are hit and miss - the Shrimp Shumai had a bizarre breaded consistency and I was lukewarm on the sukiyaki but I liked the miso eggplant and the spicy tuna roll
I have tried most things on the menu and love the Chicken or Been Teriyaki & the House Chicken/Beef
I still stand by my thought that dinner is too expensive and I would like the option to get a small portion for less money 3 chicken breasts per plate
While these aren't Mexican dishes they were for the kids this is sky-high even for restaurant standards- The side dishes are tiny -- my portion of rice and beans was absolutely lacking- The carne asada tacos were decent but could have been more flavorful; including a lime definitely would have helped the causeAs there are many other better and more authentic places to get Mexican food in the East Valley search elsewhere
Sunflower Market gets high marks for having fairly competitive prices vis-a-vis Whole Foods high quality products especially produce and meat good hours they're open until 11 which is nice and an excellent selection of bulk foods
I have had the beef bowl & the chicken bowl these are very generous portions and have yet to be able to eat it all in one sitting
It is big and their selection has improved with the addition of an organic / natural foods section wish I could get my Ian's Frys there if you read this Albertsons
The choices were amazing as was the quality of the food
Some items I ate because I LOVE variety and tasting everything Vegetable curry samosa Thai eggroll barbecue chicken Asian sesame chicken asparagus really fresh ones I skipped all the noodly dishes to save room for the other stuff salmon really perfectly cooked smoked salmon and salmon salad ALL great chile rellenoa teeny tiny slice of turkey with a special apple cranberry sauce sundried tomatoes and yellow peppers a blueberry cheese sounds weird but VERY good one ravioli tasted and looked like a pesto-based sauce and tastes of a few desserts that I shared with Gary
I would certainly come here again for the ambiance food choices quality and overall experience
Came here for a group dinner and wasn't impressed with the food menu
Shortly after I finished most of the chilis the server came out with  two fist-size meatball in a delicious looking roll
I'm talking Over the Top trucker fist-size meatballs just huge
The menu and style of food reminded me of Pei Wei's but just a little more authentic
A large selection of drinks Sake bomb is usually the most popular and a large selection of discounted items including their famous Vegas roll which is my favorite
Their meat and cheese selection is also small but comprehensive
Finally anything with meatballs on it from here is a solid choice
I liked the variety of meat selections served with the lunch special but the steak was grizzly
My husband and I's favorite thing on the menu is the margarita pizza
Their lunch portion is the perfect amount of food and comes with delicious soup
The menu is rife with tantalizing options including pita pizzas pastas subs and burgers but I've never desired to stray from the solid and delicious pitas
The menu is well laid out better than other Paradise locations and the food is top notch
The tacos were excellent and I would recommend the ground beef pernil and chicken as 3 solid choices
And as a person who always looks at a dessert menu first to decide if I want to save room SAVE ROOM
of the Indian buffets around the Valley I found the selection here to be a little small the Tandoori Chicken tasted like benzene
She was so knowledgable about everything the restaraunt offered the menu and how the food was prepared
I am not sure how the franchise works royalties menus common logo etc but if you want a very cheap meal and you are not a snob or afficianado of Vietnamese food this places works for a quick filler
I've tried everything on the menu but my favorite options are the Crab Wontons and the Pei Wei Spicy Chicken
I think what may have happened is the people inside get put at the end of the list as far as making food because there are people waiting in the drive thru so it took much longer to receive food
Every seat is great the food prices are high but now include a value menu light rail station right out front to get you on your way and free of traffic
Admittedly I haven't eaten anything but the curried chicken so the rest of the menu I really can't comment on
I will need to come back again to sample the other food choices apparently they serve a good dinner too
The HH menu can't be beat - awesome drink and food specials
Don't get scared - its not one of those Mexican Sushi types of places its just got a great menu and everything is delicious
Noting that our GPS had it listed under American food and not Mexican should have been the first clue
After sampling a variety of offerings you can have a very good experience if you zero in on the dishes you like
I would have preferred the sushi to be smaller in size or with less rice but still the sushi was above average
I was blown away by the variety of rolls they have on the menu I wanted to order them all but I settled on a Philly roll and the heart attack
Their pizzas are very simple with only a few ingredients but there's a great variety of pizzas
Shove some storage boxes aside shift the somewhat awkward and somewhat heavy tables and chairs so you can actually sit at them without having to be as thin as a stick figure they don't mind that their clientele shifts tables and chairs around to suit their parties which is usually families of various sizes then step up to the hot plates nestled into the steam table to see the 8-10 dishes offered on that day's menu--it changes daily but is usually the same from week to week
They have a fairly interesting menu and the food is usually pretty good
The food was fairly good but if you are not really hungrey and just want a small soup or salad no choices
My son ordered from the kids meal a backup just in case and he chose baked chicken fingers which came with a side of fruit cocktail and a full-sized drink
The story I got was that the owner a Japanese business man who used to travel to Phoenix for business was not satisfied with the sushi choices and decided to open his own sushi restaurant
FOOD--------Menu includes really cheap sliders plus regular-sized burgers
Seriously for the regular bowl of pho it felt like the amount of noodles and meat you get for kiddie size
The portions are huge the food is probably extremely fattening and you *WILL* have a food coma by the end of lunch
The chicken nachos were a little short on the chicken the chips were just a little too soggy but I'd probably still have them again because of the substantial size of the plate and the tasty guacamole
However for an average night I'm heading over to Thai Rama where you'll find the same great food excellent taste nearly double the portion and a lighter check
We ordered- Thai-High Sweet & Zesty Chicken Salad - delicious- Wok Fired Sesame Ginger Chicken noodles - fabulous & a large portion- Side order of fries - seriously some of the best I had w/ both sea salt and pepper and perfectly friedOverall a great lunch
I liked the Pad Thai although it was lighter on veggies than I'm used to; but it's exactly as described in the menu Small rice noodles stir-fried with shrimp chicken egg green onion bean sprouts and peanuts
It was refreshing to look over the menu and see every dish that I loved from our old Chinese restaurant
The pros - good experience lots of menu choices good food smells wonderfulThe cons - poor parking you will be a little crowded $10 guacamole and $11 glass of sangria
first we sat at a small table along the wall and found to our dislike that the enormous speakers pumping out the bass was right behind us made for a slightly freakhouse feel but this was easily remedied we sat ourselves at the bar and were quite satisfied with the drinks he Stella Artois me Mojito and the Margharita pizza - roman style the menu says - it's on flat bread
I really like this Whole Foods store it's much nicer then some of their other stores and just the right size for our needs
It's a little pricey but the food is well prepared very healthy and good portions not too much not too little
I also had a variety of dipping sauces to put the meat in and the tarter sauce was my favorite
I'm not even sure if it's offered on the menu under one of their HK-style noodle dishes because once I found out the staff spoke Chinese I ordered it in Chinese
A Full menu of bar food is available including bar noshes such as the mini corn dogs tater tots nachos and smoked BBQ ribs
There are many vegetarian dishes not just the usual tofu and veggies they have a large selection of exotic mushroom and veggie dishes
Latitude Eight really needs to take a hard look at its menu and decide how they can make their food more unique and innovative
The food is delicious the antipasto is excellent as is the Tuscan white bean salad and their wine list is quite extensive
Parking is great and the selection of food is appropriate and divine for a cafe
So reading the menu is very deceptive because the dish name may be mushrooms or tomatoes but what you get is an experience in your palate and on your plate
Our first four choices of real food ex sandwich salad cheese/fruit etc were sold out
White the food and service were both good - portions were miniscule
Dessert was cheesecake - it was a half-portion cut into two slices- enough for 3 forkfuls
In these struggling times I can understand that restaurants need customers but to say they are giving $144 worth of food when dividing portions in less than half left us feeling ripped off
Coke comes in the old fashioned bottles and the alcohol selection is a bit small but I guess the focus is really the food
I had the Shwarma - which is a hot pita with roasted chicken and all kinds of other goodness hehe I forget - but look it up on their menu
It was a good portion too no skimping on meat or filling
Ryn is the best and was able to direct our choices as to food and drink
The menu is rather pricey so I decided to order a chicken waldorf salad and my co-worker ordered a chicken caesar salad
Dessert was an afterthought with a mini sampling of mediocre selections placed on a plate with no flair whatsoever
It's reasonably priced and the food portions are perfect
I was so dissapointed because we even had our food picked out because we looked at the menu online and wanted to visit the gift shop to buy some Jimmy Buffet souveniers
Their new menu doesn't even have a price for beef ribs it says Market Price so the sky's the limit on how much Stacy can charge for them
My husband had the mango beef - I used to work at a Vietnamese fusion restaurant where this was featured on the menu and there it consisted of thinly sliced beef with tender pieces of mango and a oyster sauce
Now I know all you Hipster Foodies on this site especially those who have expense accounts and don't mind paying $100 a person for Trendy Sushi will look down on the lack of ambience and menus with photos the horror; so kitsch
The main reasons for the low stars is that although the variety of sushi is great they don't make it that well
While great proportions is generally appreciated sometimes it can very often do a dish more harm than good
Overall the food was good but overpriced and the portions  were  small
We started our dinner off with some oysters-that are served with your choice of sauce cocktail horseradish or some french celery sauce
There are more choices of items beyond pizza here and the quality is as good as Bianco's
The other member of the party had the prime rib which was a generous portion perfectly cooked and great taste especially with some fresh horseradish
Sam was amazing and explained the entire menu with recommendations to the most popular dishes including history and back stories on the dishes including info on the chef
For lunch they had a nice selection of prime rib and roasted chicken at the carving station
The portion size was perfect for me and left room for dessert
I love street food I love small portions I love guacamole I love refried beans - now that you know these things about me now that I've revealed the Latina part of my soul that burns under this German facade it's really not hard to see why this place would get 5 stars from this chica
They serve Boar's Head meat which is the best if you ask me and they have some variety for being a small place
And I was disappointed with the Mac and Cheese portion and again the perception that something was missing to really take this dish over the top
The menu is so cute and unique with chicken wire on it
Quick service solid menu salads that make even this meat lover think twice about what to order; this place made us smile as our eyes wondered about the room seeing what others ordered taking mental notes for future visits
The Eggs Benedict was perfect brioche french toast was like a dessert the dessert table had small portions of every bit of yummy sweet goodness you can imagine and everything in between was great I thought my husband was going to have to roll me out of there
I was uber excited to eat here because I love Mexican type food and their menu looked fantastic
The menu is great and all but man SALTY food
The dinner selection is limited to pastas but they are very well executed dishes
It has burgers fish n' chips and even hot dogs on the menu
We sampled a variety Vegetable Pakora Papadum Pooris Naan Garlic Naan Vegetable Korma Dahl Sambar Rasam Raita Chicken Curry Chicken Tikka Masala a Tamarind/Tomato sauce Mint/Cilantro/Jalepeu00f1o sauce and Gulab Jamun
for 12 bucks they gave us 6 really good sized flaky puffs loaded with crab and lobster meat and this amazing sauce
soft shelled crab broiled and fried ask to go easy on the salt crawfish gumbo they only have seafood gumbo listed but you can ask to have crawfish only
I'm not eating yet but the menu looks like cheesy southwestern food - good enough if I pound a few more salty dogs from the friendly bartender
How refreshing to read a specialty sushi roll menu and see something different
by far the best sushi and most unique menu I've seen in a while and so mush less pretentious and more affordable then all the other Old Town Sushi restuarants
We were so hungry that right when we sat down we ordered the Hummus Platter which we regretted after looking at the menu lot of dishes came with hummus but was very glad we ordered it
A modern  Medditeran menu is diverse enough to keep picky foodies happy while still satisfying less-adventurous diners
Minus one star because the menu did not specify bacon was on the dish I ordered and because a cheese crisp should never be $5 even though it was pretty big
The subs are just fine but the non-club menu the left side is woefully underpowered in the meat department
I surmise it's about 1/8 lb of meat on an oversized sub roll that dwarfs your sandwich and makes you wonder where your $4 went
When I received my order Bun with egg rolls it was in a big bowl and the portion was right
I rented a mid-size car and was given a 2010 Toyota Corolla with 1300 miles on it and a full tank of gas
I'm not sure why Hertz thinks a Corolla is a mid-size car but considering it was just me traveling I welcomed the excellent fuel economy and new car smell
I dished up a portion of it combing through the cashew chicken for the chicken
The spring rolls said they'd serve 4 on the menu but when brought to our table there only two on the dish and we were 3 people
I can go to La Piazza Al Forno in Glendale for brick oven pizza that is much better less wait time  more options on their menu and genuine friendly service
The menu is varied and the food is good but not great
In most traditional Chinese restaurants low price = small portions and/or very poor quality food
The menu is pretty big and they've given many of their dishes fun autical names
As for the drinks I ordered white wine Citra Pinot Grigio Italy to go with the mounds of fish coming our way and my date opted for kirin Ichiban beer and the AZ restaurant week menu surprised us with a complimentary Roku Fusion Cocktail
BTW they did not skimp on the alcohol ;  If you ever want to try Sushi Roku Arizona Restaurant Week is a great time to go because you get a great variety from the menu
I'd like to go back and try the small menu of diner food
I've tried most of the dishes here and I must say that this place boasts a pretty solid selection of dishes and tastes
I loved that the meal and pairings choices were different and I have never had better fish anywhere
A 10 is great for 2 people as it is sliced into 4 the specialty pizzas will run ya about $10 for the small size
Currently my doctor has me on a strict Vegan diet so I already knew I was in for it with selection food wise
The restaurant lunch and dinner menus were very extensive and spanned from chicken wings to innovative salads steaks and a token pasta dish
As if I'm going to listen to anything you say about red meat or any other fucking thing
While perusing the menu and munching on a dinner roll I noticed quite a pastiche of cuisines
Extremely friendly and attentive staff knowledgable and enthusiastic sushi chefs superior grade sashimi an eclectic variety of specials and a menu that offers everything from Soba noodles to Chicken Teriyaki
Bright white in color and quite fatty this fish is not always easy to find - in fact you will rarely see it on sushi menus due to the high levels of fatty esters
They've got such a huge selection of the spring rolls that I can't wait to return to try some of the others
Unfortunately we went there because we were just hungry and our first choice stopped serving food at 9 pm
Food and such I have tried a variety of items for breakfast but mainly there everything bagel or a croissant
The selection was huge and the food was surprisingly good
Oh well that is OK if the food is good but the menu was much like a Taco Bell with very little variation tacos burritos chimichangas etc
I wouldn't come here specifically for sushi due ONLY to a limited selection but they get some amazing yellowtail at CherryBlossom
Up until recently if one was hungry on a Friday night say around 1030 your choices were limited to Casey Moore's another fabulous drinkery and eatery but of a different ilk than Tricks a couple of gas inducing Mexican treats at Taco Bell or any of the other something-Berto's dotted around the valley or delivery from pizza pie people
We tried the La Pizza Bianco ~ it has a mildly chewy somewhat thin crust blistered and charred in spots
True Food Kitchen's Scottsdale Quarter provides a calming patio setting the menu is derived from a food pyramid with chocolate at the top and is green certified
So I was a bad customer; I didn't fully read the menu on one of the salads when it explicitly stated that it had chicken
When the salad came out with chicken I called him back and told him that I wanted the one without and I was basically told in the most polite way imaginable to read the f*cking menu again especially the part where it says chicken
Looking over their menu I saw it rather limited but roast beef caught my eye while my gf got the pork seared special
They have a nice selection of cocktails and nice menu with salads pizzas and appetizers I think that they have sandwiches too but I usually skip over those
If sushi isn't your thing they have a great tempura selection and large portions for hot dishes
I enjoyed the roasted garlic in olive oil with the toasted baguette slices from the start menu though the nosh plate might need some work more types of cured meats and maybe some of those tiny dill pickles
For Sharing Section of the menu - the citrus brined fried chicken and cheddar cheese waffles loved by all
They're busy every other night too simply because they're one of the hippest places around-a hot staff a huge wine selection a pretty patio wonderful food and pretty ambiance
This restaurant was an oasis in a desert of food choices and saved us from almost certain hunger-induced lunacy
The quality of meat in each taco is very good and the variety here is unbeatable
A healthy portion of sliced meat with tomatoes onions and a pickle
At this point it is still a treat for me but I would rather eat at the authentic Mexican dive with actual Spanish on the menu dishes I don't recognize and very few white people in the place
The owner who is ethnically half Italian and half Albanian a country across the narrow Adriatic from Italy cut his dough tossing chops in NY for over twenty years and it shows as soon as you walk in the door- the old school style menu over the counter using plastic letters to detail the numerous subs dinners and even Sicilian style pies are a throwback to every neighborhood pizza joint I've ever patronized in my fifty plus years
There were def good the waffle and the sweet tea and not as good points the size of the chicken pieces
No organic food at all and their regular items were limited in selection
I would definitely go here first over the Boulders even though the Boulders Resort has some organic food selections
The menu is decent with enough variety to choose from to keep people coming back you can choose to have a 1/3 lb 1/2 lb or chicken burger for a kind of 'burger' but there are better burger places to make this place someplace I'd want to keep returning
The portion of fish was very large and so amazingly delicious
With your dish comes a variety of tiny sides Im sure there is a Korean name for these
Your choice of fried chicken or fish plus 2 sides and cornbread can be split between 2 healthy eaters and will be plenty to fill the tummy and the soul
Nothing is really outstanding but the price and the rest is just solid For a $20 price you get miso soup salad edamame choice or tempura or gyoza ice cream and all you can eat sushi
That is a great deal and the sushi list is huge featuring a ton of specialty rolls and nigiri
Unlike some other AYCE places I am not afraid to try things on the menu here and venture out and I am a bit of a fish snob and won't do that unless i feel comfortable with the level of quality at a place
This place will satisfy a craving for Thai food but the aesthetics and practicality of the menu is poorly put together
I ordered the Kimow which is a dish I have been looking for on the menus of various Thai restaurants in AZ but have never been able to find
Plus the menu doesn't obviously inform the customer that all their specialties and items that say they're made with this or that meat can actually be replaced with another meat or tofu if you're vegan or vegetarian like me
It's a specialty restaurant meaning that you must really enjoy crepes to be able to appreciate what the owner's pride and their creativity of their food selections
The sushi is consistently good and they have a great selection
Near the top a stream erupts from the ground and flows down to the size able fishing pond
I'd also like to note that their regular rice and teriyaki or other prepared meat bowls are huge and are family sized as oppose to individual sized
The food is tradtional italian fare they offer you bread as soon as you sit down and nearly everything meal comes with your choice of garden salad or soup unlike a lot of restaurants today where it's an additional cost
Little did we know the provolone fondue our appetizer came in hugeee portion getting us full before our main dishes came out haha But of course this didnt stop us for digging in
It is a great simple concept and they do have a small selection of imported meats and cheeses
Capicola seems to be the primary meat of choice on this Italian sub like many other places who use it as what I consider to be a cost effective filler due to the lower cost of the meat vs
The sashimi and sushi were up to the mark somebody sitting next to me at the sushi bar got served up with deep fried  baby octopus - an off menu item  - I would have gone for that  but I was done by the time it appeared
Im doing spectacular sitting at an empty table with no food no drink  and no menu
- Chicken Blue cheese slider huge portion for 4 bucks
They aren't labeled in any way and I have an urge to stare at the huge selection and ask questions until the baker wants to throw the lovely desserts at me or I figure out what I want whichever comes first
A new staple on my lunch rotation Thai Pan features a large variety of fresh dishes
Atypically they don't ask for a spiciness level for each dish; instead each dish is designed by the chef and the spiciness or lack thereof is indicated on the menu
the chicken was tasty and the tacos are pretty decently portioned
It wasn't super pricey they brewed their own beer my biggest weakness and the food was not your typical menu
The menu is pretty basic no Cheesecake Factory bible-sized menus; just one page chock full 'o yummy easily recognizable dishes
no chicken on the menu from what I can remember
Unfortunately we didn't get to sample the dessert menu because we were both stuffed
Plus I really like that Harkins has a bigger selection of food items at their concession areas
Over the years I have tried different dishes from the menu and although not everything was to my liking I can't say it wasn't truly representative of typical Chilango meals found all around D
It all ranges in price from about $5 for sandwiches and wraps up to about $15 for a couple of the full sized dinner entrees though most of the dinner entrees mostly hover around $10 which is a steal for the amount of food that you get
Looking at the menu I thought the prices were a bit high for a restaurant of this caliber but I feel that any sub-par food is over priced
I don't eat meat so I appreciated the variety of non-meat dishes even more vegan stuff than your average eatery
I had the salmon teriyaki lunch bento box $13 that included an oriental sauced side mix green saladsteamed riceone large tempura shrimp and tempura vegetables two big pieces of sweet potato one zucchinione onion ring My salmon was tasty and a perfect size for lunchnot only did I get all that food I mentioned but my salmon was on top of pan seared mixed vegetables including baby bok choy
It may be a typical bar food type menu but the food itself is far superior to what you will find in most bar restaurants
The food is a little expensive but with huge portions
Now the food portion of the review the other guests that I have been with said there food was delicious it looked to be really good
With that said- this place is great because it is all healthy food and it seems to be passionate people cooking it and creating the menu
I tried out the different offerings but in the end I went for Michelle's drug of choice body dessert
The selection is incredible; farm fresh vegetables and eggs taste like nothing you've ever imagined if you're a recovering ex-Suburbanite and all this an more matters so much more concretely than the idea that I have to dish out an extra dollar for those eggs
I ordered the New York Omelet which has chicken spinach tomatoes and onions I think covered in your choice of hollandaise or cajun sauce
Perhaps if you come there with a few friends do not care much about food and just drink the wine and listen to music it would be much better
Bargains on bread and tortillas are great they have a great assortment of nuts and desserts I'm not a dessert guy but the prices and selections are cool and I love the grill pack- an assortment of marinated chicken hamburger patties and sausage feeds 4-6 all for TEN BUCKS
The food is both better and cheaper than Chipotle plus there's a considerably more varied menu
The portions were enough for an 8-year old and some of the dishes looked like barf
MEH MEHPizza  sausage onion garlic were the topping of choice
Our selection for the day was a live lobster tilapia and catfish
Our tilapia and catfish were cleaned and bagged while our lobster traveled live with us over to Asian Cafu00e9 Express where we had our seafood selection prepared for our meal
Also why can't a restaurant that carries a limited and expensive menu specializing in burgers Zin Delux serve higher quality beef
We tried a decent representation of the menu and concluded that only their chicken was even remotely worthwhile
Not only is food good but they have a nice cocktail menu and they are known to fill their drinks to the tip top
They also have a bar I have not been to it however because when I go I always want to sit down and experience their great food menu
In regards to the food yes they have authentic choices but it's not stellar
3 of us had menu variations of corn-beef hash and poached eggs
They stop serving food after 700 their food menu consists of either a hot dog or nachos
The big draw for me is their food selection
The meat selection is great and it looks and smells very fresh
I ended up ordering the BBQ Chicken Flatbread which was new to the menu
Tottie Rolls are fantastic and one of the highlights of the menu with a variety of flavors and textures in on delectable package
But that wasn't reason enough for cart after cart of with very choices and few that I liked Tepid greasy spring rolls duck innards rubbery gray-colored things that my companion Mr
As far as the food is concerned perfect lunch sized portions
so a slightly smaller selection overall and a much smaller selection of freshly-prepared foods
Food A surprisingly diverse and wonderful selection of food to please the meatless palate
They have an extensive menu and I am sure many people like myself order food as well as a beverage when they go through the drive thru
So basically choice of meat bun sauces add ons etc
I found the prices very reasonable for the portions and the quality of the food
The menu was quite eclectic and next time we are definitely going to try their special mushroom dish which you can also order in a smaller portion
The food overall was very rich but the portions were just the right size
I was told the portions were a good size so why would I even think about ordering more food especially when this is my very first time ordering from this place
We were informed that no such food was available; because it was New Year's Eve there was not room service and the dining room was only fixing the fixed menu meal
The portions were large enough that I couldn't even think about dessert and was so glad we passed on an appetizer
Very funny and knowledgeable of the menu spices dishes
The long and short of it was this  Generous portions of unusual food in a charming atmosphere
With a great selection of beers on tap always having a fantastic seasonal beer and a wide variety of great food I could go here three or four times a week
It almost feels a bit Japanese minimalist but this wisely puts the focus on the food and the gorgeous views
The desserts are small portions and we probably could have used a second but then we might not have been able to enjoy the delectable chocolate chip cookies they brought out with the the bill
The menu was full of basic breakfast staples and a surprisingly amount of Mexican dishes actually not too surprisingly after I learned Brunchies is owned by Serrano's next door
The happy hour menu has several decent priced apps some well priced basic sushi rolls and a decent amount of teppanyaki dishes
Since everything is already prepped and portioned you don't have to go shopping for 20 different things like you normally would if you were to make one of these dishes on your own
They have other vegan dishes as well but I have yet to try them because the veggies pho is so darn good #16 on the lunch menu
First of all most of the menu is gone along with the dishes that kept me coming
so I was shopping at Fry's and noticed that several things on my list were actually CHEAPER at Whole Foods - specifically basmati rice quinoa and tofu
I've stopped buying the salads there now and only do that if I'm at the Whole Foods on Rural and Baseline which has a better salad selection
I either get the ground beef tacos yummy the red chile burrito watch out or the menudo got a hangover
It starts with an excellent crusty artisanal roll piled high with just the right proportion of mild roasted chicken and salty prosciutto
Great selections on the menu with classic breakfast comfort food
If you aren't starving you can get a good sized chicken and rice dish by ordering the Kids portion and it's only $3
Just such a awesome atmosphere for small groups or a date and really good food with a very nice beer list
after the traditional being ignored for the first 8 minutes BECAUSE WERE A NEW YORK STYLED DELI AND THATS THE WAY THEY DO IT IN NEW YORK we sat down at a nice sized comfy booth our server a very nice older gal came and took our order cornbeef hash/breakfast burrito for the wife the cbh was fair black bear diner has better and thats sad burrito ok not great
They've got a really varied menu for those that don't want sushi so that's nice
Not going to go wrong with any of the food choices for happy hour and the specialty drinks offer some cool choices also
We decided to try for Saturday Lunch and I thought the chicken wrap plate might be nice since the menu described it with jicama and pecans with chipotle mayo
The menu looked good-  Mike recommended the fish & chips which are a favorite of mine but I was leaning toward the crab reuben
I think the wine selection is less but the food choices are slightly expanded and the quality is wonderful
I don't see it on the on-line menu but there is this dessert listed on the menu in the restaurant that has me all excited and dying to try it but they have not had it available 3 visits now
The waiter bragged that their St Louis ribs were huge and had a lot of meat on them but honestly they were of average size
everything we had was excellentFood Quantity 3/5- maybe a bit under average portions for the price though it is a resort so they are taking advantage of that I'm sure
There were three kinds of soup lots of salad goodies really good chicken tenders pork ribs & lots of other things plus a big dessert selection
The goodGreat service friendly staffTasty well cooked pizza crust sauce & ingredientsGood variety of pizza toppingsDelish saladThe badSkimpy on the pizza toppingsI got a no-cheese pizza with red pizza sauce basil broccoli crimini mushrooms & tomato
My son and I had ordered small pizzas which I had assumed were personal sizes
turns out they were a medium Dominos sized pizza
They have a great selection of produce and dry goods plus the meat is always good looking
He said it's a new menu item and that seemed to be a normal wait time for food
I can't say that my lunch was bad but the large portion of Teriyaki Chicken  $4
Food- I had the cutter's choice cut of 1/2lb of beef brisket very nice smoke ring good fall apart meat bbq sauce there are two types spicy and original both have a good sweet bold taste
Although I could order off of the regular menu I was grateful for the lunch menu that offered several of their main dishes for a lunch time price which also helped me narrow down my entree of choice
Yes it's expensive but it's such a treat and I haven't found another organic grocery in town that has the quality produce salad bar cheese selection meats seafood etc
They also have great soup selection - I purchased chicken noodle split pea mushroom barley and egg flower and if you want a sweet treat without the guilt try Bubbies Homemade Mochi Ice Cream
We enjoyed everything from the food drinks & service that we decided to come back and try their dinner menu
They have a decent drink selection and lots of other italian items on the menu that I've never tried because the pizza is so good
Our server was very knowledgable about the items on the menu and gave my husband the advice of trying to half portions of the asian dishes he was debating between
It takes away from the food when you're being hit on by drunken bros that are twice your age or listening to Snookie's twin loudly explain last night's drunken hook up but generally they're too busy watching the game outside to encroach on your good time anyway
the salmon sashimi was drenched in so much sauce but still didn't mask that last day on the menu cut of fish
The menu is also inventive and I would highly recommend getting the appetizer pizza to start with hummus on the side
Beer selection was good LIITs were excellent - and even better we were pleasantly surprised by the food
It had great proportions of meat and noodles  yet it was missing something
Ya those one's with decent tasing food only because every single item on the menu was drenched in grease or butter
One is there's no conventional concession stand; this encourages you to buy food from the menu which averages about $10 per entru00e9e
Although there is an argument that the bbq pork had in fact been cooked once already so now they are using it in another dish with dark soy sauce and green onion it would satisfy the twice cooked portion
I had been dying to try True Food Kitchen for a while now after seeing reviews on it on various people's Vegetarian lists
I went with my somewhat reluctant meat-eating boyfriend but he was quickly won over with their expansive alcohol menu and their plethora of meat dishes- all either local or organic
The simple menu could do with something to compliment the otherwise good not excellent chicken strips
I will concede that their dessert menu does offer a few delights that I have been happy with
Stay away until they slim down the menu and try to specialize or at least only go for the desserts
The kal-bi had a nice flavor although I would have liked more or it in proportion to the chicken
The employees are very happy to answer any menu questions I've had about dairy fish sauce and other non-veg ingredients
So summing up bland food and small portions do not a memorable lunch make
YUM YUM YUM- Corned beef hash is canned and not homemade  sad face- Fried Chicken breakfast is a huge portion- tasted really well but definitely sad that they only have sausage gravy
The food is good- definitely 4 stars but the price compared to the portion size and tastiness is definitely 2 stars
Dessert was a vanilla flan not the typical Mexican version very small intensely delicious and a larger portion would have been over the top
What a great addition to the list of Ahwatukee food options
I have tried a few different menu items and it addition to enjoying good tasting healthy vegan food the portion sizes are quite generous and very reasonably priced
It was actually my third choice in desserts because the first two choices had sold out
He explained the menu items in detail along with the process used for the aging and smoking of the meats
I went looking for Dan Dan noodles and instead I get sweet potato fries A Korean street food delight the menu tells me
They completely redid the menu to be more hip and well food court mall-like but in a good way I think
Now onto their regular food I have tried many menu items and all have been good
The panko shrimp was very good as was the chicken parm my dinner companion ordered what a contrast to Asian menu items
Ambiance love itService attentive friendlyFood great menu with plenty of enticing optionsCocktails superbI ordered the Jalisco Sunrise
Most of us already know what to expect from a Costco but here are a few things I enjoy whenever I go shopping*extra large rotisserie cooked chickens for $5 very cheap dinner*Life size teddy bears for $30
It also took a huge amount of time to get our food but I understand that due to our party size and the fact that it was a holiday
The pros - fresh ingredients- attention to detail - variety of foods snacks goodies and drinksThe cons- expensive- location / parking inconvenientBrief reviewAll in all a good place to hang out and grab a drink with a friend when it's nice outside
Our waiter had recommended a roast beef and cheddar sandwich that is a Stockyards specialty instead but my husband did not listen to him
The food wasn't health conscious at all but if you're looking to fill up with calories and get a good-sized portion then this is your type of place
The prices and serving size of some of the sides seem a bit out of whack but in general it's better than Pete's Fish & Chips
but the atmosphere is completely different than any of these other Trendy sushi choices
Food ~ almost everything on their menu is either 4 or 5 stars
I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala pasty husband ordered the vegan pasty selection kid 1 ordered Chicken Alfredo it had bacon pasty and kid 2 ordered Potato Leek soup with fresh bread
Food was great - in fact we ordered another empanada and the portions were big
Came with an egg roll egg-fried rice and the entree nice lunch sized portion all for about $7 one pays that much for fast food these days
I had the opportunity to sample a variety of dishes and each one was out of the spectrum of my ormal for what I would order and each dish blew me away with its combination of unique fresh tasty  ingredients
Their menu is not huge but man is the chicken good
But why is everything on their menu a mock of regular meaty foods
- and overpricedLost our name on the seating list and was sooooo not worth the wait-When complained to the manager he made it seem like our fault that the sushi was so terrible
The HH  specials are half priced pizzas and half off any wine on the menu
The menu had a wide variety of tempting Asian treats but I was here for fish so I ordered the sashimi combo with a bowl of Miso
The fish tasted quite fresh and the portions were generous
She asked if we had been to Maui Dog before and when we told her we hadn't she handed us menus and told us a bit about the food and how to order
we ordered 1 of every pizza which was a great way to sample their menu
The mixed green salad with albacore tuna is also a delightful choice as is the turkey wrap and CA Chicken sandwich with pesto mayo
Church's has way better food than KFC in both selection and flavor not to mention a better price
I told them it was my first visit and they explained the menu and encouraged me to sample the food before ordering anything
JR size italian beef is more than enough for me Decent price close enough to work but there is another spot on the Arcadia side that is closer to home better service better hot peppers and even better price so now im going to change my rating to three stars
I have a choice between a few PetSmarts but I will be returning to this one for all of my fish needs
The food ranges from bean and cheese burros shredded beef tacos menudo on the weekends to chimichangas
They have a good selection of chemicals fish and coral food pellets and frozen tank supplies and live rock
- great neighborhood vibe - small and intimate with a modern Asian vibe than isn't overly 'faux-Japanese' or 'trendy'- quick friendly serviceThe Not so Good- the tuna sashimi tuna had the telltale mushy flavorless that comes from being previously frozen - the 'chef's choice' sashimi A white fish but we didn't get a chance to ask what it was was flavorless although not mushy
I may come back when the sushi urge hits and order off the daily special menu but it won't be a priority otherwise especially with all the great other restaurants popping up in uptown Phoenix
Otherwise the portions were unusual - some dishes really tiny and some way larger than expected
The food is great and the portions are a good size but wow bring your patience
I also had a muy delicioso bean and cheese burrito I ordered off the menu since the menu only features chicken fajita and carne asada burritos and the burrito was huge and very filling and had the perfect balance of beans and cheese
This is a fine place - the prices are decent for the amount of food you get it tastes pretty good and the menu is quite vast for a deli
We LOVE their pizza of the day special with a specialty salad of your choice
Putting everything aside both dishes were excellent and the portion was huge but we know that's due to them trying to gain loyal customers and it will only go downhill from here
The portion is ok but noticeably smaller compared to last time but the dish taste completely different
It was fun to pick out veggies like thai pumpkin and white mushrooms off a paper menu like you do with sushi
Dishes I was amazed by and no not in a good way-  Deep fried taro dumpling  Have never quite had it in that simplistic way before where the filling literally was just mashed taro held together by a prodigious amount of oil-  Steamed bok choy  How the heck do you get oil into steamed vegetable
I ordered the tamales but ordered two of the green chile variety instead of one of those and a beef one as the menu states
I've eaten Eggs pancakes turkey sausage Chirozos w/scrambled eggs steel-cut oatmeal fried catfish and of course biscuits - and will be back to try everything else on the menu
My food the pizza came out first even though on the menu it said to expect to wait longer for a pizza
Food is always good with a great selection
My go-to menu items are the Pablo Picasso salad the Nu00famero One-O on thin crust and a peanut butter pizza cookie
The rest of the meat selection is also no good
I'm not a huge sushi person but glancing over the menu
Entrees1 Burger Au Poivre II with peppercorns crumbled bleu cheese & bacon2 Picnic Chicken Sandwich sliced chicken breast sliced pears pecan halves Gorgonzola cheese mayonnaise mustard and Romaine lettuce on pumpernickel breadBoth were very good and the portions were big
Very limited menu with nothing you want except maybe guac 'cause the chips weren't even good and pretty pricey for the dog food beef you get
Desserts leave nothing to be desired though they are strangely listed first on the menu
They have a variety of food yummy bagel selection they even have somewhat of a convenience store area near check out
There is an amazing variety on both the food and drink menus to choose from
Best time is dinner in a booth not on a weekend and when you are really hungry as the food portions are generous
The waiter Tyler I think said that their version of pad thai with halibut was his favorite dish on the menu
We took some Thai food lovers here from out of town and they agreed it was as good or better as any Thai they'd had in a variety of cities
The sushi rolls on the menu were decent but not all that elaborate your basic rolls
Their take is more modern portions bigger per a la carte' and they now carry meat and a wide array of other alcoholic and non-alcoholic infused beverages
An interesting menu great food and a wonderful view
We were given the wine list the bottle list and a food menu
I hadn't so she explained that they had a  wine list a bottle list and a food menu
Now I had been rolling my eyes about Kazimierz since early afternoon when I read the yelp reviews and looked at their menu
The menu--when it doesn't get lost in pretention the above-mentioned handful of hazelnuts the precious drops of truffle oil that grace one of their pizzas is pretty exciting the bottle list is staggering and the service is cheerfully lackadaisical
I thought the vegetarian selection on the menu was limited I really wanted a red sauce pizza loaded with greenery but Quattro Formaggi Vegetariana and Margherita were my only options
I can't rate it higher because Malee's is too far a superior choice for me and using Malee's as the 5-star standard for Phoenix Thai food this instinctively comes in at a 3 which is my standard for good aka I'm not complaining but I'm not blown away either
I didn't eat a lot of comfort foods prior to becoming vegetarian like chili fries and burgers so I can understand some cynicism of Green gravitating toward these menu options
Menu caters to the brunch deli and pizza folks
I ordered the Baja Bowl which is described on their online menu as Southwestern chicken atop garlic rice black beans Monterey jack cheese and topped with lime sour cream and pico de gallo
It's the same idea with a limited food menu and a very extensive ice cream sundae/dessert/milkshakes/soda menu
The portions are large and they offer a wide variety of dishes
I can't believe each dish is 475 calories or less and the portions are still a good size
menu changes 4 times a year and features local fresh in 'season' food
Notice their menu starts with dessert too
The portions were generous and the quality of the food was about standard diner fare
They have enough food selections to classify them as a super buffet
As far as the food goes it was all pretty good with most of your typical Chinese buffet selections
I dislike meat on top of pasta or potatoes  because when you cut it you crush it into the pasta  The wine list was good the teramasu was good
TONS of selection prepared foods and so many options
Update We did go back and have the above selections and I got a Chicken Tikka salad to share
The toppings here are pretty limited but they do slice the meats to order and give you a choice of white or wheat bread
The lunch portion is smaller but it comes with a fried egg roll
This was just a big bowl of Menudo no meat no hominy
Considering this Mickey D's is one of very few choices to stop for food and restrooms on the way to/from Rocky Point we ended up stopping here twice over the long weekend
Huge portions reasonable prices great service and good food
It is reflected not only in his menu or dishes but in the entire way he operates his business
Our waitress with her ever present English accent informed myself and companion that the live sea urchin would not be on the menu as there was rough seas yesterday and their supplier could not fish
No matter what changes to the menu the chef makes over time this dish will always be there just ask Thomas Keller at the French Laundry if he can remove his pearls of tapioca or tuna ice cream cones from the menu
We somewhat left the fish courses for the second half of the menu as the braised veal with polenta arrived
I understand about the portion sizes but the quality of the food should still be there and I strongly urge them to reconsider their lead cooks if they're putting food out like this
Being quite hungry I asked if it was a fairly decent portion and she promised 3 generous portions of fish atop a mountain of fries
These 3 generous portions of fish were barely bigger than what you would get out of a Gordon's fish sticks box
Whilst perusing the menu we were pleasantly surprised with a gift of chicken liver/ port wine pu00e2tu00e9 with accompanying toast
There was a nice balance of noodles beef and vegetables and the portion size was very generous only 7
Went to Z Pizza with a vegan friend hoping to find something on the menu she could eat
They had a good variety of menu items appitizers ribs fish and chips fried shrimp salad sandwiches and pizza and pasta
The service has been really good both times I've been the people that bring the food to you have a real smile and when they ask if there is anything else they can get you- they actually stand still long enough to listen to your answer
The fish here has always been fresh just a little expensive and the portions are a wee bit skimpy
I basically refused to eat anything from the menu though I tasted some of my girlfriend's dish and the cheese crisp and stuck to chips and salsa
I tried some chicken chimichanga which was a pretty big size
I guess that's a good way to make extra money but all the items on their menu besides the pizza are top notch and would be perfect for anyone that truly knows quality when they are tasting it at any time of day
I'd love to see a veggie burger tofu entree or entree with an eggplant or mushroom main dish on the menu
Now if they only had pesto pizza on the menu
I found the prices to be pretty steep for smaller portions than most places and the food to be of only moderate quality
I hardly looked at the menu before deciding on the Special shredded beef tacos and a Corona
Without going into a huge story about all the times I've been here I'll just list all the food I love Portales Portobello Sweet Mash Boneless Chicken Wings late night menu only Cheese Crisp seasoned fries Spinach Salad Spicy Crab Cakes Green Chile Burger Habenero Burger it is good freakin spicy and comes with a glass of milk Tortilla Soup Green Chile Stew Chile Rellenos Carne Adovada Plate Green Chile Mac and Cheese late night menu Key Lime Pie and Basket of Sopas
It is filled with wine bars multiple margarita specialists sushi  steak and disposable income themed  establishments that cater to wealthy Jaguar / Audi SUV / Mercedes BMW 5 series and above/ crowd that continues on with conspicuous consumption
The next time we went we perused the dinner menu and got the FB pasta dish and the short rib
The pasta dish was kinda oily but the portion is pretty big
I would go back for lunch or happy hour since the food is pretty good and the items on these menus are priced pretty appropriately
Yep the word is slowly dribbling down the mouths of Phoenix foodies that Panne Bianco has now expanded into the old LUX location next door and they are open for dinner with a limited yet delicious selection of pizza's salads and pasta selections
The pizza selections here are more limited I was crushed
Looking at the menu for dinner its definatley not your everyday mexican food your going to see here
I order a creation called the Chicken Adobo not found on the menu which has chicken avocado bacon lettuce tomato and special sauce
50 which comes with 2 eggs and then 3 different breakfast selections such as French toast pancakes breakfast meats different breakfast potatoes
This buffet offers a large selection of food
and this particular store has the WORSE kept Betta fish selection
Well maybe not everyone I did not see if they had a good vegetarian selection but pretty much a good place to bring friends who dun eat certain meats like beef or seafood
That menu while small is full of interesting flavorful food
The first time I went when they opened I wasn't impressed with the food selections and slow service thus my first bad review
I still prefer Houston's quality of food/serfvice better BUT when it comes to menu selection price points ability to make reservations and THE DESSERTS
Sadly Memphis adds to the list of substandard food choices in the southwest valley
The meat was savory and seasoned well and my portion was so big there was no finishing it
My bro's seafood curry was a hefty portion as were all the rest of the dishes in our party but I wasn't a big fan of the flavor
Even though the food was good the portion sizes were very small
It's clean and has nice seating and good food and beer selections
If from the limited menu you think you can picture the four tubs of ingredients and sauces in the kitchen mixed in all the possible 10 ways on the menu it's because you can the Dole European Lettuces variety salad mix is the same on every single plate the same olives and olive oil or orange and apple wedges garnish every dish and the same bread yes it can be good if you buy it first thing in the morning is sliced and toasted to make you think it isn't as old and hard as it actually is
The menu offered a fairly broad range of Cambodian dishes and we planned to try a number of them
So the menu prices keep going up but the food quality investment is going down
The hot side portions are large but unless you pay extra you basically only get three things to eat - I much preferred the old Sweet Tomatoes where I could take a little of this a little of that some salad some soup some pizza some Italian some muffins
You may as well go to a full service restaurant where the food is cooked to order and there is more choice and you don't have to wander around in lines interminably
We didn't happen to partake in their drink menu but it looked pretty extensive-more drink options than food
As other reviews have stated the portions are definitely enormous for Japanese dishes
I want a decent portion of not-overly-sauced white meat chicken over a bunch of veggies
FOODI found the menu a little hokey to read but we went with it
You know what you're getting into menu-wise for Burger King but the art work is light-hearted and the place is open and quiet which makes a great dining experience for fast food
grrrr - leaves us going here or Donovan's all the time which btw has the bigger and better Manhattan on the happy hour menu - they use Woodford Reserve - mmm - but the food is limited and I find Mortons bar more cozy
The food is good better than I thought it would be and served in big portions
After being served water we both ordered the Turkey dinner each w/ a choice of side Mom chose the sweet potato crumble and I the macaroni and cheese plus a side salad and dessert cheesecake or upside-down apple pie- we both chose the pie
Drinks were on the cheap after 8pm every day with a revolving selection of  food specials
The three of us ordered dishes from three different parts of the menu
And it's all appropriate because when you see the large variety of foods and the low prices you'll definitely feel like celebrating
The selection was stellar and each of us thoroughly enjoyed our dessert
To fluff up the size of your dish the kitchen plops your eggs on top of the crappiest cubed potatoes I've ever had
I'm used to paying $12 a sandwich in New York because I know that the amount of meat piled on will be the size of my head
We took a to-go menu to a table to sit down so we could review everything and have an idea of what each specialty pizza was
Torn between three and four stars definitely needs the half here but I'm going to round down mainly because I was really annoyed with the small menu board and while it was good I doubt I'll be going here again as I can make a pesto foccacia pizza at home that just as good and only slightly more work
This thin crust personal sized pizza I had the meat Rustica was loaded with fresh ingredients and most enjoyable
We decided to go with the regular sized vegetarian pizza
You can find some traditional rolls but most of them are of the fusion variety
I must have looked like a deer in the headlights when I entered Meatballz because they asked if it was my first time in as they gave me a menu
Sure the tasty burritos the size of Mom's meatloaf should be worth a few kind words and their delicious guacamole is some of the best at a fast food style Mexican place that I have had
So I literally just reviewed 5th and Wine the Scottsdale place owned by the same proprietors that own this wine bar/bistro in Chandler which makes me a feel a bit repetitive since the menus are pretty much identical but I'll give you the Cliff Notes version of the food and drink review and then move on to what's unique about this place
FOOD Extensive selection of which was ordered1
Having never been there before I wasn't sure what to expect as some restaurants that participate in RW alter their portion sizes/dishes from the regular menu
the seating was although rather tight but the food was just a complete surprise from how quick it came out the presentation perfect portion size taste and cost
I am not a Latino/Mexican foody but the scallops black cod white bean puree green beans forget the mexican term on the menu and the fried banana were amazing
In addition we had the chicken parmasean which was average and the ravioli with meat sauce which is on my o fly list but everyone else seemed to enjoy it
It was tiny and the selection of foods were horrible
All in all though I had a good time I enjoyed good food and there was a ton of stuff on the menu that would bring me back
The Lil Sicilian cheese pizza I got was the perfect size I did have a salad and bread sticks prior thought
The pomodoro was indeed lite as described in the menu and really allowed for the pasta and fish to shine
Most dishes fall into the $15-25 range which is a good value for the quality and portion size
As surroundings go the place is like a muggy gym locker room but smaller in size and so poorly ventilated that you'll think that the proprietor's must think nothing of sitting in the humidity upon a toilet of a rest stop in Austin TX with their plate of food on their knees
I understand that they're trying to move tables but when we spend $16 each for medium size pizzas we'll take our time getting up from the table
There's awesome greasy hole-in-the-wall everybody-speaks-Spanish places like El Tlacoyo and Moreno's in Mesa; there's a variety of fast food places like Filiberto's and Someburros; you have you generic family restaurant Mexican like Macayo's Garcia's and Tia Rosa's; and then you have your niche places
My Classic pizza of choice is Prosciutto with mozzarella sauce and fresh basil and the now hubby enjoys the four meat pizza pepporoni ham salami and sausage
If you are looking for a filler or something with large portions for 8-12 bucks go here for average food
He told me that they were a good size so I ordered 2 rolls for myself -- the Volcano Roll and a Crab Crunch Roll
When the food arrived I was shocked at how small the portions were
The Volcano roll was tiny while the Crab Crunch Roll was average in size
I guess the size of the rolls depends greatly on the chef for the day
It was a decent portion of food and tasted great
We've been sitting at the sushi bar a lot lately and Moses will make you whatever you would like - even if it's specifically on their menu
Instead we buried our heads in the menu which offered a promising variety of eclectic dishes
The wine itself was delicious but with the USDA Choice all-natural grainfed Certified 4 Diamond Angus Beef it was to die for
The ribs are the shining star of their happy hour food selection - they are very flavorful and actually have a lot of meat on them
The food is always fresh portions are generous and the taste is amazingly authentic
Plus their milk shakes are excellent food is made to order and not under a lamp and if you stay and eat there seating is in abundance there are misters outside and the drink selection is plentiful
Loved the fact that you inform the chef of any food allergies or preferences in advance and you will get a unique menu of the day determined by the chef
The main reason to visit is the dessert menu which most of the reviewers have agreed
For someone who doesn't eat sushi much found out there are some very good choices besides the basics
The only other things that didn't blow me away were the cheddar bacon biscuits we didn't know they were going to bring table bread before the meal - asiago and whole wheat rolls that are plenty without ordering biscuits with dinner and the portion size on the side of grits
At a place like this everyone is tasting everyone else's food so the small portion of grits was a bummer
They would also try make slightly customized American dishes based on my desire if they are not on the menu so I thought that was awesome
My reason for downing them a star is only because the sushi wasn't made as carefully as I thought I remembered it and not because of the large size that you can't eat properly
I would surely come back and try other things on the menu their pizzas looked really good too
They have pretty good selection of food choices in addition to the regular subs/sandwiches
Food The wine list is probably the best in the west valley especially if you enjoy Chiantis I had the veal Oscar and my fiancu00e9 had the shrimp Bella Luna
They also don't have much variety as most of the maki on the belt is some variation of California Roll with a different topping
If I have to list a negative the only one I can think of is the food is consistently just a little better at the University location than the Dobson one
It comes with 3 pieces of nice sized catfish a heaping fries white bread lightly toasted and all the condiments you need
The menu is minimal about five different pizzas appetizers and salads
The chicken is probably the last thing I would order on this menu
The rice was oddly wet and smooshed down I could barely detect that it was rice the seaweed was mushy wet and stringy and my tempura shrimp roll was the size of a woman's fist
My wife and I returned for our 11th wedding anniversary and we ordered the frajitas for 2 chicken & steak combo I think is the best on the menu
Surprisingly I didn't get the 'hasn't been on the menu since G-d knows when' Flying Chicken Platter which I don't ever not get
I can't decide if Victor Bergeron the real life Trader Vic was any or all of the following- A shrewd capitalist genius who traded pittances of mediocre food for large sums- A C team stock trader who went long on 25% odds based on our dining experiences- A victim of continued posthumous branding that has brought shame to his name- A one-hit wonderquack who never surpassed or fully channeled his Mai Tai inventionHowever I have decided that I am comfortable leaving this islander mystery unsolved
The menu is a mix between vegetarian and meat dishes over rice or noodles
The salad was fresh and of a good size for an appetizer salad and my adult Mac and cheese was saucy with plenty of chicken bacon and mushrooms
Dined here again and was pleasantly surprised to see that they added more dishes to their already delicious menu
They at least have quarter chicken portions and the sides are accommodating You get a big ol' artichoke for your side which was decent and a bunch of whipped potatoes
I decided to stop by at this place with a friend of mine several months back-All we can remember was that service was acceptable food tries way too HARD and is very expensive for such small quantities- and we've both done extensive traveling and had amazing pizza this is not it
Thick pieces of sliced corned beef and potato topped with your choice of 2 eggs any way you like them over easy for me please
They take their delicious corned beef white onions mushrooms garlic and potatoes then spoon on sour cream and pair with 2 eggs your choice
When you order these you also get your choice of breakfast meat including bacon ham or sausage
The dessert we ordered was a ricotta cheesecake the menu read with cherries
And Carol the meatloaf is probably only on the menu for kids or adults who choose something safe sounding
I don't critic meatloaf even when it just 3 stars on a Asian/fusion/whatever-it-is menu
Me Listen can i just get a pizza with pizza sauce
They seem to have a real nice menu here quite a few options of food and drinks
I wasn't sure if it would be clean safe or my thing but it's actually surprisingly cool there's always a bunch of families there so it's not a place people start trouble the main hub where the projectors are based and the food and bathrooms are is a decent size and the bathrooms for men don't know about womans were clean without an issue
From the Restaurant Week menu I picked the salad and salmon Matt picked the French onion soup and filet mignon with bacon we both decided on the 10-layer carrot cake for dessert
-nantucket bay scallops served with gnocchi chorizo corn avocado and confit tomato great choice-amuse bouche #10 - bubblegum and lemon passion fruit lollipops-amuse bouche #11 - strawberry souffle served with a banana creme anglaise-amuse bouche #12 - vanilla whipped cream with a candied mint leaf - oooh; one of our favorites-brown sugar polenta - amazing dessert
What is also nice about this location is the variety of fast food options available nearby
DISHES PREPARED WITH LISTED HEAT LEVEL ONLY
Gyro meat was pretty good portions were large and I liked the Tazaki sauce
also on the special menu right now there's a salad called the mediteranian chicken salad which really truly may be the most incredible salad i've ever eaten in my life
Everything was beautifully plated in portion sizes that are appropriate for such rich flavorful food
The happy hour menu has enough cheap food items to fill up on and the last time I was there our group ordered at least one of everything
The menu includes salads sandwiches and pizza
The slice was a runt as the waiter described it and swore most slices were larger - he then brought out a second runt for half price to make up for the small portion of food
They have a great beer selection full bar and an extensive for a bar food menu
Regular Menu is a bit pricey portions could be larger but food is great
They have a good variety of dishes to choose from all prepared with fresh ingredients and all perfectly cooked and attractively presented
in drag crowds of cute women out for a girl's night out buff dudes in t-shirts 2 sizes too small a few burly ladies in cropped hair here and there sad old lonely chicken hawks in salt n' pepper mustaches reeking of desperation and then of course me and the other awkward straight guys not really sure why we're there
You are sitting in a lovely place with fresh flowers and quality food where the napkins are linen the salad plates are chilled and the wine list is extensive and extremely reasonable
My friends and I have spent SO many evenings enjoying great food and incredible wine on Lisa's patio that I think I could recite her menu aloud
Ray's does have a great variety of gourmet style pizza
It tries to cover the Asian gamut by offering some choices of Thai and Japanese food
You won't find sushi here but you can get a big bowl of udon and there are a variety of thai curry sauces to choose from
Other dishes on the menu are just as delicious but for me when I go to a pho place it's all about the pho
Prices are cheap menu is mostly focused on burgers chicken sandwiches malts and shakes
The atmosphere is fun their selection of music is amazing and the food is excellent
But damn if I had a choice these dishes may just be the ones I'd want to eat before my final goodbye
The menu has all the regular americanized Chinese dishes
It had a huge portion of meat covered with Swiss chesse and grilled onions
The menu is a bit intimidating - it has 15-20 pages of dishes but they staff is willing to help you make up your mind
The outside of the normal sized cake for my family and my 8 year olds to enjoy had some sort of crushed nuts rolled all around it
The menu is not extensive but most of the dishes looked appealing
It was a choice of chicken or beef with some carrots shallots onion in a great tasting sauce
There was just enough food for a lunch size portion
We tried several items on the menu chicken and fish tacos shrimp burrito memelita with chorizo and a campechano taco
The big winner for me was the memlita a disc of lightly cooked masa covered with black beans some queso fresco and topped with the meat of your choice
We walked past it intent on our destination of choice when we we were no longer able to continue succumbed by the intoxicating smell of smoked meat
I had the buffalo chicken snackers/sliders which came with the salad bar which was fresh and had some variety; however not worth $9 on it's own
So diners I still consider this place a good choice for authentic foods
Back before they got bought out I used to go all the time but once they took my favorite dish macaroni rosa off the menu I got sad and now I don't go as often
My list of Buca favorites besides the macaroni rosa includes the chicken limone chicken parm ravioli with meat sauce and green beans
Had to ask for the Yelp Eats menu oddity #1 as all the other restaurants I've visited since the start of it all had hosts/servers deliver them w/ the YE menu on the very top of the pile and when the host handed it over I noticed a sticker that asked not to share dishes- oddity #2
50 and asked server Ana about certain dishes and she demonstrated great knowledge of both food and beverage menus kudos to Ana
She even pointed to the app portion of the menu the second time and again I said I was only going to order the entree as I'd wanted to leave room for dessert
The meat section is ok but it doesn't shine when it comes to quality and selection
If you are looking for good brick oven pizza Patsy Grimaldi's is a nice choice
Bun to meat ratio on the one third of a pound variety was right there with just the right amount of condiments for my tastes
I haven't tried everything on the menu yet but the lamb souvlaki and the Keftides meatballs were great
But it's not portions that make great food it's taste so one star off for that
there is a large variety of collectable rock and roll memorabilia on the walls signed by a variety of artists
I peak into the other room and there is a sushi chef slicing up some tuna I also see a pizza menu
I sometimes opt for the Sicilian slice special when it happens to be a meat-free variety
With the girl our order of choice is the Hummus with Grilled Chicken and the Fruit and Cheese Fantasia
They have a great selection of breads meats condiments and chips
You go up to the dude at the sushi bar and pick whatever you want off of the menu and he makes it
The buffet had a great selection and I was able to try new dishes that I'd never tried before
Salads chicken & filet of tuna sandwiches are on the menu
I know it's New Mexican cuisine and not technically Mexican but it satisfied the gaping hole in my heart for delicious Mexican food of the variety I enjoyed while living in So Cal
I had each of the tacos in the taqueria menu- fish pork carne asada and veggie
You should know that you can ask for any meat on the salad even though it's not listed that way on the menu
And while the dinner menu is a bit small the food was excellent and reasonably priced to boot
The food is very VERY good and the prices are reasonable for the large portions they serve
Pro'sSuperb serviceMouth watering steaks and foodAttention to detailConsPrice - but typical for a gourmet steak houseThey really lay-on the wine suggestions even after you declineIf you haven't gone I think it is one of the BEST places on the list for Restaurant Week
We had the 5 cheese plate you choose 5 cheeses from a list accompanied by dried fruits and lavosh crackers the green chili pork stew delightfully spicey with chunks of potatoes tomatoes red onion and just the right amount of cilantro the C4 Signature salad mixed greens with pulled chicken mangoes avocadoes and an amazing habanero raspberry dressing and
They have an extensive array of seafood including fresh raw oysters chilled shrimp  smoked salmon and scallops
They also have a VERY extensive selection of desserts even some sugar free desserts
I was also happy to find a cheese and meat menu
The choices were not many and the food was not good
They had fried chicken wings the size of my pinky
I got the california chicken sandwich-which was overloaded with spices-no mention of spices on the menu and my husband had the build your own Angus burger
They also stock about a dozen beers on tap and a decent food menu
When a counterperson asked me what kind of mayo/dressing I wanted on a chicken salad sandhich and I asked her what the choices were she pointed to 8 different bins all of which looked tasty but none of which I recognized
The menu offers other items beyond your basic pizza
I'm generally a fan of pizza and paninis so Hanny's menu does not bother me like many have noted
Fogo is going to the top of my five star list for it's outstanding service mouth-watering meat  GF friendly and THE SEXIEST salad bar
The food is awesome with a pleasant selection of vegetarian and even vegan fare for those folks conscious of animal harm the menu changes fairly regularly to incorporate new specials which is a huge plus for anyone with an adventurous palate and the service has always been cheerful and attentive on the occasions that I have visited
I also appreciate that Jackie makes an effort to have a seasonal option on the menu at all times and prices all the food at what seems to be a very fair value considering the quality of the food
I would love to say more about the menu but me and BFF can only bring ourselves to order the Buffalo Chicken Dip
We tried quite a bit off the menu thanks to corporate Amex and the stand outs were the 4 meat burger duck sandwich chicken sandwich housemade pickles chickpea fries and the watermelon salad
For the quality and the attention to detail that is spent to create the variety of cocktails and food the value is definitely justified
I ate here with my sis n her hubby bubba it was good i have not ate at one of these places for a long time i skipped over pizza section of the menu and had the jambalaya not sure how to spell it but it was good could of been spicier i prefer mine with rice instead of pasta either way it was yummy to scarf down like i hadnt eaten for a week also had some appetizer items asparagus n arugula salad light n yum n some guac n chips also fresh and tasty and some egg rolls of some sort also on the app menu they were too effin good
Dessert was a steamed chocolate cake that was dry as a bone served with a table spoon size scoop of banana ice cream
We have been many times before and the menu has been more inspired and so has the food
I have tried most things on the menu from spicy beef empanadas to the NY strip steak or the slow roasted pork
and soup is good when your sick and the portions are large I also went ahead and got my regular crab puffs and orange chicken
The selection of food is relatively small but all the food is far superior to what you would find at any other pet store

I've tried a few things on the menu but keep returning to the chicken with pesto risotto
The food menu is fairly limited but that's actually a fantastic thing
I've so often eaten at beer focused spots that have giant menus with nothing but really terrible food to offer
That small detail didn't occur to me at the time until perusing the menu and realizing that almost everything includes seafood or is cooked in coconut oil or offered with a peanut sauce
I was hoping to try the spicy squid which the other reviewers were raving about but it was no longer in the menu so I tried the spicy beef instead; it was a tasty stick-to-the-ribs meal especially with the kimchi and spicy beansprout sides that came with it
Apparently they had shortened the menu and raised the prices a buck since the last reviews that mentioned the eatery so that the meat entrees cost a penny short of 10 bucks
The pizzas were also ok but no one was ready to rave about their pizza at the end of the meal EXCEPT for the fig pizza sorry I don't have the official name because it's not on their website/dinner menu
I don't know when I eat sushi I don't really want to listen to what's on 97

I love greek food and I love big portions but yet I would still just rate this place 3 stars
When you first take a peek at the sushi menu you may be put off a bit
Unlike other places who will serve nigiri with massive mounds of rice for a variety of cheap reasons Hana's servers give you a nice big cut of fish with just a little rice
If you're an adventurous eater there are some great special fish off the menu too- check the lists up above the sushi bar
Having just moved here from the Bay Area where there is a Whole Foods almost everywhere I have to say it was a pleasant surprise to see things here not in the CA stores like the wine/tapas bar the cooking demo station in the hot foods area and a wider variety of pre-cooked/smoked meats and chilis
It's the same menu as the Phoenix location and Peter got the Nay-Nay's $8 with waffles eggs and grits my pal ordered a chicken breast $4 too
The menu is expansive beyond just pizza though falling into the category of gourmet bar food

The selection isn't as large as some other sushi restaurants that's why I didn't put five stars but you can't beat the price

The menu has all the favorites you would expect  but you want to get the chicken wings

I was with someone who keep kosher which eliminated all but a few options at the end of the meal we mentioned this and were told that accommodations could have been made to any dish on the menu shame on us for not asking earlier
We sat in the bar area which came with an additional menu of bar food and instructions on how to use it
Probably because the prices aren't bad the menu looks like it should be excellent and the quality of the food isn't that bad considering the restaurant is quick service

The Why  Helmed by Chef Cullen Campbell and highly praised by local palates I respect Crudo seems to have all the things I'd hope for in a local restaurant; high quality sourcing a strong sense of community and a unique but focused menu - in this case raw seafood hand pulled mozzarella and house-made pastas
Additionally while speaking of my waitress considering the fact that I was obviously interested in the food it would have been nice if she acted more interested in me as a diner - instead she did not inquire even once as to how I enjoyed a dish and asking questions felt more like attempting to drag forth information while she instead spent time describing the menu at length to a needy woman who wanted all her dressing on the side and modifications to myriad dishes
Porkbelly - smoked tomato agrodolce  Fatty and funky with crackly skin resting atop toothsome and creamy polenta this was pork belly as it should be and showing a deft hand with tomatoes for the fourth of my five prix-fixe courses the smoked reduction here cut the fat perfectly - simply a great dish and a surprisingly large portion
All of their food is surprisingly well-priced considering the portions you get taste and presentation

Desserts were slushes also not properly described on the menu
The food is alright there are dishes on the menu that you won't find in normal thai cuisine like the Crispy Calamari Salad although it was good
They happened to be doing a promotion on mini rolls which was just perfect for us given how indecisive we tend to be when presented with such variety

But Guanaquito has a larger menu with more Salvadoran and Guatemalan dishes
I've had everything on the menu at least twice and it is always consistent never had a bad dish or bad time
They are like the size of a normal appetizer that is not on steroids- Clam chowder or creamy chicken and artichoke soup - Believe it or not their clam chowder is the best I have ever hadEntrees- Chicken Costelleta- Chicken Chipotle Pasta- BBQ Ranch chicken salad- Salisbury chopped steak- Crispy spicy beef- Bang bang chicken and shrimp - Only order this if you like Indian spice flavorsKeep in mind that everything is massive in size so in my opinion the prices are pretty decent for the amount of food you get

I would describe their menu as traditional Mexican food with a twist
Food was well-portioned and delicious --everyone raved about the chef's creations and no one took home doggie bags
Sushi was slightly undersized in portions and yes even for classic Japanese standards but when the bill came it reflected the size fittingly leaving no thoughts as to it being over-priced
Food on the 15 minutes or it's free menu actually do come out at  15 minutes on the dot
The food court COULD offer a bit better selection although with Paradise Bakery and Pita Jungle in the mix I'm definitely not complaining

Their roast beef is an excellent choice too hot or cold
If you can afford it and understand that pricey doesn't always mean a large portion but does mean excellent food then I highly recommend The Compass Arizona Grill

But this is definitely in my top 3 choices for Chinese food
I'm not going to tell you that the rolls are amazing the nigiri mind blowing and the alternative menu super creative
Portions are balanced and food is tasty & presented well
Taste  There were many many delicious choices on the menu and sadly the food is not as appealing as billed on the menu
If you're accustomed to filling up on a sandwich made with normal-sized slices I suggest ordering a half sandwich so you can sample a side of soup salad or dessert as well

To finish off your meal order the coconut flan dessert; a delicious combination of custard and coconut in delicate proportions
The place is well-lit clean and have very unique choices since the chef likes to create new dishes

That's a good indication of what's to come if the chef if is that confident in his food that he assumes you will like what's on the menu
They have an awesome selection of fresh kielbasa as well as many other ethnic foods both fresh and frrozen
We had the four course 'Yu' tasting menu with a complimentary chef's dessert every single dish was to die for
What we had today might not be yours even if you ask for the same four course tasting menu because the chef receives different fish and other ingredients based on availability and seasons but no matter what you have i'm sure it'll be just as amazing
If you MEAN flatbread pizza you should say that on the menu
The serving of spaghetti with meat sauce was a nice size serving as well
The place is minimal and nothing special but what does make this special is their staff and of course their food it is not great but just good enough to fulfill your need of Buffet Chinese Food they have many selections i would have to say about 20 different offerings i have never seen any buffet offer Egg Foo Young and that was such a great treat only because i love the dish
Food is very average and the menu is quite decorative
However they have a pretty good selection of other foods - the seafood section had crawfish king crab legs fried crab shrimp periwinkle scallop salad on the shell and cooked salmon

The food portions are pretty large so I would definitely suggest sharing

Their complimentary chips are delicious and they don't give too large a portion so as to avoid not having room for the main dish
The chicken and peppers were roughly cut in all sizes
I am excited to see what kind of dishes end up on the permanent menu
The food meets expectations but the portion is very French
The menu describes it as a sandwich construct of grilled chicken breast green bell peppers jalapenos black olives and cheddar cheese
It's a solid choice if I need a quick pizza but it's typically a bit too greasy with no flavor to the crust
The sides were nothing exceptional but on the key portion of the mean the carnitas the food excelled
I never will work through the Dilly menu for the simple fact that I am addicted to the BBQ Chicken Blazing Buffalo and if I am feeling quirky the Dilly Bird

They bake all sorts of delicious treats daily and they have a food menu outside of the restaurant
Everything on the menu works as comfort food
The mac-and -cheese appetizer is comfort food nirvana the lobster bisque is the best I have had bruch is relaxed with a choice of everything from pancakes chiliquiles to burgers
As for the store part if it they have a huge selection of things haven't shopped there much but the food never fails
The food is decent and they serve large portions; you'll have leftovers to take home
There are several choices for fish tacos and have always been cooked well for me
I do however LOVE the Pad Thai with chicken and tofu and everytime I order it I'm in heaven   The portion is huge seriously enough for 2-3 meals the flavor is excellent it's a little greasey which adds to the texture of the rice noodles the chicken breast pieces are more than abundant and the tofu has a fabulous texture
I like the fact that Pei Wei also rotates in new menu items Sesame Chicken is new and you can order brown rice as an option
It is so refreshing to see vegetarian food with variety flavor and creativity
as far as reliable food with good service near the university this looks like a very good choice
Whether it's a traditional selection or a grilled pork or chicken sandwich you won't be disappointed
The serving sizes on the meats was very generous given the price
Why would a sushi restaurant not have any rolls on their happy hour menu
Ordered the Shrimp Tempura Climax Roll spicy tuna topped with tuna and macadamia nuts Bay Island Roll california roll topped with bay scallops and Calamari which was the only thing we ordered off the happy hour menu
They always have their signature sandwiches and pizzas but the menu changes daily -- something I love in a restaurant
Sugar cane pork chicken lollipops and quail all turned out to be good choices
got the Holy Basil Chicken which we all agreed was the best choice
The desserts are actually listed at the top of the menu so they stand-out - for good reason
Items broken and reported with issues are a broken fan in the gazebo a broken sprinkler head that flooded the area around it a faulty light in one of the common areas that strobed in an irritating fashion outside our balcony a washing machine that had gashes in the rim that would snag clothes a dishwasher that would etch dishes and never clean them properly and was characterized by maintenance staff as more of a dish rinser than a dish washer gates to the complex were frequently broken no remote was provided to the gates and ultimately we received one remote that had to be replaced multiple times before we finally got a working one air conditioning breaking on a hot day and not looked at until 6pm when the issue was reported that morning maintenance guys using very loud gas powered leaf blowers at 7am on a Sunday and other mornings and the list goes on and on
Probably the healthiest sandwich on the menu besides the grilled chicken
As I see it portion sizes of tasty food like Five Guys are contributing to America's obesity epidemic
That local does have an excellent building and decor and for a time identical food just in smaller portions but having two waitress/waiters for lunch rush lead to bad service and the cook change threw off the taste
Our server Alexis was very attentive friendly fast and really knew the menu or at least was good at selling every dish with a very thorough description about the technique and flavors used to create it
The food is served in small portions at a high price
It took five plates and a dessert to create a fair size meal for just two people
Especially the House Spicy Chicken described on the menu as finished with a spicy garlic sauce
The menu itself is GIGANTIC HUGE COLOSSAL ok not in a Cheesecake Factory way but definitely more than you'll find at a hole-in-the-wall quick order-by-numbers place ie #1 w/ chicken and #27 w/ shrimp
It's also odd that you think your going o eat a country breakfast and you see egg rolls on the menu
The fish is the same as the fish and chips and the portion on that entree is huge
The menu choices are the usual suspects of basic bar fare chips and dip nachos wings of several varieties with a large section of sandwiches pizzas sandwiches etc
Being so stuffed I didn't get a chance to try their mangoes and sticky rice but it's on my list since it's one of my favourite foods ever
They have a lunch menu served daily til 3pm including weekends that have the same dishes for $6
Between the covered parking bulk selection and good prices I personally think they are better than the Whole Foods down the street for staple items and while their prices are higher for some of the esoterics that actually helps in my case to prevent me from buying more oils vinegars spices etc that will sit in my cupboard indefinitely
The basicsGood selection of Korean Chinese Japanese and Indian goodsLarge produce departmentSmall-ish seafood counterSmall-ish onsite bakeryThe prosA nice variety of produce that is typically very fresh and very affordableOodles of noodles
I also looked at the menu online ahead of time and wrote down all the ingredients I wanted in my roll before coming in
This sauce was draped over a decent-sized portion of Chicken-Fried Steak and topped with a small pile of melting cheddar cheese
Plus when I came here with a friend we ordered drinks and some tapas which I've come to learn over the years is the American translation for tiny portions of food at rip-off prices as opposed to what I expect in real tapas in Europe
Lastly they have a good selection of Boba tapioca flavors I personally prefer mango and desserts
I believe it's part of a large chain of restaurants of the better-than-Red-Lobster-but-not-by-much white tablecloth variety and while the service was quick and friendly the food was pretty bland
I do remember them having a decent selection of food for Happy Hour but their wine list was nothing special and in the end we ended up eating again an hour or two later
The food is limited but supplemented by fresh popcorn made even tastier by a wide variety of flavored toppings
It's a little pricey and their dessert menu leaves a lot to be desired but their frigging veggie burger is the most delicious one in the Valley
This platter had a variety of meats including a wonderful chicken schnitzel German potatoes red cabbage  brats in assortment  and sauerkraut that tasted nothing like that stuff from a jar
Every dish was great and the portions were huge
If you're a Downtowner who yearns for a handcrafted sandwich featuring high-end meats and cheeses on a variety of fresh-made breads you can do a whole lot worse than this tried and true Downtown Phoenix lunch spot
I would like more food offered or maybe just a different selection
Great location cozy ambiance eclectic wine and spirits menu and absolutely stellar food
We ordered take out and the portions were definitely not large enough to warrant the price they charge and the food can best be described as bland

But be warned - The portions are very small so - if you can eat -  be prepared to spend about $70 per person - just on food
They have an incredible menu filled with traditional sushi/sashimi and with your more contemporary rolls including the old standbys like Alaskan rolls spicy tuna Dragon etc
Would give it one star but the other star is for easy to navigate store location down the street from my work and cheap and good selection in the food department
For the price the size of the rolls make RA look like preschool meals
The way I see it is I have about 10 more rolls to explore then Ill move on to the actual cooked menu
Also the desserts are made daily so they are not listed on the menu
Food The food has always been good and good portions for the price
The prices were reasonable and the menu offered your traditional Mediterranean dishes
I reserved via OpenTable and wrote a note in the reservation that it was her birthday and specifically requested for there to be a nice dessert to celebrate the occasion; nothing special-made off the menu necessarily just whatever kind of cake they would have that night
So I was wrong- everyone enjoyed the quality of the food and the great menu specials
The food is amazing and their wine list is impressive
The servers are very pleasant the food portions are good
at the first food truck event I was planning when I could check out the full menu
Being new to Filipino food the menu was intriguing and maybe a little intimidating
I guess that crowd who was coming in to get their 5 course wine and food pairings didn't want to listen to the game
For the quality and variety of sushi/appetizers you can order it is WELL worth the price
I think we got a bit greedy and underestimated the portion sizes of each roll
The beers are cold you can order the MAN size or girl size nice marketing ploy  The food was better than I had anticipated with large portions and full of flavor
The sandwich and salad menu looks awesome with sandwiches boasting of roast sirloin and the finest long line caught Albacore tuna center cut all white meat
Great food solid local bottled-beer selection though I'm hoping for drafts at some point
Yes there's a section for Italian food on the menu
I ate sushi here so my review only applies to this portion of the restaurant
Would this be my first choice for a fast food burger
The meats they toss in here aren't typically what you'd find on mom's dinner table so make sure you read the menu and are cool with those
Not a McDonalds 15 cent hockey puck from a paper bag mind you but a for real sit in the booth and behave yourself until your food comes my God look at the size of that thing bacon cheeseburger
This was our opportunity to have good food of our choice without having to deal with all those guys
The food prices become not just realistic but downright deals - though the pours are still just for people pretending to drink
If this place was outside of the airport it would not garner itself 4 stars due to the limited menu and the overpriced food
My guess is their pizzas and calzones are better than the rest of the menu
Upon reading various reviews about Chef Gross we were both very impressed by his awards varying from Open Table's Diner's Choice Local Eats 2010 and Phoenix Magazine's review to Food & Wine Magazine's Top 10 Best Chef as well as a James Beard Award Winner his resume speaks volumes about his food
First course was a perfectly butter poached scallop in a leak butter sauce that was dreamy second came the generously packed truffle risotto third was the large portioned foie gras and mushroom soup fourth was the extra tender lamb with a squash hash Chef inserted the cheese course consisting of the manchego aged cheddar Humboldt Fog and Valdeon blue and of course the final dessert course and we chose the chocolate tower and berry tart
I had a fabulous dinner salad with chicken whose name escapes me their website doesn't list the menu and is useless so no help there
I've eaten a lot of fine dining over the years so small portion sizes do not bother me as long as the food quality is there
I unfortunately got no smokey flavor from the meat but the texture and portion made it ok
Big portions good meats but I need that sweet sweet smoke

I mean typically you would expect to get a decent portion or some tasty food for $10 at lunch
Had the all-you-can-eat beef ribs and thought it was solid with portion so generous that I couldn't take them up on the offer for refills
The decor is relaxing unlike typical mom and pop places where I feel a bit uneasy the selection is great you can tell them to cook it anyway you like with beef or veggie etc
If their portion size for regular food items is any indication then the desserts are huge too
The breakfast menu is filled with comfort foods like chicken 'n dumplings and biscuits and gravy but I always opt for the standard scrambled eggs and potatoes
I hate to admit it but Whole Foods has a much better selection of EVERYTHING
The beef stew and hominy are choice and all come with fry bread
Only negative is the Graze restaurant not a very good selection of items to choose from especially when you are catering to families staying here I tried only two items and was not overly impressed with food or prices but I'm sure there will be those that disagree with me
The fish selection is the best I have seen
The coral selection is very good as well although not as exceptional compared to other local fish stores
I was very impressed with the selection of food as well as the prices
melon salad needed a little salt to bring out the flavor if you don't have salt on the table you need to get it right  had the fish trio the portions of ahi and butter fish were very small the salmon was a bit bigger all were cooked correctly and tasted good the rice was served on a seperate plate which made mixing with the sauces akward the bok choy side consisted of one leaf must be running low
I was impressed by there happy hour prices until I experienced some of their happy hour specials first hand my friend got the nacho's I personally could of made better nacho's at home I mean these things really looked like they cost less then 5 dollars the chips here are so salty I would need a gallon of water to eat the whole dish the salsa seemed fairly good and fresh and the shrimp tacos I had were not bad even though I did expect some larger portions for 13 bucks
Food was good but serving sizes were small and disappointing
There were so many items on the menu I wanted to try that I'll give them the benefit of the doubt even though their pizza is ridiculously expensive and smells awful both time what are the odds
They have a wide variety of pizzas and all of them are good
Food was exquisite as ever menu to follow below
I just love the fun vibe here which is carried through to both the cocktail and sushi menus
As it's the only vegetarian sushi option that I found on the menu I ordered it hoping for more than the usual carrot cuc and
I dislike onions and was a bit cranky that about half the total mass of this dish was onions despite not being mentioned on the menu
Below is the menu choices that we had on offeringFirst CourseSmoked Paprika Braised Pork Shoulder Queso Cotija Guacamole Shaved Baby Radishes Korabuta Pork Belly Butternut Squash Hash Tamarind Peach Glaze Hand Rolled Porcini Gnocchi Maitakes Ginger Cabbage Black Bean Miso CreamSecond CourseGrilled Romaine Fried Rainbow Valley Egg Spanish Anchovies Capers Raisins Roasted Striped Beets Gala Apples Horseradish Cream Prairie Breeze Amish Cheddar Applewood Smoked Duck Breast Peaches Sweet Corn Cranberries Almonds Arugula Frisee *Add $5Third CourseGrilled Pork Porterhouse Spaetzle Spaghetti Squash Bacon Brussel Slaw Amish Asian Pear Butter Niman Ranch Tri-Tip Steak Roasted Fingerlings Baby Rainbow Carrots Black Mesa Ranch Feta Caper Aioli Wild Caught Market Fish White Beans Cherry Tomatoes Fennel Baby Spinach Green Goddess SwordfishNow on top of this there were a couple items on top of the normal menu there were Sweetbreads for the First Course +5 supp and there was another option for the second course but I do not recall what it wasCourse 1 - I had the Sweetbreads which were had a sauce that was delicious i cannot remembe what kind the good kind with a plum apple slices to freshen it up for some acidity and they had a cornmealish fried texture to them -- I had been to Blackbird 1 star Michelin Chicago who also served up a sweetbread 1st course and this preperation blew it out of the water and that was our favorite app we had there -- Also they gave a very good portion size as well this was not a Restaurant Week portion to make tons of money this was their normal portion just at a discounted price - one thing that always drove me crazy about RW is that many places don't put their best foot forward and try to make a quick buck instead of trying to gain return clientsThe Mrs had the Pork Belly which I have to say was one of the best pork belly's i have had in a very very long time
For some reason I expected warm duck but it was chilled duck with just a light touch of smoke to set off the flavor against the tangy peaches and sweet corn it was amazing and way better than what i had pictured in my head - there was also TONS of duck in it every bite huge piece of duck - just greatThe Mrs had the Grilled Romaine with Anchovies which was also very good nice anchovies on it and she really liked it however the duck salad was where it was at - our friends wife went with the off menu salad and she really liked it I passed on trying it because it wasnt beating the duck saladCourse 3 - 3 of us had the Grilled Pork Porterhouse which was one of the best pork dishes that I have had the only other one that i would rank up there when they had it on the menu was the Stuffed Pork Chop at Cowboy Ciao no longer on the menu this was was equal to it or better they cooked it pretty close to medium rare which is perfect for me and everything about it was good lots of flavor - The Mrs had the steak when Todd was explaining the menu he was very elaborate about everything on the menu and then he was like we have steak too so that was really on the menu because you have to have a steak on the menu - It wasn't bad but when all the other flavors on every other course is off the charts just a good steak isnt the same - however as a good husband I gave multiple pieces of the Pork Porterhouse to Mrs Dapumacharacter limit
The menu is set up with a cold shellfish section first courses specialties of the house and a more typical steakhouse menu with a range of steaks and sides
You really can't go wrong with anything on the pizza list

I haven't tried this place until tonight even though it's one of three choices of food nearest to the house
Bite for bite this was probably my favorite dish of the morning but showing a bit of restraint given the day of eating yet to come I was glad to let some of it go home with my friend - to call the portion 'generous' would be an understatement to say the least
I cant get my oversized Coach bag around your three screaming kids in your giant stroller

on requestThey have a variety of specialty rolls as well that vary in price from $3 - $7
They also serve a sort of Vietnamese-Chinese fusion menu with spring rolls Pho stir-fry etc
I couldn't find anything to give me the size of the park but the lake itself is 25 acres which apparently is the largest of Arizona's designated Urban Fishing Lakes  There are like 6 different kinds of fish there including Catfish tilapia rainbow trout and yellow bass
If I were rating on food quality alone ~ All of the dishes were easily 4 star quality - good portions very tasty excellent flavors & great variety from which to choose
** It just hit me that tomato isn't listed in ingredients and now that I'm reviewing the menu closer on-line it does state in small print Not all the ingredients of each dish are listed; we ask that you inform your server of dietary restrictions before ordering
Granted I was probably going to like LOTS of food at this hour but the portions are crazy big and the bartenders are cool and chill unlike other old town spots
You can order anything from the menu and they will replace the meat with either crispy or boiled tofu
The selection is pretty good & you order at the counter & then pick up your food when it's ready to take over to the table to eat
so I opted for the Grilled Chicken Burger off the Gringo menu
Anyway the food is mediocre but oh boy do they have a great tequila selection
The prices are a little steep when it comes to the food and the size of the portions except for Joe's Big Breakfast but it's farm fresh and I'm okay to spend just a little bit more when it's just me and the hubby
I ordered the emerald chicken then I get the choice of being served over rice or in a quesidilla I chose the dilla

But the menu said it was fennel roasted pork sirloin rapini Scamorza cheese Serbian lepinja roll pickled vegetables
Coach & Willies is a nicer sports bar with an awesome food menu & is walking distance from Chase Field really walking distance as in we managed to walk in 105 degree weather
This is a must get dish whether you get the full size as a meal or the half size as an appetizer
Solid food choices great happy hour beer prices and lots of room for large groups Bobby Q's is one great place
Not sure if it was because I am getting more accustomed to the dishes served or the choices made by the folks I was with
It may well take another ten trips or so before I become actively involved in the food selection
The waitress was quite thorough explaining that my girlfriend or daughter could not order from the children's menu because they were over 12 so they split an order of mini chimichangas and I asked for my favorite the Chicken Diablo
Even though it was not specified in the menu online I was pleased that the first course was supposed to be shared since most of the restaurant week menus at other places we had gone ended up being way too much food
Their lunch buffet is one of the most diverse I've ever seen from an Indian restaurant with 2 rice dishes bryani and basmati several vegetable dish choices and several meat choices
My pal enjoyed her little personal-sized pizza as well
I could understand the offense if I had forgotten to include the info or if I had multiple orders that made it hard for him to keep track but a mistake on the second of two dishes and with a list of allergens on a note right under your nose as a reminder
Friendly customer service every time a great selection of dog food and your 10th bag is free and dog toys that you won't find elsewhere
They had a cherry tomato salad to start - was fresh and tasty a choice of steak or halibut for the entree - I got the fish my husband got the beef and they were both divine
The pizzas are definitely personal-sized so half a pizza will leave you hungry

The desserts were the highlight of the meal and they had a good selection of wines by the glass
Ranch Market has a good selection of food from China and other East Asian countries
They've got a large selection of frozen seafood and meat and a decent selection of fresh
The menu is expansive but not overwhelming so anyone can find something he or she likes even if you don't care for Mexican food you can find something more American
First of all I'm immediately intrigued by any place that has roasted beets AND caramel corn on the menu as separate dishes mind you
The menu items are creative but not so far out that the food isn't enjoyable
Get the bang for your buck and avoid ordering anything but the generous portion of nachos only above average dish as far as taste and value and the perfect margarita only drink guaranteed to NOT be short-poured
The online menu lists several vegetarian dishes the restaurant menu does not

Some flatbread pizzas sandwiches and a blase choice of appetizers
On their menu the spicey dishes have a little red chili pepper next to the dish
I've sampled many of their menu items in the past but once I discovered their fresh chicken salad served on a freshly made pita I was hooked
For a Greek restaurant there is a varied selection of food
The menu items are named after people and I did catch a glance of the Big Unit hot dog yes it is 22 inches if I was with  a bigger party I wouldn't mind trying it it looks loaded with everything and its 18 bucks but if you split that between 3 or 4 that's really not badunless you're the type that can eat the entire dog Im a Man Vs Food fan and I know Adam had his turn with the Big Unitbut anyways back to my trip to Coopertowns
Additionally the HH food menu would make any foodie happy and has a really nice variety of small plates
If you're a first timer to Chino it can be a little overwhelming listening to their 10 minute introduction on how to order and combine the different foods

All in all the food exceeded our expectations and the portions were bigger than we thought as well
They are a good size that will fill you up without giving you that afternoon food coma
The pink menu is full of sweet and sour chicken and other morsels Americans expect in their Chinese adventures The blue menu is the Chinese menu translated in to what is at times very humorous Engrish
A portion of our family is Chinese and so we always celebrate Chinese New Year with wonderful seafood dishes
Over the years I have tried a couple of other things on their menu and they do a pretty good job with a chicken sandwich and sausage biscuit from their breakfast menu
The food was excellent the wine selection was excellent & the service was EXCELLENT
What's awesome is that a lot of their specialty dishes have a spot on their lunch menu
The menu is minimal maybe 40 items in total including soups and appetizers and split in to four primary sections appetizers special noodle dishes soup noodles and fried noodles
Finally we had #34 on the menu the spicy beef with the XO sauce though we actually substituted chicken for the beef and it definitely has a little bit of chili powder and kick
It's awesome how this place combines korean dishes with japanese food choices
Portion sizes were good for lunch and the prices are on par fo the food
I would much rather give my money to a local business with a relaxed atmosphere than that awful Starbucks with its bitter African beans my coffee snob husband swears that good coffee should not be bitter it should be flavorful bad tea even worse hot chocolate and limited food selection
The menu said spaghetti and meatballs plural and in the middle of my pasta sat one little lonely old meatball
The grilled chicken sandwich is tasteful and of large size on a soft Kaiser roll
There was a good selection of food out so I grabbed a plate & started with some chips & too mild salsa good salad & terrific ceviche with big shrimp

I do know good Thai food when I have it due to my extensive travels and living near a city like NYC which has many good restaurants for every style of food

They put out a wide selection of salad and dressings appetizers soups main dishes rice and noodles
Given that the burrito I ordered was fit with two sides and extra meat I was surprised when a Lean Pocket-sized entree came before me
since then i've tried a variety of their dishes from the noodle bowls to the buffalo wings to the rib dinner and have never been disappointed with any of my meals
No major complaints about food but service was just ok food portions were tiny which isn't all bad because that's why most of us are fat but $300 for two people
The fish they get is some of the freshest I have ever eaten and they get some amazing variety as well
The whiteboard up behind the sushi bar is always listing their latest specials and that's usually where I do most of my ordering from
We ordered off the full menu had many appetizers to start full dinners desserts and drinks
The service was great and so was the food - everyone seemed very pleased with the selection some vegetarians and timing of the meals - sometimes in a large group the food doesn't come out together but this wasn't an issue
There are a few choices for Sushi in the West Valley but this one is a nice combo of price and quality
After several visits to explore the menu and sample the dishes described by other critics as wonderful I would have to politely disagree
With a large selection of food options there is something for everone
Food Good selection of wine and beer
Finally I got the attention of the bar tender who gave me a paper menu to take along and talked up the owners and food as truly authentic Italian
The first thing I realized was that there was a lot of choices just for sushi & I liked how they were categorized baked tempura fresh etc
The portion was fairly large too so it was a great dish to share - we even were able to take home some leftovers
Kinda gross but hoping it was just an off moment for them because I still cannot wait to go back and try some other menu items like the Thai Chicken bowl and the shrimp tacos
either make it as awesome as your other dishes or take it off the menu life is too short for you to have something sub-par on your impressive menu and it makes me sad that this was his first impression of your restaurant
Many Vietnamese restaurants in Phoenix area managed to get the beef noddle soup Ph to a nice level but the rest of the menu were just wrong
A large head-sized head/brain-looking mound of food
The menu selections for food were outstanding
I posted pictures of our drink and food selections so feel free to take a look
The food is served in generous portions that makes the price seem too good to be true
I love how you can get half portions on almost all of their food
The Executive summaryFood -- All appetizers on the menu were gross even fries
I love trivia and the menu is happy hour prices tho to repeat myself I will not order any food again
A lot of the menu items from the original owners are no longer on the menu; for example the special Chinese cakes served on a plate topped with a delicious gravy-like brown sauce and shallots - probably some form of Cantonese food
If you like salty greasy plain-tasting yet somehow edible Chinese food not far from the $1-per-scoop variety then go here
I ordered the chicken thing on the tapas menu
It's not that their isn't a good amount of pita selection ranging from those with beef to all veggie or that they don't stuff those pitas full with lots of vegetables like they should
A coworker of mine ordered 2 menu items totaling about $25 and was VERY disappointed with the quality of the food
The food was good enough to make me want to try everything on the menu at least once and I believe I will embark on that journey
They do have some tasty drinks but their menu is lacking basic options for those of us that aren't quite up to par in the foodie world
It's very no fuss it's set up like a fast food place you look at the menu on the wall then order from the person behind the window
If it's your first time there plan on spending more than the one-$ listed the more authentic creole dishes are a tad more pricey but completely worth it

I haven't sampled much of the menu - but have spent many occasions making a glutton of myself with the chicken catfish and cole slaw
The catfish has always been good quality and decent sized pieces - but not whole filets
I had been reading about the best places to get pizza around town and this spot was on my list
I've been here three or four times and I've tried a variety of their foods
Just some common sense - don't serve the food if 1 its freakin BURNT and 2 don't serve it if it doesn't match the description on the menu without warning the guest
Most of the menu resonates and Malee's tailors spice level to individual tastes well but some dishes are consistently better than others
Their fish-n-chips on the night I went was near perfection with a nice strong beer flavor that is often listed beer battered but hardly ever tasted
Service is fast there's not that much variety but some worth mentioned Squid Salad and Shrimp Tempura Roll
The portion was a decent size and a good noodle to meat ratio
On the dinner menu I've tried several fish dishes - salmon and halibut are my favorites
If you are extra hungry you can get a combo plate that comes with your choice of fried rice varieties either bean and two smaller portions of a meat or veggie
It is quite simple really as their menu doesn't have much on it except for pizza salad and wine
However I've come to find that basic/limited menus are always a good sign because that means a restaurant can specialize and perfect a specific item and in Grimaldi's case that item is authentic NY style pizza
With the freshest toppings and endless make your own pizza combinations you really can't go wrong with the menu at Grimaldi's
[prejudiced judgmental observation and affirmation]to whit i do respect your-all's choice to not eat meat
I came away feeling that they really only make a few dishes each night and you're going to get one of those regardless of how adventurous you are on the list
She takes safe choices when we go eat -more on the margaritas in a min- Food come out and seriously it was some of the best spanish/mexican I've had in a while
OK let's face it-- whose menus offered me a few items I could ACTUALLY eat due to my food allergies and I chose Jimmy's of Chicago
I decided to go w/ the Frazalle-cheta to start the homemade ricotta cavatelli w/ vodka sauce for my main course and the only homemade dessert choice on the menu tiramisu to finish
We also had another pizza the last one listed in the pizza section on the menu that was equally as good
I had a Grand Slam which used to be good but 3 of the 4 items with this one were with this little tasteless hockey puck thing they called a Chicken Sausage Patty a little serving of hash browns the size I would give my cat & two small
The menu is big maybe 30 dishes and there is a separate lunch menu which is about the same size
The portion sizes were on the small side and they each had a weird fancy twist to them that kind of hurt the taste of the dessert overall
I had a pretty basic margharita pizza or something --perfect size for one hungry person
As for food they have an awesome menu but the food came off a bit cheap in quality to me so I don't think it's worth ten dollars a plate
The menu at SanTan ranges from salads and pizzas to sandwiches and burgers with most being $12 or less
3 stars for good food quality and fair prices but with poor game selection and service
It's a chain restaurant that wants to provide the type of fast food that is more appreciated nowadays - fresh but not frozen fast but not microwaved and filling but not because you super-sized it
Unless you want fast food your choices are slim when you're downtown at night
We ordered the Sashimi plate for dinner and it was a great size 16 pieces with good quality fish
In fact this place would probably get four stars for the food beer selection & tvs except that the service is just so rediculously bad it ruins everything
We love their Chicken Fried Steak & Chicken Fried Chicken on the dinner menu & at breakfasttoo
There are at least two items on the menu that pass the test at Chompie's ~ the corned beef sandwich and the matzo ball soup
Their menu is full of American food items that they don't execute very well not surprisingly
It's a no frills establishment with a larger variety of foods and papusas than Eliana's
The prices are very reasonable but it is not as inexpensive as say Carolina's Mexican Food and the portions weren't enough for my appetite another good sign of the food quality I guess
Tea Infusion combines good service a pleasant atmosphere the BIGGEST selection of tea falvors I've ever been offered delectable desserts and an overall happy feeling

The lunch menu and daily midday specials lean heavily towards comfort food open-faced roast beef and gravy sandwich meatloaf and mashed potatoes roast chicken etc
There is a huge selection of foods and cookware
I've tried several things on the menu chicken walnut sandwich breakfast quiche oatmeal bowl albacore tuna sandwich and paradise roast beef sandwich
Andreoli's has a nice selection of meats desserts and other tasty looking treats for sale in their store and a variety filled menu full of Italian dishes
Although they have a large variety of sandwiches salads and antipasto dishes I was in the mood for pasta
With plenty of studying beneath my belt as lunchtime approached I next decided to hop across the street to check out Baratin but with the daily menu not terribly inspiring aside from the dessert I instead popped next door to Bodega to see what local produce and meats were in - and apparently to buy a brioche donut complete with the hole and a brownie with dates and pecans plus a bag of FnB blend coffee from The Roastery of Cave Creek
A small store but with a well culled selection of local cheeses and butters immaculate organic vegetables and various salads plus proteins like Jidori Chicken and Berkshire Pork from Tender Belly Farms I'll definitely have to make a return shopping visit in the future
Composed into tidy rows of tortilla crusted chicken breast avocado bacon chopped egg and manchego cheese and dressed in chipotle vinaigrette the dinner sized Southwest Chicken Cobb Salad $12
While you have your choice of chicken or shrimp the idea of beef tenderloin mixed with sausage sweet onions and tomatoes seemed like the hearty choice
And I won't hesitate to try the rest of the menu as the food here is obviously high caliber
The Panang curry my dish of choice was average but my Thai pudding with sticky rice was great
After about 15 min of looking at their menu and the lunch special menu and the sushi menu and the special lunch menu board
The Camarones Culichi and Molcajete Caliente one of their specialty dishes  If you go for lunch and be sure to ask for the lunch portions which are half the price listed on the menu
* I was a bit disappointed by the selelction of food but I guess it is better to do a few key things well than offer a bunch of variety that is not as good
Really yummy food extremely friendly and cool staff and great portions for the price
One thing I didn't like was that so much of their menu is fried however they totally make up for it by baking the meats etc instead of frying if you request
Burgers pizzas salads hot dogs and a variety of other classics each with their own twist
Amazing patio great musiccheers to whoever auditions these people or trusts their mixed tape great wine selection and awesome food
On top of the vendors there were probably 8-10 different food places some offering extensive menus and others offering more specific things
They have bar snacks which are actually tapas smaller sized portions of some of their main dishes so it was great to be able to order several of these and share them - and they were really reasonably priced too
Before he gets to getting me the size 12 shoe he starts tying the tie on this waifish pubescent kid who can only be conflicted in all the most crucial ways including how high on one's ass pants should be worn
The inexpensive yet tasty food grill that served a nice variety of foods has been replaced with the Boar Head Deli and Fatburger
So the pizza you get is about the same size as Pizzeria Bianco and runs about 14$ per pizza
We had a fixed menu of soup salad finger sandwiches scones with clotted cream and jam and a variety of small desserts
Passionate about food and wine the list of restaurants where I had dinner includes Guy Savoy Alain Ducasse in Paris Joel Robuchon Daniel Boulud Charlie Palmer Thomas Keller
this brings us to warning number two -- Crabmeat on their menu actually means Krab meat -- as in the imitation stuff and not just in the California roll where we all expect it and I can avoid it
Based on the food and beer selection alone
I have eaten at this location once and the food was great I wasn't a huge fan of the bar area for after dinner drinks however the crowd skewed much older than my preference and I am no spring chicken the service was very good and extremely  friendly though so no complaints there great wine list despite the fact that the mark up for booze there is nothing short of highway robbery
My only thing is I feel like I see people that have ordered really cool dishes yet I never see them on the menu
I've sampled a few of the dishes here and if you are a fan of green chile you will be very pleasantly surprised to see a variety of their dishes are made with Hatch green chile
After reviewing the menu which had all of the usual stars in a pizza place I decided upon a staple favorite the margharita pizza
If you like a little bit of sauce brushed over texas sized toast with mozzarella medallions and a topping of your choice added basil leaves on the side then this is the pizza joint for you
Okay this isn't usually our first choice for quick Mexican food but sometimes you don't want to feel so guilty after you eat a burrito
For $11 I got a small drink pita pizza which was really just a regular-sized pita topped with marinara chicken and feta and a dinky salad that had no dressing
You can order anything off the menu from next door Euro Pizza Cafe for no up-charge
Went to Food Truck Friday for the first time and after 10 min of reading every food truck menu I decided on Jamburritos mainly because I was in the mood for some hushpuppies
I mean some of the stuff is good mostly on the dessert menu but I warn you about the Milkshake
There are a few things on the menu that are a bit Americanized however there are some stellar examples of this simple yet tasty food
On a side note the atmosphere of this place may not be up to par with the big restaurants or East Valley dining but I'm someone who goes for food and service the look of the restaurant is last on my list
Setting aside the broader debate on the extent to which fast food may or may not be to blame for all that is wrong with America today those of us who do at least occasionally frequent what I like to euphemistically term accelerated dining establishments are sometimes faced with important choices about where to fill up on empty calories
Anybody who's been to Postino Arcadia or Postino Central knows what to expect from a Postino restaurant  great wine selection incredible food and a modern but relaxed atmosphere
The preparation and side dishes were very minimalist so I'm not sure what that extra twenty four bucks is for
There were 3 choices  chicken shrimp and/or tofu
Old no food choices bad beer selection poor service they could not handle the crowd the Giants brought you could not buy food and they actually ran out of food
Go to any of the other stadiums for a great venue shade food choices good beer etc
Their food/drink section is impressive in variety and regions and is well too stocked for me to spend lots of time perusing
They also have some chicken sandwiches and even a grilled fish sandwich on the menu
The food was traditional Italian and the portions were great
The lunch selections include a taco bar with greasy high-fat beef a salad bar that attempts to imitate Sweet Tomatoes but it comes up far short some other low-quality Chinese and Italian options and a dessert bar
Good if not great teriyaki chicken/beef all-white chicken and brown rice available better then average pot-stickers gyoza and a very good fast food sushi menu
The menu consists of a few tacos and a dish that is like a enchilada pie
I quickly found the dish on the revised menu I had been looking for
I had the dinner combination #7 which included a choice of one entree and came with fried rice one egg roll sweet and sour chicken and choice of soup
Each dish is portioned for one person so if you want a la carte or family style tell them ahead of time so they can separate the rice or noodles for you
They recently expanded the menu to include a whole host of new sandwiches all made with fresh locally produced meats
ask for the prefixe menu - for about $35 a person you get an appetizer an entree and a dessert
That said--the food is good [kind of modern fusion] I've only been there twice for lunch so I can't say how dinner is and since I've only been there for lunch I can't say if the wine list is any good
i know my friends were a bit disappointed with their meals and the portion size of certain dishes
The menu is a bit toned down and you're not going to find the ultra authentic foods here no tripe or tendon
They switch the menu up pretty often which can be good and bad RIP Steak and Fries - Best $19 steak I've ever had but they also bring back some favorites as well Helloooo Jack's Crispy Chicken Platter
This place is ambitious  they bake their own bread churn their own gelato make salads sandwiches pastas and stir-fries to order and offer a huge selection of gourmet grab and go foods
My husband brother-in-law and I each ordered different menu items jerk chicken curry chicken and fricassee chicken with the special rice and had Jamaican sodas that were recommended by Marie I think that was her name
The chicken chopped salad lasagna strozapretti and fish of the say are always great selections
I loved all the choices even as overwhelming as they were and making your own pizza is a cool idea
I love the ala carte idea for the taco menu as there are many to try, but found the food to be less than impressive
We finished the meal with a shared portion of the churro and ice cream dessert
The menu is blah blah blah and similar cruise ship food
My impression was that the corporate side of things had most of the control here it felt VERY corporate and that's how the menu and food prep got ruined but I don't know that for a fact
The meat selection as they came around was very good but I couldn't help thinking that I saw sirloin's much more often than the more tender rib selections

I can tell you that banchan side dishes selection is better than Hodoris and more consistent although at times I was wondering if I was eating leftover stuff from the previous table

The food was just as good as any other nice Mexican place with less on the menu and comparable pricing
This will not be my first choice for Mexican food when i'm craving it
everything we had was good and our experience was fine but nothing about it the food atmosphere decor menu was spectacular
Even if you don't like Greek food the menu is large enough where everybody can find something they like
We ordered a pre-fixed menu they didn't have our favorite dessert on the menu but he hooked us up with our favorite complimentary dessert
We were amazed by the huge menu so the next day we got dinners and the food was pretty spectacular for under $20
the drinks were not as strong as they should be for $14I had 3 of them and was not even buzzing- usually 2 and I ready to rumble the sushi is great but again you end up with $20 of it perperson just to have a decent sized dinner and the waitress totally but things on our bill that we didn't order AND the 5 piece tempura order originally came w 3 pieces

Poor Sonya ordered the beef tacos that sounded wonderful but came to fruition as 2 bite-sized soft tacos with no side

I would have liked it if a few of my friends would have been more adventurous but hey they found chicken on the menu and ate that
It's on the desserts to share list but I get it for myself and enjoy it for a day or two
Wait staff was also slow we were the only people there and didn't know anything about their menu or sushi
I had not seen a pizza burger on a menu in many years and I was excited to try it
In addition to bad food we were crammed into a small room where we were nuts to butts with 6 other tables listening to conversations ranging from someone's recent bout with pinkeye and another couple who elected to speak entirely in French until the waiter showed up then it was like they turned off the French switch and suddenly began speaking English
Then we got some steak but never did get any wings or variety of other meats
The food was spectacular and as a vegetarian I had a lot to choose from although the menu needs some help; things marked with an asterisk are supposed to be vegetarian but there were asterisks dotted all over fish dishes
Chicken was really good a tad dry but this is likely due to smoking then grilling and the veggies were spot on delicious and a great variety of carrots parsnips and butternut squash
The fish  I think Tilapia  was nice and moist and light and this dish is listed on the menu as spicy but it was  mild in an easy to eat light brown sauce that had the black pepper taste in the back-round
BARSTAFF-Right off the bat we sat at the bar in the food for some conversation that usually comes from the bartenders at any place however after having two menus thrown down with out anything being said it started off very unwelcoming
Food is awesome had the new menu item tenderbelly bacon sandwich and will get again when available

The food/menu wasn't really that fantastic
It doesn't say on the menu it comes with onions so why would think to request my food without them

My all-time favorite dish is something that isn't even on the menu anymore but they still make it on request - the Pasta Basta

You can order tortilla chips a burrito your choice of meat beans salsas opt for lettuce sour cream shredded cheese and for an extra fee guacamole a fajita burrito which substitutes the beans for grilled sliced peppers and onions a burrito or fajita burrito 'bol' which are the same ingredients sans tortilla in an Atkins low carb-friendly cardboard dish or tacos
Their salads come in different sizes and my favorites are the Mediterranean and Southwestern Chicken
Their employee turnover is too high to feel like a neighborhood gym and their demographic is disproportionately meatcake-y
The rest of the menu is excellent with various offerings of classics like meat loaf sandwiches fish and chips salads and classic entrees
i guess i was just expecting something on the kids menu to be a smaller portion of adult food as it is as most other places

Lastly the dessert was reasonably sized for two people to share and indulge in the great flavors but without over doing it

I can usually find something on a menu that will fit the bill so I ordered the Thai mango chicken salad
I'm sure they used quality ingredients and at no point did I feel the possibility of contracting some food-borne illness from my food which would have made the experience more authentic in my opinion hehI just didn't think it was all that and the size/taste to me did not justify the price
Would like to see some specialties/variety or perhaps a deal like a dish and drink for $15
My main course choice was the Double Stacked Chicken Enchiladas Christmas Style Red and Green Chile I would so SUGGEST this choice Christmas Style it was very flavorful and added a nice mixture of taste with each bite

They offer hot sandwiches fresh baked goods desserts and a small variety of cheeses and meats
Never in my life would I imagine seeing a $12 Spicy Tuna Roll on any menu but the Yard House makes no bones about it
Great variety of food and friendly service
Check their add-on list - you can add a lot of things including green chile and jalapenos to just about anything and that is just one more bonus that sets Sonic apart from the rest of fast-food corporate America

Although they tend to get a variety of music acts rolling through there the sound always leaves something to be desired or the listeners deaf
The menu was nothing but heavy-heavy dishes in the heat of Spring they need to lighten the menu options

I inhaled it so fast I don't think I can even describe it but it was the perfect lunch portion to prevent an afternoon food coma AKA I could have eaten two orders
The cheesy bread is really amazing - delightfully thick crust covered in a buttery garlic topping smothered in cheese served with pizza or marinara sauce your choice for dipping
The $3 price tag for what amounts to a medium-sized pizza can't be beat either
The filet bites with creamed horseradish are served bite size and are tender and juicy
This place is hoppin' chef Aaron May has done a fabulous job with the menu this is a bar that I go to for the food over and over again
Looking over the menu the Truffles Mushroom Pizza stood out
The menu has something for everyone- steak of course seafood and chicken
We were hesitant on the fish dish bc we weren't sure if it'd be too spicy and she told us to get the lunch portion vs the dinner since it was smaller and if we didn't like it we wouldn't have as much

Huge portion - essentially there was an entire piece of fish on top of a bed of spinach
We both agreed that the food had definitely been prepared well portions were large & presentation was good

The food is good but served in abysmal portions
i think I've had most of the stuff on their menu here are a few standouts  the hummus is very good the shwarma is terrible the turkey pesto wrap is good the lentil fetoosh salad is very good the club wrap is bad the lavosh pizza is good and the glazed chicken lavosh pizza is really very unique and tasty
Service food quality variety selection portions drinks and value were all spot on
The five double chops were lined up on a long narrow plate the bones of one chop leaning on the meaty portion of the next all of them balanced in a ribbon of creamed spinach
I think the number fifty four The chicken in this meal was white meat and prepared well the vegetables were grilled and also were a nice selection

Much better choice then the everyday fast food chains that clutter our city streets

Once my food came out the burrito has shrunk half to its original size but it was 230 so I thanked her and ate it anyway
I also ordered chicken lettuce wraps; the woman on the phone said I could get the lunch order for cheaper and half the size
The idea here to to select what type of eater you are vegetarian carnivore seafood or chefs choice

The atmosphere is lovely the service is always excellent and the variety and quality of the sushi is as good as anything we've had
The happy hour menu includes their crispy tuna which is a lovely little dish

I think their pizza is really really good and they have a great selection of beers on tap

My girlfriend's order came back with cheese on the pizza although it wasn't listed

There are plenty of food vendors and usually a nice broad selection of beers & cocktails
The food is heavy and the portions are very very large
There might be some better sandwich combinations out there on their extremly cluttered back wall it's actually not cute cause your menu is in 20 places but with the limited variety of meats it doesn't mean much
The falafel pita glazed chicken pizza and the medchilada combination of a chicken burrito and enchilada Greek style -- not on the menu anymore but if you ask they will make it are some of my favorites but really anything you get is good
Overall Crazy Buffet offers a variety of filling food and is a perfect destination for anyone who wants buffet food for relatively cheap

I was surprised to see orange chicken on the menu on a pub menu that seems to be focused more on pub-type food like fish and chips and scotch eggs
Menu  Basically two parts cold and hot - crudo always has a market fish available along with about 5 other options
So we are seated and we rummage a bit thru the menu note the artisan pizzas the bruchetta the hummus cheese plate salads pretty simple fare

The menu is vast and there are curries and noodle dishes to choose from in addition to other Thai favorites
It earns you free food off the menu over time

I would like to go back and try the shredded beef arepas and the many other menu items
The food is pretty good and they have some interesting choices - cornbread peanut coleslaw
The chicken is a healthy choice but smells better than it tastes
they also have a whole menu of Chinese/Japanese dishes
The menu had a wide selection of food to satisfy everyones taste
I don't recall ever reviewing a fast food place in fact now that I try to edit the category on yelp for this place I realize they don't even have a selection for fast-food
The spices for each dish are powerful and unique I don't think you could go wrong with anything on the menu
The menu offered variety of sandwiches as well as pizza sold by the slice and spaghetti
Tortas tacos ice cream all these other dessert choices
As part of AZ Restaurant week we got 4 dessert portions the QR promo added another 2

-Groupon check-Cool unpretentious waiter check-Live music check-Amazing menu double checkWe ventured over to 5th & Wine a few weeks ago after buying our Groupon online for $15 bucks for $30 worth of food and haven't stopped talking about it since
The salad had NO chicken but we got charged for it dinner size
Despite the service it's worth it for the great selection of dishes and sides
The steak meat was tender and the meal came with steamed rice and your choice of panchan sides as well as macaroni salad to choose from 4 for each meal
At the end of the night we had a decent sized bill that my boss was cool enough to cover so I don't think this is exactly the cheapest food in Scottsdale but I would definitely go back
A late night brown chicken brown cow situation let's just say someone should have bought me dinner before having to listen to something that intimate
The ambiance is amazing and the food is extremely inexpensive while being decent portions and absolutely scrumptious

The rice dishes feature massive portions of food
Even though prices are similar I find Pei Wei to be a step above Panda Express as the selection is larger and the food tastes fresher probably because they haven't been sitting in a wok for hours
We both ordered menu items that take awhile so I must admit we were actually almost full when our food rolled out
you will starve there's nothing for you on the menu  But if you want comfort food soul food
We didn't have dessert but I glanced at the menu and while they have several of the Houston's signatures I think they should add apple crisp to the list
Think I'll add this place to my list of go-to restaurants for when I am craving Chinese fast food and don't want to shell out $$ for PF Chang-like fare
The menu offers such standards as fried chicken  fried catfish  ribs  waffles and my new favorite  fried shrimp
You have your choice of bread and I always choose the onion roll
Thumbs Up The entree soup coconut was some of the best I've ever had;  egg roll was crisp and fresh; drunken noodles came out piping hot and were tasty; portions were generous; my colleague picked up the check
The menu itself is a masterpiece with quirky names for dishes funky descriptions and hilarious quotes - it is just fun to read through
Although you get more noodles and broth with the extra large size you do not get more meat
Wei has a good selection of options and the food is always fresh
It's consistent as you can get and doesn't break the bank for a good portion of food that can also be relatively healthy
The food court has a nice selection as well as a Ruby Tuesday's for slightly more upscale fare
I love Whole Foods in general they always have the best selection of cheeses wine seafood
Their wine selection is great and the prepared foods is super delicious too
Oh and did I mention the portion sizes are ginormous compared to higher priced lower quality Phoenix sushi joints
My sister had the catfish which was really good in size and cut but again it lacked flavor
The decor and mood are decidedly low-key and menu centers around purportedly healthier foods like hummus falafel and of course plenty of pita
For lunch and dinner they have tons of pasta pizza sandwiches and soups to choose from as well as a pretty good wine and beverage list
I asked the friendly Thai waitress for some suggestions and she explained that you can order most of the entree items with your choice of meat or seafood or even tofu as your protein choice
As I scrolled down the list I came across Sushi Eye - a new location
I'm a sucker for menus that have photos of their dishes
Their frozen fish selection is fantastic
My boyfriend likes the green chicken enchiladas and I have gotten a variety of things all turned out good
My only disappointment w/ Sauce was that while the food was good - it wasn't as great as the menu's hyped it to be
Now if only you'd add chicken rings to your menu and stay open for late night drunken cravings I'd never need to go to the Midwest again
The only complaint I have is there wasnt enough non meat options but I bet on a regular day the regular menu would have more to chose from
There aren't many selection of food outfits for breakfast around the area
I am sure I can close my eyes point at something on the menu and still find the dish enjoyable
The menu is pretty creative and I would like to return and try some other dishes one day
Kids ate chicken fingers from the bar menu and some sliders from the appetizer menu
The meat selection is pretty darn extensive - a variety of pork and beef cuts sausages and sometimes even lamb
I've never had anything I didn't like with particular favorites being the pork chops ribs chicken tenders prepared from fresh chicken and served in a very generous portion and various salads
Pricing is very fair for the quality of the food and the portions are large
On our last visit I tried a new meat loaf dish that had just been added to the menu
After a few minutes of perusing the menu and asking a couple questions I settled on the lunch special that included soup and half a fajita chicken wrap
The smaller size is perfect for a two person meal but they still carry larger family sized dishes as well
Tea Lite has a limited menu and only had 2 versions of pho a beef or chicken version
This is *must* on any meat lover's list of destinations to visit if you are in Phoenix
As well as being a fantastic environment and atmosphere there is a great selection of microbrew beers the food there is really good and the bar staff are also very friendly welcoming and attentive
The food selections are interesting and fairly adventurous
The Santa Fe chicken salad was described in the menu as coming with pico de gallo
Their chicken adobado is amazing the salsa bar is possibly the greatest thing you'll ever put in your mouth they have a decent beer selection and all you can eat homemade chips
I am pretty picky about food and we try to go to places with good flavor and it's not all about GIANT portions
One slice is probably the size of 2-3 regular size pizzas
The wings and other dishes were great especially as sports-bar food goes beer selection was good prices were reasonable
I used to LOVE the creamy cheesy meaty cheeseburger soup when it appeared on the menu but I had it just a couple of days ago and was disappointed to find it watery virtually tasteless and sorely lacking in the meat department
The menu was chock full of the typical chinese dishes rice plus meat plus sauce
Demerits  Average typical Chinese menu no real Korean food other than the Bulgogi
The pizza's are all very good whether you order something from their speciality menu or build one yourself
They've got a good beer selection on draft or bottled too lots of good choices to go with their pizza
The sashimi was utterly perfect but don't believe the menu when it classifies this dish as a large sashimi plate
We decided to try a dessert since they wisely re-vamped this part of the menu
The prepared food section had a nice selection of entrees and seemed to be a pretty popular area of the store -- everyone was hording around the area probably trying to pick tomorrow's lunch
This was 3 pieces of chicken a large waffle with 2 nice sized sides for less than $10
The food was good however some stations were out of food before I got to them drinks were affordable crowd was mixed live band played a nice variety of music and the staff was very accomodating
* Decent food choices in Terminal 4 including Paradise Bakery and some Chinese food grill although once you're past security and in your far flung wing for your US Airways gate there isn't much to choose from besides Pizza Hut and a mediocre mexican cantina
First impressions I was thinking Burmese food was going to be just like Thai food after first glance at the menu
While their selection isn't as vast as other buffets it felt like the quality of cooked food was better and not as oily
I'm looking forward to coming here more often and trying everything else on the menu including the fish tacos
Great selection of fresh steaks chops marinated chicken breasts kabobs ground beef brats bacon ribs homemade beef jerky numerous sides AND they even bake their own bread daily
I have also encountered the portions of food being noticeably smaller than the other restaurants
I am use to those suckers being quite a decent size and I have had it enough times to notice that food portion is smaller than usual
They use primarily re-usable dishware the menu and carry-away boxes are recyclable and biodegradable and they recycle
From local veggies to grass-fed chicken and beef - fresh local and seasonal ingredients are packed into their excellent breakfast and lunch menus
The food is like any other Oregano's location Tasty with large portions
wish i was in their familyThe menu is kinda funny because all it has on it are the names of the dishes it doesn't waste anytime trying to tell you what those dishes are lol
With a thank you and a quick exchange of smiles I proceeded to devour the entire bowl - catching my posture melting into a slump a few times as I took in the sheer flavor of the broth the delicious texture of the clumped tender rice noodles and variety of beef parts cheek tripe thin sliced meat etc
A few minutes time and another aromatic bowl was set before me - this time with a wonderful array of seafood shrimp krabstick dumpling amidst a hefty portion of delicious egg noodles
The food is great artery clogging and comes in huge portions
I had looked online to find what was considered one of the best pizza joints in Phoenix and kept seeing Oregano's pop up on lists
I only recently discovered that Pizzeria Uno in St Louis has a similar dessert on their menu- thank god
The food is inconsistent but they have a fantastic revolving beer selection with many import beers on tap
As with dim sum the optimal party size is four so that you can try more dishes
And I might be crazy but I honestly don't remember ever seeing the Featured dishes menu
I went with a group tonight and we shared edamame and a variety of rolls including california yellowtail spicy tuna tootsy maki salmon nigiri and more
There are no menus and the only table available is dirty with dishes left over from the last patrons
They've definitely got some good choices of food on the menu but somehow this place just didn't hold our attention like some other breakfast spots have
Sure its big and the menu is even bigger filled with a lot of whatever food
Fantastic selection of natural pork and grassfed beef
The Salmon dish on the lunch menu is one of the best salmon dishes I have ever had
With the much improved pie the food portion of our visit deserved 4 stars but what brought my rating down was our server
The food is on the healthier side and the portions are more in line with what a ormal serving size should be unlike some places that pile on the food until their patrons are unbuckling their belts and practically throwing up when they walk out the door
For what it lacks in an adventurous and exciting menu it makes up for with the quality and consistency of the food that does come out of the kitchen and that's what keeps people coming back for more
I like the pulled pork so much that I haven't been able to try any of their other meat selections which look great as well
The menu includes salads sandwiches flatbread pizzas rice bowls etc
Second thing I noticed that the place had pulled chicken and a half chicken on the menu but at 630 at night the half chicken was not available sold out
Pros lots of topping choices and you can add as many toppings as you want; fair price for a hot dog; if you are into low carbs or can't eat bread there is a aked dog option where you pay the same price as a regular hotdog but you get two meats and no bunCons the buns are not traditional hot dog buns but more of a pita-like bun which I didn't like that much; the fried pickles were cut a little too thick and therefore not that crispywould I eat here again
Large shrimp and chicken selection and pizza and things for the kiddos
Of course I immediately perused their menu online and was very much looking forward to choosing the most delectable dish
Half of my party ordered the Beef Tenderloin which had been on my list and I had to immediately rule out so as to not be the fourth person ordering the steak
The extensive menu is a combination of familiar Greek dishes more exotic Lebanese ones and a great many dishes I had never heard of which made me very happy
Our experience was different from John V's in that the meats were cooked at a variety of doneness and when my wife wanted something cooked a little more does that make her unsophisticated
The menu listed them in the singular but he kept saying how big and numerous they were - he made it sound like I'd be committing shellfish genocide if I ordered the dish
He put some greek grill appetizers on the menu which are essentially gryo meat spring rolls and they are fabulous
What I liked about this place was the variety of house or special rolls
Keeping a menu fresh is so important with all the sushi places out there now
I usually always go with a meat dish when eating out but today I decided to mix it up and try the spaghetti squash casserole excellent choice very refreshing and filling
Food- we both had the tasting menu which offers selection from their small plates dinner
rrchoice dishesrduck confit sandwichrside order of mac & cheesercroque madamerflatiron steakrilly coffeerrbonjour scottsdale-ites
The pizza I am convinced you just simply can't go wrong with on any selection
I have been here a number of times tried every pizza on the menu but its just ok and not worth the wait or drive
Yes the food portions seem small but the flavors are so full & rich that we were all full afterward
They don't have a ton of variety on the menu--maybe 12 or 15 rolls the usual assortment of nigiri and then sashimi and hand rolls--but what they do have is made with top-quality ingredients and delicious
Noodle dishes and soups are hearty and very reasonably priced and for lunch they have a large selection of bentos that include rolls and sashimi so you can have the best of both worlds
The food selections is good and their outdoor seating can't be beat
Good variety of dishes for everyone from salads and sandwiches to hot dishes
There are about a dozen items on the HH food menu including a $2
For $36 per person the tea includes a variety of finger sandwiches scones and desserts
And if that's not sweet enough for you the final course is a variety of mini desserts
The sushi roll menu had too many items with crab mix
There wasn't anything very inventive on the menu but we found a couple of rolls and some tuna and salmon nigiri to order
It came with chicken and on the menu it states you have to pay an additional $1 for chicken so it would definitely be something someone needed to ask for
Consistent service good selection quality food a touch of the southwest unique to the West those who call it a chain invoke thoughts of Applebee's and TGIF and Z is absolutely no freaking chain
small bite sized meatballs with veggies and a savory broth; they also put fideo noodles in it which makes it even better
I was not feelin' the menu but decided to try one of their Focaccia Panini's with grilled chicken, tomato, avocado and spinach
Yeah the dogs are pricey but they are cooked in front of you and there's a choice of beef dogs or pork
My grandfather had the chapino It was a generous portion of fish and pasta with clams all through the sauce and shrimp; it was not spicy at all and the portion was also large
The menu isn't super large but is easy to navigate with many salads sandwiches and pizza's to choose from
Pizzas come in 2 sizes 12 and 14 but the 12 is of good heft and made a great appetizer for the table
It is a kids dish but i would order it if they raised the price and made it a dish on the menu

My coworkers were all raving about the meatballs and based on the menu description beef veal and pork I can understand why
My favorite items on the menu are their zucca chips organic roasted veggies and seafood
Second the menu is interesting and the food flavorful
It's high-style I suppose for a fast-food Mexican joint complete with an LCD menu and cool lacquered wooden tables
The food alone deserves 5 stars; add an always welcoming staff fresh ingredients and an ever changing menu that compliments the regional museum exhibitions - where is the 6 star button
Pretty much everything on the menu both food and drink is yum-yum-YUMMY
There was a nice meat selection and overall the meats were of good quality and quite tasty
For the price there are worse choices but I'd rather spend a little more to really be happy with my food

While they do have an American menu they also have a huge traditional Chinese menu you might need to ask for it We are regulars here and while one of my favorite dishes here is their spicy mongolian beef my fiance John and I also love the fish with black bean sauce salted fish fried rice tangerine beef wonton soup chicken corn chowder and their peking duck as well

I like how they set up their seafood portion of the menu - 6 fish 6 different preparations
it is Arizona after all the owners certainly make purists and old school Italian food fans happy with its inclusion of more traditional meat choices like capacollo

My favorite entrees are the Portobello Chicken and the Meat and Cheese pasties but they are all good I have never been disappointed with anything on the menu
They also carry Petite Cuisine- Fancy Feast sized cans of food that is the most wonderfully unprocessed cat food I have ever seen
The menu actually sounds more appealing and the food actually is better
The lack of items on the food menu leave it lacking as a place to eat and the lack of liquor leave it lacking as a place to drink
The menu is pretty simple you pick your meat Dark meat chicken White meat chicken Steak Salmon Shrimp and pick your rice White Brown Noodles for $1 your veggies Broccoli Carrots Zucini Mix and sauce Teriyaki Orange Peel Sweet and Sour and Spicy

The wide variety of ethnic foods is also interesting
The menu is simple and has exactly what a pizza connoisseur like myself needs simple delicious toppings however I want it and in sizes that will actually fill me up and make me not have spasms of hunger in my small intestine
It's true the mexican food you receive here is not what many are used to in that its not as spicy and the menu is limited

I went on a Sunday so I kicked it off with a steaming bowl of menudo a beef tripe soup with a ton of garnishes so you can personalize your bowl
The best part is that you don't see that kind of pizza on the menu everywhere you go
- Order your food on the grocery side - find your own table on the pizzeria side - wait for your sandwich on the grocery side- listen for your pizza on the pizzeria side- ask for more ice at the coffee stand- fill your ice tea at the table at the doorway between the two- go back to the grocery side to pick your dessert from the case trust me you do not want to skip this step

My grocery list invariably reads something like this  A buttload of various meats and cuts usually based on what's for sale a ridiculous amount of eggs a crapload of a bunch of different types of vegetables the occasional staple or dairy product
For example on top of his Thai selections he had dishes like Tai-Yaki which was just chicken teriyaki dressed up and an Atkins section

I love the sushi although not a big variety they always have fresh stuff and very tasty
Fun and unique menu great flavored sake selection awesome food and reasonable prices gives Sens five stars
I found the rationale stated on the backs of the menus and on the website We believe that food prepared this way not only tastes better but is better for you quite ironic considering the amount of butter and olive oil their food is fried in
The ingredients are fresh the salad portions are substantial there are tons of different menu options and the food is tasty
Now that I gave up the vegetarianism I am thoroughly happy with the variety of flavors in the meat items
The ambiance is surprisingly low on snotty given their abuse of the trendiest foodie terms on their menu
I was excited to read through the menu but disappointed at the flavors - the dishes didn't stand up to all the high falootin' foodie terms used to describe them
But to me its highly expensive and most Sushi joints sell the same menu and I've been places where the same thing is cheaper and taste better
The food is delicious most everything on the menu is exceptional; though a few things really stand out
Some of the menu items are a little pricier at T & J but they more than make up for it with the extremely generous portions of food

They have a huge menu of the aforementioned menu items that cater to vegetarian and meat eaters
The prices are very reasonable around $7 when considering the quality of food the ingredients and the ambitious serving sizes
The menu alone made my mouth water just envisioning all the dishes
The sandwich was as the menu implies a meat paradise with egg
Since I've been a bunch of times I've pretty much worked my way through the entire menu but I will say that the scallops the amaro meatloaf and the lamb burger are my favorites fries not included
They have a large menu containing items from soups and salads to steak and pizza
The best two things on the menu in my opinion are the meatloaf weird I know but it is good and the Steak Au Poivre
They offer a good selection of seafood steak and  if you are looking for smaller try the small plates
My coworkers had the japanese lunch specials which for $8 you get miso soup salad choice of rice entree and 4 california rolls--great deal

I find it somewhat comical that people will size up any new fish upon entering like some sort of doucebag/douchette jail holding pen
It offers all 4 points good food great price healthy choices and fast service
If you get the grilled chicken plate it's basically the same thing lil less salad but you still get the side of your choice and it only costs $8
Not worth it-Pasta side is bland but sometimes I get it and mix it in with my salad yum-The mediterranean tuna left me too stinky for work hours-Orzo soup was bland-The turkey is just deli slices of processed meat not great compared to the chickenYou can specialize anything on their menu too and they will get it perfect
Great customer service food and variety keeps me coming back to Zoe's
The slices of bacon that were evident were small like the ones you get on a 99 cent menu fast food burger
They have $8 dinner combos for the win which come with a super-portioned dish a spring roll and two crab cakes
The gyro has a healthy portion of meat with some tomatoes onions were held on fresh pita served with a side of tzatziki

The menu is modeled after Mexican street food with small plate specialties in addition to a variety of barbacoa dishes
A decent selection of raw feeding foods and a HUGE selection of quality kibbles
I know the concept is simple but I needed to know why the menu didn't exactly describe the food
You walk your lazy ass over to the line and load up on your choice of however much you want of raw chicken beef pork shrimp scallops krab and whatever else is on this chilled salad bar
The menu ranges from as American as burgers and fries to pan-asian/exotic such as Malaysian Seafood Curry or Japanese Pumpkin Ravioli
My only complaints would be the amount of time we waited to get our food/drinks it was pretty loud a bit too dark and the portions were fairly small for the price
Their rotisserie chicken is delicious and my favorite entree on their menu is their grilled bbq salmon which is cooked perfectly tender and melts in your mouth
The food here is amazing and there's such a wide variety including delicious tater tots even sweet potato tater tots and the mouth watering reuben that I had chosen
You can get a lot of your traditional heart-stopping Italian grub here like a meatball sandwich but they have a lot of variety for those who like to eat lighter as well
There is plenty on the menu besides pizza
I was highly disappointed with the prepared food selection-they didn't offer much
He even accepted An open letter to veterinary professionals that I had printed out for him which appeals to veterinarians to stop endorsing dry kibble and supporting pet food companies that have only one goal - profit and not our pets' health and instead to learn more about ALL diets so they could help us to make better choices for our pets when it comes to their nutrition
A friend tried it out and despite all the vitriole on the menu about their being handmade and glorious the meatballs were anemic the spaghetti ordinary and the sauce nothing to write home about
My partner had the fish sandwich which she says was just okay all in all it was cute trendy good beer selection but not impressive food
Not many selections beyond the basic fish
The menu is simple with calzones pizza and salads
Bottome line The Keg would probably not be my first choice when there are so many great local establishments with better food and more character
I'm going to def give this place another chance next time I come but for now my mind is still made up this joint needs more meat and size
not bad considering how many WIN places I've found otherwise ****Also- looking at the picture of the menu their combo prices seem to be a MUCH better value than just purchasing full chickens or full orders of Carne asada
They have a simple menu and the food is meant to be served tapas style
I went there again a few nights later because I got a craving for more of that chicken tortilla soup this time ordering the larger size still on sale about $3
The food is delicious and he always accommodates special requests like grilled onions on the Gyro or when I just want a piece of Salmon on a Greek Salad which is not on the menu but one of my regular orders
And now I've learned that Pane will be open for dinner starting Sept 24th with a simple menu of a couple of pizzas salads and a special or two
The Parlor has grown on me since I started exploring the menu beyond the pizza meh
Heres why Freshest fishUnassuming genuinely nice chefs and staffamazing priceshuge selectionfast
I strolled in and looked over the menu
Three of us ordered from the lunch menu Pad Thai Sweet & Sour Chicken and Garlic Chicken and one ordered from the menu fried salmon
All of the food I tasted particularly the Garlic Chicken was extremely salty but to their credit they do give you large portions - with the exception of the Pad Thai we all took food home
Packaged foods selection is also decent though the frozen section is kind of lacking
I think I have probably tried everything on the pizzeria menu at one time or another with my favorites being the chicken wings the orange fennel and spinach salad and of course the pizza
The food has its soul back and I love the new gelato look and the expanded dessert menu
It offers a few of the entrees in a smaller portion size and comes with an egg roll or wonton soup
The dish came with a decent sized fillet of grilled sea bass grilled broccolini spears and some surprisingly tasty fried rice
I was expecting a generous variety of Oyster dishes to choose from
Forgot to mention the Onion rings - they are beer battered crispy and a great choice as a side dish see pic
And more veggies and meat size at republic
We should have sat in the patio because couldn't see our menus or even our food indoors
When your menu is 30 pages long okay I tend to exaggerate and filled with Italian Asian Mexican American and so on food choices you just start to wonder just how good the food's going to be
With such an extensive menu that offers food from every ethnic group it's no wonder that they're unable to excel in anything
ly/hsdQOcThe FoodThe Place serves some of the biggest portions of breakfast food I have ever seen
If you want a nice place to hang out and have dessert while watching some music videos of the lightweight pop variety at all hours of the night this is a winner
It was a nice selection and at only $11 was more than enough food to start our evening
The menu has been the same for as long as I can remember but the food is always good
Phoenix Magazine beats you to the punch and lists one of your favorite finds as one of the Valley's best dishes
The chicken soup is flavorful and the portion size is significant served with a couple of handmade tortillas
The Food  Such promise to fall so flat the menu does offer a variety other than steak but a larger seafood selection and some chefs specials
Last week I had the gyro typical kronos non-greasy gyro meat with lettuce tomato and onion; huge portion for $3
Big in portion huge in flavor and in my opinion the most well executed dish of the afternoon I figured going into it that the cod would be excellent and as good as it was the biggest shocker of the dish was perfect execution of the polenta - toothsome dense and a veritable sponge for both the tomatoes and the briny fish
Javinos' A very nice / elegant / stylish Wine Bar - with a great selection of wines and a great menu for food
Now most wine bars have wine and no or barely  any food - this place is an exception - Great Lunch and Dinner menu - an excellent  happy hour appetizer menu as well - love the individual pizza's
I mostly buy mountian house and other camping foods from REI they have a huge selection to choose from including biscuits and gravy
Upon first glance at the menu I saw that it stocked full of cuisine options -- everything from steak to sandwiches to plenty of seafood choices
We have also gotten the vegetarian enchiladas as well as the chicken even though its not on the menu they still are cool and let you customize the enchiladas fillings/sauces
What we weren't expecting from this place was the very pricey menu for fish shrimp and chips french fries from a bag I'm sure
The portions are pretty big the food is tasty and the menu has a lot of stuff in it
I probably won't have the pizza again but it looks like there are lots of other solid options on the menu
When a restaurant has a menu as limited as Honey Bears' they darn well better do a good job on each dish
Everyone is handed a drink and food menu after buying a ticket
The menu has appetizers burgers pizza quesadillas chicken tenders - it's similar to food at Chilis
Everything on the menu looked fantastic but I decided to be good and order trout with glazed carrots instead of pasta or fried fish with fries
The dessert selection is huge took us 15 minutes to decide which one
Dined  Saturday March 31 2012 @ 6PM Party Size 3 Adults 2 Children 6 and 9Order 01 - Mix Tempura 01 - Salmon Sushi 01 - Clam Sushi 01 - Beef Teriyaki 02 - California Rolls 02 - Las Vegas Rolls01 - Veggie Roll  01 - Some other roll I can't remember
Veggie Roll - Like the California roll in size small and ok as far as the quantity or filling
When I want to pack on the pounds and feast on good ole meat and potato's this is on top of my list
The rolls are excellent the selection is great yes you can pound down fresh salad and fruit if you are on a diet
Anything is good on the menu ReallyMango Sticky Rice - A+++ Creamy sweet but not too sweet with tangy mangoLemon Fish - A Light bright and flavorfulPad Thai Best I have ever had was hereI am going to stop writing since I am slowly entering a food coma
Also interesting and encouraging side note - the waitress said when she was hired part of the training was to have the wait staff try ALL dishes on the menu
I am getting nostalgic here so let me close with these couple of important details  1 The wine selection was small but the wines were good and 2 the cheese/cracker/olive food pairings were quite good
First time I ate at one in California I was blown away by the portion size so big that they were serving apples on the plates and also by the taste of the food
Varied menu giant portions reasonable price consistently excellent service giant tables available they're usually spacious as hell inside lunchtime portions and the biggest desserts I've ever seen in my life
Also my friend ordered the combo pho and I ordered the beef and brisket pho w/ the large size upgrade and when they came out they were the same size
The soda selection was awesome but the food was just ok
I was reluctant to try a local resturant at first because the week before on the way through town I made a BAD choice only 1 of 5 family members thought the food there was even OK but my wife chose this location with the help of Yelp yea Yelp
The store is small and jam packed with everything you could ever want for your furbaby from homemade treats to cute clothes and collars tons of food choices training tools bones and just about anything else you could ever want or need
Their food is pretty good but they have changed the menu so now I must review again after trying this place again to see if the changes make a difference
Banana Leaf has nice nice selection of various Asian cuisines so you can mix and match we had hot & sour soup Pad Thai Szechuan Chicken so a nice combo of flavors
anyhow Great vegetarian choices for people who eat there veggies but trust me I am a MEAT eater  Chicekn Tika masala Little dry but still good
They have a great selection of Margaritas amazing Chicken Tortilla Soup and of course a great selection of grilled entru00e9es
The Italian Beef Beer Bread is the best thing on the menu but you can't go wrong with the Chicken Fingers Chicken Salad Pita or really any of their sandwiches
Wanting to try a variety of foods I tried the Hawaiian plate
Their brunch menu conists of many egg frittata dishes some crepes and a few breakfast-style sandwiches
Overall because Metro is one of the few places in Old Town to serve a late night menu that doesn't involve pizza or fast food they get a bump from 3 to 4 stars
All of the items on the happy hour menu are very reasonably priced so you can get some good food and drinks
We ordered a pepperoni/black olive pizza the cheese ravioli and special ordered it wasn't on the menu garlic cheese bread
Selection of food was sub par and the food itself was to put it bluntly
While the quality of the food seems a bit better the portion was MUCH smaller no leftovers
I understand that this is not an On The Border or traditional Mexican food as soon as I open the menu
Wanting to salvage the evening I scanned the dessert menu for a hidden gem
Some of my personal favorite named food on the menuThe Big Unit Hot Dog Ryne Sandburger Amazing Grace Burger and my personal favorite on the menu - Tommy's Cali Burger
There is a low carb menu as well as a drinks and dessert
I've eaten here on a few occasions not my choice and both times the food was ok I opted for salad
We got a 1/2 order of fried pickles and onion strings to start  the 1/2 portions look to me like what i would consider a full portion just ridiculous amounts of food
I've also had the eel dish and the eel is a good portion size with steamed vegetables
Compared to other fast-food Japanese there are other places I would frequent more but if I'm in the area it's a good choice for quick Asian food
I believe it is just small portions of the pizza dough but I cannot be sure
Gargle with Listerine and vow to the heavens to limit your fast food to In N Out and the Philadelphia Sandwich Company
The wings were good size and had a good amount of meat
The only other menu item I've tried from here is a vegetable vegetarian dish that left me wishing I got my usual
The meat is freshly cut the bread you don't get choices back in Jersey at a sub shop so wheat or white was fine by me was nice and crusty on the outside and soft on the inside
I took a look at their full menu while I was waiting for my food and they have a very decent selection
Oddly enough the decor is closer to that of an up-scale gourmet American place than what's actually on the menu Thai food
Bistros offer fares with decent prices a prix fixe menu and simply good simple food
Definitely on my list of places to hit for good food on my next Tempe visit
Wish the beer selection was a little bit better but otherwise I love their food and ambiance
We quickly perused the menu and decided to order the hummus plate and the drunken mushroom chicken bowl
Their menu selections are decent ranging from wraps hummus pizzas burgers and salads
The menu is very smartly varied to include authentic staples including Jerk Pork or Chicken Fricasee Chicken Curry Goat and Red Snapper to name only a few
My dining companions caribbean food enthusiasts were soreley dissapointed but the waitress assured us that they would be featured on the menu soon
Menudo at this restaurant is served all through the week though typically at other Mexican food restaurants it is served primarily on Saturday and Sunday
My co worker then proceeded to order another roll after we found out about this secret menu
I'm not sure what is the point of the secret menu if they don't show it to you until you after you receive your food
Before hitting Gold Bar for an evening of homework I decided to pull up a list of cheap food in Tempe created in a talk thread
The menu is  extensive focusing on Pho and noodle dishes
Quote from their menu We've been told many times more meat falls off our BBQ sandwich than most places put on theirs
However I was pleasantly surprised by the taste and selection of the food
Rolls were pretty good - they had a large selection and for some reason many of them had macadamia nuts in them
I went here last night with list in hand intent on doing my whole weeks worth of shopping here I generally shop Target for non perishables and household items & Sprouts for all produce meats things like that The hubs and I are starting a 7 Day Detox diet and I needed to buy mass amounts of organic products I knew TJ's would be the place for this so off I went
But I had to dock a star for the prices - like almost everyone else on this site I feel that they're charging probably about $5 more than they should for the size of the pizza you're getting
Try having half the menu items but make them incredible and people will come for the food and not the Alabama games
My phone died before I could take a photo of the menu as I sometimes do to remember the name of the dish
One usually does me in due to the size but if you're Bulgarian or something you'll probably want the entire chaffing dish
Other tablemates purchased and shared their choices of moussaka an eggplant meat sauce and bechamel layered baked dish delish
That is reflected in the food preparation alcohol selection pricing and general vibe
Unique menu great food and awesome beer selection gives the Cornish Pasty Company five stars
Yeah maybe I have made some interesting choices that weren't for me but even then I could taste the flavors and freshness in every dish
You took the meatball sub THE meatball sub of the menu
Jamie has tried nearly everything on their menu but his favorite has been the roll filled with grilled freshwater eel cucumber deep-fried crab etc
It was restaurant week and the $39 for an appt entree and dessert was a steal of a deal but we opted for the regular menu
They also have a huge selection of accessories for boating both for fishing and recreation ski's tubes suits PFD's electronics and hardware
There are prolly hundreds of things they carry that I missed but it's just not possible to list them all
It was a chicken tamale which where I come from Tucson is NOT a traditional tamale filling and the menu never mentioned it would be a chicken tamale
I'm giving CM's two stars because despite the fact that the beer was decent and the food mostly tasty I was so immensely turned off when I had to listen to the we really don't do separate checks speech from our server
Here are my top choices in Old Town in no particular order-Mastro's City Hall-The Lodge-Daily Dose-Civic Center-Scottsdale Stadium-Joe's NY Pizza-The Casablanca Lounge-Grimaldi's Pizza-Rusty Spur-AZ 88-W-Fashion Square Mall-Culinary DropoutI could list more but you have Yelp at your disposal
Here are some of my favorite food choicesSandwich I typically build my own sandwich which I like to call Old Faithful
The menu seems to shift quite a bit so I haven't gotten a sense of the entire repertoire of goodness offered by this sunny bright-yellow addition to Phoenix's food truck scene
I ordered 2 cheese slices and a BBQ chicken slice and a gatorade and according to the prices on the menu after taxes I should have only been charged between 11 and 12 dollars
Instead I tried an Ao Yasai mixed gourmet greens with ginger and a sushi roll w/ brown rice the latter I thought was price-y considering the very small portion given
Apparently hailing from the British city of Cornwall and here in Arizona finding its foothold at the appropriately named Cornish Pasty Company I had originally heard of the pasty during a recent trip to Philadelphia where the baked crescent was a daily special on the menu at The Dandelion but featuring the least the combination of beef rutabaga onion and potato I cannot really say my interest as high - a situation remedied by the extensive if inauthentic selection at Cornish Pasty Company and thus leading me through their doors just after 230pm where I'd find the small bar area still full but the larger dining room only perhaps half so
An eclectic list of Pasty's both 'traditional' 'signature' and 'premium' plus a collection of soups salads and sides I asked Hannah about portions on her return and told that each pasty clocked in at approximately a pound and that two would be way too much food for a solo diner since she could only eat half of one thus leading me to settle on a single option a dish I was told would take about fifteen minutes leaving me more time to study and enjoy the tunes - the White Stripes perhaps the only thing 'un-British' in a string of songs ranging from Zeppelin to The Beatles to The Ramones
Debating a second pasty as Hannah returned to check in on me The Pilgrim sounds quite good but subsequently turning my attention to the sweeter half of the menu I decided to not make the same mistake twice and inquiring as to which dessert she recommended I went with my gut and ordered two to arrive with a delay between them the first Shirley Temple's Pudding a $6 sticky toffee pudding served in a cast iron pot with a side of cru00e8me anglaise
The waiter was an energetic pony tail sporting ball of electricity and was delighted to call my wife out on her bland choice of pizza crepe and insisted she ordered the mushroom chicken; excelent choice sir
Their menu is quite diverse and you can get anything from seafood cream pasta to beef noodle soup
Food was flavorless and my Mother and I tried a variety of foods here
I critique a restaurant onthe followingFood - taste presentation creativity and use of ingredientsService - level of sophistication of the sever knowledge of themenu and attention to my needsAtmosphere - quality of flatware stemware and overall ambiancePetite Maison delivered high quality gourmet delights thatwere succulent chic and innovative
If you're a foodie like me you willwant to sample the entire menu
Here the freshness of fish emerges from the fun sized fish stick only to be tempered by the pickled cabbage
YummyThe menu has more than standard rolls there are a lot of fusion rolls to choose from
Food Selection 2/5 below average they had very few fish types and most rolls had the same stuff in it just with different sauces
We are realists when it comes to restaurants and expect quality ingredients a clean place responsive service and tasty food
for food they have a decent menu but i went safe with chicken fingers
I ordered the House Chicken and was given the choice of spicy or not
For Dinner I was going to try the Grouper or the Pistachio Crusted Tuna this time but to my surprise they took them off the menu and replaced them with a Tempura Battered Fish
In-N-Out was on my list of west coast fast food joints to check out on my trip
The menu is fairly creative with anything from a margherita pizza to a proscuitto and pear pizza
The menu has more than 100 authentic dishes of which I have only really about 5 or 6 because I love lamb and can't bring myself to leave that category because of a few favorites that I love too much
I thought the the menu was very inventive and that the food was great
The pizza and salad menu was very different from your average place
food/gelato cases were still empty and she wasn't super friendly but she at least acknowledged them as human beings and pointed out where the menus were
The portion was large and the food was great-the flavors were bold and everything tasted fresh
Chinese All you can eat buffet restaurant offers a variety of Asian dishes
however they are struggling  financially right now and I think the reason is that while other steakhouses have embraced the fact that people want to eat healthier adding salads and less filling foods to their menu this place has decided to keep a very old school steakhouse fried chicken mantra
Catfish is on the menu and it was stinking up the joint and not really the food I want to smell when eating in the morning
I've never had anything but great food at Mi Patio and although most Mexican restaurants are generous with their portions Mi Patio is extremely generous
It's hard for me to pick the best item on the menu but I'm fond of the Mexican pizza and the Greek-Mex salads
And a lot of times when I don't have the time to eat there I get food to go their to-go menu is really inexpensive - something like $4
Although the bar serves food and attracts more of a family scene during the lunch time hour I don't recommend ordering off the menu
Upon looking at the menus I must agree with the previous reviewer who stated that the dishes offered were uninspired
I've sampled from several sections of the menu and haven't yet found a dish I didn't like but haven't found that gem that wows me
The meat was nicely done and the brioche roll was an excellent choice to serve it on as it kept the contents in the sandwich instead of running down your hand but the sauce was woefully short of promise
I rate this restaurant 4 stars based on quality of food portion size to cost and excellent sanitation
Food was excellent nice large portions but not crazy
She handed me a menu and I asked her recommendation between the turkey or roast beef
It's a great place with a great menu and variety of food
For dessert we got the sampler figuring it would be 3 small portions
I feel like if this place could really nail their food it could easily be a weekly staple on my list of quick bites and beer just outside of campus
Old Town is sushi-row but Stingray is trendy and equipped with a selection of tasty sushi sweet cocktails and a fun atmosphere
I know sushi is supposed to be healthy but apparently my taste buds don't listen and I always order the fatty ones
My only suggestions for improvement would be to dust the Amoroso rolls with corn meal and offer a broader selection of hot sauces
They really know what they're doing with the food peppered steak is my favorite there's a good selection of higher-quality beer and choices for everyone including vegetarians - I know because I was one once
A most wonderful combination found I today of simple delightful food a laid back atmosphere warm staff dog-friendly accommodations a vegan-friendly menu and
It's a great place to introduce Thai food ewbies because the food is great and the menu has lots of photos of the entrees
Snobbery aside the food is rather average but the convenience & variety are certainly a plus
I also like the selection of sides and dishes
food was very good and the portions were HUGE they have these little pizza rolls that are made like cinnamon rolls they were really tasty
With so many interesting choices in downtown PHX we will certainly not be dining back here again if not because of the food then because of the decor and the staff
I took half of the food home if that is any sign of the healthy but not overly large portions here
I love that their chicken & turkey breasts are house-roasted that all sauces including the delicious pesto made by hand and in-house and that the incredible selection of sweet samplings and baked goods are all made from scratch
They also have great unique selections on chips crackers drinks cheeses dinner items they make a great pizza nuts and meats
Service was friendly but we found the menu a bit limited and the quality of the meat not amazing
My husband and I are trying everything on their menu because we love Thai food
that's a lie I look at the dessert menu more than the entree menu
The Food is amazing the staff is friendly the location is always clean the menu is not overpriced the selection is great and the food always comes out very fast
Now if they added pizza to the menu my life would be complete
Either I was only given half a menu or there is extremely limited choices for food selections
That's the only conceivable beef one could have with this place the size
We very much enjoy the food but it is your standard Mexican menu
It also isn't as expensive as other sushi restaurants and there are other menu options for land lovers
This is a cool place for brunch good service good selection and decent prices it's even close to Old Town go figure  I had the salmon flat bread pizza with creme freshe capers and arugula this was perfectly paired with a nice strong cup of coffee served in a clear plastic glass
The gave us menus in line & took our order so that when we sat down finally our food & drink followed immediately
They always come with a good portion of grilled or fried fish cabbage pico de gallo and avocado slices
I've always enjoyed La Grande Orange's pizza which along with its extensive wine list is one of its specialties
and I must say for the size of this location and the limited menu its still a great place to eat at if you're craving pinoy food
Of note- on the menu there is a section entitled Pasta which several Asian noodle dishes under it
People love the huaraches which are gigantic corm tortillas covered with white cheese red or green salsa and mushrooms hongos or various meaty choices
The sandwiches have a variety of toppings and fillings and are served on a beautiful bolillo roll
The cost of an entree is very reasonable and you get a pretty large portion of food
The cafeteria style serving gives you time to decide the side dishe selections can't be beat - home made apple sauce is my favorite  Homemade rootbeer and rootbeer cake are a delight
Needless to say we will be back to try other dishes on their menu excellent choice for lunch or dinner
The staff is welcoming and eager to please the selection approaches infinity the value is absolutely unbeatable and the food
The menu has grown substantially and now inlcudes several seafood options in addition to the standard pizza pasta and calzone offerings
Just a list of pizza base size with a list of toppings calzones but still have to choose all your toppings and a few salads
Stopped by for drinks the second time ended up ordering a pizza expected little since it didn't mesh with the menu it was really quite good
The sushi and sashimi weren't super fresh sushi-bar style but there was a variety and the servers were always replenishing
A half pound Prime meat hamburger with smoked bacon and choice of cheddar gruyere or blue cheese on a toasted challah bun
The meat comes with two scoops of rice and your choice of sides
The combo plates are generously portioned flavorful perfectly-balanced complex in seasoning comfort food
Menu items have shifted around a little but the premise stays the same-make great tasting pizza and do everything to satisfy your customers
The menu is heavy on the steaks and seafood
Fried okra red velvet cake Kool Aid also in ginormous mason jars the list goes onThis place oozes character charm incredible food not to mention half melted butter that seems to find it's way onto anything and everything on your plate and really what isn't made better with melted butter
The gourmet food items the housewares and decor selections touch on all areas of the globe and does so seamelessly so it's not a cluster f@%k that gives you a headache
I love their candles the little trial sizes of random gourmet foods a mini bottle of aged balsamic
They have a large selection of dishes listed on their American menu and Chinese menu and much of it is prepared well
and they said they opened with even MORE Irish stuff on the menu to include a seafood boxty but us Americans just don't eat it enough so they ditched it in favor of more popular items like chicken fingers more burgers steak sandwiches etc
Their food selection is that of a barrio's tienda - think Food City
Great service and the amazing wine list beware time for food
Food portions are huge so if you with a Big Plate you may not even need a starter
The food is certainly solid with certain stand out menu items like the Poke pulled pork and the ahi eggs benedict for brunch
It's a chain in the same spirit as Hooters or The Library in that they feature scantily clad young girls serving alcoholic beverages and a variety of fried foods while multiple televisions pointed at every angle display whatever sporting events that happen to be happening at the time
Super fresh tons of meat choices they take over 24 hours to make the beef broth that is the amazing base of the soup
Check out these slices of Glory see pics One with Tomato and Ricotta and the other with Spinach and RicottaThey had about 6 or 8 different pizzas to choose from for a slice not to mention a full menu of signature and custom made pizza calzone pasta soups salad and appetizers
They serve tasty bread and olive oil for you to snack on while your food is cooking and the menu is filled with different pastas and salads to choose from
Ingredients are very fresh the choices provide tasty and interesting salads pizzas and yes even desserts
Not the best variety in the food courtbut its bearable
The selection of food and beverage choices is wonderful
I wish they did serve a smaller size pizza for individuals the fiance doesn't care for New York style pizza so that means you end up having a bunch of left over pizza
Drinks were flowing food was always on the table no orders were screwed up quite rear with a group this size and they even separated the checks by couple without a fuss and the Keg did not automatically add a gratuity to the check while I understand the practice I prefer a server actually work for their tip
While the menu isn't super extensive there are several choices of pizzas and salads
The 6 piece rolls were about the ormal sushi roll size but the size were twice that width
Cocktails-perfect and filled with booze Seafood Tower-PERFECT way to start the meal Wine-FLOWERS Pinot Noir is now added to my favorites list Entrees all rocked
The wine list wasn't as extensive and one would expect for a nice seafood restaurant in Phoenix
Obviously the cheese is cheap the pizza glistened orange and yellow from the grease and cheese
however there are a plethora of food choices a short walk from the mall
It is perfectly fine but the selection is fairly limited and my trio signature dish was adequate but not special
Then I had the minced beef phad kaprow which is not on the menu and lo and behold I was tasting Phuket in a Bangkok sort of way
They used to offer a larger variety of foods I like but now offer more foods I don't eat such as sushi instead
Plus sized shopping for the rock&roll/punk/alt set - or just for younger folks who can pull it off
The delivery lunch combos come with white or fried rice and your choice of an egg roll or a canned soda and of course a fortune cookie
I would review the desserts but I have never ordered one since none of them on the menu have caught my attention
We began with the Meat and Cheese Selection under the Anitpasti section
To begin with there is a piece of paper and a pencil placed on the table with a selection of cheeses and meats to choose from
The size of pizza was ample and we brought home half of each pizza
There are several broth choices and they are happy to switch meat out for tofu
Even with these deficiencies I will add Thai House to my favorites list if only for the awesome Thai food
They will tailor to your requests for your food to be prepared a certain way even if it isn't on the menu
The portions were big enough to have food left over for the following day
There's a rotating menu but I think there's always some variation of a bean side dish
For a buffet- this place is really good with a variety of seafood dishes from crawfish to crab legs to salted shrimps on a stick to sashimi
We had two rolls Hot Night and another that is not on the menu w/ shrimp tuna cucumber mango sirachi etc
If you're looking for a good eighborhood sushi place near FLW and 101 we think this is a great choice and encourage you to give them a shot
They have a well priced limited menu that includes food and drinks
Portions were generous and we all left with no room for dessert
My suggestion be to just add some pizza sauce to the kids menu pizza
Besides the pizza though they have a pretty wide variety of GF dishes and my non-Celiac friends and family always seem to find a dish they love my mom always gets one of their pastas
Phenomenal pizza an outstanding draft beer list yummy specialty cocktails and always friendly service
Fresh delicious food and generous portions
They had very little choices to start with and the food was COLD
The food was portion was tiny and the price was ridiculous
The atmosphere is great kind of dark and mysterious classy and a progressive wine and food menu
Portions were so big that we had to request containers to take leftovers home and the delicious chocolate cake we chose for dessert came with a candle and was free
Our experience in Vegas' Maggianno's was five stars but I only gave the Scottsdale restaurant four stars because I feel the dessert portion sizes are much larger in Vegas
Great service cold local beer and a good selection of better than average bar food
The food was amazing and in very big portions
I ordered the Chicken Combo Platter and was pleasantly surprised when they brought out this huge portion of chickenmixed beans and brown rice which included a side of pita and the most delicious hummus I've ever had
Additionally I like grilled onion on my Italian Beef and that was not even an option on the menu
Dessert and a bunch of other menu items that sounded good
No dishes on the food menu were under $5 from what I saw even a simple plate of eggs and bread
Had an egg Sammie scrambled eggs w/ your choice of cheese meat and bread with provolone and bacon on an English muffin
The place has a limited dinner menu sushi is mostly ordered
the food here was excellent the prime rib was one of the best I have ever had  all seemed very well doneI was talked down on my wine selection lol typical steakhouse wine I did not like the horseradish it was really sour ALMOST not fresh but that was it
However they give generous portions and I could have easily given them 5 stars if Haji Baba's Chicken Swarma wasn't twice as good as Pita Jungle's This place seems to be constantly improving their menu and is a must go to for a date or just to try it out with some friends
The portions were a bit too small for the prices but the food was great
I usually just get my veggie chips and soy milk and occasionally check out the Fruit and Seafood selection
The food was really good  they offer a couple of unusual dishes not seen at other Chinese buffets and a good dessert selection
All 3 of them ordered a different pork dish they have a lot of pork on the menu
On to the main stuff - promove if there's just two of you dining would be the Whole Hog Heaven deal for $38 pick from two meats off of a list of four the ladyfriend and I picked the beef brisket and sausage two rib selections out of three we rolled with the beef ribs and St
The beef ribs were good; they were decently sized and definitely meaty
I have been running into this problem lately where restaurants have a choice between sauce with meat and really spicy sauce
Arriba has a gigantic menu with lots of pictures of the food
I can't comment on anything else on the menu because we've never tried anything else - but their pizza is awesome
My fettucine bolognese was another ample portion of homemade noodles and a delicious meat sauce
OK now that I got my complaints out of the way I can say the service diverse menu and good food are all pluses in my book
The menu was impressive diverse Hot Teriyaki Veggie Bowl and with tons of hot and cold lunch staples Club Sandwich Pastrami and Cheese Chicken Caesar Salad etc
Their signature roast beef sandwitch comes in 3 sizes small medium and something approaching the size of your head
You aren't seated given a menu then free to check little boxes on a piece of paper to let them know what sushi you want
Tottie is well-known for her ability to please her customers with her knowledge of Asian dishes and offers a variety on the menu that most places don't have
The choices aside from the sushi and seafood platters range from pricey things like $20+  for the trout or the macadamia-nut crusted halibut to $12 tuna melts
The menu is simple and I usually order just a  pepperoni pizza with a side of marinara sauce
The salad selection will make even the most focused foodie indecisive
As I typically do I recently had the grilled chicken plate which is grilled chicken with sauteed onions and your choice of a side I chose their rice-yummy and their greek salad
Let me start positive - if you haven't been here yet just pick a staff meal and check it out; you get to try some dishes that aren't on the menu and nothing is typically over $10
I'm not a German food expert but I have a nice variety to make some  comparisons and Black Forest Mill was by far my least favorite or had a notch below in quality to what I've tried
5 The place was so full of Zpizza customers listening to the music that there was literally nowhere to sit unless we went to the noticeably empty pizza side
Large pictures of the main dishes in the counter area show you what they offer even before you are seated and handed a menu
The palov was a dish of tasty seasoned rice with carrots and meat and was quite a good choice
I really want to give this place more stars but I've tried everything on the menu and to me it's like fast food for vegans
Since variety is the spice of life we ordered two different sandwiches to split - Long Trail delicious roast beef on sourdough with crumbled bacon muenster cheese lettuce tomato red onion green pepper and a fantastic horseradish mayo- The Vermonter maple glazed turkey & honey baked ham on wheat wtih sharp cheddar lettuce red onion thinly sliced granny smith apples and cranberry mayoIt was past the lunch rush so our food was prepared pretty quickly
Only complaint is the lack of healthier food choices but yeah it is an Arby's
The shredded beef chimichanga was pretty good but we both felt that it was on the small size considering its $12
The food is very good and there is a lot of variety - salads rice and noodle bowls burgers and more
The moment I was done with my salad our table was surrounded by beautiful glistening beef lamb chicken even a little pork
A plethora of food choices and gift shops on each floor
I work right across the street from this bookstore and took a stroll on lunch to see what kind of selection they had
It's not in to say the least the fancy part of town all transactions are done in cash so leave your credit card at home and the meal is provided on an empty soda crate bottom sort of thing with a piece of butcher paper on it and then the sliced meat of your choice is on another piece of butcher paper and when they ask how many slices of bread you want and you reply they reach into the drawer below the cash register rip open a loaf of sliced Wonder Bread or the equivalent and give you that to make the traditional folded sandwich of sliced meat and BBQ sauce on bread
The list goes on from BBQ Chicken to the Buffalo Wing Pizza that packs a punch
He disappeared and spent another 10 minutes preparing the food which came out to extremely small portions for the price
it may also give you the chance to try some off the menu dishes and sample various treats no promises there as it depends on if you can make friends with a busy chef
I had the Pesto pasta which came in a nice scooped out bread bowl with my choice of meat
The food was just OK when you walk in you see this very large boat serving center that is where the Sushi is at nice selection for a buffet but then again not the bestThey have a section that is like a BBQ area where you pick what you want and the cooks will cook it for you a nice selection
There is a lady who brings the food as well as broadcast to the cooks in the back what is needed the speakers are so loud in the kitchen that it sounded like a train station anouncements in a chinese train station This same lady bumped into my many times while she was bring out the new food I understand that she is in a rush but when there are people in front of me who is overwhelemed by the selection of food I have no place to go The atmosphere is nice very airy but very loud when you have a large gruop of people trying to talk to each other it gets very loud
So the fried chicken breast waffle with the ice cream sized scoop of butter on it come out along with the mac & cheese
Having just rolled into town for a work trip we showed up before the day's menu had yet been written on the chalkboard
There are a LOT of vegetarian/vegan dishes clearly marked on the menu
I was excited that they would prepare their Pad Thai a dish that serves as a very good baseline to judge everything else served in these places Thai hot despite it not having the associated chili icon next to it on the menu indicating that this was an available option
Beautifully maintained great service lots of food vendors and the perfect size - there isn't a bad seat even on the lawn
I will most likely try the other dishes I listed next time and adjust my rating accordingly
Very good value in just oz per dollar; however they also age the beef and offer 2 infrequent choices for how you would like it cooked blue rare on one end of the spectrum and Chicago style as an oddball
Zen Sushi offers a lot of perks that one could enjoy Trendy yet relaxed atmosphere outdoor seating with misters happy hour--and reverse happy hour friendly hostess servers and management and plentiful portions
The kalbi portion has got to be the smallest beef entree I've ever gotten anywhere
Food was well prepared and portions generous for the price paid
I ordered the 1-slice + salad combo cheese pizza caesar salad and was pleased to find the slices were nice and big and the salad was also pretty good-sized
Not a huge menu so My mom ordered the shrimp salad-grilled not fried like it comes I ordered the Chicken Salad and my husband ordered the Italian Salad  I think it was called that The pretzel app was amazing
The menu ranges from traditional pho to rice or noodle dishes to crustry bread sandwiches
Only place I'll buy meat and they have a good selection
Love the wine and beer selection and all their unusual desserts and snacks they carry
And they have levels of spiciness for the hotter dishes on the menu -- five chili peppers next to the description means you better be able to handle the heat they serve
We were tempted by the dessert menu but decided to stick with coffee
I will agree with some of the pluses and minuses that Jenn H wrote about previously such as+ A great location+ Very fresh fish+ Low carb rolls+ Good sushi selection+ Neat little complimentary sunomono type appetizer although we didn't receive ours last night
I couldn't wait to get some good Mexican food in during my visit because we all know what extremely limited selection there is on the East Coast
Mexican food is probably one of the easiest to make vegetarian-ish and most places I have been to have several veggie options on the menu
What I mean by that is they have the cheap ass patio that is so common in scottsdale bars with the goofy oversized pictures of rockstars that you would find in an LA rockbar and the private karaoke rooms and Japanese food
Service was ok menu selection is typical pizza/pasta delivery joint menu with a few basics and fried apps
On to the food quality portion of the review
There was a decent size wait for both my order to be taken and for food to come out
Also they have some special rolls not on the menu that they will make when it is not too busy
but for such a small store it packs surprisingly large variety of Korean goods plus a food stand
Kimchi is always plentiful and offer a good variety of types of jarred kimchi or kimchi in bagsThe food stand serves up truly homemade Korean food like what you would get at home
There's a really wide variety of ban chan available and although the small packages seems a little expensive $3-5 each if you know how much time it takes to prepare each individual side dish
We ordered a small assortment of dishes to get a well rounded taste of the menu
Other items on the menu include several different gyros burgers sandwiches a decent selection of pasta dishes and all kinds of Greek and non-Greek appetizers
said I love this place and gave it 5 stars well I came close to 5 but fell a little short because the dessert selection was not quite there
Claim Jumper is one of those chain restaurants that gives you giant portion sizes but the food really isn't anything to rave about
I can't wait to try breakfast or lunch here the menu looks great and I will definitely update on  the food as soon as I get to try it
I have eaten from the appetizer menu only had sandwiches pizza and salads
The spam was on a sweet roll with a bunch of the toppings listed
Good flavor that tastes great in a variety of dishes
i suppose i can't fault them for this though as the dish is listed on the menu as 'basil green curry'
Good variety of options includes all of what you expect from a Chinese buffet along with some non-Chinese items such as sausage pizza and French fries
On the other hand the portion sizes and the caloric values of their food is kind of ridiculous
Following the hostess to our table I couldn't help but notice the humongous portion size of ALL of their dishes
Boring I know but lemme make it up to you by talking about moms dish the 3 egg avocado & crab omelet which was made w/ jack cheese tomatoes scallions bacon & asiago cream sauce accompanied by red potatoes choice of one of their mega-sized hot & fresh muffins & fresh squeezed O
They tried to get us to stay to order off the menu which was just Chinese food
We found the food choices to be quite extensive
The chicken sandwich was made with that cheap partical chicken patty that you commonly find on most $1menu chicken sandwiches
They don't give you a ton of food but that's probably for the best since most restaurant portions are way too big
Brick Chicken grilled to perfectionYummy Pork Chops fired in wood grilleExcellent Vokda Pasta purses - smack -Most extensive childrens menu I've ever seen
The side dishes were lukewarm at best and the vegetarian choice is to pick 3 side dishes
The food was small portions for the high cost and the flavors were not all that great
Wally's has neither the best food nor the best service of the restaurants on our FNF list but it ranks high in terms of being the most consistent predictable and dependable
We ordered a bunch of dishes of the happy hour menu everything coming in at $6
There is nothing on the menu that I don't like and the pizza and wings are to die for
They have about 6 curries and each one comes with a choice of meat or prawn/tofu
They have too many ingredients to list meat types bun types toppings sauces etc so you can mix & match combine and taste test to you heart's desire
They have a great selection of desserts here
At least they have a variety of seafood and sushi
I crave their wonderful selections of the pizzas
Most of the pizzas here have a fresh and clean tast - which is really good with their wines and cocktails selections
They do give a huge portion of meat which is nice
In addition to a standard selection of Chinese buffet items beef with broccoli fried rice sweet and sour chicken they have sushi pizza for kids I'm assuming and a hibachi grill section where you can pick vegetables and meats and they'll stir fry it for you included in the buffet price
My favorite dish the Adobe Salad a large with added shrimp will put you back about $15 but it's worth every penny made of baby greens goat cheese roasted red peppers tortilla strips and the most amazing and addictive orange/chipotle dressing and your choice of protein tenderloin shrimp salmon chicken or none at all
I also thought their pizza was mediocre but I think the pizza dishes aren't on the menu anymore
Overall the portions are large and the food is yummy
The food is affordable and if the other entrees are the same portions as the curry you certainly get your moneys worth
Their menu is small mainly pizza and a few salads so if you are looking for a place with lots of choices pastas sandwiches etc Grimaldi's may not be the place for you
They specialize in natural organic and holistic foods and toys
Plus the lunch dessert menu offers a sampling of three items for about $8 that we found the perfect sweet ending to be shared by two along with coffee
The downsides Only one movie is played at a time so there really aren't any choices the food and popcorn are still expensive the movie is expensive 15
Trader Joe's has a decent health food organic produce soups snacks and frozen item selection
Despite the large tables the place doesn't really lend itself to large parties because the menu is really limited to BBQ -- pork ribs chicken brisket burgers sliders sandwiches -- so you have to abort if anybody in your party is trying to eat healthy
The server had the nerve to ask if we were going to order dessert as well and showed us the menu
There's a variety of Italian dishes salads appetizers and personal size pizzas
Granted I was the worst busser in the world but that does not excuse the bad food old decor tired menu and lackluster staff
We decided to try out a variety so we got tacos - carnitas beef and carne asada and one beef tamale
There're plenty of instant noodle choices Korean candy/snacks seaweed rice and fresh fish
I would willingly give up seafood if all the world's oceans were made of Lolo's ice cold Arnold Palmer in perfect proportion
Food is also available To Go and there is a small but good selection of food paraphernalia
A family run joint with amazing food and huge portions
Food is priced fairly inexpensively somewhere between fast food and your garden variety sit down dining establishments
This isn't your typical sit down order from a menu and wait for your food type of joint
The cafeteria style perfect portions and great food makes this my first choice for BBQ in all of AZ
Maybe it's the hunter in me or just the boundless enthusiasm I attach with the ability of choice combine with meat
This is not a sushi place for creative rolls - it is a very basic menu
The Pizza Blanco was a simply olive oil ricotta mozzarella garlic and choice of two toppings which we decided to be bell pepper and onion
Overall the food at Crust is good and it has a decent wine list it's just a bummer to eat somewhere where the wait and bar staff are apathetic
Every item on their menu is delicious but my preference is either the Machaca burrito or the Chicken Mole
There is a great selection of drinks and food all for very reasonable prices
The food portions were large and all very tasty
Started poking around the giant portion of meat get your head out of the gutter and discovered it was huge
You can order the food the way you like requesting egg whites no tomato whatever you need to rearrange the omelette's or other choices to your taste and the food comes promptly
The price is about where good breakfast food is these days this isn't a 99cent breakfast slam it's approximately 8 bucks per choice other things are a la cart so it's really simple to get what you like
The selection of sushi is fantastic and the best ones are the Chimichanga Roll & the Sanchez Roll
We pretty much ordered everything that was available off the menu - the chicken appetizer in peanut sauce was very good
Over all I liked the food but not sure about the quality of the ingredients and portion sizes
The menu seemed interesting but we were both disappointed in our food
Food was reasonably priced good for bar food and VERY large portions
We got to pick three meats  with the full size and chose the  chickenpastor and carne asada
The three of us ate for $25 including drinks and even had to take food home because we could not finish the full size platter
Most of the food is good sometimes the fish portion sizes vary once my husband ordered it and it was huge the next time is was like 3 times smaller
They do have a wide variety and it is fairly well priced but that doesn't excuse the bad food
Also it's important to note that the size of the rolls is awesome - no skimping and the perfect ratio of fish to rice
We saw on yelp J Alexander had $$ and a menu with promising meat options
I think that I have tried every salad on their menu - my fav being the strawberry chicken salad
Once I got through cutting through the whole chicken the marinade and seasoning on the fresh tortillas accompanied by the sauce was quite tasty but it was the process getting there that makes me want to try something else on the menu
The main edible food choices are thesandwiches
Pros excellent food fantastic service menu changes regularly did I mention the  food is phenomenal and the service superb
I was hanging out outside the whole time while I was there enjoying the beautiful weather and listening to two chicks talk about raw food community gardens yoga meditation hemp and a bunch of other all-important topics while checking the Twitter stream via the free wifi
2 stars are for the great pizza and unique variety of pizza toppings
I was pleasantly surprised to see what I would consider an above average selection of various meats and vegetables available
Poli is a little different than some of the other ~bertos places with a bit of variety in the menu and a bunch of quality in the food
The menu is made up mostly of burgers salads lahvosh pizzas and a few entrees
I ordered the Fire Island $10 which is one of several classic Pischke dishes on the menu that made it over from the old days
Pros+ Great variety of fresh food always tasty
The food and the menu and both fresh they seem to have intriguing new salads and pastas every few months
I got a little confused because they had a menu over the registers so I thought it was like baja fresh where you order your food at the registers
I've always been impressed by their meat selection
You get what you pay for and at about $3/roll that's what you get-most roll options were of the mayonnaise variety or tempura and the tempura wasn't good
Good food lots of TVs with games on fun atmosphere - but where you can still talk nice outdoor seating with misters on those hotter than hell days and an amazing beer list
Generous portions of nigiri sushi are sure to delight just about anyone
While they may not offer alot of selection when it comes to rolls what they do serve up is mighty tasty and sure to satiate even the most hungry of sushi lovers
So 2 stars for okay food rude/lazy employees overpriced food and extremely overpriced/bad selection of desserts
The menu displays your favorite comfort foods and bar fare with modern presentation and taste
I NEED to try their pizza so I'll be back soon to check that off my list
Each dish was well-portioned well-prepared and expertly seasoned
They also do a very adequate and lively happy hour where house drinks are half priced and there is a nice variety of sushi rolls and apps that are between $3-$8 oh and sake bombers too
Ther service was prompt and the food surprisingly quick given our size
Sushi station has a ton of variety and the other choices are plentiful and high quality
The food is good the service is good the selection is good; I'd sum up that in general it was 'good'
The had oatmeal granola and quinoa bowls with fruit a tofu scramble and a variety of breakfast and dessert baked goods
I went there expecting to see things like cod and halibut on the menu like a real fish & chips joint
They give you too much food and the prices reflect the portion sizes
For under $10 you can get 2 choice of meats rice and 4 sides
They have a great selection to build your own however I'm sure that all their offerings are a hit as evidenced by the long line of hungry pizza lovers going out the door
Nothing super fancy on the menu - just wholesome authentic Mexican food
Several different rice bowls and a few combination plates that looked promising as well as a sushi menu
luckily every issue we've had has been with confidence for the front of house stuff speaking up looking at you in the eyes -- the food is always excellent  generally they don't always offer everything on the menu but it's generallty the cod or sole
You get 2 choices of meats and 2 choices of pit ribs with 3 sides for $36 dollars
Nice selection of desserts and gotta love that they have both beer and wine in individual size bottles
Also the sandwiches are a bit heavy on the non-meat items a la Subway hate to even use that word in this review with the meat portions being rather thin especially given the rather high prices
Good selection of comfort food in a hip industrial space
Fish head stew an off the menu item here is one of those that I tried towards the end of 2011
We had the plato tradicional appetizer a platter of Salvadoran specialties - for $9 you get two pupusas of your choice two beef empenada-like things three fried yucca things and a chicken tamale
HOWEVER Zpizza's side salad is over $6 and is HALF the size of Pinnacle's
so we went for a variety around the table 2 different pizzas with one repeated for a total of 3 pizzas at the table garlic fries potstickers 3 orders of the lobster bisque and southwest egg rolls
you will be spoiled for choice with the sushi roll menu and their servings are generous
Everything on the menu was great although the mushroom pizza had a pile of spinach on it
Moving on to the food options they have a large selection of cold and warm sandwiches as well as salads
The menu has some good combination dishes and a mix of seafood staples and chef creations
I'm torn between three and four stars on this one but I think their spring rolls and choice of decor deserve a little generosity despite my overall ambivalence
The orange chicken meal came with a good portion of chicken white rice fresh steamed broccoli and fresh fruit apple kiwi grapes strawberry
I just can't get too thrilled about a place where the food--the crowning glory of any great European restaurant--isn't that flavorful and isn't generously enough portioned to allow everyone in the group to really share in the flavor experience
Had the commuter  which was a homeade english muff with mayo egg tomato and your choice of meat or avocado
The menu has such a variety-pizza sushi breakfast lunch
Chicken skewers were good but small portions
Skewers are not the full sized skewers as I imagined- it was one small piece of chicken meat per skewer
The food is fantastic but the portions are disappointing
The Picture Show movie theater is awesome and the food court is pretty decent with a nice selection of places to eat
Shrimp rolls tasted great but I did not realize they came with pork inside also menu didn't specify
5 stars for delicious and inexpensive food such a friendly server and for being generous with the portions
We started with a pasta dish on their menu as an appetizer and a pork cheek ravioli
From 3-7 just about all their appetizers and a good portion of their sushi is  1/2 price
At first I wouldn't be caught dead eating anything other than the bananas foster french toast and trust me someone at your table NEEDS to get this dish - don't worry the full size order is way more than enough to share
The wine selection was excellent but the food needed just a little tweaking
They have an extensive menu that includes options that are NOT fried which is a welcome alternative to traditional bar food
I recommend trying one of the lavosh pizzas the bruscetta variety was delicious without feeling too heavy
Their food menu is decent but not earth shattering
The foodOk well the food is above average here personally I like the fries and the sandwich I won't boast about every item on the menu
After strategic review of the menu consisting of a price volume mix analysis to determine the right combination of entrees and side items to reach Pareto Optimality my friend and I ended up with a table full of goodnessLo-Lo plate 2 waffles + 3 chicken breasts 1 additional waffle home fries and no surprise here mac n cheese
The meatballs are about the size of golfballs and you only get 2 of them the taste was again decent
All in all the food is good they just need to serve larger portions
The menu is sparse and simple A couple chicken beef fish vegetarian options
Here's what we ordered and our impressionsAppetizers Il Tagliere an assortment of Italian Meats and Cheeses - 4* this is absolutely the best thing on the menu for a groupBresaola - 3* the table seemed to devour this oneCaprese Salad - 3* standard deal the pesto was a nice touchEntreesLa Noce - 3* the arugula did not seem that fresh the crust was very plain and flavorless the sauce was a little sweetProsciutto Crudo - 3* my parents asked them to add some pecorino on top
We were often given free samples of new dishes and salsas and though short-lived as this place was there always seemed to be something new on the menu
I believe this is the location that I fell in love with my all time favorite item on the menu and that is the chicken pasta salad a concoction of Marinated grilled chicken breast tossed with rotini pasta fresh tomatoes with lemon vinaigrette
We couldn't even think of dessert but it sounded amazing from the descriptions on the menu
Granted they have a lot of other dishes on their menu but
With every dish he listed my mouth watered more and more
I have about 30 different choices when it comes to the cheap-drink+bar food combo in my hood
Excellent food worth the price the menu has classics your choices of burgers and mesquite-grilled meats and some more imaginative dishes
A good choice 5+ of salad bases to combine with either of 5+ meat/fish small portions on top
This place has the typical bar food and a good selection of beer
The BBQ platter with a 1/4 chicken macaroni salad and potato salad was quite tasty  but way too big of a portion for me
Take your choice of chicken shrimp and whatever else they have
We then went on to the bacon wrapped Kobe meatloaf mashed potatoes mushroom gravy and sweet-sour- red cabbage this being 18 dollars on the main menu
Each roll was packed with thin slices of pork and 3 good size shrimps
These are pretty generous in size too and they also feature vegetarian pasties as well but I`m a meat girl
I did hear about them revamping their menu and really working on improving their food and believe me when I say they did a really good job
We came for happy hour sushi their HH menu isn't extensive but it is cheaper than most with 2 rolls at $4 and 2 rolls at $6 but also ordered other sushi
The thing about the sushi on the happy hour menu is that for 4
Roka Akor was a combination of excellent service ambiance and most importantly exceptional food with a wide variety of great dishes to choose from including hot and cold plates tempura grilled steaks seafood sushi as well as a diverse selection of drinks cocktails sake shochu and beer
To satisfy the mostly Caucasian Scottsdale neighborhood the choices are part Chinese Orange Chicken Kung Pao Japanese Chicken Teriyaki and Thai Pad Thai Panang
I had Panang Chicken curry which came with your choice of fried or steamed rice steamed Jasmine
From the egg-in-a-hole for breakfast to the lovely Coq au vin  lamb shank or Beef Bourguignon for lunch or dinner the menu is always rich
Their coffee is pretty good and they have a much bigger selection of snacks food drinks and toiletries than you'll find at other gas stations
The menu was extensive and taco sushi-style menu was cool but pricey
with your quirky menu that doesn't quite make sense salads fried fish & chips burgers as wraps
The food is always delicious and the selection more unique than other restaurants
gets higher ratings with a tiny selection like this by serving exceptional food
The happy hour menu is very affordable and has several options for both food and beverages
The menu is a throwback to the good ole' days of diner foods
It's the same wonderful aroma and quality of food but they've made some changes to their menu
They also have homemade cornbread and a few homemade desserts on the menu
The best value is their happy hour and the food choices at happy hour are moderately varied and fairly good
There is a wide variety of veg and vegan dishes in both North and South indian cuisine
The menu featured a number of interesting dishes including jerk T-bone steak lobster tail fricassee chicken Jamaican red peas soup and steamed crawfish
On the positive side my main dish was the Caribbean chicken which was delicious and a large portion size
I have come to believe that most of us generally desire that unique union of a robust menu composed of carefully planned and executed dishes with a splash of unique drinks a dazzling wine selection excellent service that offer suggestions to round out a dining experience and finally an atmosphere that lets us focus on our palette not our survival instincts
I ordered the two types of chikens they had on their lunch menu and for $9 I got a whole lotta chicken
It was a generous portion not huge but adequate with large pieces of halibut scallop and probably some other white fish
The dinner entree was a menu choice of 3 proteins chicken fried steak steamed fish or an 8oz
I've had other items from the menu before pizza burgers etc and they're nothing exceptional
They have a different menu every day of the week but some food items always stay the same like their breadsticks and pizza
The food is well priced and their meal portions are adequate
While In-n-out remains this west coaster's favorite Five Guys stays on the list for when that afternoon food coma is oh so necessary
the menu offers many traditional mexican plates of food like the delish mole poblano i had so don't be expecting any nachos quesadillas enchillada buffet though i secretly wished they had some
portions were just right and coming from san francisco all that food for under $50 was a steal
Not surprisingly The Downtown Deli offers shovel-fuls of sliced meat between your choice of bread often with a side of fries always bound to sate your appetite
My only qualm is that they don't have a wide variety of food options
We were a party of 10 and made a reservation about a week in advance and also did the $40/person menu which consisted of a few dishes per course
Our wives chose the fish & chips and we chose the steak selection
The food was excellent served promptly and in large portions
it's about $7 and you can get a pulled BBQ sandwich with your choice of meat garlic mashers yummy chunky garlic mashed potatoes a bag of chips and a drink
They have a selection of Sushi Rolls Sashimi Salmon White Tuna Tuna Octopus and a small hibachi station
The chinese food selection was great too including prime rib
I would say the dessert selection was the best
It is a very generous portion for the cost and the meat is surprising meaty and tender considering this cut is really just a byproduct
All sandwiches are served on a warm bun that is fresh and has perfect size and texture so to not distract from the meat and sauce
We had barely made a dent in our sushi when I asked for the menu to order more
The only small complaint I have about the sushi menu is that it's very limited
The rest of the family either got the Roasted Jidoir Chicken huge portion or the Spice Rub Steak
A four course meal is the way to go starting out with a cheese fondue of your choice then a salad then an entree I prefer the broth for dipping rather than the oil as it makes the meat just so darn tender and then of course the dessert in the form of a chocolate fondue
Try the blacken Wasabi Fish also a good choice
We've tried numerous items on their menu and have always gone back for the bbq chicken the pad see yew and the red curry
also overheard us talking and he and his trainer offered us a choice of one of their nightly dessert specials so sweet
Stand-up service great lunch/happy hour selection and pricing awesome patio setup and some of the best Latin food I've eaten
The plate came with two delicious sopapillas filled with ground beef and generous portions of rice and beans
After ordering our meal we asked for the non filtered sake and the waitress said it was definitely a good pairing for our food selection it would nutralize the heat with the suttle sweetness man was she right it was like horchata
The food is pretty good and the menu is pretty typical brewery pub fare
We ordered off the sushi style taco menu
Scale of 1-10 multiple visits5 Food4 Service5 Atmosphere4 ValueAn uninspired menu w/ average barfood at best
He listened and did seem genuinely concerned even stepping outside the restaurant as we were leaving and offering us complimentary dessert
ProsTeriyaki bowls are pretty cheapNice size servingsThe seating area is usually very clean They are fairly quick at getting your food out to youThe beef is really well cooked
Their prices are modest and the menu is ripe with dishes all of such delicious properties as to make you come back and sample and savour every new choice
Food was really good and the portions were huge
I recommend the Crispy Spinach '2' dish that is on the menu under house specialties; it's a bed of fried spinach with a spicy chicken shrimp and vegetable medley on top
Compared to some other choices Sushi101=small cramped poor quality; RA=dirty smelly loud it seems to be the best in our book
You can tell the makers put a lot of thought in finding the right spices and flavors in creating healthy choice dishes
The two sandwich artists must have had something against non meat eaters as they berated me in front of other customers for choosing a meat free selection THAT IS ON THE MENU
Next on my list from these great people is Baratin - they just opened up a little wine bar cafe and I'm sure the food is going to be just as amazing
We always get a platter that they offer which allows us to try a variety of meat and sides
This is a WONDERLAND for anyone with vegetarian tendencies though they also have a meat menu for the carnivores
The Happy Hour is great better for wine than tapas and the late night menu is a very welcome touch as there are limited places that serve food that late in Scottsdale
The starter menu includes some unusual and tasty items like the hot and cold wedge salad and a Kobe beef foot long hotdog
Side dishes are generous portions large enough to be shared and I liked the Parmesan fries and asparagus
The menu is limited; chicken strips fries coleslaw and Texas toast
What choice did they have but to open their own pizza parlor
Same food same menu same salsa same friendly service
Although not located in a choice area of Phoenix this establishment is clean has a very efficient staff and serves really good food - definitely better than in many of the good buffet establishments I have tried
for lunch here at opening day and was impressed by the appealing interior decor and the wide array of tasty choices which includes Mongolian grill they have killer mini-kebabs sushi clams in ginger-jalapeno broth as well as many of the staples in Chinese buffets but very nicely seasoned here
I'm definitely returning so that I can have some of the dishes I wasn't able to try because I ran out of tummy room - even though I had only a small tasting portion of each dish I tried
That's the happy consequence of having such a wide variety of good food available
XDThey have a good selection of pizza [chicken pesto = fave
Good variety on the menu sushi rolls brown or white rice noodles chicken steak seafood combo plates - the full gamut
Delicious sauces hugely generous portions speedy service all for around $10 per dish
The prices are right there's a good variety of ethnic food the cashiers are quick and friendly and they're just helpful
Overall Exactly as advertised which is what I like about this place and the smallish menu emphases food of high quality
It attracts teenagers who have access to their parents' credit cards people hoping to sneak a variety of sweets in to a nearby movie mothers looking for a diversion for their kids and those of us hoping to induce food guilt after a guilt-free meal at True Food guilty
The food is not as good as it once was and the portions looked smaller to me than previous visits and the $12 margaritas still get you way buzzed You will need that buzz to tolerate the parking and the awful wait where you are pretty much ignored by the flamboyant douche bag host who while has a hip cool shirt could offer people waiting some God Damn chips or something or even some f^&*@$g water or better yet acknowledge that I am indeed alive
They have 4 choices of catfish talipiacod and whiting
I wish they would have two different size options that would solve the problem of it being too expensive and too much food
Their menu offers pizza      salads burgers and drinks
While they have a decent menu including some attempts at irish classics like boxty bangers and mash corned beef and cabbage and fish and chips which can be quite tasty the quality and tastiness just aren't there
The food was pretty poor and the portions were horrible
The sushi was very fresh and of good quality and the menu was quite extensive with classic rolls and specialty rolls as well
The prices are very reasonable the Pad Thai came with both chicken and shrimp and was a huge portion for only $8
Appearance isn't everything this looks just like a normal fast food type of place but by checking the menu found that there are several specialties that are my joys
Primebar has reasonable Happy hour pricing as well as premium drink choices and quality foodWe sampled the Pomegranate Martini ~ The Silly Goose ~ Margarita ~ Beer
I bet Primebar can improve this dish to come up to the standards of the rest of the menu
The pizzas were just the right size for one person and the crust was awesome
and a nice menu with good choices of good ol' American food
The Pho was excellent; the broth was lovely and the cuts of meat were nice and lean and in the right size to enjoy without a struggle
We tried the whole hog and expected generous portions of ribs chicken and sausage for the price
Favorite choices included the cauliflower eggplant chicken tikka masala and veggie tofu tikka as well as the mint hot and curry sauces
My wife and the kids opted for the Americanized menu and went with specials like sweet and sour chicken shrimp in white sauce and garlic beef
Two of us ate more than a healthy portion of food and it was only like $28
They have a wonderful variety and it's a nice kick with meaty not-sweet menu
I also went to Essence for a sweet tooth fix and was completely disappointed in the dessert/pastry selection
The regular sushi menu did seem a little pricey so I'll prob stick to coming here only during happy hour
From the menu the dishes appeared as if they should be creative and tasty
Ultimately no matter who the chef is who developed the menu and concept - the food is only as good as the staff cooking it
This buffet restaurant has an extensive display of international foods
For breakfast there is an omelet station extensive granola/musueli choices yogurt pastries various meats including peppered bacon that was sliced to order
Decent food court selections as well with real restaurants on the outer edges
I have tried pretty much every dish on the menu at least once
No comfort food menu would be complete without braised short ribs and I have to admit that Chef Justin gets it right here - they're some of the best I've had in town and priced just right
I ordered the Build Your Own Omelet which comes with meat of your assuming you eat meat cheese and veggies of your choice
The service was great the food was even better and the menu has tons of options
I decided to go with this choice last night because I wasn't in the mood to cook and I'd remembered seeing commercials about Pizza Hut serving pasta and thought I'd give it a shot
This is the cutest pet store that carries high-quality healthy cat and dog food the type of non-processed food you can't find at a traditional chain store and a variety of wonderful cat and dog supplies ranging from beds pet shampoos treats leashes collars clothing dishes etc
They tell you on the menu that food is prepared fresh every day and one bite of a tortilla will tell you that for sure
the boneless chicken portion was small the rice was good and  the veggies consisted of cabbage and that's it
I should have just went with the fish but I'm a sucker whenever I see crab on a menu
Turns out they deliver and the menu shows an offering that expands beyond the restaurants misleading name of Pizza to the second power
The portions were smaller than we had anticipated but the food and service was so slow we didn't dare to order more
Somehow I made room for a few bites of the variety of heavenly desserts Gary brought out to our table to end our oh so fabulous meal
I thought that their menu was too expensive for street food and ignored others when they raved
If the large portions don't fill you up you can gnaw on the coconut meat
We shared a chocolate dessert which is decently sized and enough to share between five gals
The meat was extensively dry like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for awhile
The menu online is the menu for their Canadian locations so I was really bummed out to find out they didn't serve the chicken with apples and brie sandwich at this location
The lunch prices are reasonable the portions are on point and the food is satisfying
They offer a lunch special that includes your choice of two soups an entree rice a bangin' crunchy eggroll and two crispy wontons
Very much more like a pizza joint than a bar even though they have a wide variety of good beers both local microbrew and imports
Also for a restaurant based on the use of simple fresh pure ingredients that are locally and or organically grown to create a healthy and flavorful menu; I would expect to find a few more vegan and vegetarian entrees please note I am neither vegan nor vegetarian I just prefer veggie dishes
I would also like to see a selection of pure raw food entrees and by raw I don't mean just salads
Great diverse selection of music playing excellent & very friendly service great wine and the food
The food is reliable I like their beer and wine selection so that gets three stars and it gets one more because you can take your dog if you sit outside
The food can be ordered table side and  ranges from steak to a very tasty Asian menu
The two bartenders on were very friendly and greeted us right away and we given a drink and food menu
Let me say that I wanted to try every item on the food menu as all the options sounded delicious
I always split the dinner for two combo which has an incredible amount of food and a huge variety of their offerings
Ironically the eggs were both my wife and I least favorite portion of the dish
The only thing I've had from the HH menu that I didn't thoroughly enjoy was the Chicken Satay
I love mexican food and this place just topped my list for best in phoenix
25 for items like gai lan Chinese broccoliThe Bad - weak dessert selection-  have to wait for a table on weekends getting Best Dim Sum on New Times helped that out- make sure they don't include a tea charge for your kids who don't drink tea- came here when they opened on a Monday 10am  2 carts came out 20 min later with some food
well they didn't have a gluten-free menu so I looked for something resembling a GF dish and the server was kind enough to confirm with the cooks/chefs that indeed that was the case
This one was alright had a great veggie variety and the meat variety was okay as well
The kobe beef burger cooked medium was definitely the better choice
The flavor was excellent and I would definitely order this entree again - if I can get over the extremely realistic meat analog
We took a stroll through the arcade to peruse our selection
You always know where the rib-eye is located on the selection trayBut the preparation of the food is pedestrian the presentation is uninspired the sides are uninspiring and the whole feel is formulaic and datedI do expect more at this price point and Morton's just doesn't deliver these daysSo just like MickieD's I only go to Morton's these days when I am dragged or is it druggedAre there worse dining experiences
I ordered the ruby fish curry and since I had the choice of spiciness I chose Thai hot
You will find a greater variety of dishes in this restaurant inside the Super-L Ranch Market international food store at 44th St
The menu items include interesting dishes such as Squid Pickle Mustard Cream Rice and Pork Stomach Porridge see the picture I posted of the menu on the restaurant counter's base -- try finding THOSE in your local Chinese take-out place
After viewing an option for breakfast pizza on their brunch menu online we just had to go
Then came my chicken shawarma entree which had a sizeable pile of the aforementioned chicken plus hummus tabbouleh rice and more pita
The menu has a nice selection of salads sandwiches and pizza but honestly the salads are so great that I or anyone who I have gone with haven't ventured beyond the greens
Though the sandwich tasted good was worth the price and is my new fast-food of choice while in the Arcadia area it does not trump The Del Rey from Los Reyes De La Torta overall
The menus and prices are simple and excellent and the food is phenomenal
I had them put together an antipasto tray pasta salad marinated artichokes and mushrooms olives and pepperoncinis and an italian style pepperoni capacollo genoa salami provolone & muenster cheese plus some of their rolls that they were nice enough to slice into smaller portions
The server dropped dessert menus when I had instructed a bday dessert tray w candle to come out
Some one must've reminded him bc 5 min later he hastily picked up our dessert menus
There are plenty of choices for food but I usually get the Maxwell Street Polish Dog which is pretty good
I get the concept of this place with a simple fast order menu but if you are looking for good Greek food
Food is good but the portions would be too small for my husband who still eats like food like he's a teen preparing for a football season
Best things on the menu  Egg rolls real chubby kind from back East - not the spring roll most pass off as an egg roll BBQ ribs so meaty and zero fat Skewered beef well seasoned and tender
The food is delicious I had the citron chili with tofu and my girlfriend had the pad thai but the portion sizes are way too small
I get the 2 meat combo which comes with a side beans chips good chips and 2 meats of your choice for like $7
My half-sandwich of shaved corned beef swiss cheese fresh sauerkraut on Acacia Cafe marble-rye bread looked tiny Mom and I noticed the wee-portion right away but it was full of flavor
a little FYI if you have questions about the menu the servers are clueless so any food allergies should be consulted with Johnny or his wifie
If you like spicy food Last week I had the philly cheese steak it was a special on the menu for the week SO GOOD
These restaurants strive to change their menu with new creative dishes

As the first roll on the specialty rolls list I expected it to be a knock-out but it wasn't
The food is pretty good but the portions are ENORMOUS
The cafe is a little more upscale than what you'll find down in the food court and the menu consists of salad sandwiches soup and pasta
During our visit together we took home a variety of groceries including some fresh peaches and apples peppers steak grain and veggie salad Charleen's delicious granola and a pretzel bread roll that was amazingly paired with a tangy mustard
This is my favorite dish I have found on the menu and I really enjoy it
-Food HUGE portions very tasty delicious & fresh

It's easy to navigate and has excellent food choices
And although I am tempted by the many foods we Americans shun I think I spotted either pig urethras or cervixes I will contain my impulse shopping and stick to the menu
The menu is diverse and includes many of the AF signature items such as the Mushroom Spinach & Goat Cheese Tart the Strawberry Chicken Salad and their extraordinary desserts

the food here was pretty good but i found the menu actually better then the food tended to be
The food is kinda pricey for the portions you get
The kids' menu contains the usual suspects but the pizza is of the same quality of the adult menu
All of their food choices adhere to the healthy living culture as best as any restaurant i've found in the west valley/glendale area
I was surprised by the variety of the menu and the servers seem to be very knowledgeable on the different alcohol and food
I do love the flavor of the food but the portions-- particularly on the tacos-- are pretty small for the price

Also this is the only pizza restaurant I have found that has the combination sandwich on the menu
One of my favorite lunches is the Turkey Avocado Melt it's called the Roast Beef Avocado Melt on the menu but I always get it with Turkey and a side of fruit
The entire experience was sub-par and for the pricey dishes you'd expect a better menu better flavor and better service
They have a variety of meats to choose from from veggie to brat to spicy beer dog and a huge list of unique toppings like mango chutney and chipotle cream cheese
The food is GREAT especially the shrimp with cream sauce I forget the exact name but its featured on the menu
Carne Asada Tacos are the best but I like to mix them up when I order so I get the shrimp chicken and pork for variety

They bring out the beef cut in small cube bite size pieces on a metal plate still sizzling loud enough to get the attention of the other diners
The portion is only half of what Da Vang gives you and the pieces of beef are not tender and are studded with chunks of fat and there weren't many noddles to speak of the opposite of Da Vang's
The full size pizzas are even better but never in the area to take home a full size pizza at night
The stadium is clean modern has a diverse selection of food/drinks and yep air conditioned at times

The other two choices were fish or veggies

He tells me for $6 he could get me one more piece of fish and I tell him I'm not paying that for another piece this size
I usally eat the Twice Grilled Chicken Salad healthy portion of food

The food seemed well prepared and reasonably priced and the portions were certainly generous
The menu is a tasty combination of sandwiches salads burgers and other comfort foods
The menu is eclectic and witty offering a variety of rice bowls and sushi along with buffalo burgers and sushi ice cream for dessert a great concept called Mojos where ice cream and brownie are rolled in a layer of rice krispies and then sliced like sushi and served in a bowl
Their menu is extremely limited  Paninis and Pizza and only two entree choices
The dessert menu looked good but we did not indulge
We skipped the restaurant due to checking out the menu on line before we left and the prices were pretty outrageous and after reading other reviews about the food on here I am glad we did

After reviewing their VAST menu of over 100 dishes which covered everything from every colored curry under the sun to  vegetarian dishes Barbeque Chinese favorites and soups that I'm looking forward to sampling when the weather gets colder; I ordered the Pad Thai and my mom ordered the Cashew Chicken

The best part was the dessert - only two of us were having dessert and on the top of the dessert menu - it says desserts for two - well
White chocolate banana cream pie was my choice and it really had an amazing flavor but the dessert you must have is the French white chocolate bread pudding - wow - wow - wow
My ONLY possible suggestion for them would be if they started serving MONSTER SIZED EGGROLLS
There's a place currently in the strip mall next to Sprouts on 19th Avenue & Northern that sells MONSTER SIZED EGGROLLS but it would be nice if I didn't have to drive that far
Maybe that's what I should expect from a restaurant that lists their sushi only in English
Veggie pizza was tasty as well but they only put itty bitty bits of toppings on the lunch portion pizza
The food was really yummy - I highly recommend the a fried fish offering an off the menu item our waitress was nice enough to tell us about as well as the Gyoza Soup

I know its a lot of food but we wanted to try a good variety and it cost about $27
It might work out better for future menus if they created pizzas priced accordingly with toppings already added
I generally get the large pizza and wing special listed in the Value=Pak mailers I get at home
Drinks went empty several times tried to order a second round of sushi only to change our minds after our waiter walked by our table without taking the filled out menu at least 5 times
The food is good it's only eggs and toast but the waitstaff is is slow forgetful can be rude and doesn't know the menu
Food is generally tastier than the other concepts in my opinionServers are friendlyValet parkingNow the negativesFood was 'meh'Awkward patio seating with uncomfortable chairs sitting on dirtSlow serviceOver-priced especially for a kids grilled cheese plate that didn't even taste goodDon't come hungry  gnocchi was ok but was served as a diet portionValet parking I don't get this place but then again it's a Fox-owned business catering to the masses looking to make the big bucks
And a little bird told me that the most amazing thing on the menu thus far is the Oregano Lime Chicken
The food is fresh and you can choose from a variety of toppings from mushrooms to peppers to add on your burger
The menu is friendly and offers a wide variety for different tastes including sushi
Everything on the menu is delicious but I always end up ordering the beef taco combo
It seems like the perfect place for a meat and potatoes sort of guy plus I heard there's a great selection of English beers so I'm planning to take my boyfriend there for dinner asap twice in one week wouldn't be overkill right
The meatballs were not what I expected them to be based off of what I was reading on the menu
The food was slightly above average but the service was slow and below average overall a good choice if you are in the area but not worth the drive
Recommended any of their tandoori dishes; a vegetable curry that may not be on the menu but comes as a side in one of the special dinners; saag paneer; mango lassi; their relishes
In long this place has an awesome selection and mix of food
Menu drink soup food bill out you go all before you can seem to completely read the brief lunch menu
The lunch special menu highlights your typical offerings Orange chicken sweet and sour chicken Mongollon beef ad nauseam
The food was good and the prices were good just very small portions
They had a huge variety of dishes at what I can only describe as American/French fusion
And from what I've been told their menu changes frequently to new seasonal dishes
I think that the place has tons of potential to be an it spot if the menu was smaller with better food and the inside was thoroughly  cleaned and updated a bit with better lighting a better paint job etc
The night that we went there was a special duck dish not the one on the menu which was served with a spicy wasabi-like paste a ginger slaw some peppers and pickles
Ok-  first this I NOT fine dining it's a fast food that saidIt has a good selection of  Chinese and sushi
He said they change their dessert selection frequently and that night they were serving an apple crumble dessert with butterpecan icecream
The pizza was only the personal size but easily big enough for my girlfriend and I to split and very tasty
Their menu is handwritten on the wall with color photos of each dish
The wall menu is covered with red curtains because Grady says the food is the star here
You see without food the grumpiness evolves into rash hostility and I decided it was far too soon to pummel my new boss with his own queen sized pillow top mattress
50 lunch special which came w/veggie spring rolls a yummy soup which had chicken an entree of your choice and fried bananas spring rolls for dessert
I've had other pita dishes there and those are typically better proportioned for a meal
So all in all I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice place to go on a Saturday night the prices are reasonable the service is good even if they aren't as flexible as they should be at times with the menu and the food is very tasty
we frequent a variety of sushi restaurants in the valley and sakana seems to be our staple
the sushi and sashimi portions are generous and reasonably priced
The appetizer menu could use some work but the desserts make up for it
While you will not get any sort of memorable experience from the decor what you will remember is the intricate coded system of ordering from their enigma-menu and the way your dish looks when it comes out with mexican beans jerk chicken red jade pork and fried rice
Choose two numbers 1-12 as meat then either black or refried beans then from a selection of rice - pork chicken fried jerk spanish - oh and if you want it just thrown into the metal tin or prepared as a burrito or quesadilla
No doubt I will try to recreate this dish on my thanksgiving menu this year
I ordered the Carlsbad Stuffed Chicken Breast  which was stuffed with vegetables cream cheese and topped with queso fundido and served with rice and choice of beans
Arriba takes great pains to distinguish themselves as a New Mexico style of food and a large percentage of menu items were uniquely different than most Phoenix-area Mexican restaurants
I thought they had a great selection of sushi and sashimi
Plus the food was great everything we've had has been very tasty now it's all been off of the happy hour menu but that's the only time I'll probably be here the scotch eggs are delicious and my main recommendation
The food has potential and there are still several things on the menu that I haven't tried that sound good
They have good selection on better pet food grain-free Innova Evo etc
The menu had a lot of choices mostly bar type food but it was inexpensive and offered lots of options
Humble Pie offers a variety of unique pizza options
It lists a coupon for a free pizza if you spend $20 or more
The prices on produce and meat are pretty terrific and the beer selection improved considerably about two years ago
Not wanting to stand around and listen to a high school band or wanting 'festival food' we decided to see what the resort had to offer
I ordered a quesadilla which states on the menu that it includes chicken but the waiter charged it as an add on
Their food menu goes beyond the generic bar food you would see at most places like this
They have a good Mexican portion of the menu burgers salads steak chicken past wings and my fave the Spinatch and artichoke dip
Solid menu which also includes non sushi options plus GF
Margaritas taste like antifreeze unless you order the super premiums which won't leave any money left for ordering food and that may be a good choice
They have a good selection of pizzas flatbreads wines on their HH menu
Servers are attentive and friendly food and drinks come out at precisely the right moment not too soon not too late and portions are pretty big
I've been here twice and have had a crab benedict and a build-your-own omelet which includes choices of like a billion different veggies/meat and cheeses
Outside of some cheese/olive/meat trays the menu basically breaks down to panini or bruschetta--with many of the same combinations
At the end of the day the food is still  just as wonderful as it always has been but the portions were weak and I figured two stars was a bit extreme
The husband and I chose the menu and got sweet and sour chicken
Very affordable prices  generous portions and option of meat or tofu in each dish so vegetarian friendly
Normally at other BBQ places there's a selection of a few different sauces to choose from if you want to dress your meat with sauce
good portion size and chicken was great and I am very picky about my chicken
For breakfast dishes there were about 5-7 egg dish choices and a handful of other choices
With that said it's very important to me that a sushi restaurant offers a variety of non-seafood menu items
It still isn't the Chicago deep Dish I yearn for but it has all of the qualities of a Non Chicago style Pizza I search for Fresh Ingredients Great Sauce Big Slices and a Crispy bottom but not too thin more pan sizeWe got some Ziti last night for the first time instead of just pizza
It is on my top 5 list of pizza's in the valley
The servers know the food; they can describe anything on the menu and recite the specials as if their job depends on it if you know Christopher it probably is
Sushi was so-so the wine list wasn't anything to make me want to go back
Then had a choice of 2 salads 2 meats - we had turkey that was served with a focaccia dressing and the tilapia served with a side of some of the best creamed spinach I ever had - then 2 side dishes in addition - mashed sweet potatoes and mashed garlic potatoes that were just okay - 2 pasta dishes - we had the signature Rigatoni D and the angel hair with pomodoro sauce/sausage - and 2 desserts
I usually order off their specials menu and get seafood and its always on point
They have done a great job with their regular dish selections and with their specials
50*you like bar games pool shuffleboard and board games are all available to play*you like places with mixed crowds*you don't want to dress up to go to a bar I'm pretty sure I could have rolled up in a hoodie jeans and flip flops and still have been overdressed*you like obscure songs from the '80s for some reason that dominated the jukebox selections last night*you want to chill on a couch with a drink in front of a faux fireplaceOverall Monkey Pants is not a place that takes itself seriously
We are both vegetarians that will eat fish and were excited by the plethora of fish dish choices on the specials board
Their menu and review boosted of the best pizza in Arizona so I was intrigued
Although the menu is a little pricey it's definitely worth it because you order from the alacarte menu and you get the salad/seafood/appetizer/dessert buffet for free
Nice mix of hot and cold choices on the menu and tempting desserts mocking you from their glass confines
On the plus side the fried rice came in an ogre portion size so if you're looking for value this dish will leave you with leftovers for days
The chef was willing to prepare a dish that was not on the current menu but did appear on the website
The food is all local organic and sustainable when possible even down to the wine list which is replete with local selections
Lots of choices for non-burgers Ahi Tuna steak and chicken sandwiches even salads
The food is great the wine list too and the service is decent but
And the veal meatballs rival Lisa g's meatballs not in size but certainly in taste and flavor
They have aisle upon aisle of every type of soda cookie chip pudding and fruit snack you could every want but if you're like me and don't eat a ton of junk food wouldn't you rather be able to find what you want without wading through bag upon bag of the newest variety of Flamin Cheetos
The selection of Asian food staples like five-spice powder and miso soup base
Pretty good selection with your typical bar foods burgers wings
If you are a seafood fan the cioppino and seafood salad loaded with shrimp and calmari are both excellent choices
My choice a loaf of high 5 fiber bread with whole wheat honey flax millet oat and sunflower seeds that weighs literally 2 pounds and a half dozen honey wheat dinner rolls
Good beer & drink selection and good food selection
On the top of the list of menu stand outs are the buffalo chicken nachos
I think the food at Coach and Willie's is solid bar food with large portions
The food is decent the portions are enormous
We ordered from the Arizona style menu Americanized Chinese food but they have an authentic Hong Kong style menu with all the things I seen in the cafe's in Hong Kong and China while visiting there
Keep up the good food and the tradition that flows in your menu
The menu is very diverse and prices are reasonable for the quantity - more than enough food
It is one of those comfort foods I used to eat as a kid so when I saw it on the menu I couldn't resist
Not the restaurant's fault per se but it would have been helpful to know from the extensive laundry list online menu that fish/tofu items had to be made to order
I again ordered something off the menu and we also ordered some vegetarian fried rolls to share
All that said they need to focus on doing fewer menu items better and should add some vegetarian/fish items to their main lunch menu so people like me don't have to wait half an hour for a special order
The Market Cafe serves sandwiches chicken and a variety of California-style menu items
They aren't gigantic like some other places they are a manageble size and quite tasty with seasoned potatoes cheese and eggs along with the meat
And I'd like to try other things on the menu including another round of the chicken and waffles to see if my experience differs next time
Food comes in somewhat small portions so I wouldn't recommend coming here with more than 4 people if you plan on stuffing yourself
The staff were great the food and atmosphere were good but I think I was expecting a more tapino-esque menu
The specialties are a few types of cajun dishes gumbo pan roast and seafood creole with your choice of meat shrimp crab oyster crawfish chicken  or a combination of all meats
anywhere in the valley is usually an expensive proposition but here $15-$17 gets you generous portions of very good food and $25 gets you more shellfish than two people can finish
Stingray's happy hour menu is smaller than most but there are great deals on entrees and classic rolls like spicy tuna the Vegas roll dragon roll shrimp tempura roll and the crispy spicy tuna my favorite--it's not so much a roll but it's delicious  panko-crusted rice topped with tuna and a jalepeno slice
Yet again I am disappointed with Arizona's selection of ethnic food
We had a choice of egg drop or hot and spicy soups an egg roll and many choices of beef seafood chicken pork dishes yet not many vegetarian dishes if any
Their supplement/vitamin section is quite robust they have a great meat section and their produce section is twice the size of TJ's
The chicken and hummus on the starter menu is sooo good
from the yummy fresh warm bread to the salad with the awesome shaved tomato pieces to my HOMEMADE chicken alfredo which was most definitely the best Ive ever had in my life and the raspberry cheesecake everything was just absolutely amazingthe service was great and the wine selection was HUGE
The egg roll was over sized mealy and mostly cabbage
While I was going to get the Capriciossa pizza it was the most expensive pizza on their menu and I was put off at the price
50 for 17 oz of tasty draft3  Darn good Bratwurt and the crunchiest most well seasoned fries that I've come across in a long long timeAnd it was a friendly crowd to bootMy only disappointment was the absence of my favorite german dish from the menu
Our portions were pretty descent sized but could have been a little larger compared to other soul food restaurants we have tried
The menu us full of Italian food like pastas not just pizza
we looked at the menu for appetizers and i was gonna pass on the food looked a little over priced
The meat shop in the back offers some good selections for you
We were so disappointed over the last few months with Baiz market for their meat selections and offeringstheir halal ground beef is just gross even the extra lean ground beef is awful   that we finally made the switch to I-Mart after 5 years of exclusively purchasing our meat from Baiz originally
The meat and prices are incomparable to Baiz as I-Mart certainly offers a better selection in meat and their prices are slightly cheaper plus we don't have to deal with any attitude from the butchers like at Baiz
Overall everyone was very pleased w/ their food choices
mehthe jade red chicken is probably the best thing on the menu next to the jerk chicken the black beans are pretty divine as well
but the menu is HUGE no WAY they don't have SOMETHING that strikes your fancy on that thing and the food is all pretty good
Best thing I like is the selection and it's fresh meat not the frozen shaved stuff
The menu looked appetizing with hand tossed and stretched pizza's sandwiches salads nacho's etc
Overall the most food was really good and unique the prices are just a little too high for the portion size
Over time we have tried almost everything on the menu and found every dish to be unique and creative with the greatest most complex but enjoyable flavors imaginable
And Kai carries that theme of food is art to all aspects of dining down to the custom hand drawn art on each menu
The meatballs were delicious and the portion size more than adequate for two servings
Everything at Sakana is just a variety of a the California roll and they are super generous not in a good way with the imitation crab
Decent wine selection tasty desserts and a fun atmosphere
i would come back for their regular menu based on how good their food was for the event
Having eaten a variety of foods here and never have had anything to complain about is pretty close to a miracle
Big Dawgs emphasizes big food items such as a variety of foot-long hot dogs to a very large $16 soft pretzel that comes with multiple dipping sauces
Same with dessert- daily selections may vary
There was an awesome selection of food and yum
The food here is good the drink menu is extensive which is always a must for me and the scene was pretty good
They didn't have a lot of curries on the menu and the dishes were HUGE
Not a huge fan of their chips greasy fries but with the wide selection of fish and low prices this is a dependable lunch
Second a note to whoever writes the descriptions for the rolls on the menu You may not have too many Asians in your life but next time you're thinking of a way to describe your sushi saying things like 'you no likey
They also list which foods are gluten free
So anyway - in spite of this place having great wine selections at reasonable prices considering the cost of the food great pretzel bread the illusion of great service and good food when they allow you to order it I won't be going back
Overall the food was tasty selection good and prices reasonable
the salmon quesadillas was on the fishy side the pollo relleno good but a little dry and didnt get the poblano and goat cheese flavors that drew me to choosing the dish the cilantro mousse sounded more interesting on the menu but was cream cheese and cilantro the Obama burrito was the winner on our table though
The portion sizes at this place are huge and their food is pretty cheap
We have tried a wide selection of dishes between us and everyone has been pleasantly surprised with the quality of the dishes presented
This place is good enough to add to the list of pizza places worth a return visit
The menu was explained to us very well although she had to dash off and ask the chef a couple of questions in regards to the desserts for the evening when we asked
We decided on several menu items including an order of butterfish for each of us then I got the tuna and the squid ink risotto
The pizzas here are the perfect size I say two hungry guys can kill a pie no problem
The food is pretty good not overly proportioned but just satisfying in appetite
Like I said the quality was good and tasty the proportion of bread to meat was just a little smaller than expected
Great deal too for less than eight bucks you can get the lunch special with salad two mini egg rolls chicken and rice and the portions are enormous
First let me state that the only reason I am deducting a star is because I didn't like the entree that I ordered but due to the fact that the quality of the food was great I would return to try a different entree on the menu
Again though they do basic food very well which is harder said then done and that is why I would recommend it I would not go out of my way though just because of the location and the size of the place but I only judge by food
I've heard the pizza is THE item to get off the menu
My 3 year old ordered chicken strips & fries it came out to 3 good size strips and about 8 fries scattered across the plate
We ordered multiple items and they have some great dishes my favorite is the lo mein catonese style the pork selections where also yummy
For the unacquainted the menu offers all the traditional North Indian dishes you would find at a typical Indian restaurant as well
Fez makes a pizza-like item on the menu with pesto and fresh mozzarella which is quite tasty
As we sat down and looked over the delicious-sounding menu I remarked that if the food was as good as the atmosphere this may become my new favorite place
If you are really going for some meat don't be afraid to order triple meat since the double portion isn't exactly overlowing
The food was good and the portions were just right for lunch was hooked until
Listen I am all for food that is bad for you
however they slice up the chicken so small that it's about the same size as the diced water creast
We started getting an 18 because I felt like we were getting gipped a bit when we got the 16 as they'll usually use a differently sized pan to make it and it always seemed to be a bit closer to 14 than 16 I'm big on pizza and I KNOW my sizes
Their protein selection is made up of veal pork and asparagus stuffed meatloaf turkey a couple different chicken selections stuffed pork and a few other meat dished
Not the decorations not the menu not the friendly staff not the quality of the food
With the taste buds panting for more I googled Whole Foods and assumed the Paradise Valley store would be the most logical choice for in-store smoked fish
The serving sizes are hearty and food was good
Complementing the food is a well-thought out wine list and at very reasonable prices
Therefore you'll just have to look elsewhere for a play-by-play of the dishes as they also seasonally change menu items it renders this task improbable if not impossible
Naturally we headed straight to the back counter to take a look at their fish quality and selection
We examined the menu and concurred on the 3 dishes to share based on preferences for separate meat dishes and flavors for that overall balanced palette experience
The most awesome attribute about most noteworthy traditional Thai and Lao places was that most dishes are about $10 and normally you have 3 people share 2 large oversize dishes
This place lacked this aspect as the 3 dishes we received for that price was an individual small portion size
The food is very good the sushi bar has many selections more then other buffet with sushi bar offered
The hot wings are also a good choice -- lots of meat and tasty Harp-soaked sauce
The food is not bad and it's worth the low prices on the menu no question
The bartender warned us that the fries were good sized orders and maybe we wanted to split  an order but we were starved and each got an order and its a good thing we did as the pizzas were on the small side
The bartenders were super friendly and offered up a lot of great information about the drinks and the food menu
The combination of open space small size and constant wok cooking yes I know it's a Chinese place and that's how the food is prepared fills the air furniture and fixtures with grease
The food came in big portions but did not leave me feeling weighed down or sleepy after
Many of the dishes attempt to infuse the sweetness of various fruits which I do not like unless it is appropriate it never was on this menu
Aside from the curries the rest of the lunch menu was the typical Chinese stir fry type of dish
My husband and I came in for lunch and each ordered a separate dish but the portions were so huge we could have easily shared
Their sashimi is always top notch their drink specials great and their selection of rolls are too many to mention
I've had their Diniguan with Puto Kaldereta Menudo Fried Fish Sinigang and Mechado
There are a lot of different shrimp dishes on the menu
They have fresh fruit drinks served in fishbowl sized goblets and different kinds of fruit cocktail with whipped cream honey or sweet cream for dessert
While they change their soup selection daily they usually have around 4 choices I generally order the chicken noodle and the almond tuna sandwich
Great food good service and awesome wine list gives Cowboy Ciao five stars
So if you're into drinking this may be an amazing stop for you with its huge list of tequila if not you can probably find better food elsewhere with about the same prices
It's a wonderful opportunity to sample new dishes that may or may not make it to the big leagues the FEZ menu someday
The carrot jus was not detectable or if it was didn't add much and we were dismayed to see that the listing for the same ribs on the regular menu said that the meat came with ancho chile chocolate sauce
The portion was small which we usually don't mind if the dish is high-end and super-flavorful but that wasn't really the case here
Looks and tastes like store bought  I have had a variety of foods and they have all been good
We didn't have any of their food but the beer selection was nice and the red sangria was AMAZING
--The crispy eggplant parm and teriyaki bowl were great and filling we didn't have a problem with the portions here--AMAZING desserts
All of the items on the menu look very good and a part of the proceeds from sales of menu items with chicken breasts go to breast cancer awareness
but the girl was really nice and listened to him and when she left rolled her eyes he didn't even go in there to buy anything just to complain what a jerk haha
The burger was very tasty and not dry People who kavetch about grease HELLO a burger is supposed to be greasy this is not a heath food choice
From their awesome selection of easy to make Asian food amazing looking produce the super bulk foods the great selection of Newman's Own right next to products that were made locally and lunch/dinner options that include their great pre-made section from sandwiches to tabbouleh salad and their smoothie/sandwich/salad bar spot - everything was great
95 lunch specials with a l-o-n-g list of dishes at that price
We will definitely be back to try the soups noodle dishes curry selections etc
I wasn't that hungry and I'm always hyped for new foods so I snatched up a menu and looked at the options
When the server gave us our food it was wrong and didn't look like the picture on the menu or what Man vs Food and were was the fries
8 choices for wraps including albacore tuna salad cheese steak scrambled egg & bacon Asian chicken and grilled veggie
Here I felt as though I had a solid selection that spanned from a few pretty innovative salads to low carb chicken and salmon dishes
Portions are intentionally a bit smaller and although healthy can still be really flavorful it's not the same as the food you get elsewhere that's smothered in butter or deep fried
Also I don't eat meat and I am pretty healthy with what I eat and the only healthy thing I saw on the menu I could eat was the salmon salad
Usually a menu with over 50 rolls to choose from is not a good sign but from the variety I tried not a single roll was bad
That being said the pizza choices and ingredients were too yuppified for my taste
So keep in mind that the portions here are small-medium and very few dishes have a starch
The dish comes piled with clams but they are of the canned variety
The menu is quite limited although the food was good
For starters they have a great fresh fish selection especially the smoked whitefish my absolute favorite
They have a wide variety of food to choose from and you dont have to be a health nut/vegetarian to shop here
I think my favorite part about Zuzu are the portions - they give you the exact right amount of food - not gigantic obesity inducing portions not tiny leave you wanting more portions just the perfect amount of food
The menu is comfort food with a gourmet edge and some extra sophistication thrown in
For our last dish we had the cook make us something of his choice
The quality of the food and of the menu is second to none as far as sushi restaurants are concerned
Like how interesting to have the choice between pasta or Asian food I wouldn't have thought to make the connection so props to the owners
However I was not impressed with the food maybe it was our choices
You can choose from a variety of healthy food options hot or cold breakfast/lunch items and if you do feel like splurging - they do have some tasty pastries of normal portion sizes to try too
The menu changes seasonally at Lon's and we all decided that we were going to go for something hearty so it was sea bass pork duo and the Jidori chicken
The Happy Hour food menu is a nice size and reasonably priced $2 - $7
The menu is split into different areas Appetizers Sashimi & Sushi Tempura and Robata Grilled items sides and entrees
Food HighlightsSashimi Chef's Selection - This was amazing
Menu looked GREAT - standard favorites mixed in with a few dishes for the more adventurous
On a side note portions are pretty enormous so half portions are a good idea  terrible food aside
They have a great selection and the line moves at a good pace its well controlled
Our guests enjoy the constant parade of carts and variety of dishes
It just didn't have the same party-like atmosphere the music was barely audible no life-size blender and very mediocre food some canned papaya chunks and bland vinaigrette do not constitute a Caribbean salad in my opinion
The owner of the restaurant went over the entire menu for us told us the most popular dishes and really pointed out the pros and cons of each dish
+ + +'sfairly ethnic feel fresh lunch food clean several areas to eat inside outside VIP take-out friendly service- - - 'sfaux materials we all know it's fake just paint it mediterranean blue or something tone down on the clean smellIn sum if you are looking for a bit of ethnic flair with decent food and a variety of seating choices this is your place
The menu is almost exactly the same as the Scottsdale Steakhouse but the Seafood is placed above the meat portion of the menu
The seafood tower seems interesting until you see it is nothing more than an ice bowl filled with the crustaceans of your choice and some dry ice to attract attention
I really enjoy the free breakfast nothing fancy but it's a nice to have for sure and the small lobby area bar is great - beer wine and a great tasting selection of bar type food
Whatever magic they use works which they also must use to enlarge the rolls because they are a GREAT size
Big menu awesome service HUGE SANDWICHES very reasonable prices and great food
In retrospect I did not particularly revel in the recurring reminders of how everything was deep-fried In light of the disinclination of Udupi Cafe to omit certain ingredients in their dishes- which leads me to believe that most items are already pre-made and later plated if you read my other reviews you'll see just how many chefs are quite willing to swap out/sub sauces sometimes PIQUED at the chance to come up with a new sauce on-the-fly and the the reluctance in creating a simple chutney I doubt I'll keep UC at the top of my choices next time I have a taste for Indian cuisine
when we were served each course our server primarily nicole who was amazing identified each ingredient in the dish offering more detail than what was given on the menu
the combination of mindblowing food coupled with incredibly accomodating and informative service has to put binkley's at the top of the list of restaurants i've visited
The food is homemade and the menu has a ton of variety
They can have the most clever fusion ideas 'cool' decor a rad happy hour menu but the fish tastes minutes away from expiration
However I still feel their food is well seasoned and they give you good portions I would pass one the fried ice cream though for dessert for the price not worth it just make it at home
The food was very good and had over 100 selections
They have a great selection of authentic Mexican food and they also have a very great Tequila bar
and the food and beer selection is good too
I did a very cursory glance over the menu on their home page and was delighted to see that they had pho-style dishes here
Cobia makes it onto the menu and I don't see that much outside the Gulf Coast; plus it's one of the best fish you will ever eat
Normally we don't eat at the hotel restaurant but when I saw beef stroganoff on the menu I was hooked
We ordered shrimp fried rice the beef in french sauce scallops in XO sauce and my wide ordered the spare ribs in black bean garlic sauce which they made special for her since they are not on the menu
My husband and I could not find what we were looking for and the menu was no where near what you would expect from a sushi restaurant  very limited selection with the rolls
I asked for a variety of tofu and seafood
Then I got a vegetable dish what arrived was nothing more than a portion for 6 on an enormous oval dish that was nothing but soy and white cabbage with what looked like wallpaper paste
Bingsoo is a Korean dessert which works like this -You take a bowl and fill the bottom portion with shaved ice
Last time I checked family style was a choice of certain things and then the food keeps coming until you are done
A good amount of Chinese and Japanese food and quite an impressive selection of Indian foodstuffs - from refrigerated sweets to frozen kulfi pistachio and falooda flavored ice cream 40 kinds of frozen naan/chapati/paratha/roti and an impressive dry goods aisle including a wall of spice mixes
The menu changes every few weeks and you have at least 2 choices for appetizer salad soup entree and dessert to choose from for a little over $20 per person including tax and tip
Lots of nigiri rolls beer/sake and appetizers to choose from on that menu
It's nice that no one is rushing me when I make my choices from the steam carts and that empty plates are not being thrown at the front of the kitchen for dishwashing
After you get past that you find that on the menu there are only certain things that are available for happy hour and that none of the traditional rolls caterpillar roll are included
Out of all my sushi experiences I think this one is at the top of my list seriously Yen has been replaced
The only reason I stopped going is we had tried all the appetizers desserts and most of the entrees on the menu
So I read the other two reviews and thought that a chicken bowl would be the perfect portion for lunch today
very hip- good selection of wines- excellent friendly serviceNot so much- food was good but not as interesting as other wine bars we frequent- too many kids
They also have a selection of Italian dishes which I have not tried
I'm assuming everyone was there for the Smart Shopper deal for 1/2 off menu items excluded the drinks and desserts
The fish is beautifully cut as well as generous in size
The food menu was limited but very adequate for our simple minded tastes
There wasn't a huge selection of food on the menu but enough to satisfy most people
was along for the culinary experience as well and she helped us navigate the Chinese menu explaining about Szechwan cuisine and selecting some different dishes for us to try
I ordered veggie spring rolls which appeared to be raw on the menu but arrived deep fried
Like I said it's solid All-American cookin' like BBQ chicken great tender beef or pork ribs that fall right off the bone awesome steaks mouthwatering au gratin potatoes and the list goes on and on
Great wine selection VERY light food menu great staff and you can bottle your own wine
They also have desserts but not a full menu for meals
Let's get to the food - had the crabcake appetizer which was yummy two small very small portions
Both our portions were more than sufficient and both dishes were great
Very impressed with his ability to select wine for my wife and I we proceeded to order a selection of meat and cheeses which we also let him pick out for us
While waiting for our food I wandered back to the retail area to check out the beer and scotch selections my beverages of choice
While this dish which isn't on the menu is one of my favorites it didn't delight at the new CPK
Food - Looking at the menu we decided not to split an appetizer
The prepared foods area at this WF is much more restrained than at any other WF I've been to which is sad because I used to love ogling the selections at my Boston shop
Cheese selection is the only way in which Arizona has failed me until I met Laura my Whole Foods Cheese Monger not Lara of Petit Fromage
The food is delicious - I always suggest anyone try the bruchetta planks and any of their salads are a delicious choice
The bar area isn't that big but it's a fairly decent size and they have a few booths if you want to order food as well
The menu is full of rolls $4-$5  Bhan Mi's $8-10 and Pho`
I like the idea however in practice the sandwich was a bit dry I  mostly got bread flavor and it would have been nice if they cut it in to two smaller hand sized pieces instead of one long roll
They have a good menu and the food is always well prepared
I'm an avocado snob and you can get a good selection of the buttery green goodness in any omelet or egg dish you choose
We narrowed down our selection based on the recommendations and ended up getting Vietnamese egg rolls the spicy beef soup and the soft noodle sauteed meat combination plate
With the hour now nearing three Spencer returned to ask if I wanted to see the dessert menu and with my mantra that it never hurts to look I said sure and received a short list of four choices all of which sounded okay but none which sounded great and as such I deferred to my server's opinion and he recommended the Fourplay based on his own personal preference for cheesecake a good recommendation though certainly not on par with the savories
Described on the menu as Flourless chocolate cake New York Cheesecake Chocolate Cream Milk Chocolate Parfait and a Chocolate Fan and mere minutes after ordering it was clear from the start that this was a pre-prepared dessert and while each texture was nice enough the cake itself was a tad spongy thus relying on the 'fan' to add a bit of crunch-rich but not heavy cold but not frozen the flavor itself was not all that different from a Hostess Ho-Ho
A long day of dining behind me and dinner yet to go I hope Praying Monk is turning better business on other days of the week-my guess is that it'd be an awesome place to watch some College Football in the coming months particularly given the quality of the food and beer list if you're into that
You will get full off of the gigantic vegetables asparagus the side of a baby's arm I'm not even joking and not have any room for the variety of meats these Aladdin-pant-wearing sword-holding employees have in store for you
There are many choices and we have had some wonderful meals here so I suppose we shouldn't have been surprised to find the food fabulous and the service stellar especially considering the great reviews here on yelp
Their selection of fish is more than adequate but their prices are higher than some of the other ethnic markets in town
Overall Lee Lee provides a great selection of ethnic foods at relatively affordable though not rock bottom prices
Parking is easyService is always fantasticTake-out is always ready very quickly and very hotGood variety of spices at the attached little storeTried and recommend Shahi paneer chicken tikka masala veg korma
They offer several different sandwich selections other than the traditional such as a chipotle chicken with guac spicy may veggies on a baguette or bread of your choice
Love the grilled fish menu trying to stay on the healthy side and they will make modifications to your order without hesitation or grief
Only complaint is their seafood selection is crap nothing is really that fresh there at all everything usually smells fishynot good when looking for fresh seafood
Menu - all meats were available with potatoes and asparagus; nothing exciting about the sides potatoes were too smooth and the asparagus was over cooked
My usual choice is either the Teriyaki Chicken Bowl or their eight piece California rolls and Miso Soup
It took her at least half an hour to come back and check on us at which point she didn't note our empty glasses and listlessly said something vague about how she didn't know when our food would be out
Keep in mind this is one of the more modest sized dishes
Here you go-Urban Market Salad with watercress red pepper dried corn sugared pecans avocado and blue cheese vinaigrette dressing on the side-Citrus & Rum Free-Range Chicken with watercress pear-gorgonzola salsa-Alaskan Salmon with maple-ginger glaze-Asparagus couscous with feta and mint-Grilled vegetable feast with farmers goat cheese and herbs-and of course my favorite the Signature Sweet Potato Chips dusted with mild curryWe arrived at the above menu after looking through around eight pages worth of gourmet menu items that are all appealing possibilities if you choose to use the Herb Box to cater your event
THEN you check out the menu to see summer rolls tuna tataki sushi crab wontons and italian dishes
That fish they gave to him at Ruby's was probably half the size so I'm assuming they probably only paid 1
I oNly had the chance to try the bi bim bop rice bowl filled with veggies and a fried egg this visit and thought they could do a few things to improve including  using bulgogi meat instead of the ground beef offering it 'dolsot-style' aka in a hot clay pot so that the bottom rice gets toasted adding more variety of vegetables and leaving the gojuchang  hot pepper sauce on the side to add
Also the menu had a variety  of good things including the lunch bento box and sushi happy hour
The sizes of the dishes were very inconsistent
Then right along with the food size is the price
The specials board that listed the fish did not indicate that it was going to be in the form of a sandwich at lunch
The foods are excellent and the portion is great
The food is typical bar grub and the menu won't overwhelm you but it is still terrific
The food court is pretty decent with a selection that includes Sbarro DQ/OJ McDonalds Paradise Bakery Panda Express and a few less recognizable places
He made impeccable recommendations on the menu and timed the delivery of our food dessert and check perfectly
The only criticism I can make is that the selection of pizzas was a little weak but I had no problem waiting three minutes for the next piping hot pepperoni pie to spring from the oven
They had a special birthday message in the menu as well as chocolate bday wish on a small dessert plate of cookies and a picture of the two of us to commemorate the special occasion
Large selection of dishes to choose from along with the handmade noodle dishes
I knew the portions were going to be huge so I ordered from the Senior/Small Plate section and  there was still a ton of food easily 2000-3000 calories
They have a pretty decent selection of food and we all seemed to enjoy our fare nothing special just your typical bar food and they offer mini pitchers of beer I love that
So friends- an hour for our food from time of order food that wouldn't even be good if we waited only 5 mins for it and sucky wine choices
Food  Needless to say we all were guided to wonderful dinner choices
The lomo saltado was like a kid portion that had like 6 pieces of meat and it tasted like it was drenched in soy sauce
My wife likes the gluten free but is is a bit pricey when compared to a similar non-gluten free pizza of the same size
A very California menu with cucumbers in the water and fresh avocados on their tacos this is a fantastic place to get very good food at very reasonable prices
I got the roast pork dish from the Daily Special menu
From the starters we ordered the herbed potato fries with Gruyere cheese and mushroom gravy; from small plates we ordered times mac and cheese with crispy prosciutto and herbed breadcrumbs and added lobster; and from the sharing menu we ordered the citrus-brined fried chicken with white cheddar waffles
Again the serving size was way more than enough for a big guy and there was enough meat and goodie falling off of each taco that you could make two new tacos
fathers day birthdays I choose this place for the all you can eat sushi lovers menu
That way you can order a good variety and not have to eat entire rolls by yourself
Other items on the menu to take note of would be the Moco Loco and Spam Moco which are also common foods amongst the locals in Hawaii
They have a small but satisfying menu consisting of mainly chicken
While you are siting down for your food you can watch a selection of never ending Indian soaps
The food is pretty tasty and the portions are not bad for the price
Our waitress who must have barely been 18 promoted savignon blanc from Spain maybe that exists somewhere but not on their wine list and food was coming out undercooked meaning raw chicken to tables around us
The menu's style is comfort food which as we all know traditionally is heavy on the meat sauces and fat content
next time I am back in the area I will be checking out more of the menu when craving meat and not my usual tofu seafood veggie diet
Their menu has a nice variety of standard fare across the spectrum of Americanized aps to comfort Japanese food for non-sushi related items but I was here for the fish
1 Hornsby Cider2 FRESH Gluten Free Pizza in the deli3 Bulk Bins full of chocolate and some other stuff too4 Nummy produce5 Nice people who shop and work there6 Free samples of coffee7 Free samples of lotion8 25% off gluten free foods week9 You're on my way home from work10 Great wine selectionLoveMePS - Yes they're a touch on the expensive side
Great crowd great menu and the food is outstanding
They're known for their pizzas so we went ahead and ordered the first one on the menu - the roasted corn
In the weeks to follow I returned twice more to Beaver Choice each time ordering a new dish
I cannot wait for my next meal at Beaver Choice and I suggest anyone/everyone give it a try if you truly enjoy delicious homemade food
That should definitely become a permanent selection because I am vegan and I did not see another vegan dessert option
I definitely recommend this for anyone looking for some local selections a unique mix of mostly healthier food and anyone wanting to enjoy a good meal
The portion was pretty big and between the kabab wrap and the butter chicken two people could easy have eaten and been satisfied
LOL   There are better Mexican food places in Phoenix but I would certainly not mind going back if I was in the area as it was quick and the selections were plentiful
The food menu encompasses a range of odd ingredients such as kale tempeh Anasazi beans and tofu lettuce cups
I really expected to like Cantina Laredo - upscale mexican food darkly intimate interior nice outdoor patio with a fire pit & lights interesting menu options and prices that would indicate good food
Wang's Express is more of fast food style restaurant but has a surprisingly large menu to choose from
They have lunch specials; which are like combo meals with rice and egg rolls and such or dinner plates in different sizes
Whether you are looking for breakfast or lunch they have a huge variety of both Mexican or American and southwestern inspired food to satisfy your hunger
All these foods are quality made and each meal on the menu has a southwestern or mexican inspired name
Also I wish they offered different sized burgers cuz I could definitely do with about half of the meat I had
the meats olives and chick peas were a nice touch but the lettuce was kinda meh looking and they don't offer much in the way of choices for salad dressings
It wasnt a cheap lunch that is for sure but the food is super good and the portions were  a decent size
Also some of the dishes on the new breakfast menu just sound straight up disgusting
I sat down and took a look at the menu and was happy to see the variety of not only pizzas but sandwiches and pasta as well
The thing that I liked about their menu is the variety of pizzas that they have
The menu is kind of small and there is really only sushi which is fine but if you have a non-sushi eating person in the group this place would not work
We have been here four times pervious and it was great the food and serving portions were wonderful
They are proud to boast they sell only 100% Choice USDA Beef but it is some of the worst meat I have ever tasted
The offerings on the menu was different from any mexican food place I have been to
We were seated given several minutes to look over the menu placed our order and once the food arrived we were given a decent amount of time to eat before being checked on
A greater portion of the food is prepared to order and is thus fresher
There is an expanded menu including not only teriyaki rice bowls but also tempura popular sushi rolls etc
it seems what is available on the menu might vary depending on what is fresh LOVE food made to order that's FRESH
My husband asked for mayo for his burger which he still had half left she brought the mayo along with our dessert there was not a choice of desserts with the living social deal
The menu and food is incredible and has a twist to it
Friday nights in fish fry and Saturdays they are featuring a New Orleans-themed menu including catfish and shrimp poboys - which I unfortunately haven't had a chance to try yet since they sell out rather quickly
I have tried a few more things on the menu and I highly recommend the crispy chicken wrap
Pho #1 on the menuSeafood Fat Noodle #29BBQ Pork Short Ribs Served with RiceSpring RollsSeafood Hot Pot
Unfortuanately I noticed Szechuan Cuisine does not offer a lunch sized portion of my dish so I might have to keep going to Szechuan Garden for lunch but they just opening perhaps they will come around
All in all I really dug the atmosphere pizza and beer selection
The menu contains an assortment of comfort food as well as some pretty creative sounding cocktails
The chicken portion was pretty small but I did enjoy the overall flavor of the crisp apples and crunchy pistachios and cheese
The salmon dish I selected was a good portion and was cooked to perfection - moist and flavorful
If you have one choice for pizza try this coal fired creation
My buddy had a tofu/vegie dish - I wish I knew what it was exactly - but on the menu it had a single pepper on it
Had lots of chicken and came in a pretty good size
I do wish the dish had come on a bigger plate since the duck slices weren't bite-sized unless you're really ambitious and I had to maneuver some food to make a slicing area
* The brick toasts are wonderful and the other food usually comes in small portions so they're good for a snack
Based on the big portion of the salad we should have split one pizza because we both ended up taking half of our 12-inch pies home
We both wished there would have been sauce on the pizza but his also tasted great with the variety of cheeses
I also loved their pre-made salads such as the tarragon tuna and the wonton chicken salad and now they are gone from the menu
Now I have to admit since changing over to an a la carte menu the food has improved in taste although the prices are a bit high for some items
The salad portion was fairly big since it was a wedge of iceberg lettuce but the 2 skewers of beef were small and already precooked so they tasted like they had been sitting out for some time
The pizzas are the same the margherita is a safe but solid choice
My BF and I just happened to come here for dinner during restaurant week so I was happy to see the $30 prix fix menu for appetizer main meal dessert and sangria or soft drink
With full size appetizers we only ate half of our full sized main dishes
We ordered a variety of pasties the Royale w/ cheese Shepherd's Pie Chicken Alfredo and the Reuben
I don't eat red meat so my choices are somewhat limited
Everything was excellent from the menu to the food quality and presentation to the service
We ordered off the happy hour menu and split the fish tacos and the chicken pesto pizza on a crispy tortilla
I can only echo what others have said - cozy and trendy space unexpectedly diverse and reasonably priced menu good happy hour down to earth and friendly waitstaff good food
I usually can't pack in dessert after polishing by heart portion of curry but if you are feeling indulgent while you're there try the F
I also thought the prices were fair and they surprisingly have a good selection of pastries desserts and even in-house sandwiches
So on the menu the sandwich sounds pretty tasty roast beef bacon arugula and even a fried egg
Mix that with a curry of your choice the goat and chicken tikka are particularly good and you're in as authentic a Pakistani restaurant as you're going to find in the Valley
So I had their 8 Meat Ball sandwich this was my second choice
I may put this on my short list for foods to be brought to me in my padded cell on 'you can have WHATEVER you want' day at the sanitarium
but after seeing the extensive menu and tasting the yummy cold soba with its slippery goodness and surprisingly fresh for the desert sushi I was hooked
The menu seemed well balanced with some classics and some that were a bit too new age for me I just moved back from Italy a few years back and have seen everything served on a pizza but some things are a bit much for me
Although not on the online menu I would highly recommend the Swordfish served with diced tomatoes onions and avacado in a vinegar sauce
The tequila options were just as gratifying as the dishes themselves and the dessert menu descriptors would make even a full person's mouth water
He new them by name and was servicing them some interesting rolls that were obviously not on the menu
The Shimogamo roll that is on the menu was amazing
It's got a small variety of dishes mostly some variation of chicken
Have fun mixing beef chicken or shrimp with your choice of vegetables noodles and sauces
Tons of choices from salads and veggie trays to mouthwatering burgers chicken strips and  Pizza
Definitely a shocker coming to a noodle place but a pleasant surprise The menu is broad and eclectic ranging from Italian linguine to curry noodles from ramen to sushi and an impressive and surprising selection of rice dishes
While creating my pizza list I was actually surprise I had not written a review for Oreganos
There are pizzas and many variations of it wings salads sandwiches and pastas on the menu
The food came out within minutes and was hot tasty and in large proportions
They have a great selection of meats that include chicken sausages chopped brisket turkey ribs ham and the highlight of the menu being the pulled pork
The menu isn't so extensive that you lose quality in food
However when I said I had never been to a Carrabbas before the server proceeded to explain nearly every dish on the menu
The food is quality the location has been around forever but keeps fresh with awesome and unique decor like a life size tractor and lots of space outside for families with kids to go crazy
The happy hour prices are very good though the rolls on the happy hour menu are pretty basic
When it comes to higher end quality pizza and pasta in town this is up there on my list
After looking at the menu for a good while I decided to build my own pizza choosing the wild mushrooms locally made sausage garlic and spinach
The store has a great selection of fresh products gourmet food and good quality staple items for cooking
There is a great Veggie selection spring rolls noodle dishes even a pho like soup
Open airy brightly lit and with minimalist modern decor this place was a far cry from the pizza parlors of my youth-- which isn't a bad thing at all
3 Hmmm price has gone up like everything else and the meat still seemed like quality beef but did ya have to shrink the size of the burgers
You probably get excited when you read the menu and think how wonderful the food is but I just didn't think it was all that great
Their homemade french fries are very good and the catfish they just added to the menu is the best I've ever had
Okay back to the food; you gotta order from the Chinese menu; not to say the Gwy-lo menu is not good
The Famous Spaghetti and  Meatballs were recommended to me and so I had to partake mostly because there were a lot of really tasty looking items on the menu and the fact that the meatballs were top recommendation made me raise and eye brow
I ate one of the two fist size meatballs and took the other one home to my wife
The GoodInteresting menuPretty good foodNice decorThe BadSlow service if it's even slightly busyCoffee is not good at allInconsistency
We were actually going to Turf next door but aware that Turf's late night food selection consisted of stale potato chips we decided to check out Sens' offerings
A full menu selection of delicious food available late at night
The beef was fantastic quality and the patty was a good size but not one of those we'll-give-you-a-huge-burger-so-your-gut-hurts-afterward burgers
In addition to a large Japanese menu they have several Chinese dishes
The happy hour menu includes Greek sliders and mini pizzas which I don't think are on the regular menu
I order off the seniors/light eaters menu and still find myself with half a plate of food at the end of my meal
Alessia's menu offers all the pasta types you would expect but what I liked is that you can also get just about any type of sauce on those pasta dishes
My boyfriend is a bit of a food snob so the minute I saw the Chef's tasting menu I knew he would be all over it and he was
they consistently have a wonderful choice of prepared food to choose from
The menu was fresh and interesting offering a lot of items I had never considered food i
For a second choice True Food was pretty good
- Beaver Choice makes me want to talk about the love put into the food and I'm not that type of person
When the pink menus were dropped on me I wondered where the chicken chow fun had disappeared to - oh
Most of the food was just ok but certain portions were some of the worst things I've had
First of all the selection was quaint but a little bit meager - except the dessert
He was not satisfied with the size or taste of the meat which would  upset his stomach later on
I like the beer list but the wine list and food menu leave a little to be desired
along with the stellar beer list just the food menu makes me scratch my head
It was a tad on the pricey side probably because it's in a hotel but the food and coffee were delicious with generous portions
I can't believe I've waited so long to review the Roosevelt as it is everything I look for in a bar amazing beers and a significant wine list  great food  friendly staff and a crowded yet comfortable vibe
The reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 4 is that there is no orange chicken on the lunch menu and the sweet and sour pork I got had some nasty fat chunks in half of the pieces I got
I hope the portions will not decrease as business increase like some of the soul food posers that came and went in the valley
The menu consisted of stuffed artichokes gnudi swordfish roulade mixed grill and Cassatelle con Ricotta as dessert
Those who are Cuban and/or create Cuban food were busy cooking yet those serving the customer knew the menu well inquired to any likes/dislikes and made good suggestions
I believe the food on the lunch buffet is not spicy on purpose to appeal to the masses which would make since I personally prefer my Indian food spicy with some burn and I'm sure if you order something off the regular menu they will kick it up a notch for you
No gem to find her just pricey breakfast food and there are other choices that you can do better with
The owners' son came up with a pizza that is unique to Arizona but with the name of the establishment I was quite surprised that not all of the franchises have it on their menus - the Fun Guy Pizza
Neither my guest or I were blown away by the favors of the food but the drink menu and atmosphere were wonderful
Although I only visited the Vig for brunch I was pretty happy with their overall menu food quality and service
I ordered garlic chicken and vegetables - very flavorful and a good size for the price actually it was too much for just me to finish so I had to take it home - I'm a 5'4 petite female
There isn't a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich on the menu
You can find the typical chinese selections some sushi and dessert
Cookiez has a wide variety of desserts including Italian ice milk shakes ice cream fresh lemonade and fruit smoothies
Over half our table got something of the fried variety I really hate bar food
After I sent the pizza back and waived off the offer for a new one or another meal selection I accepted a chicken strip from a table mate
Yellowtail sushi just a bit dry but a nice size serving of fish
Came here for dessert recently and was a little disappointed with the selection
Sarah G and I shared the variety pack consisting of five mini-desserts which we cut in half and amounted to 1-2 bites each
The best thing and best deal on the menu would be the sampler plate with ribs fish shrimp and nachos
We ordered a bunch of rolls they have a fairly small selection of rolls which is fine with me and some nigiri
Portion size is fantastic and food served hot and fresh
Overall the food is good great kids menu and great happy hour
The food quality is always top notch and the selection is usually quite good
So I asked the waiter if I could please have a chile relleno which is my favorite food and I love all chile rellenos and thought to myself I couldn't go wrong with my second choice
While I haven't had a chance to try the food I saw some plates come out and I am counting the minutes before I can go back and taste every option on the menu
The portions of the food was huge and cheap and oOoh the wings are a bomb and what was even better was for Tuesdays it's only $6
We started off with the AZ spring rolls they were perfectly crunchy on the outside and served with yummy side sauce choices  I told the waiter I could of ate 20 more
The sashimi and sushi rolls were a good portion size- this rating may change as I go back to try other things
Sushi Rolls - we had several and they were all very tasty and decent size
Taco del Mar is a block from my office--one starThey're always friendly and get my order right--two starsToday the person behind the counter recommended a great burrito--three starsThey offer a wide variety of average Mexican faire at reasonable prices--four starsSome people may not agree with me but Taco del Mar is what it is fast food
And I don't eat meat so clearly there is a certain scope to my review that will not cover a wide array of their menu
They get major points for delicious food with limited kitchen capabilities for a really cool vibe and for the best beer and drink list that I know of in all of Phoenix
Listening to myself next time on both desserts and drinks
I really dig the flower selection as well as all the healthy food choices
My sandwich was great but the picture on the website and menu made it look like it my sub would be FULL of meat cheese lettuce tomato
If you are feeling a pizza but can't make up your mind the pinwheel pizza mixes up 4 choices so that is always good
We sat down and took a look at the menu everyone in my group kept telling me how great their Chicken & Dumplings were but I figured everyone was gonna order it so I could always try it from their plates
However the biscuits were super delicious really fresh and puffy on the inside with a slight hardened outside dunked with the white sausage gravy and life was good  I also had a bite of my buddies Chicken & Dumplings which honestly tasted really close to a home made casserole and the chicken was a bit dry guess I'm glad I didn't order it  I guess I missed out on their breakfast menu so I'm definitely going to have to try out their breakfast next time I'm in town
Menu is very fairly priced and make sure to get the Vienna beef Chicago dogs
Didnt try the food but the tap selection was pretty decent with some local brews on tap west coast stuff from California nothing special for me but great for the locals I was most interested in the Left Hand offerings as they don't distribute to Cali
We both decided the chicken was on our list for being among the best we've had
I wish they had more salad options on the menu only 3 but all of the other dishes I have tried have been very good
The food was a little better than what I'd have expected from a sports bar; the variety was a tad on the expansive side but I'm glad that my BBQ plate didn't have anything that was butchered and horrible
The bruschetta and bottle is usually enough for two but we like to add in the Butcher's Block which is a selection of meats cheeses olives and asparagus
Ordered up a regular size chicken bowl only to find the chicken was extremely dry and nearly burnt
But we have concluded 1 Rokerij does offer good food - but they are slightly over priced for the quality 2 the professionalism was seriously lacking in service presentation of the wine list focused on the price and not the taste pallets and 3 they should get their ego in check - I get that you have a long list of people waiting for tables at your restaurant - but the next time I have a special event I will be going to one of the dozens of restaurants in the valley and receive the level of service that should come with the ambiance and food
If dining in I recommend going with the Tea Lite Special which allows you to sample one spring roll two egg rolls and your choice of chicken or beef pho soup for just $8
extra spicy with chicken usually a large portion for a very good price and a Singha
The Pad Thai arrived quickly enough and I was thrilled to see loads of chicken and tofu amongst a decent sized portion of glass noddles all gleeming with red sauce and chilis all over them with a bright toss of cilantro on top
I think they have a pretty good selection of meats and veggies and  yes sometimes it's a little messy but I would say they are usually on top of making sure the counters are clean
I love yardhouse and their happy hour makes it easy to try a variety of food
A few months ago I had a great experience learning about authentic Sichuan from Helen Y when she invited me to join her at Szechwan Palace in the Chinese Cultural Center and this past weekend she invited my husband and me along with some other very fortunate Yelpers including David S B Jason W and Alexander C to eat some more amazing and authentic Chinese at Lao Ching Hing according to her review their Chinese menu features mostly Shanghainese food with some Sichuan dishes and a few Cantonese dishes
So that you are able to order some more authentic items I'll give you a breakdown of what Helen ordered for us off the Chinese menu which she has so generously translated and posted to the business info section of this review *Cold jellyfish in scallion oil - This had a nice semi-chewy texture reminded me of octupus and a vinegary sauce
*Fish pieces w/ sauce - I could be wrong but I think these were  the spicy soybean paste with sliced fish from the menu
I've only had sushi here so I don't know what the other food is like but the other tables had non-sushi meals and they looked good big portions
They have a fairly big menu with what seemed like many original dishes
Four Peaks is an excellent establishment because they have wonderful food a very robust beer selection brewed on site and incredible atmosphere
Given the extensive menu with a long list of homestyle dishes pho doesn't take a backseat but it's certainly not the star of the show
I noted too based on the menu that they have on their website they have dropped their prices and have added some cheaper items to the menu pulled pork sandwich fish and chips
While it didn't say it on the menu every meat item was breaded
On walking in I noticed that the choice of sanwiches was compact which was good I had only a few things to choose from beef sausage or egg and some combination of these
This place is the full package the location decor and menu are perfect for an evening of relaxation good drinks and great food
Two things really struck me about this place  the tasting menu portions are HUGE and the restaurant has an extraordinarily convivial let's-mingle-amongst-foodie-friends atmosphere
I knew ahead of time that NOCA doesn't normally offer a tasting menu which is how I like to roll when I am trying out a new place but on the day we were visiting there was a special Four Peaks Brewery beer pairing tasting menu
Per our waiter the portions weren't much smaller than the regular non-tasting-menu sizes even though we were eating five meat-heavy courses plus dessert
I know the Asian in me should have relished the bang-for-the-buck but I really wish the portions were smaller so I could have savored it more my genetic make-up renders me unable to leave food on the plate without major guilt
I get very annoyed when a menu does not disclose the ingredients in a dish and there were onions all over these tacos
We had a huge portion of the chicken parmasian took home leftovers
Great selection of everything you need from produce meats dried and frozen products
We didn't realize that their personal size pizza was 12
That's double the size of a Pizza Hut personal pan pizza
I didn't want to piss the guy off any further never piss off the people who make your food so I just picked the burger that I happened to be looking at on the menu
Not only is the food very good the portions are larger than the average serving
I found that the selection of restaurants is depressing as a whole and the food court is although very spacious is exponentially loud and messy
I'll agree that the fairly unique menu at True Food is what will draw folks in and the decor is beautiful but the sales nature of the service and the talk up of menu items is enough to make me pause before I think about heading back
As we sat and enjoyed our early desserts I noticed that Cold Stone has really expanded their menu
I have enjoyed all the food I have tried like 80% of the menu
If you've never done conveyor belt sushi you just grab things off the conveyor belt as they roll past you and you are charged according to the color/size/shape of the plate depending on where you go
Best part of the menu Do not leave without having the Pizookie for dessert
The food was great the portions were good and the price was fabulous
The food looks a lot better on the menu than it is in real life unfortunately
The deli selection is top quality and you will find meats from around the world here; cheeses too
I had to go to Whole Foods to complement Total Wine's selection
Protip Add the sake bomb option to your menu rather than ordering beer and sake separately like every other sushi bar in your price range
Their ambiance and menu wowed me by encompassing all of my seafood eating requirements FRESH sea creatures delicious sides impeccable service and a fancy but not stuffy atmosphere
With a fresh seafood section two or three times the size you'd find anywhere else in Phoenix and with parts of animals you've probably never prepared at home it's fun to just look but even more fun to buy
The items on the menu were pretty much just salads and pizzas
I think all the brunch dishes were $9-$14 but with the huge portions and cheap drinks it was a steal
The menu has a nice variety of dishes and desserts Chocolate cake is fantastic
And the primary dishes off the menu do not disappoint
They have a variety of pre-made pizzas to choose from and the slices are generous
My husband even signed up for an email sign-up list or something and with his birthday this location sent him a free large 1-topping birthday pizza
We went to the Renaissance Festival and didn't want to stop and get fast food so we googled local restaurants and there weren't many choices
The food has definitely been ramped up now they have chicken n waffles the incredible Yucca Burger and wings with a wide selection of flavors
The wine list is always interesting giving you choices that surprise and please the food is well priced and the brew-shetta Geordie accent please is ridiculously good
I will not critique the menu or food but will say that it is slightly expensive and nothing spectacular
I was surprised to see some options on a menu in a sports bar with more then chicken wings and pizza
I also ordered some fish and chips I know odd choice but hey that's the kinda girl I am
Food is good portions are large and the variety is awesome
Depending on your group size 5 could fit comfortably in the smaller room whereas 8 is pushing the limits imagine spilled drinks and dropped sushi
For Sharing I've never had Chicken and Waffles before and when I saw it on the menu I knew that's what I needed to order
They have an eclectic food menu consisting of Pub style choices and snacks that compliment the beers they serve
The NY strip portion of the meat was tasty however the filet side was tough and overcooked - certainly not medium as ordered
They do have a great $5 weekday lunch menu with cold or hot sandwiches and pizza
But if you're looking for a relatively low priced place where you can find a few dishes that rival San Francisco China Town's holes in the wall turn a blind eye on the imported service and take your chopsticks and randomly choose something on the menu
The food has been consistently great i'm not going to complain anything about the portion cuz they are just good for me p I love how they pair sweet potatoes and kale salad for most of sandwiches they are not only tasty but also so good for you
This is definately a gourmet burger place and you pay extra than the norm for the options of higher quality meat and a variety of toppings
The pasta dish was a bit stingy in portion eat lots of bread if that's the only thing you're ordering
The menu has everything you'd expect in a ramen shop regular ramen spicy ramen seafood and vegetarian
The menu is interesting but it is not true Cuban food but a their version of Cuban recipes
The menu showcases local ingredients and the waiter told us that the chef tries to incorporate the history of the local tribes into the food
I was pretty impressed by the concessions selection but keep in mind that's as compared to the veritable desert pun intended of food options at Turner Field
It has a decent selection of fresh and canned foods
The variety and portions of food will fit most pallets and budgets
So here's the deal If you are a hipster foodie who likes the idea of eating overpriced Jamaican food-- even though you and your knit cap has never even been to Jamaica-- with stingy portions and poor service
The service - Our waitress was pleasant took our drink and food order and all-in-all the service was relatively quick considering the decent size of our party of 8
On to the food - The salad was fairly good and was a good portion
Note that I didn NOT complain or send it back because even for a half portion it still came out on a pizza tray full of chips and I pretty much felt like if I complained all they were gonna do was just add the cheese and heat up the platter of chips again which would've made them stale
they seem to have the right formula going and their food is unique enough; good enough taste-wise and large enough portion-wise yet in my humble opinion they need to step it up to make that difference between the thought of food just being thrown together vs
Lim's offers the unlimited buffet all day long or you can dine right off their menu for food made-to-order

They did a great job building a custom menu for us and the food was great
The items on the menu looked decent enough and I settled on the shredded beef taco platter and ordered it to go
However the spring rolls were literally the size of my thumb
The selection is limited - so I would not recommend going for a meal of Sushi alone
Such a good selection of all healthy foods
Upon looking at the menu I realized this place mostly had girl food sandwiches soups salads and some breakfast  stuff
If you are in the area and want more than just a Starbucks selection of girl food you may want to stop in
The food is great with daily specials for entrees and soups their menu is constantly pleasing and full
It is big and spacious and the quality and variety of the food is very good
My husband located this place and wanted to try it because they had gnocchi on the menu and that's the only thing he likes in the world of Italian food

I'm usually all over some Chinese food but after looking over the selection I passed it over

Although I''m reluctant to go to a theme restaurant inspired by an SNL sketch I found cheeburger cheeburger to be better than a theme restaurant with mediocre food I was here once before when Tempe marketplace first opened and was overwhelmed by the topping choices Think last time I had a burger with feta mushrooms and olives trying to imagine a Mediterranean    burger really what ended up happening was flavor overload that I couldn't really taste the burger so I decided to give them another try this time around I got 1/2 lbs burger sorry a pound is just too much food with cheddar jack bacon and sauteed mushrooms we ordered a half order of the best of both worlds which is a basket of fries and onion rings with a side of cheese  the fries are good very crispy well seasoned and appear to be fresh cut  or at least a very convincing fake the onions rings are very crispy with a light batter that almost takes on a yellow tone my burger was well prepared they use sliced whole mushrooms instead of pre sliced the bacon was crispy and the cheese was nice and gooey so all in all it was a pretty decent burger I must say my burger was a bit greasy I cut my burger in half to eat it and by the time I moved on to the second half  my lower bun had become one and fused with my burger pattyOverall my experience was good and I would go back but I don't see it being a frequent choice and not just due to distance the main attraction seems to be the wide variety of burger toppings and the build-your-own inspired menu despite the food being consistent and good it's nothing I haven't tasted before though if I ever get the urge for a pepperoni peanut butter coleslaw Sri racha burger I can sleep easier at night knowing I've now got that issue handled
Other items on the menu are great too like the fish and risotto
There are large portions but quality of ingredients isn't there and food is somewhat bland requiring that you season with the salsa to get some flavor
The menu sounds lovely with the slow food descriptions and local produce connections
Generally I don't announce I'm a vegetarian  if I can find clear guidance on the menu that there are no dead animals in the food
Our waiter who had been MIA  for quite awhile reappeared and dropped dessert menus
Located in a small house close to old Scottsdale this place just has a great feel to it and a menu that would satisfy any food lover
She looked over her choices and she opted for the French Bread Pizza with pepperoni and cheese
I go here to see movies and with the assortment of clothing stores Target BN and a great variety of food choices I'm very satisfied

I went for the chicken pesto sandwich after the chef said it was his favorite and remember don't question the chef's choices and I couldn't have been more pleased
If you stick to pizza the joint is pretty affordable it's when you leave the pizza menu that things start to get expensive
It is a bar after all so I thought we would have a menu of nothing but fried goodies & finger food but to my great surprise they have a great menu
The Kattiam Pik Thai chicken is juicy and the portions are overly generous same as the soup
The food is surprisingly good yet cheap and with great variety
They should drop the Noodles part from their name as their are only about 4 noodle dishes on the menu
The rolls were good quality - we had a spicy salmon roll not on the menu but they allowed the subsitution tuna toro with jalapeno and a dynamite
The individual size servings of desserts are the main attraction for us  creme brulee cheesecake pudding tiramisu and milk chocolate cake
After we finished and I didn't possibly think I could stuff down anything else of course came the dessert menu
My food was okay but the gal I was with had to send back her order twice because the cook couldn't stick to the menu item one of the wraps
There wasn't enough ice cream vendors in my opinion but there was plenty of food vendors and the neighboring eateries were also busy and offering variety
They add a little liquid smoke to all of there sushi sauces which adds a little variety
A Carne Asada Burrito that's my delectable choice when I choose Mexican food often from a roach coach
They do have a lunch menu even though it is not posted on their website but most of he dishes are still $9
I ended up ordering the sandwich that was showcased on the TV show and next to it on the menu there's a sign showcased on the food network so hell I had to get it
In all the Frys I've been to the customer service here and food selection can't be beat
They have expanded their Organic/Natural Food selection which I think is fantastic aswell as offering more produce I wish they're organic section was a little bigger but I understand that alot of people aren't on the organic bandwagon yet
We didn't need it but it was still quite nice to be asked so politely on the contrary I didn't get my entree of choice at another Panda Express location because the tray was 1/4 full and only contained remaining vegetables and no meat from the dish
The beef noodle found a little portion of my stomach that had not been satisfied in the 7 months since I left Taiwan
Speaking as a person who has been craving this type of food for a very very long time I find it very easy to brush aside my perceived inadequacies in favor of their spectacular food; it is ultimately your choice to do the same or not
What I want to talk about is the actual experience of PB - because if you are going to PB for the best pizza in the world then your expectations will fall far short of that goal - In summation you go to Pizzeria Bianco for everything - the wait the conversation before the seating the excitement of actually getting into the place and then finishing with the bragging rights to say you've been there done that and hopefully got a copy of the menu or at least a t-shirt like I did
You will wait to get on the wait list and then the cuties who take the names will give you an estimate of the time you will wait to get a table - that wait is pretty accurate so don't think that the Pizza Gods will part the clouds and drop pies from heaven any minute sooner than your first estimate
The best thing to order for two really hungry people or for a small family is their Loosen your Belt~ 1/2 slab of their award winning ribs smoked chicken thigh/leg large portion of their award winning pulled pork and brisket

While the foods at Asi are pleasant the prices are a little steep for the size or quantity received
Back to the food I ordered the leg of lamb but my lamb was cubed and buried under a thickened tomato based sauce not explained on the menu
But the menus were pretty cute -- actually had chicken wire in the menus
I will not likely shop at any other place for groceries -- as the produce is gorgeous their meat is proportioned into perfect dinner servings their selection of national name-brand products are concise but available and their wine is CHEAP
Good selection of seafood and other meats
The food choices and tastes were literally the exact same
but seriously the sushi roll we ordered was the size of a chipotle burrito and tasted like an old obese man farted threw an onion in to a tuna fish can
Healthy organic simple dishes that are portioned well
CPK is a typical chain where you know what is on the menu and the quality and price of the food you are going to get

I haven't had a majority of the menu but for basics like the bean and cheese chips with cheese and guac rolled tacos with cheese and guac are delicious when you're craving such things
It turned out to be nothing more than mediocre mixed Asian dishes in tiny portions
Whether it be sticky pork bbq rolls Very good or some sort of beef rice noodle there is about 4 portions per plate

The menu did not properly describe the item and instead of a bell pepper dish I got a port dish
They also have a hot food stations that serve rotating dishes of various pasta sweet and baked potatoes pizza multiple breads and muffins desserts drinks and a 6-7 choice soup bar that's outstanding
They also had a lot of fresh fish choices on the specials board
Of special note is the meat department which happily cuts your meat to your specification and has a wider selection than any other place in town
I've not had anything off the menu and personally prefer to pick out my own cheeses/meats
They had pretty fair happy hour prices and selection of food; we had wings and chicken fingers - both good but the string fries were the best    The bartender was very attentive and friendly chat something that never happens next door
we were all a bit surprised at the size  very small of the dishes
Pei Wei is great they have a relatively decent selection of dishes that can be made vegetarian or vegan

We love every single roll in the menu and you cannot beat their prices

Before I hit the food and drink I must say that the service was stellar extremely knowledgeable regarding the menu perfect timing in table visits beverages constantly cleared/refilled and a perfect dose of information and interaction
Indian food has to be on the top of my list for favorite cuisines and I am sad to say there aren't many or any great Indian restaurants that I have found in Phoenix
The food menu changes often so I won't comment on specific dishes but I don't really think you can go wrong here
I was tempted to give it 3 stars because I've had a lot of Thai food in the Bay Area and I've been to Thailand once and I'm honestly not sure where I should come down on that fourth star but since Phoenix doesn't really have quite the selection of Thai restaurants I'll err on the side of arroy Thai for delicious

Dessert choices were homemade pumpkin pie and apple crisp
The menu is split between creative American entrees and solidly Mexican dishes

The dinner size is sizable enough for an entree if you can sneak some bites of someone else's hot food to round it out
They offer an antipasti menu that works very similar to a sushi menu
Another member mentioned the photographs on the Wall it's great for everyone to see the food not just read it on the menu also they've added some new dishes
It was so much fun to ask him about the various dishes and listen to him describe every texture taste and ingredient in each
The menu is pretty much the same and there is a big window looking into the kitchen so you can see the staff hard at work banging out those tortilla's by the thousands along with the other awesome mexican dishes
Comes with salad and soup good portions of the main item rice four california rolls deep fried korean dumplings mandoo and tempura vegetables
five stars to the food it is exactly what is supposed to be a Korean sushi place; with variety of good cooked Korean items on the menu
The menu and cooking style truly reminds you more of a seafood+steak restaurant with a Mexican flare as opposed to genuine Mexican food
They use standard sized buns but its served open with the meat just packed into it
And the antipasto salad included with the meal had generous portions of meat cheese tomatoesonion peppers olives with house dressing was fresh and very good
Not really sure what to try I opted for the Tour of Rigatony plate which included a generous more than a sample portion of what I guess is their more popular itemsChicken Picatta stuffed shells fettucinni alfredo and a huge italian sausage  kind of spicy to my delight
The menu looked incredible and as I watched the servers take food to the tables I could see that the amounts of food give were enormous

Now for the food great selection of drinks very nice lend of both chinese and thai menu Love the taste of their crispy fried rice soup-sizzling sound too
After 11pm there is only a late night menu which consists of most appetizers and a few simple pizzas kitchen closes at 1am

I feed rawmeatybones so i didn't shop the food selection much but the premium brands offered are expectedly pricey
Food is not that great really over priced and the portions are not even that big
We got it going on from the west to the eastOur team is now complete and so uniqueWe yelp with passion like we are possessedReading the menu sushi's good but not the bestOne of these yes oh please
or maybe I just think the portions are undersized because I could eat their food all day long
Tried a couple of rolls but I can't recall much to write about except that I would probably come back to try other apps and entrees not on the HH menu but I'm in no hurry to go back
I know that it is asian fusian but the menu was mostly Thai with some sushi thrown in for good measure
I ordered a chicken quesadilla off of the HH menu for $4 and a small dinner salad

They have great food a great selection of wine and a trendy atmosphere
I've never had a bad food or wine experience at Postino and I could tell that the staff is highly trained on all menu items and the wine they offer- which is a refreshing change

It's not the best mexican restaurant I have ever been to but few restaurants in the area have a variety of green chili dishes let alone good ones

The tray of meat comes with 4 nice size pieces of their amazing bread as well

The nice thing about the size is they have to keep stocking up the trays with fresh hot food

The food here reminded me of Rainforest Cafe - the smells the portions the prices

And they have a good variety of rolls and other menu options
They had a great selection of food and drinks but I wanted to keep it simple since it was my first time here
The food selection wasn't extensive but the scone was really nice - heck I'd go back for more
This place has a long laundry list of toppings this is why I think the sauce lacked flavor as most don't miss it when they add on a whole meals worth of meat and veggies to a pizza

Their menu includes both cold and hot appetizers many pasta dishes and dishes with seafood or meat

We would love to go there more to enjoy some of the food on the happy hour menu but given how it is set up we opt for other locations
The rolls contained nice large sausage but the pastry outer needed to be MUCH thicker to be in proper proportion
There were three of us and we basically all ordered different dishes except for the carne en adobo course so we got try a lot of the menu
What that means is that I got to try 10 different dishes on their menu and I only think two are worth coming back for
The spring rolls that I get have pork and shrimp in them and are a pretty good size
This place serves your usual Mexican-American style food but does not go over the top on portions like some other  restaurants of the same genre

There's a good size food court and an aquarium too
The food is honest and simple yet amazingly delicious we ordered just about everything on the menu between the two nights and were satisfied with all of the dishes

Oh wait it must be referring to the fish taco on the menu
The roast beef listed the raw or undercooked disclaimer; but in fact the beef was well done
The food was excellent and the portions sizes also very good sized
The wait for the food wasn't bad either but I hate when you as the customer have to ask for a wine list because your wine was empty for 10 minutes but the waiter didn't ask if you wanted anything else because he was focused on the table of 5 women next to us sharing an appetizer
If you were not reared on fresh seafood and the thought of sashimi makes you queasy then I suggest you not jump in with both feet maybe work your way up with small portions of ceviche
Just last night I picked up a whole chicken prepared Asado think grilled/brick chicken for $5 which included fresh corn tortillas and a generous portion of their Salsa Molcajete my favorite here
All they offer are beef and chicken items so that kind of limits the selections
There weren't a lot of food choices - I had a cheese enchilada that was pretty good a chile relleno that was just okay some beef fajita meat that was fatty and tough average rice and beans
I had my heart set on having the tasting menu to sample more dishes but the tasting menu was for a minimum of 2 people
I am sure that they served me the equivalent amount of food for 2 people with double portions of everything
It was the most fabulous looking and enormous dessert selection served on a block of ice
You have a more spacious restaurant more friendly staff amazing flexibility in customer service and more generosity with the dishes London's 'premium' menu sushi selection only included salmon tuna and yellowtail - no sign of any toro And to achieve this in the middle of the desert

They have this 'sushi-like' menu that has cheese and meats you can order that comes with bread and a garnish
Their beer list is pretty descent by my standards and the food seems to get better with each visit

Very big portion and the fish was very good
The menu a mix of locally sourced rustic dishes with upscale flair went very well with the decor
There is a decent amount of variety between the types of burgers or chicken sandwiches that can be ordered
The chicken appeared smaller in size to me but surprisingly moist and juicy once you started pull away at it
We also shared seafood rice soup which was served in a large portion
The radishes may vary in size but tend to be large and are always tasty
The pizza was good but I can't imagine ordering anything other than that off the menu
We were showed to our table our waitress was Jennifer very nice and very sweet she explained the menu to us since it was both our 1st time there we ordered the Cowboy Stuff which was bbq ribs & chicken crispy shrimp steak & seafood kabobs beans veggies potatoes wedges and some other stuff I have to say the one thing that stood out was the ribs omg they are fall off the bone melt in your mouth good

Friday's menu listed a dish that wasn't offered bec
Gingerroot's ambience definitely places it at the top of the list of all the other Filipino venues in Chandler if you're on a date but I'd very much dislike the experience if I'm forced to listen and watch TFC and have buffet food at those prices
They have a stellar selection of wines and cheeses and I like both so well Whole Foods you had me at cheddar
The product selection is less than most Whole Foods but I suspect that has more to do with the reduced square footage of the Tempe location
Overall Rosati's is still my choice for pizza in the valley
And chicken strips are ALL they had on the menu with the sides as mentioned above
The continental breakfast had a below average selection of food and no peanut butter which I wasn't happy about but maybe they were taking precautions because of the peanut butter scare

They have a very limited menu rice white and brown veggies beef and chicken
I ordered a chicken gyro which was $8 on the menu overpriced to begin with
I would like to see this place turn up the notch on the food keep the same menu but make it taste as great as the menu tells me it will

The location is the classic strip-mall something that Arizona has perfected  and the menu contains the standard Italian dishes from up and down the peninsula
What I got was dark meat chicken in catfood-sized bits smothered in lazy overly sweet goop on top of a gelatinous heap of rice
and you can get your choice of 1 or 2 or 3 meats with it for quite a decent price
I'm so tired of sushi places not noting on their menu that they use KRAB aka imitation and not crab
There are so many choices on the menu and not just chicken so even if you are a vegetarian you can still find something like beans and rice on the menu or on their list of sides which is enormous
Crab enchiladas full of white crab meat and smothered in your choice of red or green sauce
The highlights of the food menu are Galettes which is crispy flat bread topped with cheese bacon olives and onions

i ordered the chicken and vegetables and it came out hotfreshand big in portion size
After waiting over an hour and listening to all the people raving about how good the food was outside I had high hopes

I went in there to get some really basic stuff for my fish tank and the people there didn't really have anyone that knew anything about fish and they didn't have a good selection at all
I did like the selection of different kids of dog foods that this store had and they seemed to have a lot of different more healthy options for your dog they even have a pretty impressive selection of refrigerated dog food and some stuff that looked like you would have to cook it for your dog
I tried a selection of the tacos; beef fish and shrimp
The restaurant is a small little shop that only sells chicken fingers but what they lack in variety is aggrandized in taste
The chicken fingers were perfect not too much breading not too much salt very juicy and a large size for each chicken piece
They serve a great portion of fish with the perfect amount rice to go with it
The rolls are also a decent size for what you pay for
The menu offers a large selection of breakfast burger steak and BBQ dishes

With pancakes the size of your head and the BEST corned beef hash I've ever tasted why would ever go anywhere else
the pizza selections are great and you can choose from various crusts and they also have salads for those wanting a lighter meal
The prices are right the food is piping hot and the menu is extensive
The food looks really good a very extensive menu and full bar
Delivery was fast and efficient but with my quibbles about the price and quality of the food well I might go back for one last-ditch try but with all the bad reviews here on Yelp already I am extremely reluctant to try anything else and I will likely skip this in favor of more tasty delivery menus in my area
They had a large selection of cheeses and meats which was rather impressive though I was at work so didn't get the opportunity to purchase or try them
Food was average bar food though they do that portion the ketchup thing rather than have bottles at the table or brought to the table they bring out portions in little cups which I think is silly
The menu was pretty interesting and I got the southwest chicken which is basically chicken on toasted chiabatta
The menu is typical of Arizona mexican fast food places but Rivas is unique in that their rolled tacos are delicious and the accompanying guacamole is tasty as well
I recommend the Hawaiian ham pepperoni and pineapple  the Flaumbay pepperoni green bell peppers garlic and pineapple or the RASPOTLE chicken roasted red bell peppers raspberry chipotle sauce and a choice of feta or goat cheese/no mozzarella cheese

75 and was given the choice of white or dark meat
I have been there a few times now and unfortunately the menu changed in the week between my visits but both the chicken tacos and the veggie tacos are both good
I'm not gonna say Yelp has let me down as most of the reviews here are for other items on the menu but we will seriously reconsider this destination the next time we are in the mood for some Asian food and if we do go here it won't be for Chinese
Instead you check off items on a printed menu much like those in many sushi places with an accompanying page of photos of the various dishes
I don't recall how much this cost but the dishes from the menu are remarkably low priced
Both menus contained dishes you don't often find and there were lots of Asian diners so China Chans felt like the real deal
I'd love to give this place more stars just based on the local beer selection and decent beer prices however the food leaves much to be desired and is way overpriced
Hope they improve the menu and food pricing
The pancit is probably the lightest item on the menu and had plenty of chicken breast and vegetables for those who are watching their figures
Dessert I confess that I read the dessert menu first before making dinner decisions and while other reviews loved the selections
I feel their dessert menu needs to be expanded in a way that compliments their cuisine
The menu is quite disturbing - a lot of sea food and no game isn't this a high end restaurant
Granted the restaurant set up a table with rose petals and gave us menus with the words happy anniversary printed on them but I would trade all that for decent food and a nicer crowd
If I had a bucket list then Chicken & Waffles would definitely have been on it
The menu stated that the sandwich had chorizo eggs ham sausage and chicken on it
The food doesn't blow you away but you can find some servicable choices that you will be satisfied with
Probably not my favorite pizza joint but a good variety of pizza and great location for sure
haven't tried the chinese food but since the owners are korean i'd stick with that menu
The menu has surplus of good dishes including nice salads
They also have a separate laminated sushi menu that was given to us to share among eight people
I was very confused when I was also given another different sushi order menu that lists additional nigiri and maki rolls in their own acronyms
I lopped one star due to the usually wonderful service being off last night but the seafood tower with iced crab oysters on the half shell and pink chubby shrimp the size of a child's fist can go far to assuage lax service
We ordered a basket of string fries as an appetizer and our waitress suddenly had bigger fish to fry since we didn't order the tower or another ginormous spendy menu item like we usually do
For those who don't eat beef like me there's a good selection of chicken and even a vegetarian option
But at the time I was a vegetarian and not astounded by the menu embalming and meat eating just don't mix in my eyes
Hubs chose #7 turkey & provolone giant size & I chose #6 roast beef & provolone mini size
The menu changes often so I can't really recommend any particular dishes other than the amazing Thai shrimp and coconut soup the one dish that's always on the menu
And really the salad came in a pre portioned bowl like fast food
According to the Waitress the Chef had made the dish for himself one night but the employees tried and liked so now it's on the menu
I had to labor to pick each rubbery arm out before I ate a slice of thepizza-size pancake
A decent pizza selection an eclectic menu including greek american bbq asian italian
Their appetizer choices were mostly seafood which doesn't help me out
The meat portions are on the chintzy side and the spring rolls are a pass
I've also had their pasta tortellini it was amazing but I didn't see it on the menu that last time I was in; I think they have some seasonal dishes they switch up
You need to reduce your portions- My husband and I can share a pizza here and be full
I orderedSalmon sashimi the portion size was larger than expectedMasagoTobiko they only have wasabi tobikoSalmon nigiriHamachi Toro UniSpider RollSpicy Tuna it was happy hour and ended up taking it back to the hotel for breakfast the next day - yum
The menu available on website is comprised of panini antipasti calamari pizzas and salads
About a week ago I was flying out of Buffalo NY airport and faced with a rather dismal choice of fast food places to eat lunch choose something called Which Wich a place I assumed was a local chain
My fiancee is a definite lover of the meat and he was stoked with the selection too
I love that's it served by the slice ~ the size of ONE slice of Sal's Pizza is the size of TWO regular  pizza slices
The food was delicious fresh flavorful and filling and the variety was incredible
We have tried just about every item on the menu however my favorites are the Shrimp Dumplings orange chicken Mongolian beef double pan fried noodles and for dessert the banana spring rolls
From the wonderful happy hourhalf off all appetizers and most alcohol to the large beer selection with a bunch of local brews and the delicious pizza we are pleased to have this new pizza joint in the neighborhood
I know there are tons of other great pizza joints in town but the Z is ranks very high on my list
When I saw menudo -- beef tripe stew -- listed on the menu I decided I should definitely give it a try having never eaten tripe before
A friend and I decided to split the KK thinking the chicken was the same size but we were wrong
we tried about 5-6 different menu items all at least 50% off $20 roll for $10
Their menu is quite extensive when it comes to pizzas - different toppings crust styles and sizes
It was like eggs some veggies and a little meat in a bagel of our choice
They have an eclectic menu with a variety of standard Mexican dishes with slightly different ingredients in some to give them a different taste
The menu is pretty extensive and includes all the Thai favorites like curries spring rolls and Pad Thai
Good sounding food selection on hh - notice I say it sounds good but it was not good not at all
The prices are good the selection is better and the food is great
Good cocktail and beer selection surprisingly good food for a bar and a great staff
On to the food-We didn't try any appetizers because we were determined to make it to the dessert round based upon the delicious sounding desserts on the menu
Gourmet bakery cases and cases of handmade pastries local gelato yum espresso bar sushi bar fine alcohols outdoor seating next to the BBQ lunch bar nice produce lots of meat choices sadly no buffalo though nice people
It's not secret In-N-Out has the damn thing posted on its website and it's not much of a menu as it is just more combinations of food and condiments except maybe the Grilled Cheese
*Pho portion = pretty good and there was a lot of meat in it *Rice dish = honestly the beef tasted more like Teriyaki than Vietnamese bbq
If you're in the mood for some good Italian food with good portions and friendly attentive service Macaroni Grill can't be beat in my book
We were mildly impressed with the selection of meats & cheeses
The thing I love about Trader Joe's is the great selection and quality of the food
I'm a huge fan of the Indian buffets because I don't know very many of the dishes and like variety
You won't find socks or frozen foods but you will find a selection of astro-turf/fake grass options
Where else can you get a regular sized roll for only $5
I don't know why you are still calling your sandwiches Cambodian sandwiches It may be called differently since it was sold at a Cambodian Restaurant but it's the exact same thing as a Banh Mi sold at a Vietnamese restaurant my bad because I didn't call it whatever you named it on your menu but except yours is over-sauced and very stingy on the meat
The food is usually out pretty fast and portions are generous for 3 people the total came out to be around 30 something dollars drinks spring rolls and pho bowls all around
The food was flavorful and the portions generous
I asked to see the kid's menu hoping that they may have something more traditional on that but alas more items concocted from a health food store
Good authentic Mexican cuisine at an affordable price - humongous portions; one where in a MAN verses FOOD competition FOOD WINS
Their lunch menu consists of standard items such as cold sandwiches salads pasta pizza soups and bakery items
My favorite on the menu is #48 - the Orchard salad with a standard bed of greens chicken strips oranges apples jicama dried cranberries and walnuts served with country French dressing that I usually switch out for their Roasted Red Pepper Fat Free dressing just so save those extra calories
I could see the tenderness of the meat as its juices glistened in the daylight
They have pizzas sandwiches and salads on the menu as well as some specials
All of the food is geared toward a healthier lifestyle and as Shannon said they give you a lot of useful nutritional information right on the menu
Everything on the menu is reasonable priced and they even have some specialty Mexican foods
There are lots of delicious choices - The Thai Chicken Wrap Salami Pesto Goat Cheese and the Roast Turkey are my most frequents
I felt I had a connection with Jason's reuben sandwich first few times piled high with corned beef and a good proportion to sauerkraut
It was my first time & they led me right through the process of making my own sushi but I opted to try the 3 Alarm a regular menu item & I LOVED it
The meat is flavorful and the portion is generous to say the least
As other reviews have said the menu is really interesting and the food is awfully good
So if in Old Town Scottsdale and in the need of pizza Gimaldi's is the only choice in my book enjoy
With menu items like Chilled Avocado and Crab Cocktail with Spicy Remoulade Crispy Salt and Pepper Shrimp with Shiitakes and Sugar Snap Peas Sliced Wagyu Beef Hot Rock Ishiyaki with Soy Broth Lightly Smoked Filet of Atlantic Salmon with Bok Choi and Chinese Black Bean Vinaigrette Seared Pacific Ahi Steak with Sautu00e9ed Shiitake Mushrooms and Wasabi Potato Puree Crispy Cashew Calamari with Fine Cut Vegetables and Ginger and Soy Truffled Macaroni & Cheese and Sautu00e9ed Spinach with Garlic and Shallots who could ask for more
Not too many places have corned beef hash on the menu so our friend jumped at the chance
And the selection is absolutely exceptional as only the finest most freshest of meats poultry and seafood are available
I don't know anyone who has tried their Italian fare but my friends and I have found their Asian food selections to be delicious
Each time we had multiple courses of food shared of course since the portions are large
5 words Antipasti meat and cheese selection
fantastic bartenders fun company on either side of us great wine delicious food especially the bread with pesto sauce and Dwight on the piano with a vocalist
Oh and if you're really feeling frisky you can ask for their Chinese menu which features some of the more unusual items fish bellies and the like
I was told reservations are only for groups who purchase a food & beverage package and that I should get there about 715/730 and put my name on the list for 8PM bowling time
One note is that C Fu offer wider variety of live fish too it is not only live Tilapia but also live Sea Bass and another one which I forgot its name
I was mostly impressed with the humungous size and generous helping of chicken included in the dish
If you really know your fish this is the place to get some of the best and most generous portions of sashimi possible
It was in a shallow tiny bowl almost monkey dish size
yah I knowTried it out about a week later because the menu is a la cartebig plus if you want authentic food that is not suffocated with cheese and I was not disappointed
The service was friendly and fast and the fish portions were very generous
When this food touches your tonge you will be in heaven food taste so great you won't be able to name another Italian restaurant portions are big enough to share or to take home and belive me this is food you won't let go bad in the fridge it even taste great reheated oh servers are always full of energy and very nice this is a chain restaurant but everyone is consistent and it taste the same from one restaurant to the next iv been in 4 different ones across Arizona they were all the same
Lots of real wood chalkboard paint galvanized metal and food service sized cans on display
The portions are good sized and I do find country/southern food items catfish okra etc
A perfect combination of various eggs pancakes or waffles dishes for breakfast and brunch items are included on their menu
Depending on your taste one can order standard items The Traditional -  two eggs choice of meat English muffin and potatoes or one can order something a little more creative Key West Crepe - crepe combined with flurry white eggs served with potatoes and English muffin
They could have a better restaurant selection but it's not too bad if you have time you can grab California Pizza or burritos or some drinks at a few different bars
The food prices on the happy hour menu are insanely cheap and if you go on ladies night on Thursday there is another menu for the ladies to choose from and the guys to help enjoy
The portions were pretty large and food rich
I also love the blackboard near  the back door that has the list of their seasonal fruits vegetables herbs that they use in their dishes
I'll definitely have to come back here on an empty stomach one day to try their full menu because the food that kept passing under our noses looked amazing
They still have a tantalizing food menu they are a full boar upscale restaurant and a drink menu that together rival anything else really in Lower Scottsdale and in much of the Valley
The Yelp category is Mexican but this is not your usual Tex-Mex cuisine  - menu is filled with Tortas grilled fish and other Mexican dishes not typically found on a menu of a typical Mexican restaurant in US
The choices are really diverse from sushi sashimi fresh stir fry typical Chinese standards and not so typical- yet traditional Asian specialty dishes
There is a lot of seafood and fish offerings as well as a good sized salad and desert bar
There's a robust vegetarian menu featuring Quorn brand mock-meat which has been delicious each time I've tried it
I got a 4-course tasting menu with wine pairing and he got a 5-course menu with both fish and meat course
I have had sushi in a variety of locations in the U
Fresh Wasabi Sushi and Grill doesn't have every sushi option in the book but they have a very solid selection
You may find a sushi restaurant out in Scottsdale with a better sushi selection and slightly better sushi quality
If there is a cupcake on the dessert menu I try it so when I heard a WHOLE CAFE DEDICATED TO CUPCAKES was coming to Scottsdale I was excited
Food wise their happy hour menu is good and decently priced
You can order you burger by the size or by non-free topping or you can get chicken
His menu is a mix of predictable authentic Vietnamese dishes and his own creations borrowed from other cuisines or his own imagination
Plus I appreciated that their pastys are a good size and that it is not a dough-overwhelmed dish meaning the crust is perfectly thinly sized and not like a calzone
So we asked for a menu and sat down at the closest table to see what we might like to try the stuff crab shrimp as an appetizer looked fantastic the couple next us had just received so we decided to try it and a ceasar salad with grilled chicken
When it comes to chandler az there are not very great choices for Italian food
Pizza is pretty good its new york style and they have a full pasta menu
While at our table we had a great view of the deli cases and menu boards and I knew I would have to order some food to go for my Mom and for me
Ok service was not good --- when we got the bill the pizza and wings were charged separate -- not right -- it was a together order per the menu
We had a big party and they tried their best to accommodate us as quickly as possible- Menu with wings and pasta and sandwiches a lot more to offer than just pizza - Fun retro decor and music classic style ads were on the front of the menu- Dirty monkey classic rum fruit cocktail that was quite deliciousMidlights- Sangria just ok not so much fruity flavor- Pizza cookie half done to give it that gooey almost cookie dough-like texture but I prefer it a bit more crispyLowlights- Only certain pizzas can be thin or Chicago style and the menu isn't so clear on that so it's a bit confusingEnjoyed this yelp find and would eat here again or another location since I found out it's a chain
However they have way more choices in terms of desserts smoothies baguettes
Unfortunately for $15 there were only 2 pieces of fish about the size of an orange slice
Dessert choice was chocolate bread pudding nice warm and creamy
Chuck made certain that both the food and wine selection were appropriate for the time situation and budget
I'm interested in trying some of the other menu items like the hot dogs chicken and burgers but with Italian beef this good it's hard to pick something different
Don't write me off as a simplistic food reviewer but CostCo pizza is really really good
The menu has a wide variety of foods from brick oven baked pork chops to roasted salmon which was phenomenal
Food is bland and the portions are small especially compared to the prices and the place itself wasn't even that tidy
Plus there was the promise of gigantic tanks of live fish and shellfish including some of the largest clams I have ever seen seriously they had necks the size of toddler's arms
*Molten chocolate cake- I don't normally like this type of dessert but the portion was so big I shared my husband's
No also because it has a nice wine selection full bar tasty if simple food solid veg options and that chilled out Phoenix bar in a house vibe
M4 - Yakisoba mi xao - a tasty yakisoba noodle dish with veggies and your choice of meatT2 - Bombay Veggies - Wok stir-fried tofu and veggies with curry coconut sauceB3 - Stir-fried mixed veggies - just a side order but perfect to fill your veggie minimum for the day
The food tastes fresh and it seems like there's some thought behind the menu not just the typical meals
I had multiple questions about things that were not on their menu roti other desserts and the owner came over to the table to chat
The buffet had a good variety of foods
In fact one lady laughed when my husband asked for a smaller portion of prepared food

If a light salad is what your more in the mood for they can assist with that at the salad bar where you will feel empowered to make your choices known of what you would like your salad to turn out to be and while your at it don't forget to pick up a chocolate chip cookie carrot cake bagel or cinnamon roll all freshly baked from the oven
Given the amount of feedback we've provided to the server and one of our friends didn't like the chocolate cake in the prix fix menu as a dessert the server gave us a sampler of desserts and a port to end the evening
There is a great selection to choose from for the desserts
From the menu    Grilled Mahi Mahi marinated in sake and orange juice with wild herbs served on a toasted handcrafted brioche bun with redleaf lettuce all-natural beefsteak tomatoes and red onions accompanied by sides of creme tartar and cucumber-pear medley
I live an hour away from this place and I make it one of my top choices to go for good sushi and japanese cuisine
I had the Gordon's Wrap off the to-go menu - seasoned chicken thigh
I've had better Thai food with a lot more choices on the menu at other restaurants in the Phoenix metro
One edge Fiddlesticks has over other Valley amusement-park-type choices is their Kiddie Land including the Dragon Ride and Miner Mike Roller Coaster
As for the raw food - first they told us they didn't have any and then they had to go print out a menu for us to look at but only offered a few of the items
The food is tasty but the portions are TINY
Bottom line good food but tiny portions and expensive
The pesto pasta with chicken added is my go to on the menu
Well I have never been disappointed by the food and I've tried just about everything on their menu but always end up back at the Chicken and Hummus appetizer
The array of dishes offered is not extensive but what they do offer are adequate for a decent meal
It showed this definitive picture of bulging cheese eggs salsa and the taco dwarfed by the size of the food spilling out of the end
Mexican food has to me my favorite type of food and Arriba is for sure at the top of my list for Mexican restaurants
The food on the normal menu is wayyy over priced for Mexican
The menu has many meat free options but I felt it was my duty to review every falafel in town and at $7 with salad or fries it was one of the better values on the menu
We came during Happy Hour but some of our dishes ended up not being on the HH menu a few we found out when we got the bill
The menu says your choice of meats but when my son chose Carne Asada we were told that the HH nachos only had the option of cheese or pork
Some dishes to try include Lavosh Pizza both the regular one and the glazed chicken variety; Red Pepper hummus appetizer; grilled chicken breast salad the dressing is soooo good
The menu primarily revolved around breakfast food
My dish was a good size and the Goulash was really good lots of gravy
I met up with a few friends and S of N were having a two for one special on all menu pizzas
Since they clearly have a great well-chosen list of ales & beers & that seems an obvious British accompaniment to pastys I told her some of the beers I normally liked such as IPAs Kiltlifter Dogfish Head 60 & 90
Given the choice I prefer to eat ethnic food in the way I would if at someones home in that country
If I had to find a negative I would say The Whole Foods I used to go to had fresh cut to order pasta and they had a better cheese selection similar to to Manhattan
In reality everything on the menu looked amazing - fresh ingredients inventive dishes and always healthy
The Spyder Roll was super fresh and a nice big portion
The egg flower soup had a generous portion of chicken in it making it very much like another order of food and not just an appetizer
A  1/2 chicken + rice + ranchero beans + tortillas corn or flour your choice + cabbage salad is $5
This pizza was the perfect size and tasted great
After reading the menu I almost wanted to leave because I didn't think my kids would eat anything but our server suggested some things and turns out we all LOVED our food
My own obsessive choice is Chilaquiles Verdes - heavenly green chile sauce poured over free-range perfectly roasted chicken topped with delicious shredded cheese and free-range eggs sunnyside up - a breakfast they serve all day and night
I used to travel to Florida monthly for work and got a little spoiled and addicted by the great cuban food selection
The food wasn't stellar but at $10 for a good-sized helping it was decent
The food is great lots of selection and they bring as much garlic bread as you want
I had some trepidation about trying it with whiz white american being my choice but it turned out to be surprising mild and did not interfere at all with the awesomeness that was the meat and grilled onion taste
The portion was very generous-I had the rib tips as well as the ribs with a wee side of brisket and pulled pork on a telero roll
They explained that there must have been too much fish sauce and they took it back without our small dishes that had portions of our soup with the majority of the chicken
Food wise it was generally good but somewhat overpriced for the portion size and food temperature could have been hotter - hot food HOT - chilled foods COLD is the oldest rule in restaurants
On the menu it's stated a guest described it as being so good they wanted to take their clothes off and roll in it
Any of the dishes on the menu will fit the bill for this taste romp as would the many creative drinks they have to offer
When you are seated they give you their standard menu if you want sushi you have to request for another menu
Knocked a star because I wasn't too please with their Sushi selection
Compared to other buffet fast food Chinese places Yum Yum falls short in the number of menu items and quality of their food
They do not rush you out they are pleased to help you select your food choices if you need
While they will gladly bring out a dish of buttered pasta or the like for a picky eater be forewarned with regards to the potential length of your visit and the no corporate kids menu
Love the customer service the produce is always fresh and a terrific deal and the choice of Gluten Free foods is amazing
Don't expect the 'have it your way' mentality of Subway; you have a choice of ~10 subs each of which comes with a selection of meats and cheeses
Also tried the grilled salmon and Cajun chicken sandwich which were both excellent choices
One of my favorite choices is the Jewish sliders they are served on a soft roll with a thick potato pancake and juicy sliced beef then topped with cheese a a drizzle of gravy
They always give you a generous portion of meat that you can barely taste the bread itself lol
Plenty of beer choices and lots of options for food that are quite good
Their buffalo chicken wrap is a solid choice as well
My favorites are a build your own omelette with a huge variety of options French toast turkey rueben with sweet potato fries and the above mentioned berry salad with pine crusted chicken
the food is simple the selection is simple but its well done and enjoyable
There are many other appealing dishes on the menu; it's difficult to taste them as the pizza is so good
We looked over the menu and decided on the calamari appetizer spinach salad and the sausage pizza
In conventional restaurants you pick one thing on the menu omlette steak fish whatever
The sushi here is tolerable but for similar prices I would head to some of the other choices around the area
The concessions had a good variety of choices but still expensive ballpark food
While there weren't a lot of dishes that didn't have some sort of nuts on it I and my family were certainly were satisfied with the choices that we made

He and she talked extensively about Japan since he is from Tokyo and sent out many unusual dishes for her to try
For our main course we ordered a variety of sushi rolls
The theme is carries out thought the menu in a poor attempt to seem original lobster sausage or chicken is added to most traditional dishes
The Swedish Meatballs are always a solid choice--not stellar but pretty tasty
The menu is a little limited with the main dishes being carne asada taco burrito tostada Vampiro and quesadilla
We get the rest of the food and the portions look tiny but in reality they are huge because I just ate half an avocado and a bagillion or so chips
I would have liked to see more of the other items that they advertise on their online menu such as the lobster bisque or seafood chowder
Green Burger goodTuscan Chicken Sandwich good large portionRed Velvet Cupcake The cupcake itself was just ok the icing was incredible but it was a tad overpriced at $4

Prices are good portions are generous and food is the best

They have an extensive menu of Irish food and the service has always been good for me
The chimichanga was tiny-- about the size of an egg roll but it had spicy ground beef in it
Wiser the second time I went I ignored my waiter's advice to order another dish that seemed to be also a prime candidate for cheese drowning and went for the fish tacos which were quite good and served with a heaping portion of rice and beans
On the positive side the serving size was nice on the bowl and the women serving/making the food were very sweet and friendly
I've tried more than a few dishes off the menu and most are alright
Not a ton of sushi variety and I wish there were more descriptions I'd probably order other rolls if I knew what they were/what was in them but over all I enjoy this place a lot
Food  Hob Nobs has a good variety of items on their menu

Menu items I've had are the caprese the chicken caesar salad the balsamic dressing on the chicken is to die for
this is not a style for fans of bloated soggy super-sized pizza piled high with toppings and big greasy blobs of cheese
if you're a pizza minimalist like me i haven't found anybody that does it better
So now I can say I'm ready to try other dishes on the menu
The real appeal of this place is that they serve on a separate menu to those of us who know anything about Chinese infused Korean dishes
you get a choice of 3 sides with your meal and he chose the dill mashed potatoes broccoli and marinated beans  like a 3 bean salad he ate the whole plate and this is not a small plate this is like hungry man giant sized food
Not only was the food outstanding but the on tap selection of beer was incredibly impressive
I have yet to venture farther into the menu than pizza because I am perfectly happy with that
The portions are huge so me and 2 friends shared an appetizer salad and pizza and left extremely full and happy
Every dessert on their menu is really good but this is by far the best dessert I have ever had

Last time I ordered the seafood pizza which was Gross which I didn't even see on the menu anymore
This place can host exclusive private party for the movers and shakers of Arizona as well offer a great lunch menu for the common foodie
The tiny quarter sized piece of meat was oh-so-good but they were full of fat and bones so it was about $12  for 5 bites of lamb and a plate of bones
The have a new menu with some Thai and sushi options in addition to their Chinese cuisine
I don't really get why they added sushi to the menu since there are roughly 528 other sushi options in old town but other than that the new menu is solid
Other dishes do not have all their ingredients revealed on the menu -- such as green onions which my boyfriend hates and nuts which I can't eat

I also got a sheet of beef jerky about the size and shape of Rocky's head from Mask
It's the closest health food store where I can find a wide selection of fresh produce bulk grains & nuts cheeses and other random hard-to-find items
They didn't have much selection but I went with the bbq chicken sandwich and my friends got the beef ribs and brisket
Food choices are plentiful around the terminal inside and outside of security I am disappointed Burger King doesn't have the BK Stacker there
I rarely ever eat fast food but then sometimes get a craving and am pleased to find something a little more like real food than the typical Burger King/McDonald's variety
Thinking that I'd probably have to settle on a greasy burger and fries if I didn't want a bland chicken sandwich and typical fast food salad I was pleased to find pork tenderloin sandwiches on the menu the other white meat that you can dunk in grease and fry along with a range of sides
My wife grabbed a frozen custard I got the pork tenderloin with cole slaw and  we both went away happy with our classic fast food selections
Once I had the tiny tuna some tuna on a roll about the size of an English muffin for $4

Sushi Sam of San Mateo is still the best on my list; but this place takes the cake for PHX area hands down
The prices are reasonable around $8 for a cheeseburger Angus beef with one side a variety to choose from including french fries onion rings and cole slaw and the servie is very friendly
He took the time to explain the menu and even gave us a lesson on how to pronounce dishes
It didn't hurt that they had also sent me a voucher for free birthday pizza; I guess my wife signed me up for their email list

they also have a very good dessert selection which includes an ice cream bar and a fruit bar
My friend and I love Mexican food not Americanized either but we'll cross this one off our list
This roll and a number of other ones on their menu have chopped macadamia nuts which I've never seen in a sushi roll before or any nuts for that matter
After sitting myself at the sushi bar I had to wait 10 minutes before someone offered me a drink/menu
The choices aren't spectacular but they work well with the food
I tried most of the izakaya menu over the past two days and had some killer dishes
The protein pancakes are their signature dish and although I'm not sure I believe the low et carbs they describe on the menu they are still really tasty and very unique
But most of the time I order the half-and-half which is a plate of a smaller portion of protein pancakes and a dish of their homefries mixed with veggies meats or cheese there are a couple of options with an egg on top
The food was unique and in large portions which was perfect for sharing with everyone
Short Story-Great food but smaller than Barbie Sized but full price
I am looking at my measuring cups right now and the dish looked like my quarter cup but the dish of beans wasn't filled all the way so it was less than a quarter cup also vegetables were not a part of this entree $24 Both of us and the two tables seated on both sides of us thought it was too dark in the dining room you REALLY HURT your eyes trying to read the menu in such darkness no matter how young or great your eyesight is
You've got shuffle board and pool and TVs and a menu that will make any lover of fried food super happy
Short list this place if you're in the delivery area in case you find yourself up late and craving pizza and subs
Menu is not huge but varies from pedestrian dishes like yellow curry chicken which was very mild to spicy pigs ears
I always have the garden burger which is cooked rather conspicuously close to the actual meat to be considered vegetarian--especially when the same spatula is used to cook it and there is no meatless portion of the grill--but that's not what Chuckbox is about
The Pear Pizza and the Egg Pizza here among others provide enough variety to keep me curiously coming back

In Japan you are supposed to eat sushi whole but when we ordered the Hana Roll Their best standard roll IMHO I could cut it into two perfectly sized pieces--if nori was nicely cut-able so in the end it was a disaster on my plate and eaten piece-meal
but I have to admit all the contents of the roll were tasty and I liked their eel sauce consistency and proportions sometimes it can be over slathered and/or runny drenching the rice till it's rendered un-sticky and difficult to handle
Their Bento Box meals are also a great price for the variety of meal you get and I'll admit I would buy their Chicken Katsu if I was jonesin' for it but was too lazy to cook it myself

The food is outstanding whether you're eating from the happy hour menu or the regular menu
Did I mentioned that the chicken tenders with honey mustard are an excellent choice as well
The one downfall is that they don't have a full food menu but you can always bring in some pei-wei or munch on some of their hummus and pita chips
Its runner up for best sleeper dish on the menu
The chicken marsala was not over-cooked like some tend to be and each of us had an accompanying side of vegetables and our choice of penne or spaghetti
i saw 4 1/2 stars on this restaurant  so instead of going to my neighbor hood sushi restaurant  with yaki soba on my mind i decided to try this place i showed up at 1130 a m  i was the only person there when i walked in the owner handed me a menu i went to a table and had a seat i went over the menu 3 or 4 times he sorta asked me if i was ready to order from behind the front desk i guess he did not wat to walk to my table to take my order  i asked him if he had yaki soba  he said no and left it at that so i ordered the lunch special w/chicken katsu the piece of chicken was maybe 3 oz piece 5/6 tempura battered vege a shrimp and a pot sticker and a small salad  6
So I wasn't real hopeful although they had some nice cuts of fish on the menu
No complaints on the meat flavour or texture but the size of the burrito was a bit disappointing
Didn't seem bad for all that but the portions are a bit smaller than I'm used to for a hole in the wall type Mexican food place - for that price at a place like Filiberto's you'd get more food
Everything on the menu looks pretty great but I decided on the 3 Pupusa Combo 1 steak w/cheese 1 chicken w/cheese & 1loroco flower w/cheese
- Cocktails huge menu list of fun mixology and tropical items - Bread big hat-shaped hunk of soft and warm yeasty goodness - Desserts the tray always looks enticing especially the pina colada cake but I usually don't have room
After it warms up a bit it's much easier to get in sit down eat mediocre pizza and drink a pitcher of beer while you list to an artist play a wide assortment of musical selections
I am a produce shopper who needs a wide variety of things the opportunity to be elbow deep in a lettuce display fishing out a a head that satisfies my salad requirements
Earlier today I had a conversation with one of my best friends about Buffalo Exchange and he went off on a stand-up comedy rant about it that had me and my girlfriend rolling on the floor as we listened on speakerphone
Currently my nom of choice is the orecchiette with mock meatballs
The natural foods section is next to the produce but it is pretty lacking in selection
I thought my food while very tasty was poorly portioned
First is a somewhat dark dining area with booths and a sort of intimate feel to it and second is a menu that features various steak/prime rib cuts along with token chicken fish and pasta selections
My two companions had never had Chicken Fried Steak before which I find hard to believe because I think every elementary school cafeteria had it on the menu
If you're in the mood for a really incredible place to hang out have a few drinks indulge in some delicious food and really just enjoy a laid back dining experience then the Windsor should be at the top of your must try list
We had just had brunch at Maizie's the day prior and our first impression was disappointment in the portions of the food considering the prices were also comparable
They also do a variety of vegi and mock meat stir fries that I've had at their other location and though I've not had them their vegi burgers look amazing
She did come back and explained that apparently there is a pizza on there menu that is specifically called the Italian sausage that comes with all the other stuff and apologized for the mix up
The food and cocktail menu looks great and I thoroughly enjoyed my freezing cold glass of Schramsberg Blanc de Blanc at a very reasonable $9 a glass
as the menu is not much different and the food is of the same poor quality---it comes out within 5-10 minutes of ordering and tastes as if food was cooked hours earlier and was just reheated in the microwave it probably was
I can't speak thoroughly as to the food since it has changed substantially since my last visit to eat but I understand that the menu has expanded and has a Greek flair to it now
It's not the interesting menu items like fried gizzards and fish and grits that you just can't get other places that stir my soul
The food here is excellent and the menu is very large
Every tapas-sized dish we had was great
Nobuo accompanies the great food with a good wine selection a one-of-a-kind Japanese beer selection running the range from lager to oyster stout including a great IPA and a good sake selection
Add star 4 for having a sizeable grocery section with fresh food
I was gonna give it a solid 4 stars because this Target is fresh has lots of food choices a Pharmacy the great food court with Pizza Hut Express and Starbucks and plenty of friendly Team Members that have never failed to ask me if I need help but the fact that this Target is open til 11pm rather than the typical 10pm closing time for Target that my friends just bought star #5
The menu is short and simple Fish shrimp hush puppies fries a handful of other fried sides and a fish alternative
The food was excellent and so was the wine selection
Their food is small portions for the price
Needless to say it's been years since I've had that meal on my birthday so I was pleasantly surprised when I found fried chicken on the menu at Roaring Fork
These were the smallest rolls I had ever seen and it was not a half portion cause of happy hour or anything
Everything we ordered from the Christmas menu was delicious but a few stand-outs are the crab cake appetizer and the beef tenderloin and pasta carbonara main dishes
Their menu is creative and there is a really great variety of food
They'll come and grab your order the menu is full of American food similar to AMC Esplanade 14 and they'll deliver it to you throughout the movie
The menu is large serving both traditional Mexican food as well as Burgers and fries and combinations of both
Dishes are a little on the expensive side but like most people have already said the portions are very large
The food was terrible and the menu was all over the place
When it changed to the Lizard the food got better and the menu more uniformed
Would have liked to see some small pizza options on the menu but then again if you want pizza there's always his other little restaurant
I had combed over the menu and mostly out of pure inability to make a decision extreme lack of sleep and beer after a long day of work and a movie decided to just go in on the pizza with everyone
They offer some large full size desserts and they offer little dessert shots
It is an above average place but the two things I saw that made it sink in the stars was the portion little meat maybe 2-3 layers about it covered up wih the cheese melted on it
Sorry to all you Brittany Spears fans out there but definitely not something I want to listen to while nom'ing on some sushi
Overall I would say this is great food I probably wouldn't buy another mixed drink there as they are weak but they have a nice selection of tequilas
The broth was full of flavor and the meat was a generous portion and on my order of Pho Tai it actually was rare as it was served to me unlike many other Pho places where it is already cooking in the broth and far from rare upon arrival to me
The menu had many options on it besides just Pho and I ordered my usual Vietnamese egg rolls which were great as well
The menu is very broad and diverse and the desserts look very appetizing
**Pirozhki - Small meat filled pies approximately the size of a dinner roll
That's only one of very unique specialty pizzas on the menu one of my personal favorites along with the barbeque
You can get food at times other than the dinner show but the menu is limited
Then we tried the the chicken and mushroom crepe also a great choice
Anyway the entree menu is really random spicy Singapore noodles Jamaican Jerk chicken Bombay cauliflower curry Plaid Thai noodles all with options of chicken or tofu
The next dish that is probably the best one on the menu and they know it is their LOS MEJORES DE LA CASA which is 2 small perfectly cooked bacon wrapped beef tenderloin medallions and 2 shrimp with bacon cheese and jalapenos mmmmm so so so Good
You can specify from a vast variety of meat choices
PositivesService was goodMashed potatoes and jalapeno corn were very goodTostadas were fresh tastingPortions were large - prices are okayNot so positives not really bad enough to be negativesThe side room not the main dining room was extremely noisyThe chili rellenos sounded great but the seafood taste was lost beans and the crust was a little heavy
The food was fantastic but very small portions so we did end up ordering chips with salsa and guacamole on top of it
Our server Eric was very friendly & answered any questions we had regarding the menu/food
The beef tostadas were yummy also; I think these are both new menu items that are being tested - hopefully they will stay since they were both pretty impressive
Nothing like their Achiote Chicken Chopped Salad which is my favorite menu item to order when I go to Z for lunch
The menu works something like this pick your broth they have 5 or 6 then pick the meat
Things I like about The Roosevelt- The beer selection- Parking is easy except on First Fridays- The wait staff is quick- The snack food yes the pretzel

The menu selection is plentiful with a nice variety of hot dishes and sushi
Fridays to try some of the food featured on that Food Network show but during games they have a limited menu that excludes a lot of the good stuff including most if not all of the Food network recipes
I've been there a few times and there was never live music I've never eaten their food - or been offered a menu so I didn't even know they had food until I saw it on Yelp reviews and I've never had any wine
Once I got my food I felt that the prices were fair due to portion size
If you are planning on ordering deep-dish and aren't wanting to make a day of it you may want to peruse the menu online and call your order in or at least  right you get there even at typically slow times there's always a bit of a wait for a table
That way you can pig out on the breakfast items just before they switch them out for the lunch choices increasing the overall food selection from excellent to terrific

The entrees fared well also generous portions of delicious food with uniformly intense flavor
The coffee's good the food is delicious and offers a wide variety of items from breakfast and sandwiches to crepes and salads
The sushi menu is incredibly gimmicky
I had their fish in chips which were nice and the proportion big but i STILL prefer Rula Bula's still looking for something comparable ANYWHERE else
They've updated their menu and serve food until 3pm
but sometimes you just want that chicken parm sammy or that big burger that your diet or lifestyle choices must keep you from

The surreal combination of this menus with chicken wire inset into them a long table next to us filled with 60-plus diners and Like a Fool Believes playing over the restaurant speakers had me in a fit of uncontrollable laughter
The menu was so full of puns like hens forth and egg cetera that I was almost too distracted to order my food
The place was busy & somewhat crowded so I didn't try to count up the food choices but I say that it was somewhere near 100 to start with
SOME of the meat choices for examples were pork sausage patties pork sausage links fennel sausage Polska Keilbasa bacon fairly thick & large ham steaks big meaty beef ribs & more
+ Very decent wine and drink selection all reasonably priced going along with the Regional themeThe Bad- We were sat and then waited 15 minutes before anyone came over- My dining partner was brought the wrong beer- I asked if I could sub a salad for the fries and was advised I couldn't you have to purchase the salads separately - no half sizes and the house salad was 6 bucks lame- They have a pretty limited menu for lunch only 4 sandwiches no chicken sandwich
It has a variety of dishes and cuisines everyone would like
Great beers on tap some super wines and the food is above average lots of variety
Served in a giant plate with lots of lettuce your choice of meat cheese beans salsa ect
Portions are ginormous and the food was really tasty
We ordered four rolls - three off the wonderfully priced happy hour menu - and I chose a cherry blossom roll off the regular menu because I couldn't resist the fresh combination of three meats

I am impressed with the giant menu and so many food options available

Choices can range from prime new york steak to lamb chops to a wonderfully cooked piece of fish

Already with lunch plans I knew the bistro menu was not the choice though admittedly the duck and foie gras had my attention and as such I turned my attention to the pastry case only to be told that no Paris Brest was available - a disappointment to be sure but at the same time given the variety of options including a number of my other favorites not totally disheartening and after a few moments of indecision I opted for three selections paid the modest tab and made my way outside to enjoy
Besides the major misfire in matching theme to decor to menu the food is great
Sadly  my favorite item was just taken off the menu which was the chicken caprese cutlet

95 the Paccatelli al Ragu a bolognese pasta dish I believe the Scaloppine al Gorganzola a veal dish that he enjoyed but serving size was not as big as he'd wished for
Service is fast because you don't have to wait for a server to bring you menus and take your order you go right up to the counter and order off the menu they have displayed then they bring your food to your table once it's done
I am someone that orders almost everything on the menu when trying out a new place and the majority of unique dishes were dissapointing specifically lacking in flavor execution texture and occassional messy plating I could be swayed if the prices were a little better but for what they charge I wouldn't be afraid to send something back or shy away from this place all together
Beer selection is a little on the weak side but the food is pretty good

They served this same sauce with the egg rolls tempura vegetables so terrible and the tempura tofu which on the menu said came with peanut sauce
The have a great menus and my favorite meat is the brisket so tender and yummy with their sassy bbq sauce
But the really cool part is that a lot of the side dishes from their menu are available for purchase by the pound deli-style
So I have to stress that I personally am not a huge seafood fan at all and most of the menu consists of some sort of seafood and/or exotic food I haven't experienced so the experience was a bit different for me

I've had most things on their menu the fish burritos are really good if you eat them right away while the fish is still crisp and as for everything else it's all good but my heart belongs to Filibertos
The steaks and seafood are prepared to perfection and their wine list is second to none
We both had Pad Thai noodles on the lunch menu which came with a small soup some fried wonton skins and an egg roll

Meat and poultry offerings are also extensive
It's highly Americanized and yes I've had Chinese food in China but I've also enjoyed great American Chinese food here to the point of regrettable blandness and it is SO VERY EXPENSIVE you may find your credit score taking a ding after eating a plate of wok charred beef listed as one of the saltiest foods in America

I ordered the Coconut Shrimp Rolls & salad off their lunch menu
Their selection of food is outstanding and their food is great too
I have tried many things on the menu such as Eggplant Parmigiana Chicken Parmigiana and Cheese steak and three of those are worth a shot
For dinner I had the seared ahi appetizer - I know done everywhere but I really just felt like a small portion of nice fish
I can't speak to any of the dishes on the regular menu but if you decide to try the Summer Menu I highly recommend the date and mozzarella appetizer
I usually get Jade Red Chicken Jen Red Pork pork fried rice and black beans with Sobe Lean from the fountain because you know I'm just that health-conscious but I've tried everything on the menu and it's all great
The food is very good and portions are more than ample so you can easily split something or just have a lunch for yourself the next day
The menu ranges from basic lunch items such as quiche chicken salad sandwiches and salads to afternoon tea items where you can order the entire Afternoon Tea $24
I had been craving a grilled fish taco and was stoked they had them on the menu
As most korean restaurant these days they also offer serveral item in their menu that is not common korean dishes such as katsudeep fried pork or chicken
I ordered off menu their Szechwan cucumbers which were fresh crisp slightly salty with a great hot oil and many red chilies tucked into the dish
This is a spicy dish without a doubt but the warning is unwarranted as it allows the great flavors to come through and when combined with the generous portion of rice served it is a perfect meal
My waiter Paul was very excited about the dish and when he found out I had liked it so much he promised to make me a special dish not on the menu next time I come in
With just more than 100 items on the menu there were some tough choices to be made on each of my visits with friends sharing dishes family style
-1 star for being a bit too pricey for what they have to offer and also some others in my party were not completely thrilled with their food/drink choices
The menu is extensive and heavy on the seafood which is awesome since it is delicious
Nevertheless I would definitely come back for the selection and the food
Love the variety and quality of food offered here
I got the teriyaki bowl with dark meat chicken regular size
The entree was chicken & chorizo pasta from the gluten free menu and while it really really looked the part  the only two ingredients that had any real taste were the artichoke and the roasted peppers
Prefixing everything with organic is redundant and probably adds 1/3 to the menu's size  Nearly beats Flo's out for lunchtime noise the main area is pretty harsh and reflective  and regardless of what it looks like  it feels like mall food court
The food is well portioned and the coffee was pretty darn good
But the 'ZBQ' was the choice for me BBQ sauce chicken w/ roasted red peppers red onion tomatoes cilantro and sweet corn
Beer selection as others mentioned was great but the food was meh
The bombero burro is smothered in almost a bbq meets red chile sauce and filled with the meat of your choice and rice wrapped in a homemade tortilla
Years ago I used to enjoy their BLTs with avocado but since I no longer eat meat I do find it a challenge to find something I want on the menu
I have not sampled their food menu but the wine choices I had were great
They also have a small menu for kitchen food like bbq chicken and desert like tempura ice cream
*Also their menu stated that they will cook fresh raw seafood for you
It's $5 each dish and you can choose from a long list of sauces/styles you would like to have it prepared
The deli has a good selection of meats and cheeses sliced to order and the service in the deli was very friendly Christine
wow the happy hour here is killer for the gourmet food selection they have
With the menu change they took away the spaghetti and instead put penne pasta on top of the chicken under the cheese
Foie Gras Duo with Roasted Bing Cherries and Almond Streusel  While I generally eschew the restaurant week menu it was the non-RW appetizer that would prove to be the biggest failure of the meal and perhaps the biggest food failure I've had since moving to the valley - simply stated this was a piece of foie that should have never made it to the kitchen let alone to the table
They even deliver the food right to your door and I know there's some online menu you can choose from
They have a wide variety of italian pasta dishes that were very reasonably priced
They have a great selection of wine $5 on HH the service is always great and the food is tasty
I've tried a couple of other items on their menu as well but I love the curry dish so much I rarely order anything else
The menu is fun because you pick one type of meat and the rest is literally the Cook's Surprise
The sandwiches are loaded with meat and cheese and if that is what you are craving they are a great choice
Extremely good value here - great menu I had the Smart Chicken which was out of this world yummy
Think of it as a pizza joint touched by the hippie spirit with a giant mushroom mascot and colorful music-inspired artwork covering the walls -- good vibes all around to complement the vegan-friendly menu
The menu's specialties are the pizzas but it also includes soups salads and hoagies
Despite not being completely thrilled with the food I ordered there were lots of drool-worthy items on the extensive menu that I'll be trying out soon
and was actually quite a lot of food particularly for lunch which I love cause I'm always complaining that lunch portions are too small
I tasted my wife's Chicken Greek which I probably wouldn't have picked as one of my own top choices to order and it was awesome
As a side dish I ordered Roasted Seasoned Mushrooms perhaps the only poor selection on the menu
The variety of beer on tap the good appetizers the young lady offering free samples of cheese pizza and
The desserts are tiny individual sized portions that are beautifully displayed
The meat was well cooked vegetables were fresh and there was a good variety
The lady proceeded by pointing at the seafood pancake section on the menu and saying I don't know why but you Chinese like this pancake a lot
The spicy chicken came in a bowl about the size of an instant-noodle bowl but slightly deeper was tender with rice underneath it
Then there was an ice-cream scoop of rice topped with 3 pieces I kid you not THREE pieces of dog-tag-sized super-dry meat
The menu is easy to decipher - the dishes are explained in English
I really wanted Chicken & Waffles for breakfast and the Clarendon Hotel I was staying at used to have this item on their menu
So I recently ordered delivery of which I found they do not deliver south of Curry so Score 1 since my friend lives at Miller and McKellips the invisible border of Scottsdale/Tempe menu items are moderately priced and the third best thing about LCP Little Chicago Pizza is the food it's pretty good
Inside was nice and clean the menus were simple and a bit liberal with the apostrophes but I'll forgive grammar if the food is right
I was really excited they had a GF pizza on the menu
I eat sushi often and eat a wide variety and when I go to Station 80% of my plates are $2
Since we shared everything the proportions except for the dessert were perfect
Maybe it is because people give up on the wait list and go next door to the other pizzaria
their martini list is adorable and they have some great happy hour food as well
The place caters to families the food is always good they have a full bar and this one also has an acceptable tap beer selection
Nothing to amazing on the menu the food is good overall but nothing I can remember really stood out
Selection of food isn't as big as some other Vietnamese places around here but definitely higher-priced pho than most places
There aren't a lot of vegan dessert choices around the valley and this is a good one
The Butterfish is supposed to be the best item on the menu
The menu is huge the TV's are on with sports action the drinks were cold service is adequate and the food is too
The owner and the staff were extremely nice and explained each wine selection they held a raffle for a few prizes and kept the food coming
This is really nothing more than someone collecting all of the 'exotic' dishes one at a time from generic american restos like applebees and chilis and combining them onto one menu in one place
The menu is varied and the variety goes from Afghan food to Indian / Pakistani food to good old American grub
Food selection was fairly standard for stadiums nothing special there
The food was easy the generic menu that you'd expect--my burger was just okay and there's plenty of grease to go around
the food was good and i liked the variety
Neither of us are red meat eaters so we both immediately look towards the chicken and fish menu sections of any restaurant we dine at
This place has a classy looking menu board some classy staff and some utterly indescript food
Meat selection is great both do-it-yourself and behind the counter
There was a good variety of dishes available for the low price of $5
Moto is where I really got hooked on sushi though what I have had off of the rest of the menu is always yummy too
The underground menu is also a great option when your feeling flush - the rolls are all $12 each
So then Chef Brian stops by our table asks us about our food we explain how thankful we are to have found such a spot and the food is yummy good great portions and he invites us to Mabel's on Main-rewrite he drives us to to Mabel's on Main
Unfortunately the menu is too extensive and the food is not very fresh
The menu needs to be re-worked to something SIMPLE and the food needs to be fresher
The lunch specials include an egg roll rice and your selection; which for me is typically the beef panang
The very orderly presentation of the food makes the portion size appear to be small but it is just the right amount to leave you feeling satisfied but not overstuffed
I will definitely have to return on a Friday to try the other tappas and listen to the Swedish singer who sings some songs in German
The menu has removed all the soups and most of the noodle dishes
I SWORE I was full and refused to look at a dessert menu
I order my standard quintessential Viet dish; the pho in supersize with everything in it at about $7
The meatbacon like  wasn't the choicest selection of the animal either; no flank london broil or leg cross section
I would prefer to pay a few bucks more to get a fine-crafted  quality dish in smaller portions
We shared a Las Vegas roll a spicy tuna roll and then each had our own selections of nigiri I had ikura and she had eel and handrolls I had spicy scallop and she had eel
They have an eclectic variety of yummy food
You can still cook your food yourself on the outdoor grills but at least now you can order off of the menu like at a regular restaurant
The menu needs improvement and the food is inconsistent and overpriced considering the generally low quality of it
The menu is tiny it's diner food but the food quality is very very high
As my fellow foodie Pete likes to say it is a check list not a menu
On the flip side the food is awesome portions are good size atmosphere is nice it is a night place but good during the day also
-OFor food this is strictly a Chinese buffet now & the new owners had 44 food choices out today plus dressings & sauces
California Pizza Kitchen is a frequent choice for our family as we all have various dietary restrictions that this restaurant can easily accommodate
She explained that upon placing the order for the pizza that the tomatoes normally on the pizza a diced variety supposedly part of a chunky sauce WERE the sauce so she had the kitchen go ahead and make the pizza without tomatoes
The meat is great quality the tomatoes are sliced thin the staff is friendly and it may not specifically be on the menu anylonger but you can get pepperoni on your cheesesteak if you so desire and no one is going to make faces at you for asking
ther food quality is good service is good and all around good place with their new pricing and menu options
They load 'em with beans your choice of meat salsa cheese sour cream and 3-cheese queso
Ive been here twice already and the food pricing and portions are tasty bargain and large
Their vegetarian selection on the Chinese food menu is extremely limited and of that they only have one dish with tofu
In the past I have been a little reluctant to choose RigaTony's because I wasn't really a big fan of their menu but after this visit I noticed that they offer more of a variety of food choices that are certain to keep me coming back
Same spot though and the food has pretty much stayed the same besides a few changes in the menu
BUT when it comes to their actual menu and food its only a C for me
The portions were not as large as dinner but we could have made a dinner meal from the amount of food that was brought out
the chef is an acquaintance of my friend and he was so generous to send us a dessert of our choice on him
After much contemplation and internal debate the sushi menu is quite large including many nigiri- and sashimi-style options I chose the Houston roll vegetarian roll and unagi nigiri
so on the one hand i would go back there in a heartbeat quick service good food and for the most part decent prices kate would list it on a top ten places to avoid list
It only took a few minutes and when they called out my number I was greeted by a steaming order of  perfectly battered chicken strips and two decent size sides
The Kabobs were a selection of meat shrimp and veggies one of the veggies I had no idea what it was although good I wasn't thrilled with the dipping sauces though
My boyfriend ordered a kobe beef hamburger to the room that I believe was $19 on the menu but after a delivery charge and a service charge came out to $30
JD had the chicken burro because of the reputation it had earned from other Yelpers and he was very happy with his choice
For dinner we did a full service chef choice thing where they picked for us the wine and food that is perfectly paired
The dinner choices are pretty standard but I've only have a few of the most common ones Orange Chicken fried rices a few other stir fry's etc
The food is fantastic and the beer list is suprisingly delicious as well with breweries such as Dogfish Head
There was a great selection of hamburgers and chicken sandwiches
Their meat salsa and carb choices are just as varied
When I'm watching my spending I get the lunch special which is a chicken quesadilla chips and a drink but it is definitely a great point of variety too don't get me wrong
i picked up a menu and thumbed through it but it was filled with just the usual dishes
I usually have a standard list of items that I order for the entire table when my family goes to BucaBruschettaLinguine Frutti DiMareMargherita PizzaPepperoni PizzaChicken MarsalaI also frequent other independently owned Italian restaurants but Buca holds a special place in my heart and my stomach
They have a great selection of organic foods
The people that I invited that had never been to AB before were expecting more of a variety in brunch items since I'd told them that they had great brunch but their concerns were quelled with a few bloody Marys and some good if not diverse food
They had a good selection of ice cream desserts and the staff was very friendly
Good food - at least the price and surroundings didn't have me questioning my choice of sushi in the desert
If you are not into sushi also on the choose two menu is an assortment of salads soups and sandwiches
And the selection was pretty good given that they could have even made do with less pizza's out there
The portions are enough for two people to share and  they have many other dishes to choose from
The rice was a very small portion the seafood was inedible because the garlic sauce was like mucus and tasted off not worth $16 for sure
We tried the chef's menu which unfortunately included seafood yuck but there were some dishes that I could try
Memories of my sandwich inspired me to look for roast beef while getting groceries this weekend but the selection did not compare
They knew my dessert weakness and had creme brulee with berries on the menu
Yes it's cheap the food offerings mediocre and boring and the service disinterested but when the choices are between Denny's and BJ's I'll opt to fast for the evening next time
I first visited to this spot last night where I was able to sample food off the the happy hour menu
not terribly extensive as far as the food selections go
The menu is expansive with classic Italian fare ravioli ziti steaks and seafood
TV's were so loud we could barely hear the waiter asking questions of our choice of drinks and food orders
We tried the rice krispies rolled in ice cream for dessert and I didn't think that was all that great - it sounds better on the menu than it actually is
Both selections were very good - the fish had a great taste - nicely crisp on the outside tender and juicy on the inside
The rolls themselves were pretty good nothing spectacular but definitely worth the price keep in mind this is the happy hour menu only some of their other rolls looked more appealing but weren't on happy hour
There are so many items on their menu I have not been disappointed with from Pesto pizza to cheesy bread to salad
I had the taco salad the chicken was wonderfully spicy but the salad could have had more variety in it
The shelfish/seafood selection is EXTENSIVE
Then you select from the widest selection of pizza toppings you'll find anywhere
There's a menu left in your room at all times so you can order their food as roomservice and here are all the things I tried-The Cowboy Club Amazing variation of a club sandwich that I will have to make at home because it's probably one of the best i've ever had
-Bbq Chicken Pizza Shared on the first night this thing is massive but for 6 people was just the right size a personal size pizza is about the size of a medium 10 slicer from pizza hut while the full size is as long as the round table we were sitting at
The chicken noodle was on the menu the day the bf needed it the most and we all had some with garlic toast
This used to be a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant but it closed down years ago and now it is very tasty Mexican restaurant with big portions
The portions are fair the prices even fairer and the food all excellent
They had a good selection of food that's step above your average bar food
The service was good the food was hot and tasty the cocktails they have on their menu were very unique and we tried a couple as well
I will be back for HH and to try other food on the big menu
Grey Goose Martini's - $6Well's - $3Nice House Wine Options I believe $4 or $5Bartender was very pleasant and attentive recommended a pizza dish that was not even on the menu and it was absolutely fabulous for $12 and fed both of us with 2 extra slices leftover
Even though they have a gluten-free menu the waitress was unwilling to go ask the cook what exactly they put in the food and in particular the sauces
She got the size of the prime rib cuts wrong got the side dishes wrong
The Fennel Orange Salad is almost as good as the Brussel Sprout Salad at Chelsea's but hands down my favorite dish at LGO is the Padre which is no longer on the regular menu but they're still more than happy to make it for you; a pizza with arugula fig point reyes blue and prosciutto di san daniele
I was dragged here with family & ended up ordering a chile relleno which was just about the only meatless item on the menu short of a fucking cheese crisp
The food choices are unique and flavorful and the staff friendly and accommodating
lets just say if im ever on death row ill have this pizza listed as my last meal
The food itself is decent but the selections to choose from on the menu are pretty random
I couldn't quite pin point the type of cuisine this restaurant would be categorized as but it's a hefty selection of Mediterranean eats such as prosciutto cheeses paninis and pizzas
Four Peaks in Tempe offers a wide selection of well above average bar food and absolutely great beer in a historically unique and lively environment
I was a little disappointed that unlike the menu said there wasn't any okra or seitan-sausage in mine just the fake chicken
Their website does list all their gluten free food but it's hard to bake from scratch when you have no tapioca flour or millet flour etc
I gave them 4 stars because there is a couple of better Chinese buffets in the valley Jen buffet and Pacific seafood buffet that are 5 stars but this place would make my top ten Chinese buffets list
An egg-cheese-pesto crepe provided a protein punch and I really appreciate the food selection vs
The menu is soul/comfort food that is reasonably priced and served up in a warm hip atmosphere
Then we were handed two large book style menus a sushi menu a drink menu and a sinner special menu
The meat and the seafood were in good size and cooked well so kudos for that
I would go back to try some different dishes but the overall content of the menu seemed quite general to me
I don't know if this place makes Thai food from a different region than most others or what but the menu was not what I expected and the food was not what I expected
which is weird in itself and the main menu had thai food I guess
Since I am from Michigan I was surprised to find Lake Superior Whitefish on the menu
Basically all of their fish is fantastic but I do have to say for such a quality place why do they have farm raised Salmon on the menu
I asked if I was missing the sushi menu because in truth I was disappointed
I had requested crispy both sides fried noodles with chicken and vegetables only the vegetarian version is listed on the menu which was delicious
Anyway their beer selection is good and the food is tasty
As a vegetarian this is one of my least favorite sub places since there are not too many toppings for those of us avoiding the meat selections
They have a simple selection of good quality foods
There is a great variety including plenty of seafood dishes
The steaks the shrimp fajitas the chinese selections the artisan cheeses the pizza & pasta the fish & chips the salads the smoked salmon the soups and even the sugar free cheesecake are all very good
A little different than the typical buffet the food is served in smaller portions on the buffet
Best of all despite its high brow menu I found the restaurant very friendly and casual - not pretentious or uncomfortable for us French food newbies - even on such a special night
We ordered a variety of dishes from Salmon to Salad to Pasta
I hate to sound like a foodie asshat but the menu at Cowboy Ciao is truly inventive
I was surprised by the variety of meats that one can get on the tacos
El Rancho has a variety of pre-marinated meat at great prices
The Long Islands are awesome and even their food menu has something to offer
There was nothing on the menu that stood out to me and nothing on the menu that seemed special so i ended up getting the chicken fried steak with hash browns and over easy eggs
If you want exotic foods Lee Lee has bigger and better choices
And nice selection of food offerings as well which is somewhat unusual for a place like this
The place is clean has great selection of food and drink and the service has always been more than adequate
First They use all organic beefy goodness and don't skimp when it comes to portions
It's a choice for Chinese food considering the plethora of Vietnamese offerings at the Mekong place across the street
00 and the portions are small 3 pieces to a plate so you're not stuck with 8 pieces when you order one roll
Great overall selection including smoothies burritos salads pizzas wraps and of course a kids menu
The server was very knowledgeable about the food  at times I felt I was listening to the chef or critics on the food network
The food - there's pretty much nothing bad on the menu here
Pizzas are good size & enough for two if you're not starving
75 topped with my choices of spicy peppers of course and root beer onions nestled in a chewy french roll just plain rocked
Pro'sPizza had a great bubbly crustIngredients were freshService was goodGreat wine selection tons of affordable botles Con'sThe menu has no pizza suggestions margarita meat lover whatever just cheese and then you choose your toppings and pay for each
Menu was simple choices of the usual Baja mexican food with emphasis on their special a-la-carte tacos which ranges from $5-$10 each definitely on the pricy side for just one taco
I am no Genuine Indian food expert but your average USA Indian restaurant will have the same menu as every other one no matter what city or state you're in
A lunch time menu had a good selection of food for about $4
but i give them stars for serving food past 10 when everywhere else in universe was closing at 9 or 10 the Ho Ho across the street and my first choice had a weird private party going on which is how we got stuck with the new yorker
After looking over the menu I ordered the following for us to try bean & cheese burrito chicken pollo fundido beef fajita combo plate & a cheese quesadilla w/a side of sour cream
Both my Husband and I ordered a soup for appetizer he liked his minestrone I ordered the other choice described as egg drop chicken soup with spinach and parmigana
The slices were good size but smaller than typical New York pizza with a thicker and softer crust
We've just discovered two new awesome dishes at Szechwan Palace -  the cumin covered lamb riblets on the Chinese menu as well as the Water Boiled Fish Filets on the regular menu
You have choice of meat and we chose fish today
They have a wide variety of sauces you get to pick out & add yourself or just eat the meat straight up
The fish tacos were a great choice they were delicious & even though I was really hungry I couldn't finish them
That's a major strike - when you have this few items on the menu just 4 side dishes how can you be out of something like that
Hummus selection is very good and tasty falafel are flavorful but not too oily and entrees are displayed well for what is really a fast food place
The food menu manages to be small yet versatile at once -- more than one token vegetarian option for example -- although I agree with the sentiment about lunch foods for dinner as in no
Portions were small and the quality of food was not what I would expect from an Iron chef
They have a pretty extensive food and wine menu but not overwhelming
Interesting ambitious menu with several different moules preparations a tempting risotto selection and brick oven-fired pizzas
The entire pizza menu looks great though I would like to try it when I'm not on my lunch hour
Among the best items on the menu in my personal opinion are the Seasoned Fries explained to me as 'crack' fries the first time I visited because of how awesome they are bruschetta plates chicken pesto pasta and white sangria
The food was decent big portions and not too bad price-wise
Each of my food fairies aka wait staff have given me different versions of why it left the menu when on my last visit I was told it was a pain to make so they removed it
The pizza's are a pretty good size for one hungry person or to share if you have two not so hungry people
Penny loved the peanut butter treats*They sell a lot of higher end dog foods I have not found at Petsmart*They have a really large selection of doggie outfits*I found a really awesome dog carrying bag for FIVE BUCKS
The signs outside emphasized seafood and so it was a bit disappointing to find out that though there were indeed several seafood items offered the number and variety of seafood dishes were not any more than would be found in a regular super buffet
I was also anticipating a good variety of sushi but again the sushi items were no greater in variety than in a regular buffet and most of them had cream cheese in it - sacrilege for those who like properly made sushi
Don't be afraid to chat up your waiters/waitresses if you have any questions or are a fan of Ethiopian food who doesn't see what you want on the menu
I've eaten here twice the first time the food was interesting and flavorful though I think they sometimes try to be a bit too clever with the menu
I'm wondering what menu they ordered off of because my food wasn't that great
I could've gone for a little more variety and adventure with their signature sushi rolls but I really can't complain
Chili's may not have been my first choice in fine dining on such an occasion but I know it's family-friendly and pretty standard in the food and service it delivers
While I won't say the food is better than Matt's probably the best breakfast I have ever had I prefer Scramble almost every time with no wait and simply amazing choices all over the menu
That is just 2 of the wide variety of pizza options they provide
Arthur the owner was incredibly helpful with information re the new adoption of my pet and he stocks a variety of the better foods in the industry
The menu consists of modern Mexican tapas small[er] plates an interpretation of the street food of Mexico Distrito Federal
Maybe it's just my misunderstanding of fine dining but I thought that really good food was always served in small portionsbecause of the high quality ingredients which in turn are high price ingredients but tasted really really AWESOME
Ken and I shared a 3 meat combo the menu on line says $13
The salad par has lettuce around 6 or 7 dressings great fresh Parmesan cheese a selection of deli meats and more
Food menu not too big but I thought the fish & chips looked appetizing so I ordered those
The pizza salads and dessert are all fantastic they have a pretty good beer selection and the wait at dinner is never more than about an hour
You pick up a menu as you walk in and then place your order up at the counter and a server will bring your food out to you as it's ready
She got the Western Scrambler which was a good amount of food but she said she had better items on the menu
And maybe the chef is Atkins-leaning for while the sushi fish portions were generous the supporting rice was about half a thumb-sized
My favorite thing on the menu is number 81 and the Red Curry Chicken
The chicken bowl was a decent size but the chicken was WAY too salty
The menu constantly changes so you know you'll be getting fresh and seasonal dishes
The Bazookie as describe by the menu is a 1/2 pound of Chocolate Chip dough slightly baked in a 6-inch pizza pan then topped with 3 scoops of vanilla bean ice cream
It's open late every night they have a great beer selection fantastic bands and the food is made by the owner at Gallo Blanco
The variety was good the fish wasn't its freshest fish and who puts mayo on their sushi
I don't mind small portions if the food is really good but this place just didn't have it
The noodle soup dishes come out steaming hot with a heaping helping of flavorful broth the seasoned meat of your choice and veggies
Pizza is terrific and the menu includes a lot of other dishes I am eager to try
They have a few new menu items including a pasta bar with different sauces which were all pretty good my boyfriend especially liked the spicy Alfredo sauce at the fresh seafood bar they will make some delicious shrimp to go with it
However after looking at the menu and discovering an item by the name of pillow chicken that included the phrase pillow shaped morsels how could I resist
The pillow chicken was chicken mixed with onion bamboo shoot and I believe something else and breaded into little pillow sized wonder
The menu was so large that I found several things I'd like to try next time including a whole section of chow fun food
Overall this is an above average Thai place where the selection is very good the food is high quality and you cannot go wrong with anything you order
Although a full menu is available there is no better word to describe the food than
-Vegan Deli items like -Vegan Sheperds Pie Amazing -Vegan Margherita Tofu Lasagna Ridiculously Good -Endless Salad Bar Creations Love the stuffed Grape leaves -Vegan Soups -Vegan Pizzas -Vegan Made to order Sandwiches Love that Olive Spread -Vegan Sushi Avocado Cucumber Rolls better than most restaurants -Beautiful Organic Produce Local Choices too -Organic Almond Milk -Hemp Seeds in Bulk -Mrs
We did not order dessert mainly because their dessert portions are TINY and well I make raw vegan desserts at home myself
Keep in mind this place has a huge menu so don't think there only as good as pizza and wings
The menu is not very exciting just your basic mid-range steak house fare with no real unique or imaginative dishes
We split a choice of 4 bruschetta and a chocolate chip cookie pizza
The steak dishes are understandably the stars of the menu and on Sundays they have a great special for prime rib for $37 in addition to the prime rib you get salad side dish and dessert
Had appetizers the Chicken Lettuce Wraps and they were better than PF Changs and the serving size was generous
The food selection is decent and it seems to be growing
I'd like to emphasize that was a gentle controlled underhand toss
The only major downside was that it took quite a while for our food to come since the drive-through was hopping lots of people getting menudo after a crazy Friday night I'm assuming and there were only 2 chefs and one server who had to take and serve both drive-through and eat-in orders
However the food was definitely decent and the portions really sizable and we felt that it was a great value for our money
Just a big pile of fake meat and a small portion of lukewarm steamed vegetables on the side with no sauce or marinades on them
you just get very basic albeit good German food and a small German alcohol selection
Celebrity chef-owner Aaron May brings the same philosophy to his approachable seasonal menu which features classic Spanish tapas and modern American dishes given a distinctly Spanish accent
The menu is largely steak and fried foods but you get a salad and potatoes with every meal
The service was excellent and the food very good although maybe not the best choice for the night before Thanksgiving
Third great visibility to the coal oven looks like a brick pizza oven on steroidsMenu all grass fed beef definite + Vege burger brown rice and black bean is a must next time
The food is served in an aluminum pie pan and you get your choice of chop sticks or plastic-ware
There is plenty of meat on the menu as well
Portions are large food is really good and authentic and the prices are cheap
One plus on the menu is many items can be made vegetarian by substituting tofu for the meat
This is a normal sized dish not as big as the Thai Fried Rice
Although it's categorized as Pizza I actually find they serve some amazing things besides pizza in which you could leave pizza entirely off the menu so if I may add to the other 80 reviews
They bring you a menu for special order pizzas and on the back you can pick different types of cured meats and different cheeses to create your own sampler
Their food portions are rather large so we split our meals
Ambiance excellent food a great selection of fine liquor
Off the appetizer list I have tried- the Guaca-Tony = fresh guac and pizza bread with WAY too much parm on them also expect a 20 min wait- the calamari = actually pretty decent reminds me of mozzarella sticks though- the garlic bread = wish the bread didn't come out of a plastic bag- sweet potato fries = ok- waffle fries = okSandwiches- italian sausage sandwich = spicy sausage buy the jr size since the full size is too much cheese looks fake and is not good if you have to reheat it the next day- meatball sandwich = standard no wow factorPizza = if you have about 90 minutes to wait the pizza is pretty good
The chicken wasn't bite size more like two inch shredded strips and some ends were very tough
The resturaunts on site were pretty good BOURBON STEAK- was really good even for me who doesn't eat meat there were a lot of choices the sides are great the mac and cheese yum
It was right off the special menu and very tasty but not an eye roller
Tonight was an open house and food tasting of the new menu at Nobou at the Teeter house
The restaurant has a good variety of popular dishes from different Asian cuisines
I've listed the Meat and Bean burro enchilada style as my last meal on earth
You don't get a choice of bread and I didn't think I'd finish the huge fluffy yellow-hued slice but it was sweet and fluffy and hard to resist especially in light of the rest of the food on the plate
I didn't have any sushi since I wanted to try other things and I'm glad I made that choice
The sandwiches are really big and reasonably priced for the size easily enough for 2 people to share especially if you save room for dessert which you definitely should do
Unlike Sam's Club Whole Foods gives samples that actually taste delicious and almost make you grab for seconds when instead you just grab an actual wrapped portion of the product darn had to buy some sometime
The pizza here is pretty decent but my favorite item on the menu is the Waldorf Chicken salad with the dijon balsamic dressing
Although they are known for their pizza I have to say that there are many better things on the menu
The vegetarian pizza that I ordered  was medium sized and a very good value with a variety of fresh toppings
The eggplant was diced to the perfect size and gave the veggie pizza a meaty texture
Sure its a bit pricey at $50 per person but considering the quality of the meat is top notch and the huge all you can eat selection it's well worth it every once in a while
A couple of people ordered some food and I told the waitress that I was still looking at the menu and that I'd order when she came back
But at this point the two waiters on got slammed and I counted our waiter running around with at least seven tables   some were outside on the patio  He had help but wasn't able to ask us how are meals were  although they were great  We wanted to order dessert since the meals were very good and Grant did make the trip to clear our plates and give dessert menus
I think the menu is slightly dated and the dessert we tried was good but is not on the level of the really great meals
The menu has a nice variety of rolls that stray from the traditional raw the sushi lover would typically seek
While they do offer  a mundane Margarita pizza on the menu here that is not the thing to try
Similar look bake goods on display on the way in muffins instead of pies and a couple of items on menu same as Coco's Sam Adams Beer Batter Fish n Chips
They have a decent selection of fish - I get ahi tuna steaks here and they're quite good
The menu is pretty standard Mexican food items
Ever since I've left the area I've been searching for a restaurant that will satisfy my cravings for savory Asian food like Salt & Pepper Shrimp Shrimp with Honey Glazed Walnuts Special Chicken/Shrimp Sizzling Rice soup Hot and Sour Soup Spicy Pork General Yang's Chicken Chow Mein Lemon Chicken Orange Beef Crab Puffs House fried rice and the list goes on and on
The food was very good with a ecletic variety and a tasting menu choice
The meat selection for the main course is huge and all the seasonings were great and it was easy to cook your own meat remember to have a cell phone with a timer on it to make this easier
We both ordered the RW menu - I had the caesar salad parmesan crusted chicken and the chocolate cake with caramel ice cream
You get two nice sized chicken breasts I could only eat 3/4 of one because they were so large
That translates to over-cooked DRY chewy beef  The good news is that they don't use Pink Slime boy am I relieved after reading that on their menu
Now to the food The menu and the prices associated gave me a bad feeling right quick
I am too used to excellent sushi at fair prices as well as happy hour menus with all the favorites
The Fuji sushi roll was the best of the sushi selection we tried
The menu looks really great and I look forward to trying new dishes here
The core menu items that will usually make it to the dance are Foie Gras Escargot Elemental Soup Duck Breast Filet Mignon and Seafood
There also weren't different sizes for the dish so I guessed correctly as it turns out that they only had a small size
I also noticed that their menu was extremely limited - there were almost more varieties of spring roll which I HATE than pretty much any other food category
The menu is what you'd expect - Shepard's Pie Bangers and Mash and Fish and Chips
The food was good enough that I won't write it off my list but I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't welcome my kind any more haha
Almost as if it had no vibe but I'd heard great things about the food and beverage selection and the hostess gave me props on my Pliny the Elder shirt hopefully she wasn't making fun of me so I was anxious to see what else was in store
The reason that I am updating is that they expanded the kitchen remodeled tripled the size of their menu and now include Vietnamese favorites like pho bun and broken rice dishes in addition to the excellent bahn mi sandwiches and the best boba drinks in town
Since I already checked out the menus online I was ready with the first of many questions regarding my numerous food allergies to ask my server as soon as he walked up to my table- Yes I'll have iced water please
and with all of that data i pretty much had most of the menu items crossed off sandwiches/burgers that contained buns and sauces entrees that used sauces award-winning ribs entrees adorned with sauces  marinated meats etc
The type of atmosphere they are aiming for the prices and selections of food remind me a lot of a BJ's Restaurant
The portions are generous but unfortunately the food I had didn't really impress me
DESSERTThey have a wide variety of entrees but unfortunately only have 3 sweet options
The menu is simple from pastas pizzas burgers salads
These dishes were there however the sushi was very good for a buffet and had a decent selection
I have tried a selection from each of the menu sections and I have always enjoyed my food at the Elephant Bar
I found Terminal 2 to be the smallest and 4 had the largest number of food choices Einstein Bagels Chili's Paradise Bakery / Grill Oaxaca Coldstone Creamery and Starbucks to name a few
The food is good but from what I've seen the menu doesn't really exist
Chicken fried steak - ok came w/ hearty portion of mashed red potatoes and snap peas
The meat selection is amazing for the price huge selection of Ribeyes
Finally the combination plate I ordered had asparagus chicken enchiladas in green chile sauce and a single portion of eggs benedict
I've had a few things on the menu the breakfast skillet tandoori chicken pizza wings and the salmon plate
Similar to the decor the menu boasts a variety of comfort food with a modern twist
AND the food was excellent the wine selections were great too
The biggest problems are slots set to pay around 70% exception poker and keno slots pay much better as they do everywhere; smoke problem has improved but is still very bad; food choices mediocre at best; not always clean
They also have a variety of grilled chicken sandwiches and the like
It's a great way to familiarize yourself with the food and wine menu and it's only $40 a person
Taste  The food is hit or miss here and I am not talking about comparing menu item to menu item
The Yelp Eats menu is a perfect combination of every food group
Our server expertly described all of the dishes on the anniversary menu and highly suggested the sommelier pairings
I was really impressed with the decor atmosphere wine list beer selection food and most of all their acts to accommodate children
There was a nice variety of food on the menu
Good portions fresh food great service and comfortable atmosphere
This is a nice market that is clean and has a wide variety of Asian foods condiments and snacks
When I found out from a friend who works here that the same chef who created the city hall menu is the executive chef at ocean club I knew getting a steak to compliment my fish was the right choice
Since I had a disappointing portion of fish I nabbed half of my husband's popusa and it was gooey and yummy but oh so greasy
but I don't recommend the fish just for it's over-salted flavor and misleading portion size
But based on the other food we saw there and the other food at our table I apparently just managed to pick the most underwhelming thing on the menu as everything else looked incredible
The chicken enchilada was generous with the chicken portion but pretty forgettable
All the food we had was delicious and they had some nice choices
00 had a Great Selection of Asian foods my fave was the Mussels in shell covered with cream cheese couldn't get enought of them the sushi was very fresh also the shrimp tempura and orange chicken were just ok
But again mentioning portions that was the biggest chicken fried steak that I've ever had
The seafood tower must change in selection of seafood which is good which is also why mine last night was so fresh fresh delicious
The menu provided decent selections which ranged from some interesting dishes to your classic steakhouse fare
They carry a wide variety of specialty foods so we enjoy looking around
We were also quite impressed by the sushi bar and the selection of pre-packaged sushi
In the style of  Bret Easton EllisTook a walk down a flight of stairs landed in downtown Phoenix strolled into its center into the Public Market
Their menu consists of pizza salads and sandwiches made on fine Italian bread with some awesome Italian meats and cheeses and fresh local ingredients
The food is very delicious I have tried most everything on the menu and have yet to find anything that I dislike
homemade not the typical Kronos Meat Cone variety
I believe the meat selections are the same white and dark meat chicken pork beef fish in the evening but I like the selection of veggies here which includes water chestnut and baby corn
I'd like to go back and try one of their fish options in the future since they had a good selection of mix-and-match fish and prep styles that sounded really fun
I can personally recommend the Top 2 on the menu The Company Combo and the Chicken Pesto; so different that we split our 24 between the 2 as well as the BBQ and The Popeye
They even have a selection of GF desserts
My second choice entree- chicken caprese- was super bland but cooked well
A lot of great options on the menu especially the seafood centered appetizers
The portions are small but this way you get to try alot of different rolls and types of sushi instead of filling up on one or two rolls  which is what I think what they wanted
Good friendly service an interesting and appealing menu and great tasting food
I find myself choosing from their Mini Meal menu for under $6 I can get a scoop of mac salad a scoop of rice and a choice of their chicken options bbq is a favorite or their pulled pork which I have yet to try over steamed cabbage
For the styling and food quality Corbins is a solid choice
I broke my own rule and ordered a pizza without a red sauce because it was the other reccomended dish off my restaurant list
Great staff great food and I love all the variety of sodas
The menu is vast the food is good and the service is always up to par
The one in the pic on the menu looked like the perfect mix to wash down bad service and even badder yes i said it food
I love how every category of the menu has some form of buffalo chicken
Of course there are lots of other salads sandwiches wraps and dishes on the menu but they had me at buffalo chicken
So I ask for the the full size ortega beef omelet 6 eggs hash browns biscuits and gravy
I love huge portions bustling waitresses that call you honey and hearty soul food meals that are full of carbohydrates but this place was just way too greasy
The seafood combinations are small portions and just OK
If I had to base my rating solely on the menu and the food I would probably give Orange Table four stars
Besides it's much more economical than ordering an entree *glares at real food menu and spitefully licks chocolate pudding covered spoon*
I'm a fan of the huge size-of-your-face pizza slice persuasion so I've never gone that route at Green
They serve bento boxes basically a lunch box with rice your choice of entree salad and slices of oranges--a healthy dessert
I went on a Sunday Simple Supper night which for those of you not in the know is something they do on Sundays where there is a set menu of appetizer entree and dessert with a couple of options on the entree
You get less meat than subway less vegetables in fact you don't get a choice I guess and the bread tasted like it was a couple of days old and not fresh
The waitress gave me options with the rice and the side dish and I opted with the rice mixed with the beans and sweet plantains as my side--this ended up being great choices
Although the food is decent this place has never been my first choice for Mexican cuisine
They have a variety of veg & non-veg dishes along with the  Bread Naan & Basmati Rice
I've tried the Pablo Picasso salad a large lovely salad with tortilla strips spicy chicken cheese pico de gallo and spicy dressing available in a smaller size
A wide selection of choice meats smoked on site delicious sides home-made root beer and lemonade and a yard for the kids to play in make you feel like it's Sunday at Grandma's house
We rolled up at 9p per the Yelp listing happy hour times
I love a large menu that serves food till 1230 AM 7 days a week
Green has such a wide variety of dishes and flavors that people are sure to find something they like
Since I am not a huge fan of gourmet pizza and the overabundance of toppings I checked the menu for a nice plate of delicious pasta
I love their Pizza Blanca which is made with Olive oil crushed garlic ricotta mozzarella with your choice of spinach or Roma tomatoes
She was extremely knowledgeable about all of the dishes on the menu and went so far as to open a dialogue with the chef when a member of our party needed a vegetarian lactose free meal who could that possibly be
Literally this is a piece of meat that has been flattened to the size of the bun
The food menu is kind of expensive for what it is
Great sushi rolls on there happy hour menu and also great drink specials
If you need food spicy you will need to order something from the menu
We didn't realize that America's was going to be more like appetizer sized food that comes out in entree time
Like others have said the portions are small like tapas should be but the prices aren't calibrated to the size of the dishes
com/food-wine/flavors-of-the-west/bringing-bison-back-00400000019838/Try adding it to your menu
Choices were sushi Johnny Rocket Cold Stone and some other places
Compared to Postino's it has much more seating way more food selections and just a little cheaper
There were so many gorgeous young girls in stilettos and spandex dresses that were two sizes too small; I'm not sure how my husband was able to concentrate on his food
I was surprised that many of the meat selections were dry
Their menu is very basic  main dishes side dishes & desserts
Dhal channa chicken curry aloo gobhi chicken tikka masala out when I was at the buffet but they filled it up pretty quick after meat and pea samosas potato pakoras and a giant laundry-basket-sized rice cooker to scoop from
Maybe not for a while but still - Indian Paradise rocketed to #1 on my Indian restaurant list after the first mouthful and I'm pretty sure the same will be the case for any Indian food aficionado that tries it
I met some friends here for lunch the menu is a weird mosh of Italian Mexican and American food
Also the food is great here and very filling all portions are just huge
They have a great menu with a variety of typical Asian dishes some deliciously unique cooked fish options and even a wonderful hamburger with some exceptionally yummy mix of regular and sweet potato fires
The menu carries a good variety and the food is awesome
The happy hour menu is inexpensive and innovative try out the Asian nachos the sushi has been fresh on every visit and some of the combos on the top-secret underground menu ok maybe not so secret any more compare to some of the best sushi I've had on the coast
We settled on devil's food cake and white almond infusion and according to our guests we made the right choice
Chef's Selection bread pudding too much dessert after such a hearty if uninspired meal
Our first courses consisted of mozzarella fresh fruit selections and bruschetta beef carpaccio appetizer meats calamari - all of which were spectacular and what I expected from this taste
We ordered some veggie spring rolls to share and after looking over the menu can you believe all I ended up ordering was Pad Thai
From the biggest veggie spring rolls I have ever seen to the massive portion of Pad Thai
I do however wish they added something meatless to the spicy section of the menu
I was hoping for a bigger selection of food but it looked like biscotti from Costco was it for me
So excited to write this review- classy fun modern restaurant with 5 star service a creative menu and the food is oh-so good
Start to finish- five star resort service and food and I would know that's what I grew up dining on-So to start- beautiful decor huge wine selection higher end price wise but not bad at all for the quality and the menu
-Others in my group hadThe Kobe burger- the prix fixe menu with the filet the wedge salad the featured pasta dish and the soup of the day which was a braised beef stew pineapple bread pudding the sorbet over pound cake the peanut butter cup- All of which everyone thoroughly enjoyed
They have a lunch menu which comes with an egg roll soup or soda and rice for just $4
Mike is fantastic tending bar while Chad has an encyclopedic knowledge of every single food special beer wine and cocktail on the menu and both bring a passion to their craft you may not be used to seeing
I without fail found the spiciest dish on the menu; the Chicken Diablo and had it burrito-ified
The carne asada tacos portion of meat inside was small and the portions of guacamolecabbage and onions outweighed the 10 miniscule pieces of meat inside
She went inside to grab menus I grabbed a very comfy seat on the patio and within moments we were greeted by a sweet server who saw my puppy and went in to grab him a dog dish of water
The food is fresh flavorful and served in generous portions
The other dishes on the menu while tasty are a little on the expensive side for me $10-$12 and not in portions large enough to justify spending that much
It was busy but we got menus within 30 seconds and our food arrived less than 5 minutes after we ordered it
72 with a generous selection of one-dish meals at a flat five bucks
Listed by Get Out Mag as a hip noodle house formally called sN Asian Kitchen Asia is said to have a cool black/white/red decor motif with a sushi bar
Redeeming traits*HUGE wine list almost too big; it's hard to decide*Full bar with beer selections including a couple Asian favorites*Sake choices for cheap*Big Buddha Roll that's one of the best rolls I've had - anywhere*Live music - sure beats pop music blasting overhead*Clean bathroom with a vibrant green scheme - with several men's magazines to flip through Weird eh
It came bare nothing but meat but the portion was huge
From 3 - 7 they offer 1/2 off a small menu of appetizers sushi rolls pizzas and drinks
If you enjoy a little bit of heat their sizzling shrimp dish which is not on the menu delivers with a kick
every time that guacamole is listed they put meatless by it
Go on a day off order a cup of incredible coffee buy something sweet while you're waiting for your dish brought to you and enjoy the variety of people who come and go elderly with walkers joggers still in their shorts small families college students with laptops people and their dogs etc
I enjoyed the food but the surly slow service coupled with the expensive menu items make this spot a poor value in spite of the lovely old house and charming patio in which the restaurant is situated
All of the dishes were of generous portions and extremely flavorful
It's a pretty nice menu for vegetarians; each section apps salads sandwiches entrees has a few meatless meals
They say on their menu that they use cage free eggs organic  local  when in season sustainable foods in season produce
The portions a huge but who cares if the food isnt good
Even though you may think that you need to go into Pizzeria Bianco with an empty stomach so you can have as much pizza as possible it would be a mistake to not try some of the amazingly fresh and tasty things off the Bar Bianco menu
Their lunch variety is extensive; I chose the chicken curry
I'm looking forward to trying the Mongolian beef next time and plenty of other Asian dishes that filled up their menu
The food was pretty good I would not go back to order the Margharita pizza again but I'll definitely go back to check out the rest of the menu
i give it 4 stars because the food was good enough that I'll definitely go back to taste the rest of that good sized menu but not 5 because it wasn't upto par with other pizza ive had around the area
Also there was no crab meat in them like the menu had indicated
The food was actually very good and the portions were generous
If you're a fan of sliced beef and breaded pork then order the above selections or find your favorite Korean dish
For example the louisiana po'boy used to includechicken breast shrimp andouille sausage with a choice of red beans and rice or gumbo
So far I've tried the followingGoat Cheese Appetizer - Generous portion size with fresh herbs and sauceMeatballs - Another huge portion size with lot's of flavorVeggie Flatbread - A vegan dish you won't miss the cheese on this oneMarket Vegetable - This was broccoli with a lemon aioli and bread crumbs I normally don't like broccoli but devoured this one
We had fantastic service I loved the proprietary wine selection the pinot noir was especially good and the food was delicious
So my expectations weren't very high for the food at OHSO-new restaurants often need some time to get it right if they do at all and considering the beer selection how much more greatness can you really expect
The food is good and the selection of organic and specialty items is nice
The food was unbelievable the choice of wine which we left up to you was perfect and the atmosphere was both warm and comforting
The sushi is basic but fresh as is the selection of sashimi
Our bill was $55 for three sandwiches and one beer which wasn't too bad considering the quality of the food and the portion size
The aesthetics of the place are spot on the food is exceptional with a wide variety to select from o nthe extensive menu
They seem to change their menu regularly so by the time you visit they may have none of the dishes that we had
Again both dishes were delicious and the portion size of the chicken was more than my wife could finish so we left with an extra meal in hand
Very generous portions from their entrees their burritos are almost as big as my forearm to their kids meals the rolled chicken tacos are fantastic and very filling
They are very tasty and have a variety of choices such as Pork Beef and Dumplings
I love New Mexican as in the state food and understand the addition of broader American and Mexican options in the menu
The menu is large but it is well organized and you can find something for just about anyone here whether you're looking for Vietnamese or more of a Chinese style dish they'll have something to fit your taste
We have a 9 year old who hasn't yet developed an adventurous palate but he loves the burger and the chicken strips so we can take him there and be free to enjoy some of their interesting and unusual sandwiches and  fantastic salads although they recently took our favorite off the menu
But in my humble opinion the style and food selections are 2 times better
The prices have gone up with their menu changes but we're willing to pay for the organic meats etc
-Good kim chi sold by the restaurant/fresh foods stand just inside the store in what would usually be a deli section-Decent foreign beer selection especially Russian beers
The sex and the city 2 promotional rolls the carrie and the miranda and we also had sashimi from the low cal menu
We didn't care for one of the orders from the low cal menu though it tasted like grape jelly with fish yuck
This is one of my regular Vietnamese spots for two things and they arefried rice not on the menu& chicken curry noodle soupTheir fried rice is OH SO GOOD and greasy reminds me of Chinatown fried rice in the Philippines and in Malaysia the ones you get from the hawker stand
It gets pretty packed in the evening but during the day I say sit at the bar and have a Vegas Roll my favorite item on the menu
I was also pleased to see that there is a limited menu from sister restaurant Zen 32 Sushi - sashimi combo salmon tuna and yellowtail california roll vegetarian roll and edamame
I could only take a few bites the meat was tough the sauce was unpleasant and the lack of salad type variety made it like eating a bowl of chili but not as good
They have creative and well-executed preparations of the standard fish chicken meat stuff but I'd love to see some more adventurous game and fowl selections
A delicious quick fix when I'm hungry and they have quite variety of pizza
Living in Scottsdale there are endless choices of where to get food from
I'd rather go to Thai House which is further away to get Thai food - their portions are well worth the money there
It's obvious that the chef is more from the yucatan region of Mexico as the indigenous dishes from that region show up strong on the menu and it would be my guess the best ones
PROS Reasonable pricesComfortable atmosphereFamily owned local businessCONS Too much sauceCrust is just okayTook longer than expected to get our foodBOTTOM LINEI'd eat at Nello's again if I were in the area but there are certainly better choices for pizza in the Valley
by default; we had to stop in because we were both starved and the menu offered Corned Beef and cabbage plus we still had about 6 streets to go
Food that tops the list for us are the fontina burger the pulled pork sandwich the fresh beet salad and all of the grilled pizzas the veggie pizza is so fresh tasting
I was so disappointed in the food BUT am excited to go back for lunch sometime and try something off of their sandwich excuse me Nocawich menu
Every time I go I manage to find something good to eat as there are endless choices of food to eat and its all pretty good
Again food was decent but the manager's reaction sealed the deal on my choice to return
Wandering back to the butcher shop I found a decent selection of fish
We ordered the chefs choice $80 platter of sashimi then about the same amount in rolls
Prices are great the portions are abundant and the food is tasty
Prices are definitely on the cheaper side and they have some new-ish options of making your salad a 'Junior' size for a few bucks less and it's STILL a ton of food
Sometimes nicer places have really small portions and seem to pay more attention to how pretty the dish is instead of how good it is but this place was spot on with both presentation and taste
We split the dogfish and carne asada tacos along with a mahi burrito and were too stuffed to make our way any farther down the menu guaranteeing we'll be back for more
Order each dish as it is listed on the menu and you won't be disappointed
Since the menu was fixed but I wasn't crazy about the desserts offered I asked if I could make a change and he let me-had the Warm Chocolate Cake and it was AMAZING
Server was incredibly knowledgeable not only about the menu but also the origins of the food and cooking methods
This restaurant actual serves food equal to one portion not three like you see at most restaurants
But we heard that Smashburger has a variety of interesting fried foods and decided to try it out
menu is a bit flooded with vegetarian and vegan foods however some dishes do include meat
Wide variety of sodas and beer as well as the usual soda fountains and fast food to go
We liked the comfort food aspect to the menu
Even though we'd already eaten I always like to look at menus to see if it's a place worth coming to for food
Their menu looked excellent with some very unique takes on typical bar food
Food is outrageously expensive small portions no seasoning
We went for dinner and had steak-nice selection of food on the menuand a good selection of sidesbut the steaks were just ok
On the pricier side for sushi and the portions are definitely small so do not come starving
In my plate lunch I got two large pieces of chicken two scoops of rice and an oversized scoop of mac salad
Dick's and the related restaurant Richardson's are excellent - probably the best New Mexican food I've had outside of New Mexico of course - they are always tops on my list when choosing a restaurant
The smoked chicken salad was formulaic  a portion of greens a portion of chicken a portion of nuts etc
The Food Charleen's creative local-focused uber fresh cuisine features a short menu that is anything but on flavor
Huge variety- soups salads entrees desserts3
I was happy to see the Hillstone menu is pretty much the exact same as the Houston's menu except they now have sushi
I then ventured on to their shrimp rolls and lunch portion salads with just the right amount for lunch with friends
True food offers a variety of healthy delicious choices
The menu SOUNDS a lot better than it actually is - and we found out why from a conversation overheard with a server and customer at another table The food for the restaurant is all purchased at Costco
Another selection that sounded good until the plate arrived is the Malibu Chicken sandwich Your standard Tyson chicken breast on a roll with a slice of Oscar Mayer ham and some rubberish cheese
Please let someone renovate this place - it could be a real gem with a good menu solid food sourcing and a staff that cares more
5-ish star review because for AZ and the price this sushi menu is pretty decent
I called ahead to ask if they would work with food allergies they assured me they did and told me I could even read the menu on line and work every thing out in advance
Menu options that will satisfy many food preferences including vegetarian and gluten-free
It has a nice variety of menu items ranging from raw foods macrobiotic low-cal and high-energy options
The flip side to the food was the portion to price ratio
However if you're looking for a broad variety of good Thai food cooked to your liking at a very reasonable price come on in and pull up one of the leatherette bar stools
All are made with your choice of chicken beef pork or tofu so carnivores and vegetarians both have a range of options
Again each comes with your choice of meat or tofu
The chef's special menu has some delightful options as well including 3-Curry Salmon just as described and Ultimate Asparagus asparagus stir-fried with shrimp chicken onions bell peppers mushrooms and scallions in a brown garlic sauce
This place is quaint and friendly with a great variety of drinks and interesting appetizers both meat and vegetarian
So three stars - pros great happy hour menu happy hour goes till 8 till 9 until Sept 30th good food
The staff is wonderful great selection of drinks but the food is just
Came for the Happy Hour menu 5-7pm and although the place was packed we were seated immediately at the sushi bar
And I was overwhelmed at the sheer selection of food on the menu and the flat-panel displays flashing clips of video pictures of food and offering me fresh ice cream shakes or fried green beans which I didnt get but will next time
The food menu looks good and the chef assured me that the soup was made fresh every day
Good selection of sushi joints and I'm a sucker for a clean Walmart central phx ones are scary as shit
There were 3 skewers and the morsel of chicken on each amounted to little more than 2 good sized bites
I was a little worried about the menu at first but the great staff broke everything down and showed that the food is the star of the show and not the menu
I was very excited to see new and exciting ingredients on a scottsdale menu and have become a fan of the relaxed culture of the restaurant and the food being served
Everything about the restaurant is fresh exciting and new to me and I can't wait to go back and try some of the other inspired dishes on the menu
The portions are really big so I would suggest automatically getting a to-go box and putting half of your food away so you can have room for dessert Yum Yum
They have a good menu selection of typical Arizona mexican food
The meat isn't your typical Hormel variety of deli meat; it was obvious that this came from a real piece of pork not from a vacuum-sealed pack from the grocery store
The creative dishes on the menu make Cowboy Ciao a staple on my brother's culinary roster when he's in Phoenix and I look forward to seeing how the restaurant's menu evolves as trends in the restaurant world change
Pretty good food somewhat smaller portions probably what we should be eating
The Happy Hour menu was not as extensive and the food wasn't all that great
We noticed the cheese selections on the dessert menu and they looked good
I realized I broke a self-imposed rule with my previous review of this place I sampled and thoroughly enjoyed a pasta dish and then added this place to my Pizza list
We also ordered dessert which I think were share sized
I felt it to be the perfect summer dessert as opposed to the more traditional Italian chocolate- or espresso-based desserts filling out the dessert menu
While Whole Foods probably has a wider selection no one has a BETTER selection and passion+knowledge of cheese
I'm not rich so shopping at a place like Whole Foods with such a huge selection and an even huger price tag isn't going to happen
I really want to come back and indulge in some heavier menu items  like the stuffed pizza pizza cookie etc
The presentation of the food at Yuphas is really beautiful and the portions are notably large as well
I am on the upward mailing list so i received a free b-day dessert and i got a triple scoop of Vietnamese coffee
I imagine the black menu is tastier but it's ridiculous to have two menus with food of completely different quality levels rather than levels of authenticity
We were too full for dessert or milkshakes so that is on the to-do list next visit
Next time I look forward to tackling their delicious sounding dessert menu they have creme anglaise
Here is everything my friend got for $180 plus free bag of treats- dog crate75 pound dog- new toys- huge bones/rawhide- the long stick thing that throws the balls for you i dont know the name lol- economy size shampoo- economy pack of beggin strips- breath freshener- brush and comb- 6ft leash-food and water bowl they only get four stars bc the hours are super difficult we had to schedule time off work to go they close at 4 and aren't open on weekends and because the prices aren't listed on anything so you have to constantly flip through this huge catalog to find prices
The portions weren't too big with the swordfish being the largest portion
Now that being said the food is always great and across multiple dishes on the menu
The menu has smoothies breakfast wraps with egg whites- my favorite is the All shook up which is a combo of chicken rice broccoli etc
Their cheese selections blows any main competitor away as well as their prepared food
oh i get it when asking what this is on the menu the server can seize the moment to sell the dish to my awaiting tastebuds
The new layout gives the orange chicken double billing as opposed to being equal in chafing dish size in the older arrangement
a variety of snacks are offered such as chips candy the atypical movie junk food varities
In fact I had to order a veg dish off the menu because they didn't have any dim sum veg dishes and it cost $13
The bf LOVED the jerk chicken and if he likes your food I'll def give the menu another shot
I've been here several times over the years and pretty much everything to be said has been said on other's Yelp reviews but here is my overview1 - all the food is great portions good and priced decently2 - make a reservation - the place gets busy3 - the place is loud as heck
They also have a back house where they tend to serve food during events perfectly sized and placed
The setup is pretty much identical starting with the meat choice of beef pork chicken and turkey and I think there was a fish choice
I'd come back probably reasonably often but only if they added some more vegetables - I'm not a fan of spinach or broccoli or some of their other choices so I really need those tomatoes and peppers to add some color to the dish
But next time I want to know which dessert on your lengthy tantalizing list of sweet endings makes your tongue dance and belly whoop in appreciation
5 stars - the service was fast but our server sounded like he was reading off of a script in his head and didn't really understand the food or wine menus
Dumplings the size of a fat plum full of meat
BBQ chicken in the wrap in its listed name on the menu was nothing like I'd imagine to be like the traditional Taiwanese street food
It was packed and we were constantly passing unleashed dogs unicyclists large families leisurely strolling etc
The food is exceptional the wine list is out of this world and the dress is casual
the restaurant is tacky the chopsticks and condiment dishes are grimy and the smell of the menu is weird yeah take a whiff if you ever eat there
i buy fly-tying materials for my fly fishing adventures here and the selection is pretty good
Perfect for a personal size Pizza Hut pizza delicious and plenty of seating once again at least at my gates and the time I was there and everything went smoothly and friendly
I ordered sushi from the place mat menu and since it doesn't list prices I thought it would be more reasonable than $12
We were downtown and looking for an uncommon dining experience and on the car ride we were taking about crab beef wedge salads so Durant's seemed like a natural and obvious choice
The menu is a little limited but there is a good selection of appetizers salads sandwiches as well as some steak chicken and pasta entrees
They offered to convert nearly any dish on their menu into a vegan alternative and it was delicious
You get chicken rice salad & a few orange wedges - perfect portion for lunch and it's almost cheaper than bringing your own lunch to work
They have other items on their lunch menu which includes some sushi pork and of couse some more chicken variations
Being adventurous I decided to try out one of the many veggie menu items and went with the Chicken Basil and Pesto Pasty
lunch as it was meant to beThe Long Trail is a softball size wad of house roast beef shaved super thin and served on 9 grain bread in my case
But watching him deal with people who are overwhelmed by the menu in the middle of the lunch rush would be worth the price of admission even if the food wasn't so good
I've had many dishes on the menu and you seriously can't go wrong
I tried the old staple of chicken parmesan as it seemed a popular choice and I will never go there again
And lets be honest - this dish is nothing less than food porn the likes of which I used to fantasize about as a collegiate stoner
The menu looked promising for American style food
Francis experience includes great atmosphere an extensive drink menu and wonderful food options
THE GOOD aka the foodIf you've been to another Roku or even a Nobu the menu will look familiar as will the prices
The sushi selection was pretty deep with a good specials list and lots of options
The menu is a medley of foods from the East Asian bloc - think Thai Japanese Malaysian Chinese and more
There is a seperate meny for sushi and the choices are unlimited
I sampled some sushi tried one of the soups and ordered a noodle dish with chicken and shrimp and I was extremely satisfied with my choice
We started our meal with the small portion of Tom Ka with chicken and it was amazing
In true MB style we decided to order half the menu to be sure we're fairly judging the food
We ordered mu shu pork chicken chow fun mongolian beef shrimp in lobster sauce orange chicken and we got honey wings for free if you order more than 29$ worth of food they give you a free appetizer from a list
I am originally a New Yorker  who grew up with an abundance of ethnic foods and numerous restaurant choices so I am fussy about my Thai  food
We did get a couple items from the HH menu I think we got the Crispy Calamari Tomato Basil Bruschetta and Crispy Chicken
I enjoy the food the portions are large
We ordered several rolls from the HH menu and a kid's bento for the babe's to share
Their food selection was very small however and that was disappointing
Unfortunately because of the inconsistency with the quality of their food as well as the lack in variety of buffet foods I don't think we will be going back anytime soon
Haven't tried the food yet but the menu features a comforting upscale twist on the normal bar fare
So normally I go there to browse in their extensive wine selection and end up leaving with a few bottles of dessert wine
Then to top it all off a huge selection of fresh salsas aguas frescas and lots of quick delicious food options in the restaurant part of the store
The portion size is the traditional street taco but the flavor of the slow cooked beef is where this becomes the must get
Here's the kicker though - with a name like The White Chocolate Grill and the desserts listed at the top of the menu you would expect them to be exceptional
I would like to try their fresh dishes from the menu some day - like the Tandoori chicken
There selections were great as was their food items behind the deli counter
The family that runs Beaver Choice has charmed me with their delicious food and friendly spirits
I can agree with some other reviews and say that the food did take a good amount of time to get served but Beaver Choice has heard that cry and they are trying to work on it Also when I ordered off of the Grab & Go menu I got my sandwich very quickly
Apparently the owners put the chicken version on the menu to appease non-pork eating individuals so the pork is the original for them
He even had a dish made that was not on the menu
Why Cafe Zuzu's brunch deserves all five starsThe menu -  First of all there is one not a buffet with food made who knows when on a mass scale
It's a pretty big brunch menu with items to satisfy kids to entry-level foodies to those annoying health couscious people
They almost made me think there was an ocean near by with the large selection of fresh fish
My visit started off wit their menu which is printed daily and frequently changes great for variety but hard for a reviewer to say try this dish
There is a very wide selection of fresh fish prepared to different global styles
get the duck to start but look the portions are on the small side and the fresh fish starter is skimpy for the price but really good
I sat at the bar for lunch and ordered from the Primi portion of the menu meaning first or appetizers a Beef Carpaccio $9
Humble Pie has a decent selection of fancy pizzas and one pizza is most certainly large enough for two people to share
We ate here on a Monday evening one of the evenings when a raw food menu  as in prepared raw healthy vegetable dishes was available in addition to the regular menu
We were in the mood for the Ethiopian food so we only ordered an appetizer from the raw food menu
Also with two combos we had a bunch left over that we brought back home We'll definitely be returning to try additional dishes and more of the raw menu
The menu merely lists each dish with a price
Our disappearing server came by and dropped the dessert menu on the table and walked off with no mention of even coffee
The dessert menu by the way is a small section on a page inside the drink menu
Shea 14 isn't to popular because it is very outdated and the strip mall it is located in does not offer the food choices of it's counterparts
A very creative menu delicious food and a friendly atmosphere
Even if you aren't a vegan or health foodie this place is worth checking out as the menu is so interesting and creative
When I picked up the menu I think I stared at the menu for a good ten minutes before I finally settled on the chicken tikka masala red curry pastie
There seemed to be a variety of food & drink options available and although there were about 50K people there I didn't feel claustrophobic walking around before/during/after the game
Burgers are awesome crab cake sandwich best in town fish and chips great batter large portion and always crisp crust and juicy meat
They offer a good variety of  soup and noodle dishes as well as a variety of sandwiches banh mi
There are SO many reviews I will just give you a few tidbits that stood out to me- there is no chicken on the menu so if you're going to order a salad forget chicken
their variety is fantastic--sushiI prefer the deep-fried rolls--but be careful it's hit-or-miss with some of the fish in the sushi rolls endless crab legs on Fridays tons of dumplings shumai scallion pancakes rangoons wontons fresh fruit and edamame etc etc
The lunch menu is diverse with plenty of choices ranging from veggie to chicken to beef dishes
Minor complaint I wasn't eating but I think a bigger variety of food vendors would be appreciated
If you are looking for a great Chinese / Mongolian / Sushi buffet this place should be number one on your list
They have a creative brunch menu with traditional breakfast items with a twist lunch items and great-sounding desserts
The beef was good but did not rise to the level of quality at the Grind or DeLux Burger though granted unlike the other two restaurants mentioned this one is not a burger specialist
Drinks    A     Excellent wine knowledge and service technique was                         displayed by the waiter coupled with a good selection                        makes this a great place to enjoy wine Service   A     Good service as explained above *Ramsay Test  Chef Gordon Ramsay says that if you are going to make and serve a simple dish it needs to be executed with perfection
*Estofado de Res Al La Jaudinera Pulled Pork with Vegetables in a Tomato Sauce*Puerco Asado Unbelievably good roasted Pork - tender and juicy with just the right amount of fat for flavor*Yuca Root served in large slices - tender and yummo*Con Gris Black Beans and Rice*Frijol Colorado Red BeansIn addition they had two additional rices menudo pan little rolls - these were the only things that were somewhat generic and a soup but we all thought it was way too hot out to try this one
Pork Brisket Ribs Chicken offered up in a variety of ways
In addition the couple of menu items that are actually more substantial in nature turkey meatloaf pasta and meatballs etc
Sure they bring you out pickles and cucumbers which is awesome in my book but most of the dishes are boring American choices or Jewish cuisine which I don't really crave
We were just there last night - the place was mostly empty so we sat ourselves recieved a menu immediately placed our order within a few minutes and recieved our food within 10-15 minutes
So as I'm trying to make sense of the menus posted in both Spanish and English on the wall above the hot food line or whatever I am greeted by a nice woman that helps me decide where to go
The sides are curved to make a small cup to fill with beans meat of choice topped with shredded lettuce grated cojita cheese I'd describe Mexican parm--hard salty and good
5 stars for creativity in food/taste combinations ambiance excellent musical choices artwork service
the lackluster service and measly topping portions kept me away   Guess I should visit Grazie on off-hours around 4-430p when it's quiet indoors and the pizzaiolo is just happy to prepare a pizza to keep himself busy
Loved the different choices available pizza salads sandwhiches or soups
We didn't have any food but the menu was appetizing and the food that came by for other tables looked pretty good
Having dined at Binkley's before and being taken up by its charming and friendly atmosphere and fun side to its food with flexible menus I chose this restaurant to take on the challenge
The menu is strictly vegetarian but Payton keeps a few meat items available for hard core meaties - like my daughter and I who shared a heavenly fettuccine bolognese
They have a great menu selection and the food is always excellent
After reviewing the menu--which has a good selection of choices--I decide on the panko fish over white rice
Food and service were great - but the creativity and execution of the menu was oustanding
Problem is I never get to try other items on the menu because one dish demands I order it every time
I'm not a fish fan but the group I was with was so as long as there's some non-fish on the menu I'm fine with it
This review is for Terminal 4 the USAirways terminal  There is a nice variety of food and shopping options past security
It's one of those places where the food and drink menu are both sooooooo long that they kitchen and bar probably have a tough time turning out good stuff conssitently
This particular location has a pretty standard size Arizona backyard and really demonstrated how much food and goods you can produce out of a small residential space with a well-thought out system
They have decently sized lunch portions including soup small salad veggie spring roll and choice of brown or white rice
Yakisoba with seafood - portion was huge seafood was perfectly cooked and the dish was tastefully seasoned
Last night I had the awesome opportunity to sample the great portions and wonderful food of the Grand Lux Cafe
The menu was well organized and so was the dessert counter
Two personal size pizzas is plenty for four hungry women
The dessert menu follows suit with the dinner menu adhering to few options including a variety of cheesecakes a cannoli and tiramisu
Service isn't stellar the pizzas are generously sized
We were intrigued by the food menu that they offered and eagerly ordered some fresh oysters $1 each Calamari Blackened Fish Tacos and the burger
I looked at the menu again and noticed that it didn't indicate what kind of fish they were made with so I figured it was maybe my fault for not asking but I just always think of fish tacos as being made with a white fish
The decor was pretty blah and the pizza on the menu I felt was on the expensive side
We both ordered pasta dishes which were good and the portions reasonably sized
It's part grocery store complete with natural foods a great selection of gluten-free food toiletries beauty products as well as supplements
There's a wide variety of very good Asian food so don't hesitate to try Tottie's just about anyone can find something to please their palate
I think they had more appetizers and dessert on their menu than wine
The menu hasn't changed much but the quality of the food and ingredients seem like they have
I ordered the bean curd and my friend got the curry soup and we split one of the summer roll selections
I think the food is generally on point and I'm a fan of their selection of side dishes especially the fish cake and cucumber
At the same time the menu describes the restaurant and it's offerings as Nothing fancy; simply good food that nourishes and rejuvenates the body
I do like the dessert menu they offer as they have $2
I'm hoping that one day they add a limited food menu to the mix
The portions are VERY large so we really could have split one of these dishes between the two of us and been fine but I'm glad we were able to try both of them
Nice fresh rolls perfect remoulade shredded lettuce 2 good sized cornmeal breaded catfish filets fried to perfection and a dollop of black bean salsa
We were disappointed that their famous buttercake wasn't a dessert choice but the profiterole was good and my husband had the chocolate cake
Decent beer selection I like kirin so no biggie and the signature sushi is awesome
The food was flavorful and offered good portion sizes
I've had a good experience with the food and the drinks and I still think it is a cool hip space but I find the service issues so disruptive that the Duce has dropped to my in a pinch can't think of anyplace else to go with a group list which is a bummer because if this issue were corrected it could be a great hangout
Love the food -- terrific thin crust pizza Italian Gold wings honey mustard BBQ and great beer choices
Is their infamous Chicken Fried Everything enough to blow me up into a giant hot air balloon until I go to 'Awesome-Portion-Heaven
After drooling over the menu for a few minutes I decided on the Aiko with a chicken dog
Food wise I've only tried the Turkey and Brie and that was before their menu changed so it might be different now but it was really good
The portions were pretty big and it's funny how prices fluctuate from 8$ the soup to 30$ the fish specials
It didn't have a lot of espresso or alcohol flavor but the portion size was enough to share and the airiness didn't make you feel like you ate an overwhelming dessert
The menu had a good selection of burgers sandwiches and a few entrees pastas chicken shrimp and steak
The pizzas are delicious and the menu is pretty extensive
It has a HUGE variety like a large chain offers but the food is all of the holistic/high end types
The menu is the same as Houston's except for a few sushi rolls
The menu was diverse and included small plates entrees and pizza
The food is good the menu offers just about every variation of everything - chicken pork beef lobster scallops
They've got a large variety of items imported from Korea from household goods cooking utensils snacks sauces instant noodles fresh fruits vegetables seafood and meat
They don't have a children's menu and I am not sure in what dish these chicken strips are used but they were dreadful
Both were very tasty with good selections of chicken
but without a doubt the highlight of the rest of the menu is the spicy salmon dish
The food on the menu was a bit pricier that I had imagined and I was a little disappointed that there wasn't a lunch menu
This is especially so considering the portion sizes which are not as criminal as Fish Market used to be but are still not exactly a feast
The food is reasonably priced and the portions are decent
However when I got my apple chicken sausage Paganini thin choice It was definitely not as big as the pictures made it seem
I ordered the green chile pork which I was advised was the spiciest dish on the menu
It's just such a shame the food is so lackluster and expensive the menu is so pitiful before games the hours are so freakin stupid and there are no happy hour or game day drink specials to get me warmed up for the passion and the pride I need to bring to a game
If there were just a couple of fixes to the factors in that equation preferably the quality of food and the presence of pre-game drink specials it might become my venue of choice before a game
Looked over the menu saw that they had more than pizza on the menu
Turns out we had way too much food; portions are huge
Big TVs decent beer choices edible fried foods nice staff
She mentioned something that should be readily apparent to most foodies which is that the key to providing tasty veggie options is to go with a macrobiotic whole food focus -- this approach de-emphasizes the constraints and instead focuses on building a good meal from quality ingredients
With our appetizer we got 4 full size rolls that were plenty for the two of us to start
I ordered the second pho dish on the list they have two sizes medium and large
Their menu is the only one that I have seen that starts listing the desserts first
Their food is good again not great but they have an interesting menu with some more traditional Irish fare so this is a good alternative to other Irish places that call themselves Irish because they serve Guinness and have Notre Dame banners on the wall much like Outback Steakhouse calls themself Australian because they have Foster's posters and Boomerangs on the wall
I was so glad to see them give props on their menu to some of my favorite local farmers whose produce is featured in many of the dishes
you get the entree listed above 2 cream cheese wontons and an eggroll for a little more than 8 bucks after tax
Italian food is typically not my first choice of cuisine but I had guests in town and they wanted Italian food
We have tried a lot of different pizzas on the menu and have had the Chicken Parmi sandwiches
Five stars for Cornish Pasty -- for being something a little different for having tasty food AND for having about a dozen choices for us vegetarians
Well depending on which menu you get because a lot of their best puerile antics are in the phenomenally stupid act of hiding their food from their customers
The food is schizophrenic in its spastic variety and its minuscule sushi portions and variety and stupid list of in-restaurant rules are pathetic
After visiting approximately 15 or so sushi restaurants in the valley on several occasions I've put Sakana located  in East Mesa on the top of my list
Sashimi is simply raw fish and nigiri is your choice of raw fish over a bed of rice
We ordered the fried sausage ravioli the coconut chicken tenders the chicken lettuce wraps tempura vegetable medley and the chef's sliders all from the appetizer menu
They use natural meats hormone steroid and antibiotic free meats and even have an organic burger on the menu
Their best dishes are usually posted on the walls rather than in either of the 2 printed menu
Items I enjoy *Guaca Tony this is a great but filling appetizer a huge bowl of guacamole with a giant large size pizza crust yum
Although I do still hold up to my previous statement that seating is a bit limited and that there aren't many food choices
The lunch portion is big enough and the dinner portions tend to be a little pricey for bar food
There are no food HH specials which I am sure is attributed to the already low costs for much of the food on the menu
I've never had a bad experience with anything on their menu although I favor the Pesto Chicken and the Chicken Tikka Massala the most
We were quite full and were unable to tackle dessert but the menu looked great
Went to El Pollo Loco with some friends for lunch and saw they have new burritos on the menu so I decided to try the Poblano  it was a good size burrito don't really need a combo meal with it cuz it's a meal in its self it has chicken avocado rice beans corn cilantro onions and cheese with salsa wrapped in a gold wrapping um kinda like Chipotle
It is not on the menu just ask for the firecracker pork but with chicken
The portion was quite generous - Ken kept passing chunks of meat over to me
We all ordered a variation of food from your menu each was well received with compliments to the chef
I can't really tell you how great the entire menu is because the only thing I ever order is spinach rolls with chicken and marinated slaw
Service is good they have a wide variety of desserts
Their website doesn't have a menu so I sent the boy away with orders to get me a garlic chicken dish
The menu consists of chicken fingers fries coleslaw Texas toast and a chicken sandwich which is chicken fingers on a kaiser w/lettuce & sauce
If your a glutten for good food can stomach dropping $65 pre drink for dinner and want to walk away with your belt buckle popping the tasting menu is a must
If you've been to My Big Fat Greek Restaurant you know what to expect from the food here; the menu is essentially the same
The Express menu doesn't offer some of the big ticket items such as steak shrimp or the pizzas
I was dubious of the food after the last menu change and also the mediocre transition period but the kinks have been worked out for pub grub
And the curry fries as well as the corned beef & cabbage taquito oddities are also good choices
The guacatony is the best thing on the menu a thin thin thin pizza crust with garlic onions and herbs served with a huge pile of italian-inspired guacamole
The service is pretty good very friendly and if it's your first time which is was for us they give a sample of part of their menu beans red jade chicken chicken with ginger chicken fried rice shredded pork and jerk chicken was thrown in since we were curiousI got the egg foo young with no meat in a burrito and added regular fried rice to mine
Try the Toro fatty tuna and the seared tataki is the best I've ever had Over 80 diff sushi places coast to coast Of all the places I've ever had sushi if I could only pick one to eat at on a regular basis then Kampai would be that choice hands down
The fresh meat/seafood selections most notably the Kobe beef burger sirloin beef burger beef/chicken kabobs and Chicago hot dogs can make anyone look like they can grill
There's plenty of variety on the menu and they have both innovative dishes and old staples
Wide selection of dishes plus daily specials
Serving size was very generous but flavor was missing from the chicken
Second to have a local neighborhood sports bar that has the game day atmopsphere of a college hangout but then serves the quality and variety of food that A-T does makes its a great stop any time of the day or week
My lunch choice for a first visit to this location was the Chicken & Avocado Club sandwich $8
You'll find everything from burgers and tacos to fish and pizza on the menu- not bad
With the economy where it is the dish reflected the smaller portions you would expect for such tasty food at $8
Still really great food but if you have a huge appetite you might want to order a side dish also as the portion is fairly small
This food will add to your waste line so if you do not want to do that then I would keep this place on your guilty pleasure list
Hmm previous poster found menu uninspired or food bland
When you walk in the menu is on the wall and there are pictures of the various dishes
I'm a southern soul food kind of a girl - so that is what is the portion of Stacy's menu that I will be commenting on today
I enjoyed the Mac + Cheese- which was a large portion of  chicken breast applewood bacon wild mushrooms cheddar parmesan campanelle pasta & truffle oil
Husband had chix parm nice size dish he liked it
Food that night was average/above average and as the owner explained to me the head chef was having to reference their books/menus as he was cooking the dishes the first few nights to capture the small variances in SaBai's cuisine
The food menu is not incredibly diverse and sort of falls into wine bar modus operendi i
The selection on the tower was okay but I wish they had more raw fish on there
You are given a list of meats and asked to cross off any you don't like there is also a place to note another other dislikes/allergies/etc
For the price the portions do seem like your typical small fancy food plates but I ended up being completely full at the end
Although I loved my meal here I think this place would be more fun for meat eaters as they have some really interesting ones kangaroo quail frog leg exotic fish on their menu
The menu is huge and we can't wait to try some new dishes
Portions were generous gyro meat was pretty good meat didn't taste as fresh as it could be and same goes for the rice and potatoes
OK - it needs even more selections not that the current selection is bad it needs even more fresh produce so tricky because it's all local and organic and spoils quickly if not bought - so I'm sympathetic to their plight and needs a prepared foods section they'd make a ton on this I think
They've got a good variety of dishes and everything that we've tried  other than the pho has been very good
We got Philly's chicken & beef and pizza though their menu also included lots of pasta fish & chips burgers and more
I'd love the top-notch expertly prepared fish and steaks the ginormous portions and the way they make everything -- including lettuce leaves -- deliciously heart-attack rich
They have a decent sized raised bed when you walk up to the front and they use as many of these ingredients as they can on and in their food
Great location too in a nice sizeable shopping center with lots of other food and retail options
Tons of tanks and a lot of custom-made options huge freezer food selection and there is a whole room dedicated just to live rock
Not a lot of variety for someone who doesn't want beef or bacon on some form of bread
One item I typically order here as it's often AWOL on Chicago area menus are the Huevos Rolls
At the Yelp event I love love love loved the lamb meatball which seems to actually be the lamb burger on the menu and the smart chicken
I was super impressed by the menu and the food
Staff is great food is great beer selection is super great
Also about what is going on in the gluten free world as far as where to get pizza and who keeps adding GF menus to their restaurants
If you like italian food even the slightest bit I imagine you'll find something on their menu that you'll enjoy
The menu offers fresh food which is what you should expect
With portions that would satisfy the French diet the rich dish sated our American belly
There was a heaping portion of chicken and it was delicious
But what separates this place is that it has an extensive list of sushi options
There's also a little food menu but I'll get back to ya when I try that
The food was better than average the portions were generous and the service was both fast and friendly
The boyfriend had the Park Avenue Chicken Salad  the most popular sandwich on the menu with white-meat Chicken Salad made with Grapes and Almonds & served on Raisin Walnut Pecan Hearth Loaf withLettuce & Tomato
The menu is explanatory and the servers very knowledgeable about all of the dishes
The menu also didn't have a lot of European foods on it just a few desserts and borscht
I know one variety had chicken onion a pineapple-mango relish and cilantro and I think the others had steak and pickled red onions among other things
I made a good choice with this meal the wrap was very fresh and had lots of tender seasoned chicken and fresh crisp veggies
I'm glad there's a place in my neighborhood that has such fresh tasty healthy food choices
They print their menus new every day to reflect the fresh fish
There is a nice selection of varied food on the menu from Rib-eye to wings to a nice selection of salad
Bland meat balls an artisan cheese platter that consisted of 4 small slices of cheese from the fry's deli variety pack and some jam
The Boba Tea House also serves a limited variety of foods -- including calamari
Like previously mentioned on here I was amazed that they had a rainbow roll on their HH menu
Their food menu also looks very interesting so I will probably come back to give it a try
One can choose from a variety of egg dishes pancakes or French toast or if lunch is on your mind go for one of their burgers or sandwich specialties
Their combination dish of eggs choice of meat bacon or sausage link and French toast is a must to try for any customer
There are a ton of choices for mediocre sushi in the valley and I'm past the point of giving places multiple chances to win me over
The menu variety has been reduced drastically many of the items that were my favorites are not even available any more Chipotle Chicken Club Pizza I'm looking at you
the BEST menu we have ever seen for people with food allergies
At first dear husband and I were a little sad that there was no pizza on the lunch menu but reading the sandwich descriptions and seeing some plates on other diner's tables we figured it was fate
you can order from a list of about 15 dishes and it comes with rice wantons and an eggroll all for about 9 bucks
The red jade chicken really stands out here and there is no question why it is the most popular item on the menu
People were complaining about small portions but the two of us could barely finish the food we ordered
Great food good portions and affordable drinks
Service was quite good portions were large we each took some food home and priced were OK for the quality
I ordered the Vermicelli bowl with pork and egg roll and it was a very large portion
I had swordfish it was a special - not on their usual menu and my girlfriend had the ravioli
Their cheese pizza is a classic thin crust New York style pie with good sized wedges laden with too much
The prices change based on your selection but for about $6 to $8 you'll walk away with a pretty generous sized roll
If you don't know what combinations work best there's a small selection of signature rolls they'll put together for you
The food seemed consistent with the other location portions spiciness flavor everything seems to be a duplicate which is a good thing
Bibimbop is supposed to have a descent amount of beef along with variety of vegetables
The curry dishes are delicious and served in generous portions especially when ordered for take-out
We finished this amazing tasting menu with a sampling of four dessert- chocolate type cake oil olive cake lemon cheesecake and fresh berries and mango paired with a dessert PinotOverall the meal was AMAZING
There's a color key on the menu that indicates which menu items are safe for those with different food intolerance's
Service got high marks from us as our server was personable and well-versed in the foods on the menu
Of the three soup choices available I chose Chicken Enchilada & it was TERRIFIC
Lunch special came with typical cali roll and the udon soup was ok in portion the broth is pretty flavorful
Though there is no cart the menu provides pictures of the dishes which makes it easy for anyone to order
To sum it up A restaurant with a mediocre menu and mediocre food is a mediocre restaurant
If all you are looking for is a huge buffet and you don't care about the quality of food this may not be your place however I found the selection to be more than sufficient
The food here was pretty good and along with plenty of seating a bar area and a nice big menu I can see myself coming back here as a customer
After my initial visit I switched my cats food selection to Blue Buffalo per a cashier's recommendation
At first I was skeptical looking at the size of the bag & its price tag but as she explained off the top of her head the ingredients and even her own cat's experience with the food I was sold
While the menu seemed limited to about half a dozen burger choices and handful of other meat/non-meat options the product finished with surprising flair
Largely unaware on entering that Pane serves dessert it was with much delight that I realized soon after sitting down that three options were available that day and while the flourless chocolate cake I saw emerge from the kitchen to the table next to me looked quite nice there was simply no way I was passing up the Organic Vanilla Bean Rice Pudding with Candied Pecans - another simplistic stunner with creamy Arborio rice imbued with a rich vanilla custard flicked with whole vanilla beans and a few pecans for crunch
They have fish a good selection of it and decent quality
Good service Great Food Outstanding Beer selection
The size suited us well but there was a lack of easy access to food other than the one cart
You walk into the front and you see a menu with breakfast items sandwiches pizzas and incredible desserts
Not much of a menu for food or for drinks but a good place to hang out and lots of space for larger groups
Their menu looks amazing -- I haven't seen chicken gizzards on a menu since I left home and though I haven't tried them yet they're on my list for the next visit
But if you want to spend an evening with your family enjoying pizza and listening to a pipe organ with all the bells and whistles literally this is a good destination
They also have a small food menu that looks delicious but we haven't tried yet
This place offers a wide variety of pizzas including a yummy bacon pizza a salad pizza pepperoni and jalapeno pizza chicken pizza and so many other creative and standard pizzas
Usually they have more pizza choices than the pictures show
Oh ya leave room for desert as they offer several dessert choices
You can't find a bigger fish selection anyplace
I don't know if this really qualifies as NY pizza maybe NY style pizza but it's hard to judge on a individual sized pizzas
This market was also great for soups their brand was my pick although they have a selection of major brands as well; it was also my go-to place for prepared healthful lunches perfect for work like the F&E pre-made burritos and pasta dishes
There is a cute little bar next door to spend your money and get drunk while waiting - how thoughtful   The pizza was ok - it's a large portion for one person but I managed to eat the whole thing
My favorite point is that they have organic chicken on the menu
Tasty hors de ouveries tastes of full sized menu items including white prawn with sweet and sour papaya mint and chile and a tender ribeye with beech mushrooms pearl onions and horseradish mashed potatoes were passed by attractive staff attired in risquu00e9 garb
My favorite dish was the Roasted Beet salad- it is the perfect size and really flavorful
I guess the only caveat is we never have a to-go box of the delicious food to take home ; Also if you like wine the owner has other bottles that aren't on his list and he prices them well
I ended up with a chicken breast about 2 by 2 in size with two onion slices and two pepper slices and 13 pickles on the side charged full price though
The menu is large and includes awesome desserts yummy warm cookies brownie sundaes etc
Some choices of meat include Beef Turkey Ostrich Lamb  Buffalo Salmon and Veggie
I ordered a half sandwich ham Havarti cucumber mixed greens and honey mustard on whole grain and the soup of the day corn chowder served with a cookie of my choice for dessert $6
The dish came with a ton of delicious gigantic pieces of shrimp and the portion of the pasta could easily feed 4 people with all the salad and apps we got
but I'd easily get distracted with the enticing food and drink options on their menu
Other than the drive and the lack of variety for food this is a perfect stadium
We started with an order of the bruschetta and we each ordered entree sized salads which was plenty of food for the 3 of us
Favorite items include Blackened Chicken Tacos not on the menu Parmesan chicken and Cobb salad I recommend the mini unless you want a salad large enough for two
The Sushi menu isn't the most extravagant- no varieties of fish or shellfish that you can't find elsewhere- but what they do they do well
The menu offers the typical dishes you would expect to find at this kind of joint a variety of kebabs lamb beef chicken hummus and some shrimp options
It was $16 for a large portion of sushi soup & salad
In order to try a few things off of the menu we opted for a few apps  the chicken tenders and the fish sliders
I wish I could have tried more food on the menu but I guess that will be next time I visit Old Town Scottsdale
Catfish - oddly shaped/sized - about 10 inches long and about an inch wide with a slight twist
They were almost over-sized catfish tenders in a way
The wings are big and meaty and the beer selection is fantastic
You also have the choice to spice it up with a side plate of other ingredients that accompanys the dish
Problem 1  The sticky rice which came with the pork dish was about the size of two of my fingers should have been at least 4x -10x as much
Besides the meat which was delicious but served in very small portions it was substandard especially for the price
* The staff is really friendly* They offer a bunch of varieties of pho an pack the veggie pho with lots of broccoli and bokCons* It's not located in the best area of Tempe* The broth wasn't extremely flavorful definitely beef based* You get a small portion for the price of the pho
My girlfriend and I both had the Tuscan Style Chicken Panini which was suppose to come on herb-roasted foccacia but your choices were white or wheat
The side dish choice was either potato salad or a pickle
I seriously doubt there is a pizza on the menu you will not like but that night we had the Diavola as well as the Siena mentioned above both fabulous
Unlike the other one there's a larger variety of dealers who aren't typical antique-mall fare things like reproduction hardware the aforementioned sheet-metal winged-pigs repro tin signs garden ornaments made from vintage dishes
I don't want to knock it for people who like NY pizza but Joe's is low on my list
Overall the menu seems to have basic Chinese dishes that you would expect
Seriously - would it be that hard to throw on some hot pasta dishes to the menu
Pita Jungle on Apache is the kind of place I want to love art on the walls specials under $10 good location a hip vibe and an eclectic and healthy menu but due to poor service mediocre food and other better restaurants  in the vicinity I can't bring myself to recommend Pita Jungle on Apache whole heartedly if other options are available
The Good The Daily Specials this night are about 10 bucks and feature a variety of grilled chicken tilapia mahi mahi hummus pita and vegetables
The food is consistently good and they have an extensive menu
I was very impressed with the plate of homemade pasta menu options that the waiter brought to show us - but then a little disappointed that the majority had red meat in them
eel is the only fish i don't eat and it is a favorite item on the sushi eye menu
More importantly the salad itself just wasn't impressive huge iceberg/romaine lettuce that wasn't cut up very well sliced grilled chicken black beans and corn topped in some kind of clear vinaigrette although the menu said homemade chipotle ranch dressing
Patrick's Day because they were the only restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale that had a large seafood selection on their menu and we were in the mood for fish
Turns out that the menu they have online is not the same as the one they have in the restaurant but there were still some good seafood options
As I looked in the display case at the food there was a pretty good variety
unless of course if you consider beer a food group but thats a whole nother topic it's not the great wide variety of people ethnicities and ages you'll mingle with it's not the funny wheel that you spin when your wasted
The food menu is pretty large and I had a tough time selecting a dish
The menu has some creative dishes that wouldn't work for anybody on a diet
Gorgeous rib eyes best Veal dish ever chef's special - not on menu yet and my favorite burger in the state on-premises hand ground best-of-class beef
One item that I have been told that is a chicago staple that is moderately hard to find that they have on the menu is a pizza puff
If u can go for lunch the dishes are cheaper than dinner and they are still very decently sized
Though they have other stuff on the menu like wings salads and sandwiches and specialty pizzas for $10
I've been here several times now and the food is always delicious the wine selection is very good and the service is always terrific
In the end it's just overpriced ridiculously sized chain food
Though the menu may seem intimidating and eclectic the food itself could not be more simple and classic
Oh and I asked the guy what the must eat item was on the menu to which he replied Fish Taco  Best fish taco I have ever had
The menu is varied and they will customize any dish for you
While there are so many enticing menu options the thought of this dish always makes my mouth water
maybe one disappointing dish smaller portion than I thought it should have been
Anyways today it took a couple minutes to get a menu and I actually had to ask the Sushi chef for one and it took about 10 minutes for the waitress to even ask what I wanted to drink
The rolls were a good size other places I've gone to make them too large to easily fit in your mouth and had a good amount of fish in them
As far as the food they didn't have baked beans as they state on their menus nor did they have steak for their steak tacos
How could I over see this Yelp 5 big ones for the food and really nice dessert itemFleur De Sel Caramel Fondue house made marshmallows  fruit cream puffs pound cake coconut macaroons fruits5 big ones for the Wine Selection & great Wine Knowledge A Longtime and reliable live Music SceneI love to come here to buy wine flights
There is a nice meat selection of beef chicken and poultry and also a meat counter for selected items
While the waiter bragged about the portion of fish used in their tacos; we didn't seem to think so
They specialize in teriyaki but they do have two offerings of sushi on the menu
This is basically a one or two star dive that gets 4 food stars for an extensive menu dotted with quirky vegetarian options rarely seen on a Mexican menu
Ten minutes later we get the Surfrider Chicken Sticks which were SET ON TOP OF MY MENU damn really
My dinner visit was much more exciting as the dinner menu was far more extensive with some unique Thai dishes such as the Thai Jerky with Papaya salad
Indeed I have many dishes to try before I add Yupha's to my list of favorite Thai restaurants but it has definitely caught the attention of my taste buds for my future Tempe Thai cravings
AZ88 serves a variety of sandwiches burgers and salads along with some actual entrees and a short but appetizing list of desserts
The portions were smallish but the fish was fresh
They have a menu for food and their food is neat sounding but all of it is bland and flavorless - much like the way this club has no soul
The portions were odd and very light on any meat
When it comes to the food at Delux the obvious choices are between one of two burgers the Delux Burger or the Standard Classic
maybe if I were not a corned beef lover and did not mind the canned variety I would feel differently
PS - the portion sizes of some dishes like yakisoba are HUGE - two people could easily be satisfied by one entree here so if you attend with a group don't be afraid to underorder a bit and to share it family-style
1 step higher than grocery store sushi but def very generous in portions
Desserts are also good as you'd expect from a place that lists them first on the menu
The wives began conspiring with lists of food  plans to relax and hanging out
LOL The food size of a HUGE portion I never finish my whole meal here
Although this wasn't the best sushi in the world and I personally didn't care for the atmosphere as I write this the happy hour menu is probably the most reasonably priced I've found
not only do I want to try some things on the non-happy hour menu that looked enticing continuing to go at happy hour will hopefully keep the sushi monkey on my back from continuing to eat a hole in my pocket
I had heard from a friend that the Brown Sugar Hoisin Chicken Tacos were good so my wife and I tried them off of the tapas menu they were very good
On to the food I had the chicken schnitzel which was very nicely breaded and a HUGE portion
The gumbo was a fairly large portion that was rich flavorful and chock full of sausage chicken and okra
The menu is great so many dishes i want to try
Their selection includes foods from the Middle-east Europe Africa and Asia
I'd also like to mention that the order of chicken strips is HUGE 5-6 full sized strips
The quesadilla is the size of a small thin-crust pizza
The only thing I would change is the portion size on some of the dishes but that's just cuz I have a big appetite it's tasty and I want more
Seems like a pretty straightforward menu I played it safe and went with the Chicken Parmesan and it was tasty
I do agree with other reviewers that the portion sizes are way too large - I ate less than half my food so I do think they could give you less and hopefully charge less and I'd be happier
The family style dish portions were good and the food was fresh and tasty
I loved the selection of sushi they had and went back for more
I shared a chicken and waffle with one of my friends and gladly this portion was more than enough
The variety is amazing and the quality of food is top notch
The food is fresh & the selection of fresh veggies is awesome
My favorites from the menuSushi Roku Fusion $4 a glass $18 a pitcher
Good selection of food but I think you have to make it your own if not you get a pretty basic plate such as shredded meat of your choice with green or red sauce
We have so many excellent choices here in the Valley & certain things didn't measure up to the best*  The food selection here was slightly small for an Indian or Pakistani Buffet with 19 items counting the salad items separately
I have not had any of their non-sushi menu items but if I went there again I'd go for those over the sushi
The menu/dishes are certainly unique and very tasty
Being as this is the only choice for food within 30 miles we ate here
But for the Super Bowl I wanted to get some smaller portioned appetizers and deli foods without sacrificing quality
And I've tried about half the rolls on the menu--from the uncomplicated California to the Vegas and Spider to a Volcano and some other stuff

99 for your choice of 3 options of meat or vegetarian injera or rice and a drink
The food came quickly and I have to say these portions are much bigger than Blue Nile
Upside-Incredibly FRESH delicious and UNIQUE food and cuisines-Customer service is great they always seem like they are in a good mood and ready to help-Nice 'garden' selection flowers pumpkins etc
The portions were okay except for the rice on the side but who cares -- since the food was lame
The menu is the opposite of original featuring steak crab lobster a few fin fish fillet's and some use of a vanilla glaze on the lobster tails
There's a nice selection of beers on tap and the food menu is pretty expansive
In my opinion it ain't all it's cracked up to be first pay attention to how many fried foods are on the menu
I like that the omelet menu lets you choose a meat a cheese and a veggie so you can really make it your way
Since it was my first visit I figured I'd go with a nice safe selection - orange chicken
Listen I don't send food back cause I feel bad but what an interesting experience I had here
The food is a little pricey considering the portions are not huge like Filiberto's or Carolina's Extra Yummy
I went for the Restaurant Week choice of Chicken Tortilla Soup Vegetarian Enchiladas and Banana Burrito sundae
Each member of our table received different dishes despite similar choices
I personally think it's more fun to leave the list open and not know what your eating until after you have eaten it so you approach the food with no preconceived judgment
Turkey sausage and Canadian bacon are weak meat choices
price is affordable and the menu distinctly not run of the mill mexican food
Trader Vic's was a fun kitschy restaurant with an awesome drink menu important when it's your bachelorette party and yummy food
Its heavily breaded beef and suppose to be spicy with 2 peppers indicating so on the menu
We narrowed our orders down to the appetizer size of Korean Beef Taco and a Hawaiian Poke Stack to start
But my friends also rave about some of the more exotic pizza choices on the menu

But when I saw the specials list I fell hard for the Seafood Cioppino
If you want to be a player in the Arcadia Foodie district you gotta make your menu rock
the lunch menu prices are out of this world for the amount of food that you get

Two of my favorites include the Moto Chicken Salad cabbage chicken peanuts celery green onion tossed in a light sesame vinagrette and comes in 2 sizes - regular and large
If you don't eat red meat just ask them to substitute those portions with their favorite alternative
I was delighted to see fishes imported from Japan on the menu like spanish mackerel aji which I've seen only at the best sushi restaurants
We also ordered a childhood favorite cornflake shrimp - jumbo sized shrimp rolled in cornflakes and deepfried served with a homemade tartar sauce
We loved the variety on the menu and can't wait to go back to try more dishes esp the ankimo and grilled tongue
My favorite items on the menu are 1 the pupusas kind of a soft gordita-like exterior with a meat and veggie thick stew-like interior - outrageously good

I politely listened but in the end the food reminded me of PF Chang's

Each person even the kids can find something on the menu they love and the food is always well prepared
didn't run into a single bad dish on the menu
Menu Musts - Starters - The garlic cheese bread - Salad - Pablo Picasso - Pasta - Zany Ziti or Pesto Baked - Lunchtime - Heck of a slice - Pizza - Anything goes
I prefer the thin to the thick pizza choice but if you're really hungry go for the thick
Good food fair prices but could stand to maybe be in a space half its size
We were forewarned this place had no prices on their online menu and appeared to be owned by Mastro's which consistently has excellent food
The staff is helpful when making a selection and takes quite a bit of pride in their food
The food is not too filling but the portions are just right for lunch time

I have tried most everything on the menu and my personal favorites arespicy buffalo wingsjerk tofu saladmexicali burgerthai peanut bowl with crispy tofuoriginal g spicy po-boy sammyOne more thingThey always have delicious daily specials and homemade desserts
I love the fact that the food isn't your typical Mexican restaurant menu- they add their own touch to the dishes enhancing the entree rather than turning it into some odd fusion meal
I'd add that the menu has a good number of items on it and never did I suggest that they should be able to make or sere every single type of Cambodian dish
I've decided to go with healthier food choices when cooking at home and when i do go out I don't like eating heavy unless it's a special occasion or cheat food night where we allow ourselves an unhealthy meal or dessert
The food on the menu is bland boring all-American bar food  plain old burgers french fries and finger food
This isn't to say they didn't have spaghetti BLTs and flash-fried fish but I barely got past the first half of the menu before it slid out of my hand
Order your food burgers etc at a counter grab a beer or soda to wash it down sit on one of the many picnic tables outside and listen to the live country music playing on stage
In fact skip the whole menu and look behind the sushi bar to the little white board
It's a good price for a good portion of Filipino food in downtown Phoenix
I was looking forward to the grilled chicken mentioned by several Yelp reviewers but it wasn't on the menu so I asked the owner Brian and he said that it gets too hot to grill on the side of the truck with the temperature hitting 100+ degrees in the summer
The upkeep of the store the size and the food just screams New York and I can't get enough of it
Soups are very good bread items are ok hot foods are not very good in selection and just blah at best
While doing a recent rental property renovation nearby and there being a lack in other healthy fast food choices in the area I ate at this Subway four days in a row
Real Japanese Restaurant here Yasu Sushi Bistro is at the top of the lists
Awesome* They have chicken and salads on the menu
The food is filling and there's fruit breads flan and even salad to choose from so there was variety
They have a lunch special where you choose 2 rolls from a list of selected rolls/sashimi and also get a salad and miso soup salad dressing is da' bomb
and since I love sashimi sushi which isn`t on the happy hour menu no big deal ordered my sashimi combo which didn`t disappoint
There's definitely more on the menu than pizza including pasta and calzones which after watching a few being served around me and listening to the oohs and ahhs while they were consumed I will definitely be ordering next time
salads smoothies breakfast items a billion sides desserts and numerous beverage choices
Crispy chicken glistening in sweet-but-not-too-sweet-even-if-you're-super-picky-like-me sauce
Sadly the so-so food happened to be the main attraction on the menu
And all the toppings on the menu really don't matter much when the meat underneath is dry
I went for the small selection of the Beef Brisket in sauce with 2 sides
The food was absolutely perfect good size portions the flavors were excellent and at a good value
Even without having eaten more than six or seven different dishes on the menu this has become one of my favorite restaurants to go to
You don't go to this joint for atmosphere it's like the size of a bedroom in an apartment you go to pick up your pizza and head home
Then our dishes came out and we were hoping they weren't too big of portions or too small they ended up being just perfect
I got so much more food choices and much better quality food at The Pizza Buffet and Much Much More at half the price
The food was definitely fancy and each dish had like 239448759234 ingredients listed [complete exaggeration i know]
The fish was good the portion was ridiculously small and the accoutrement were completely forgettable
So riddle me this How is it that on a menu where no item is more than 14 bucks all items very well priced by the way that the special fish is f-ing 25 dollars
There is a large selection of food choices here as well as sushi
Along with the chips and salsa I got plenty of food so portion sizes are only an issue for big eaters
There is the tendancy to go with large portions rather than quality food
Love the aura of this store and the wide variety of keyword healthy food
Food-The food is delicious and they have the perfect portions for me
We ordered Fontina Burger - 4*BBQ Chicken Pizza - 4*Grilled Veggie Pizza - 3*Sweet Potato Fries - 2*Garlic Fries - 4*Onion Rings - 5*Chocolate Milk Shake - 2*The good- great selection of American food / good portion sizes- allow upgrades to different kinds of fries to your meal- the decor & cute history behind the farm- open kitchen / sauce bar- friendly staff - outdoor picnic benches under a huge tree where the kiddies can enjoy themselves- hand washing fountain conveniently located by the soda fountain- kiddies love the cool restrooms The bad  - lots of flies outside that's summer in a farm for you- limited seating inside- real vanilla milkshake tasted weird  too much lemon juice
The portion size is decent but large portions of subpar food is just more subpar food
They serve pizza by the slice or a whole pie if you want the portions are big not like some other pizza places kids will have to cut 1 slice in half just to be able to pick it up the price is comparable to the hut about 19$ for a large but I mean large
My fav on the HH menu --- gotta get the butterfish tataki -- yes chopped little poissons in my belly - yum
We quickly perused the menu and say they had a lunch special of several items opted for the pizza and a chicken/portobello pasta both $7
Then I ate my words when the behemoth greasy cheesy large pizza sized crisp actually came to the table
For dessert we decide to try the first thing on the menu the white chocolate brownie
The portions are too small the plasticware just reminds me of Jack In The Box the serving tray is right from a mall food court and the menu selection is drastically reduced
The menu choices are varied mostly mediterranean Italian and creative and the quality of the fresh organic ingredients with such flavor that your eyes may roll back into your head
Taggia's food selection includes something for everyone in our party; steak delicious pizzas seafood pasta dishes and so much more
For some reason I have let the place on Adams in downtown with national reviews as my local benchmark for pizza and I keep finding places just as good if not better and Humble pie makes my list
The food arrives and the portion is really big and smells delicious
That said an encyclopedic knowledge of the menu a parlor trick memory of not writing down anything the sense to not interrupt conversation flow and the flash of a personality stable against customer anger/assault contributed to the ultimate disarming beta to the food's alpha
Speaking of dessert we've tried quite a few and their daily flavor of cru00e8me bru00fblu00e9e is our must have selection
We each grasped a nibble or two but couldn't resist some of the other items on the dessert menu
Like most fast-food places you step up to the counter read the menu posted on the wall place your order pay and then wait for your food
The menudo is rich red and peppery and is chock-full of fatty meaty goodness yeah yeah yeah we all know it's offal but it's freaking GOOD
On the menu itself they have lots of great dishes but I will tell you its all about the short rib meat or short rib taco platter
The second thing was the dessert menu was limited and nothing stands out
The menu was huge and I kinda got lost in it so I ended up ordering a half turkey and provolone sandwich on nine grain a cup of minestrone soup which came with bread and a side meat ball
although the place may look like a total bummer inside with it's computer-paper-print outs hanging all over the wall listing their food you can't really deny the cheesiness oh puns of this place
it was a perfect size as well not too big and meaty but not too scrawny
I can't speak to their sushi much because I have become such a fan of other items on the menu
And we always order the goat cheese and chicken Phyllo Packets from the appie menu
Contrary to a previous review we did not find the menu confusing at all--it was very organized and descriptive which is very helpful for the special sushi rolls
Sure enough this is the kind of place college kids would love - lots of beer and huge portions of classic bar food
From the online menu you may not know they sell pizza by the slice
The portions of the food were pretty ridiculous
Both meats were hefty portions and down right the best rib tips I've had since living in Texas
I had #71 or #72 which should tell you how extensive their menu is which was beef with green beans and carrots
We had a nice variety of food inlcuding eggs benedict home fries bacon grits and Portuguese sausage
Another negative is that the menu provided has no descriptions of the dishes
Too much to list and I think they even have fried chicken
A good portion of chicken breast tenders peppers tomatoes and the onions
Fried calamari is a bit bland but worth the volume bigOff the happy hr menu my fav is the scallop dynamite roll
They have a huge variety of food to try and the people I went with had the pasta salad and various sandwiches
Their sushi picture menu had a lot going on so it was hard to decide we ended up getting an avocado roll a vegetable roll a crunchy roll and a tempura fried California roll
The dim sum was plentiful and there was a lot of variety - however unless you watch for the carts that just came out of the kitchen and only order off that one there's a good chance you'll get lukewarm or cold food
The restaurant serves breakfast lunch and dinner including a variety of southwest inspired dishes
Nothing would ruin a plate of tuna rolls like having to listen to Linkin Park while I eat
That have a fantastic fish selection with several fresh catches to choose from
When the meat arrived the medium sized portion it was cooked to medium rare perfection
Carne asada is alright but you've gotta put more effort into your food than handfuls of shredded cheese on most menu items
I can't wait to get back to try some of the other menu items excluding the fish & chips
Bad service  bad food  small portions of over priced bad food
3 in smaller than the normal size for $10 and 1 of the roasted mushroom pizza
The food was good and the beer selection was pretty decent as well
Their extensive and creative sushi menu will please even the pickiest of fish eaters while also providing adequate options for non-sushi-lovers
Food-wise we sampled a little bit of everything on the menu
By far my favorite dish on the tiny menu is the Margherita Flatbread which had the perfect consistency because it had lots of cheese and wasn't too crispy
We went on a Saturday night around 7 pm and it was not that busy at all beautiful decor and a very romantic setting For those who were complaining about the lighting they might want to get their eyes checked it was fine The menu offered a number of tasty meals I had a flat iron steak and my boyfriend has the roasted chicken with gnocchi it was amazing  We sampled some different wines and had a great waiter Frankie he was very good never let our glasses go empty and had lots of recommendations for us we can't wait to return again
Got a bit of local flair in their sushi menu
My family tends to go for the combos which allow you to have a 2-4 choices out of  4 columns of items involving teriyaki sushi rolls sashimi and other items along with soup rice and salad
Hopefully one day that dish makes its way onto the menu though
Searched for a place with good happy hour deals and food and this one was in more than a couple Best lists
Dessert was good I just wish that they created ones that were a little more complex in taste like the rest of the menu

Roy's is billed as Hawaiian fusion but my first thought was oh no there's sushi on the menu I won't like this place
Though I wasn't at all in the mood for soup and wish the menu had made mention of the fact that the dish was far more similar to soup rather than curry it was tasty
FOOD You had no choice of appetizers or desert
We had edamame and gyoza off of the happy hour menu and the salmon roll which was delicious
Meats are slow smoked and arrive hot smoky and juicy with a choice of sides and hot or mild sauce
Secondly the food is awesome and portions are generous
Your choice of tune or chicken salad I imagine they'd do egg if you asked over greens and surrounded by lots of veggies etc
The portions were substantial but the food was very bland

The food is different than Thai Basil and Thai Elephant both about a mile away in that I think they offer a different selection of dishes maybe from a different part of Thailand maybe I'm talking out my ass

I am on their email list and had received a coupon for two hours of bowling with shoes food etc for $7
I don't usually eat hotel room service if I have a choice but on the few occasions that I was forced to order in I was impressed at the quality of the food served and service that I recieved from the room service staff

the menu is pretty standard for a Arizona Mexican food shack the beauty is in the execution
They want you to be happy with their food so realistic and honest comments to them would probably be appreciated
The answer is yes i am going back to try some other stuff on their menu the service was quick and the waitresses were nice the food was good especially the juices and the atmosphere was whatever
Every course was delicious- Oysters- Charcuterie plate with rabbit confit- Seared scallops over brussel sprouts and fingerling potatoes- Sliced kobe beef with gnocchi- Some chocolate orange pot de creme type of dessertThe standouts of the night were the rabbit confit moist and flavorful and the gnocchi incredibly light and airy - if these are offered as part of the regular menu order them
Their meat selection lacks but produce is ah-maz-ing
The Vig has been struck from the list of places that I frequent because I hate to wait for a table at a neighborhood grill and because I hate to park a half mile away for a chicken sandwich
The food line is super fast the portions are huge and delicious
This buffet doesn't offer as many food choices as those of Pancho's or Camarones but the food the service & the price are all good & it's a comfortable place
Cheap large portions deeeeeeeeeelish BBQ Chicken - MMM
Excellent mix of a variety of cheeses meats and other fresh ingredients
We all ordered an array of different seafood items off the menu
They had a seafood tasting menu the night we went June 30

99 was just the right size for 3 to split with a pizza
They have a huge menu serving alot of different dishes
The waiter was nice enough to leave one menu behind incase we wanted more food I didn't see the front page of the menu until I was about half-way done with my wine
The bartender spent quite a bit of time talking to me about local beers they have their menu where they get their meats and then suggested that I get the wild boar burger

The food is delicious the service is friendly and the portions are pretty large
Someone ordered the halibut which would have been my second choice and it was a great piece of fish

I love their butcher and seafood section and there is always a great selection of very reasonably priced fresh produce
sorry - the authentic Italian-style minimalist pizzas don't quell the good ole American boy in me who wants a HEAVY pie
This might be good for many other dishes on the menu but a curry gets better when prepared beforehand and sits a little bit to deliver more flavor
The portions are on the generous side and left us unable to even contemplate dessert- still we left with enough leftovers for an entire meal
Super Dragon's main menu is filled with Americanized Chinese food which I ignored as soon as I saw the single page laminated menu in pure Chinese
The Chinese menu is filled mainly with Cantonese food except for the obligatory Peking duck
I'm guessing that food from the Chinese menu is so rarely ordered that the kitchen confused what I ordered with another vegetarian dish on that menu
We had a variety of appetizer plates - mac n cheese crab cakes chicken & waffles - that were way overpriced and just average at best
The server also raved about the drinks there and the awesome mixologists but the bar selection was tepid no Sapphire only Beefeater
We recently stopped eating meat but that doesn't cause a problem here as they have so many different choices and will gladly accomodate any special dietary requirements
I was pleasantly surprised by the wide variety of the food they had
Granted that this is the only place I've found in the valley to serve moist brisket or even give you a choice but the meat was lacking flavor
The menu is typical bar food including burgers sandwiches pizza wings as well as some taco and quesadilla selections which I always appreciate a good quesadilla so I will have to try it next time

Many healthier items on the menu but the most decadent desserts too
One time I went in I wanted their mandarin cranberry walnut salad made into a dinner portion not the small side one they have on the menu and I wanted chicken on it
Great place for fresh salad and a nice variety of soups and other buffet foods
Food is very good portions large ingredients fresh
Simple but not simplistic this is food that tastes good and you feel good about eating
I wish there was more seafood on the menu but I suppose doing a local food restaurant in Arizona doesn't permit it
I've also tried a pasta bowl and pizza when I was with my daughter since there is no kids' menu and they were also good
Desserts - huge portions and yummy flavors but
I will give this place 5 stars because it has a variety of food but healthy
75Very small menu their menu consists of Salads 7 different varieties Wraps 3 items Breakfast 3 items couple of items from France Italy and America Philly Steak Roast Beef Turkey Club
If you like Scandinavian food Denmark this place down on your list of restaurants to visit
The food menu looks pretty impressive as well but we haven't tried any of the dishes yet
If you're tired of the usual pizza joints definitely put this on your list to check out
ReviewPros-good quality grade SUSHI the truest I've tasted in all the valley-portion size-good variety in happy hour & reverse happy hour menu-good ambiance and social scene-good locationCons-poor replicas of some Asian dishes evident in the tonkatsu and Korean Kalbi-price vs valueIf you've heard that this place is expensive you heard right
It was a lot of food but I wanted variety so I went ahead with it
They have a variety of great breakfast dishes as well
There aren't many places to eat Swedish food; I am delighted that Beaver Choice has chosen Tempe as their home

Everyone seemed more than happy with their selections as we all shared and sampled from each others' plates of oysters on the half shell boiled crawfish and fried alligator
I was pleasantly surprised to find fish cakes on the menu
Too many fast food places expand their menus into a quagmire of mediocrity
With such a huge menu it took a few minutes to try to find the unique and interesting dishes
My Husband was a little disappointed that with a name like The Arrogant Butcher they didn't have more cuts of meat on the menu
We tried a nice variety of breakfast food all was 5 stars
They have your typical bar menu as well as some better food choices
Their brunch menu has everything from pancakes peanutbutter crusted french toast breakfast burritos omlets and chicken fried steak - not something I would have pegged a wine bar to have
They also have a great selection of natural and organic dog foods and supplies
One distinct advantage to the already huge menu is that the cooks will even prepare food choices that are not listed on the menu
One last thing If you like hot pots be warned The hot pot dish on the menu is already prepared and simply served to you in a literal hot pot
Terminals 2 and 3 have very limited food choices
We had a groupon and came on a tuesday during happy hour every day 4-6pm and got food off the happy hour menu artichoke dip with homemade crackers yum
the portions are huge and enough for our family of three to share two dishes
plus the portions are really generous for a sushi place
The size of the meal was very good and filled me up quite nicely and then some so I guess the food and drink was a good value for my money
If you go on Sunday - Thursday their customer appreciation menu provides reduced price sushi in full portions it says good for an appetizer or snack but they're complete rolls
As for the sushi -- I was a little disappointed that several of the selections were just fish on top of a California Roll since I hate that roll but there were creative enough selections that it made it worthwhile
Overall a good place with friendly service and a decent selection of sushi options
Over all it was good the chicken tenders and the fries were cooked to order and they served with our choice of both BBQ sauce and ranch
I previously gave the owners/cooks a list of food allergies which I again went over on the phone
It was so little the perfect size if you want dessert but don't want to pig out

Great food atmosphere and beer selection however a couple details are missing
I was impressed with the menu and love the concept of beer first food second
That was the only food we had so I can't rate anything else on the menu but they were REALLY bad something dumped out of a frozen food bag
I'll give this place 4 stars because in the handful amount of times I've been I've never been disappointed either with the food or temperature of the beer  Even better the first place in AZ I've found that has a Taco Tuesday Which means dollar something oversize taco's for all you who don't knowOne thing really blew my mind about this place though the crabcakesHUH
Unassuming deli spot with a huge menu including their own crafted meats bagels breakfast and desserts
The market portion of the store is huge the produce area was well stocked as were their meats you can buy an entire goat
There are hunks of meat with sauces on them and an around the world menu that rarely touches upon the actual cuisines of the nations represented
Since that meal's menu has the majority of the gluten-free GF options this was disheartening
Not only was the warm butter cake delectable but the bowl of home made whipped cream that came in a HUGE bowl could have stood alone as a worthy entry on the dessert menu
Then the main dish was Prime rib and they shared a Big Mountain Fudge Cake for Dessert which taken home as they were completely full after all food listed above
When I saw they had fish yassa on the menu I was extremely excited
They still offer their $2 ~ 2 eggs choice of meat and pancakes or toast daily for the early birds
After being greeted by the amazing sushi chef didn't get his name we were brought drinks and we immediately started putting check marks next to all of the selections we wanted to try
Huge selection of martinis along with a variety of apps light meals and a few desserts

I love that they offer healthy food choices
Even though I wanted to try everything on the menu I went back for the Yassa chicken and it may have been better the second time around I can't tell
Awesome Mexican Tienda Joint - super friendly staff almost too many menu choices to choose from - I had what was recommended by the cashier - the steak fajitas - and they were incredible - I left stuffed with tender beef guacamole fresh tortillas peppers rice beans chips salsa muy rica
Good food takes time and the menus even say which dishes take an especially long time to prepare and bake maybe they added that recently
the omelet came with toast hash browns and choice of meat
Picazzo's boasts a menu which includes appetizers salads organic and gluten-free pastas and of course pizza and dessert
The menu boasts natural hormone free beef and you can build your own burger with various buns cheeses sauces meats and toppings
As indicated on their menu they start preparing the food only after the order is placed leading to a considerably long wait 45 mins to one hour
Meant to be a hang the menu is bar-food oriented tasty small dishes with Asian and American foods represented
The chicken was tender and in small pieces so it didn't interfere with the noodle size that's important to a Mac n Cheese fanatic
Great selection fresh natural foods lots of beautiful & healthy soccer moms strutting about - but last night was the 1st time I visited their Watering Hole
I've tried three of the rolls from the appetizer menu the pho ga and two different bun dishes
I love these specialty type of restaurants where they focus on one or two menu items here it's chicken and beef
50 no matter what you get with selections such as pork tenderloin chicken breast shrimp and brie with fennel
The chicken tacos were a solid choice but I'll likely skip them and try something different next time
They have the best eco-friendly toys the treats are all natural and organic and the selection of dog and cat food is impressive
My friends helped me order off the happy hour menu and the food was delicious
Plenty of food great menu and amazing happy hour prices
If you are looking for a casual restaurant for lunch or dinner and you're in the mood for Italian food Nick's at Paradise Valley in the Whole Foods shopping center is an excellent choice
Otherwise it's a great place to go for brunch or lunch has a full-fledged menu with tons of choices and you get a lot of food
Finally one person got the Kobe bone in rib the half order with the blue cheese grits now that came out hot and it was good - so at this point - because of the slower than expected service from the primary waiter and the fact that the main dish was blah - the overall agreement by my group of five mixed group men and women was a solid 3 stars though if you just came for cocktails and appetizers and they have a good list of starters then we would rate it a solid 4 starts with 5 star potentials if they work on the operational workflow of the kitchen to get the food out hot
Though it's limited to beef or chicken I feel the meat is consistently of good quality and portion
Saketini has great service wonderful chill atmosphere and a large food/drink menu
They have an extensive sushi menu with both cooked and raw sushi
They also have a full non-sushi menu as well
My boyfriend had the chicken enchiladas which had the choice of red or green sauce and were served with delicious black beans and rice
They have a bunch of stuff on the menu I'm happy is in walking distance from my office like a basic egg salad grilled cheese tuna salad regular salads burgers pizzas deli sandwiches and breakfast served all day--no launching with a half or partial menu at all which I take to be a good sign
The Mex & Match area of the weekday menu allows you to select one or two of many main item choices all the same price each & one or two of a good number of side dish selections all the same price each
A LOT of attention to detail has gone into the layout & decor of this restaurant as well as to the menu the  preparation of the food & the presentation of it

Extensive wine selection Dutch cheese plate and chocolate hazelnut custard for dessert
I feel pretty comfortable saying that given the good drink list and affordable good food you should expect to wait for a table unless you like to eat dinner early
I only feed my dog 5 star+ foods and this place definitely has the best selection of top notch foods I've ever seen
Massive selection of Merrick canned foods too
And don't forget dessert - loved the flour-less chocolate cake dark chocolate with a hint of sweetnessThis place is awesome and everything on the menu is healthy and tasty
I have one friend who does not eat fish order a few things off of the menu
If WE a paying customer want to order the entire menu YOUR job is go take the order and get said food
They have a great selection of cold noodle hot noodle and soup noodle dishes
the only negative that I would have about this place is that there isn't enough choices where chicken is the main protein
As far as the entrees are concerned the portions were small and the food was kind of meh
The menu  for SteakenBurger consists of either Cheesesteaks or Burgers with a few chicken items thrown in for good measure
This is art PB doesn't need a menu full of novelty pizzas to make it
Offering more than crockpot meatballs on the menu might help as would offering valet service
I forgot how pricey it can be $11 for just that one dish but was pleasantly surprised by the portion size
I remember grabbing a tray and utensils moving down the line making my own choices for food
Today the line is just not the same the food choices are smaller and hit or miss on quality
Cheap good food and lunchtime portions of sushi on the side
The fact that they have quick small cheap portions of sushi to go on the side if fantastic
Relatively low cost simple menu chicken or beef - corn or flour tortillas - no other decisions needed
The sauce and toppings were noticeably fresh and perfectly proportioned on the pizza
With a menu full of fish flown in from Japan I ordered a wide array of their specialties to get a better idea of why Bon Appetit magazine rated this restaurant Top 10 in the nation
They're keeping 'ex lax fish' on the menu though
Our favorite is the Garden Salad with the house dressing and a pizza that is not on the menu -- we call it the Rich Ihle special -- BBQ chicken pineapple and jalepenos
We also like the lasagna the eggplant parmesan the wings ask for them to be double baked and all the other pizzas on the menu
Sadly the hummus wasn't on the menu probably because of the pita but there are several delicious items including the spinach roll-ups
After checking out the menu and FINALLY deciding on a dish everything sounded great my boyfriend ordered the seafood risotto and I ordered the rigatoni primavera a vegetarian dish
Also i hear there is a food menu on its way
We also ordered shrimp some bitter Chinese greens baby bok choy beef tendon a variety of mushrooms some noodles etc
There is even shabu shabu style beef on the menu
I asked for a menu and sure enough they gave me the wrong dish
The rice is never properly cooked the meats are either over-cooked and burnt or under-cooked the veggies are often too raw and the portions sloppily placed in the boxes
So the other times we have been there to eat we just stuck with the sushi menu and of course Japanese draft beer
They have a cheese schnitzel literally the ONLY meatless thing I could find on the menu but it was good
My only cautions / suggestions would be to grab a takeout menu so you don't have to stand and look at the wall menu with your mouth gaping like a cod fish and be prepared to park along Palm if the street inset parking area is full
At a dinner plate with drink running you between 8 and 9 dollars with enough food to make two decent sized meals this is one indulgence I can fit in to my life with little or no rationalizing
And the concession stands are no joke either this is big-league pricing but I must say there's an impressive variety of foods available -- as I mentioned earlier a suitable minor league version of AT&T Park
I ordered the Aaron's Choice which is hot corned beef and pastrami swiss cheese coleslaw and 1000 island dressing on an onion roll
There are loads of reviews already written about specific dishes that are favorites at Joe's Farm Grill so I wont go into a lot of details concerning their menu
I don't think it's the healthiest food around but if you want a good breakfast this should definitely be on your list
We arrived and asked for the fresh fish menu to our surprise they did not have one as they were out of most of their fish
Next up was the cold deli mix which contained my favorite oil/pepper mix but instead of beef tendon my #1 choice or pigs ear eh my wife suggests that this is cow lung
Oh and I love the attention to details such as the artwork on the walls and on the menus the silverware cooled or heated to the proper temperature depending on the dish it comes with
It was served with an ample portion of delicious meat and they were generous with the veggie toppings and yogurt sauce
They've recently expanded their food choices and I've tried a LOT from their menu and really have yet to disagree with anything I've eaten there
The dinner portion was a perfect amount of food
They had a lovely dessert menu and it took all my strength to skip it but I did since I'm watching my figure
Large bread roll that was the size of small watermelon - it was warm on the inside but not as crunchy on the outside as I like
The menu also includes a nice assortment of vegetarian dishes as well
Overall this was a wonderful eating experience with several authentic dishes on the menu as well as some creative ones
Gina allowed plenty of time for us to decide our food choices walking us through questions we had
After looking at the dessert menu I learned that the creme brulee is infused with a different flavor every day
I like their selection of food makeup cleaning supplies and toiletries
We did grab a quick meal at Trattoria del Piero which has an impressive menu and serves local organic food / drinks all day long including casual breakfast and lunch and more of a full service restaurant in the evenings for dinner
Terminal 4 is good overall with food choices and space but then you're probably flying Southwest which is lame so no matter what there's reason to be unhappy at Sky Harbor
Totally unpretentious small very casual interestingly-named family-operated and offering good values on large portions of delicious food
They did replace the dish with the correct sauce and portions but we still felt as though they were trying to pull one over on us
I'd go back one more time for sure because my favorite is their Chicken Fried Chicken but as I didn't order that I would have to try it one more time before I crossed this place off of my list
It is a bit cheesy both in food and in sense of humor but the food portions are huge and taste pretty good
The food selection is meek compared to a lot of the parks but the vendor has a surprising variety of selections
Pizza subs Mexican and a good half-dozen kind of hotdogs round out the bulk of the non-standard baseball menu
I've had a lot of items on there menu and I have enjoyed each and every dish
They have cheap specials on the lunch menu along with a full complement of jive ass rolls sashimi sushi etc
When you ask the waiter how large the portion is of a certain dish and they respond large enough that 4 people should be satisfied you tend to think that is enough for one person
Well I was so disappointed in the portion size and the blandness of my dish that I couldn't even muster an emotion
The rolled tacos were just as bland and not much different from the kind you find in your freezer selection
A perfect amount of food for a meal you know the portions everywhere but American serves
It's nice to go to a supermarket that has a huge variety of fresh fish
There's a enormous selection of food to choose from- so not only cheescakes here

I like their grass fed meat selections at the meat counter cheese and olive bar as well as some of their beer selections
Looked at the menu and there wasn't too much of choices for food but did have a lot of drinks to choose from
For starters no I'm not a hunter or fisher but I do love stores like this for a variety of reasons
The hobo eggs make the other huge portions seem positively wimpy- my father-in-law ordered it and I swear it was like 5 pounds of food
Great selection of pizza and other foods- Everything is perfect- When you see a Mellow Mushroom you have to go in
They have both a true Chinese menu for real foodies and a more typical menu for those who prefer American Chinese food
We ordered the 3 person assorted platter with several choices each of meat and vegetarian dishes nicely spiced with ample injera to mop it up with
I wish they made their desserts in smaller portions for a cheaper price
Massive portions lots of meatsteak bacon sausage ham you get the idea heaping mounds of hash browns or country potatoes and pancakes as big as your head-seriously they are big pancakes
Having tried the hummus garlic was overpowering and stung the tastebuds the Caprese Salad too heavy on the balsamic The Gyro Pita meat was tender and juicy and the Sausage and Peppers sandwich very generous portion and handmade fennel sausage very flavorful and juicy I can't say that I would go out of my way to come here to eat
The menu has been revised to largely comprise of sushi yet the rest of the items don't seem to follow the Japanese theme
At the counter though I see one a menu which photographically depicts each dish
I must add that my review is based solely on breakfast food as i've never ventured to the lunch side of the menu
If I were to give this business advice it would be to restructure their buffet line to help with people getting bogged down and to offer a bit more variety and up their food quality
No thrills about a bowl with a little rice and a large portion of meat
My food was lovely and a generous portion we did have desert and coffee as well
OK so where do I start first off the place looks cool and has a really truly awesome assortment of food on the menu
It's easy to see why the line was out the door by the time I finished my meal - Joe's is a bastion of fresh food in a desert but I advise those ordering to choose menu items that best highlight that freshness
My waffle had a scoop of butter that was twice the size of a golf ball The chicken was so crispy and flavorful not too spicy or salty but just right it wasn't even greasy
The only change my girlfriend doesn't like There is a new stocking area behind the front desk with a variety of snack foods available
I viewed the menu of pizzas online but their ordering system was down
Pizza seems to be their specialty but the menu offers so much more
Well we didn't have much left in the way of leftovers and since we were at my mom's there wasn't much to chose from otherwise in the fridge she is a minimalist when it comes to food
My dad brought home a menu for us to look at and it has one of the most expansive menus I have ever seen at a Chinese restaurant including a lot of seafood dishes
That said the beef sandwich was very good size the hot peppers and sweet peppers were very tasty and the flavor was great
Based on the food alone I would normally give a place like this 4 stars but two things irk me about Pizzeria Bianco value and selection
You must choose from a selection of only 6 pizza varieties ranging from $12-16
I should have stuck to their fish or steak selection
It is so nice to go to a Japanese resteraunt and find something other than Sushi on the menu
your love letter of a menu - with wooing words of homey sides and starters and a well varied assortment of meat fish vegetables and desserts i was spoiled even before beginning my meal
I've never really had an entree where the side dish is a quarter the size of the protein
Anyways while the food was cooking I was explaining your menu to my husband and came across the part about you cooking brains and tongues
I'm not a pizza fan but since this place is one of the list I have to try so I have to give it a try
We arrived in time for Happy Hour and ordered a number of items from the discounted HH menu -- gyoza sliders shrimp tempura fire dragon rolls and calamari
There is a white board near the register listing the daily specials try the teriyaki chicken and yakisoba and a small counter housing homemade condiments plastic utensils and a soda fountain
Food offerings aren't surprising  think basics like the Reuben Cobb salad burgers and pasta but judging from the packed dining room the menu is exactly what area retirees and players right off the links are craving
The chief was good and the food was good but was small portions compared to most Japanese steak houses I have been to
Either drop your prices to make it just a large bar food type menu - or dramatically increase the quality
Also when you are building your meal the red meats will be more flavorful and you will most certainly need to add more flavorings than the amounts listed on their ingredient list
In any event we were handed menus and we got down to business in selecting our food
I would not recommend this place for New Year's dinner since it is a special menu they make up and one dish costs $50
We had the honey hot great flavor good size a lot of meat  we will definitely order those again
Choice of regular rental skates or roller blades - both of which seem to be maintained
They do have a lot of items on their menu that sound great but I feel like the quality of the food is very hit or miss
I've been stuck ordering food from here several times because my Starbucks of choice jeweler waxer and nail place are all in this shopping center; when you only have 15 minutes in between appointments and you are starving sometimes you just have to suck it up
Well I want free wifi I want a place to sit and eat good food I want all of the latest bestsellers the classics and maybe listen in on an ongoing presentation toward the back of the store
I tried something from raw food menu and my husband tried an Ethiopian meal
I will say that the food was OK but afterwords my stomach hurt for several hours afterwords the fries and mushrooms were really greasy so not sure if it was the grease or something else but I would say that I would probably not eat here again if I had a choice
SummaryFood Incredible Oatmeal cookies/Good Black Bean Soup/ Blah salads and onion soupBeverage Selection Caffeine Free Diet Coke great
I tried the chicken salad for dinner and it was tasty and just then right size
Lots of variety with different proteins and many stir fried pans most dishes had decent flavor but many had too much oil
I think some of their other portions like the enchiladas can be shared or you will have take home food
Ok so this place has amazing service even better food a great wine and beer selection and has a perfect ambiance
They need to have a football menu and another beef is that 3/4 of their appetizers are more expensive than some entrees and sandwiches
The food section of the menu was divided into Nibbles and Bites both essentially categories of small plates/tapas
There was also a small selection of artisanal cheeses as well as a sampling of desserts
I wholeheartedly recommend this place if you want the takeout variety of Chinese food
They have a very reasonably priced customer appreciation menu with over a dozen maki rolls
I always get the one vegetarian roll on the menu called the Jungle Roll
In Zen 32's defense they do have+ A great location+ Very fresh fish+ Low carb rolls+ Possibly the best tuna in town+ Creative and tasty specialty rolls+ Good sushi selection+ Neat little complimentary sunomo type appetizer+  A really good drink menu yummy plum wine
For the main I chose the eye fillet of beef and was pleasantly surprised at the size of beef served - it was great considering it was part of a three course meal
Plus the sizes of food are definitely moneys worth
Serious comfort food menu and I've gotta say this weirds me out in such hot climates
I gotChicken Chow Fun - Delicious and love the wok breathe or air when you open the containerCreamy Chicken Corn Soup - Huge portion but the soup seemed bland
However they do have a considerable large choice of meats cheese pasta sides etc
Looking over the menu they are quite expensive for what I am used to with Sushi
The food was always good and the menu choices were different
My dog really likes the holistic dog food
With a new appreciation for Italian food I tried the Risotto and Insalata on the lunch menu
A little more flavor but not nearly the size nor quality of fresh shellfish I had along the waterfront in the Fishing Village below the town of Sorrento
We also shared a few desserts since the dessert section was on top of the first page of the menu
I am not talking about critiquing the food service or ambiance I am referring to the haters who are more often than not rude and demanding if not just ignorant refusing to read the menu ask questions and just expect everything to be as THEY think it should beand if their expectations aren't met want it for free
The menu could probably use an upgrade ingredients seemed good inspiration was lacking so the food is up to par with the ambiance
Now this doesn't mean the service was bad the food was mediocre the wine selection limited the decor unpleasant
It also could have had a little more meat had rare beef slices and well done brisket variety
Just think of the drinks as afterthoughts and enjoy the variety of food you are able to enjoy
Whole Foods is a far better choice for this meal choice
Now I'm no fundamentalist but I still can't deny that The Presidential Special two enchiladas rice and beans is probably the best traditional Mexican dish I've ever had in Arizona
}The chicken portion was generous the dressing was light and flavorful plentiful mixed greens not crappy iceberg but $8
They have everything from your mass-brewed American lagers/pilsners PBR Bud Coors Miller etc and a good selection for the beer geek/snob Sierra Nevada Stone Dogfish Head etc
The staff was awesome and I still dig this place but the meatball choice seemed poor planning
You get your choice of chicken or steak not both
And during the day there's also a food menu limited to sandwiches
They serve the food 'tapas' style so small portions
So I asked whats good here Wendy she said fried chicken so I got it it came with choice of salad or soap and a side dish
I will have to give it four stars however as the dinner food didn't seem to match the minimalist interior
The tandoori chicken was good but the portion was skimpy and there was more bone than meat
We chose to order off of the regular menu but the breakfast dishes that we say going by looked yummy
In regards to the food and drinks menu items are a bit pricey but in retrospect on our meal I feel it was rather reasonable
From Crispy Spicy Tuna have to order it every time to the drinks love the Geisha a-go-go; the sushi is good the happy hour is great; have had everything to eat on the happy hour menu
we visited Prado  3 times this week and we were pleased with everything that we had speacially the service was nice our server took his time to explain the food to us before we order so it was clear to us you know this restaurant they dont write everything in the menu you need a server help to order and their manager was cheking every table and greeding them which is nice
As for the side items we ordered off the specials menu which I was told is where the chef creates his own dishes from local products
Not too impressed wit the menu or with the rest of the food than we ordered
They only had 2 specialty pizzas on the menu both chicken which I found puzzling
If I had to give this place a ranking on the list of all the sushi establishments I've visited it would definitely fall towards the bottom of my list for taste and quality
The English menu is the typical stuff you'd find at any American Chinese food place
Both times the food was good and the portions are generous
Parking was a breeze food choices were abundant I met my favorite Dodger and my friend caught a homerun ball which they immediately take and apparently have it signed and UPS'ed to you
I could make all that stuff in a huge portion compared to what they charge per dish
it was amazingly spicy and flavorful- the meat was lean and the portions were plenty
i had read a yelp review where the reviewer claimed the portions here were too small-i'm used to big food and i was fully satisfied
Their food is delicious and they have a huge menu
The food can be very-good or average-good and the menu changes frequently
YesPrime rib no casino buffet should be without it plus you get an offering of creamy horseradish or the plainer intense oneCheese selections snob appeal to have a cheese course after my main and prior to dessertBerries & creme anglaise on puff pastry this was soooo good I sat here an extra 15 min relishing this with coffee14 flavors of gelato/sorbet go ahead that really nice counter lady will kindly scoop several mini tastes into a platter for you
The portions were generous but not excessive and each dish was truly memorable
I don't understand actually having a disclaimer on your menu that you don't season your meat
any time you introduce the self-serve concept into food you're going to get people who act like they haven't eaten in five years and/or have never actually seen a variety of toppings before
My favorite thing on the menu is actually the fried chicken
Also considering the food they're serving and the prices the wine list is suprisingly uninspired
Every one else enjoyed the food although it wasn't warm and small portions
Food can be pricey menu is huge and so are the entrees so there's no harm in sharing an entree with a friend
Huge portions great prices and there's so much other things there to compliment the food
We mostly shop on base for the meats and some other items but this Asian market shines when you're trying to find Korean ram-en noodles and an assortment of oils kim curry and some other items that you don't typically see in US grocery stores and although we don't usually buy it their meat selection has been good the times that we've been there
The food court choices all looked bad but I had remembered hearing about this Taco Shop and since I'm a huge carne asada fan here we go
When the food came out it was a huge portion
Definitely give them a try the prices are great the food is tasty the portions are huge and the value is high
Also the food they offer is neat from pizza to white castle burgers fries and popcorn with a selection of self-serve flavor powders
Though the menu could be seen as comparatively small it's quite impossible to go wrong and there's always a good assortment of meat poultry and seafood all cooked to perfection and plated up with delicious beauty to suit the various tastes of any friends and family you may care to wow with the wonder that is Cafu00e9 Bink
They will whip up the best bagel sandwich with your choice of breakfast meat cheese and egg in no time
Wise Guy - No tomato sauce on this note that half of the pizzas on the menu do not have tomato sauce but the onions mozzarella and sausage were amazing as well just bursting with flavor
For example they now seem to have a raw food menu which I don't recall them having back in the days and their regular menu seems more extensive than before allbeit a little confusing sometimes
My husband and I both got the Blue Nile Messob which is a combination plate that includes a half portion each of beef tebbs and chicken doro wat and three full portions of any veggie side
They both seem to have their pros and cons which don't necessarily have to do with the food's flavor but more so personal preferences on texture price Blue Nile is a bit pricier than Lalibella and types of offerings Blue Nile seems to have a more extensive menu than Lalibella
Sundays and Mondays they serve raw and organic food as well as their regular menu
This is a small upscale grocery store with a small but quality selection of food and beverages as well as other household items
They have a good size deli area offering meats and cheese as well as pizza and other items
Yea the candied jalapeu00f1os are genius and it is a phenomenal burger but for me to order it medium rare every time 5 times and knowing that if I don't it will be dry I cannot give it the title of best burger in Phoenix 5 star restaurant should be perfect all around and this burger joint gets a 3 in their beef selection
I had the beef carpaccio and the risotto with artichokes off the happy hour menu and both were excellent
The menu is pretty standard for the type of food that it is but I personally find that most of the items are cooked with much more flavor than at some asian places
I like the fact that there was so much seafood on the menu try the mussels they are yummy but I think someone who is more of a meat eater might be disappointed
The one reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish they had more choices on their dessert menu
For instance I'd much rather have a meat and cheese selection from Kazimierz or bruchetta from Postinos But that was ok because the atmosphere made up for it
Good but not great food great desserts great atmosphere great for medium sized groups of friends who want to have a night out to catch up with each other's lives
The chicken pieces were of a nice size and the portion
There are a number of good pizzas to be had in Chandler--probably the most well-represented category of above-average restaurant choices in our city--- in my opinion Spinato's can hold it's own among them
Tandoori Chicken that's all I have to say to anyone who has been here and they will lapse into a curry coma of epic proportions
When the cashier rang it up it came to 39 dollars and some cents ---- I thought to myself what the heck is going on 13 dollars a person - notice it was only two side dishes ---- I said I thought that sounded like a lot --- and the cashier checked the bill - said that it was right - and then the fellow who brought the food out said - the prices are on the menu - I said I believed him just that it seemed like a lot of money for take out and not very many items
While I'm still sad that they took my favorite item off the menu the food was excellent
and if you seriously off a diet they have double meat portions
There are some great side dishes listed and we ordered a few
The Food A very sparse menu I had the carne pizza which had GREAT thin crust but lacked much flavor
Another A+  Hats off to a great burger spot that has an incredible variety of good foods and quality ingredients
I had the blackened chicken pasta and it was a good sized portion good flavor and an all around descent meal for the price
The sandwiches are piled with quality deli meats and cheeses and the 'gourmet list' included a choice of macaroni salad chips or potato salad all for $5
Ahwatukee might not be on most peoples list of places to visit while in Phoenix but after tasting the great thin pizzas here at Florencia's
This locally owned establishment has a variety of calzones salads sandwiches paninis and pizza
They have a long list of pizzas to choose from Traditional to Specialty pizzas but what makes their pizzas awesome is the dough
Please when making your menu consider customers who may have allergies or desires to eat or not eat meat
Delish-Bread and butter; the bread was warm just baked and the butter so creamy - we tried this once that our order was late the manager came over to offered it no chargeEntrees                                                      Sides-Grilled Pork chops                                  -French Fries-Ribs  chicken combo                        -Smokehouse baked beans-Barbeque baby back ribs                      -Baked Potato-Short smoked salmon                           -Creamy Cole slaw-Chicken Piccata                                      -Fried Okra-Top Sirloin                                                -Garlic Mashed potatoesThe entrees come with 1 or 2 sides depending but I listed all the ones we have tried because all items of the list have been terrific
Even the kids menu has been good my kid has tried the cheeseburger and the chicken nuggets they all come with drink and dessertIf you want to go to a nice restaurant to have an excellent time and great food I recommend you this place is superb and the service is always friendly
All the other menu items are good if not great but as I say the eggplant is one of those dishes that makes me fantasize about it while I'm eating my wife's homemade cooking
The menu is so diverse with mediterranean food
It's seafood so the regular menu is not cheap mexican
They run circles around every other sub place in the incredible variety of choices they offer and their regular sub is substantially larger and meatier than Mike's fresher and a lower price
Order up anywhere from 3-8 dishes depending on your appetite and size of party of course and share away
Each of the dessert choices sounded great but neither of us could resist the Kahlua creme brulee
The portions are insanely huge for the price you pay and well it's great quality Mexican food
I enjoyed the vast variety of vegetarian dishes to select from
The food was good pretty good sized portion and I thought it was a pretty good value but my wife and I liked ours
Another good choice would be the Sweet and Sour Chicken not as crunchy as the Orange Chicken but just as much flavor
Well the food was pretty yummy too and the happy hour menu was pretty decent
There were wide variety of burritos and maybe I picked the wrong one but all the raving about food and it was decent
The appetizers ware also great and described adequately in the menu and everyone except my uncle who ordered the lasagna and wasn't impressed was so happy by the end of the meal that we all indulged in either a specialty dessert coffee or the excellent dessert special Chocolate Soufle with vanilla ice cream which was flawless and had a great presentation
Some people think there is better pizza to be had and maybe there is but for the plain cheese variety that reminds me of the East Coast the most Buono's gets 5 stars
Extra bonus points for the large selection of cheap pizza wines
If you get a combo you're in for a mix of meat/poultry/fish your choice beans rice cheese diced tomatoes
My partner and I shared a variety of things gyros kebab chicken shwarema rice hummus which on the menu is spelled homos much to the amusement of the kids and tabouli with homemade pita bread
Pretty extensive sushi menu and variety of entrees
Just to compare it is WAY way better then Abuelo's Mexican Food Embassy which easily ranks my own list of WORST Mexican Food places
Nothing on the menu is too greasy and as far as I know most of the food is local
Sprouts also has a meat counter with seafood and a lovely bulk selection
Bottom line cheaper than Whole Foods more selection than Trader Joe's
I pretty much like everything on the menu but my absolute favs1 any of the tsoynamis2 drunken mushroom with mock chicken3 BBQ chicken sandwich4 mongolian bowl w/mock beefWho knew mock meat could be so tasty
my friend says their portions are to small But more importantly if you like dessert first go for the bread pudding like daily and if you like fancy whiskey sauce move in- I heard they have a cot in the kitchen-teehee
What kind of greedy restaurant is this that they can't refuse a table when people who told them they came to eat there can't even get anything off the dessert menu
The bottom line for me is Texaz grill is my destination of choice for chicken fried steak and ribs
As a vegetarian I am used to eating only side dishes at certain places like steak houses but to have that listed as an THE vegetarian entru00e9e is slightly insulting
Dessert menu looked good but we were stuffed
The burritos look huge because they use an over sized tortilla that hides the tiny amount of meat they use so most bites are filled with tortilla not meat
Although our waitress came back and informed us that they were out of shrimp so we opted to try it without as there aren't too many non-meat or fish options on the menu
Great vibe awesome wait staff great location incredible food wonderful drink selection and a cool patio area
While pricey the service decor food and selection are all top notch
I talked to the pretty girl at the counter and I found out that they started as a coffee shop and have been adding more food items to the menu
Food and Menu The menu is probably one of the worst menus I have ever tried to order from
The dish was SMALL too about the size of my hand and not much thicker
They have a great selection of toppings and some pretty creative specialty pizzas that are sure to please anybody who loves something different
-Cochata will change your life-Hit up their website for their story it's always cool to read up about successful food establishmentsThings I don't like-Don't let the menu fool you it gets expensive fast and the portions are small so find some coupons
the menu is very cheap for the quantity and quality of food you're getting
The food was still tasty however I had the chicken mole DH had the chingalingas and the kids each tried a mexican choice off the kids' meals
If you can stand eating among large families and battling traffic to refill your own drinks and condiment cups the Farm Grill is a good choice for the meat loving crowd
The sushi was fresh and they had a short but inventive specialty roll list
My only complaint is that the menu tells you what is included with a roll but doesnt specify whether its on the inside or the outside of it
Dessert's often the highlight of a dinner out for me and while both were good in this case with the chocolate torte being my choice it doesn't bother me at all that the first and second courses were the stars of the meal
In other words don't go there expecting artisanal innovative food selections
The food is okay- the menu has the standard TGI Friday's items like wings cheese sticks fajitas burgers etc
Z'Tejas has great margaritas DUH a great wine list and great food
The coffee is excellent they have an organic colombian a good selection of veggie friendly foods wi-fi a large outdoor patio and there is an extremely reasonably priced yoga studio on the premises which I visited for one of their intro classes and removed the kinks of several days of driving from my back
she doesn't like food in US in general so this was a great choice not spicy not just meat and carbs and not overpriced
Every time I have dined at Roy's I have ordered off the Prix Fixe menu which is a steal for such quality food
Although they have many sandwich choices my favorite is their chicken walnut salad served on dark whole grain bread
Food was okay but it was overpriced and wished they would have more of a selection
For the refinement that is so evident in the menu food and service this place offers outstanding value
Next time I'm at Noca I will definitely order it since my choice - Prime Beef Rib Eye was nothing special
The bar staff were chatty and friendly food was good and the beer selection was pretty great too
Very average food really poor service slow and subpar wine list
If Taberna continues to work out the kinks with their menu and has all their dishes available this could be a place that I'd be happy to go to all the time
These folks have fantastic Happy Hour specials constantly actual good food a decent beer selection covered/misted patio with sports TVs and constant fantastic service
Mongolian Grill - It's all you can eat Mongolian Grill with choices like Lamb Squid Chicken Beef Shrimp
Everyone ordered something from the teppanyaki menu except my sis who opted for sashimi & a couple sushi rolls which she enjoyed
I can't recall what everyone else ordered but my hubby got rocky's choice steak & chicken & I got samurai treat steak & shrimp
Menu items particularly the pizzas are easy to customize if desired
Chompies serves BIG oversized portions and I usually dont finish mine but will also try other peoples dishes when I'm there
Portions are large so unless you want to take food home get one of the mini-meals
They have a huge variety of food to choose from so whatever you feel like you can pretty much get
For me italian food is always a good choice
My main dish was a little less exciting than it looked in the menu description but still flavorful
I have had about half of the food on this menu and have never been disappointed
Lots of vegetarian choices and the pizza is really good
The food is a healthy Mexican food menu
Good food but the waitress got our order wrong even after I pointed to the item on the menu since she could not understand English
The bread is a great selection the juice that the beef is cooked in seems rather watered down and again lacks flavor
So for the Italian beef sandwich sandwich I'm going to leave this as the I'm starving to death and closer to this location than one of the competitors choice that I would only resort to in a pinch
The meat was very tender flavorful but this cut should be specified in the menu as most US diners are accustomed to pork loin
There is good variety with the food and everything is so flavorful
They do have a variety; veggie burgers turkey burgers and Kobe beef french fries sweet potato fries onion strings deep fried dill pickles dickles
This restaurant had dirty menus dirty plates/glasses slow waiters the food was unedible and the kitchen was slow
The food we had was calamari fritti and a regular sized meatball pizza
The food is tasty enough although the item selection and presentation are akin to that found in college dorm cafeterias
The thin pizza crust was great & the choices for interesting pizzas/toppings makes it a fun experiment & treat
The beers are huge the portions filling and it's fresh which is super important when eating raw fish no
although we did not get to try the bar menu-they do offer a variety of cheese flights meats and chocolates
Postino doesn't include food in its happy hour menu and Postino's happy hour ends much earlier 500 I think
Some cheap pizza joints go way to easy on the sauce but these guys keep it in proportion so it play's its proper role
They had a prix fixe menu of Lobster bisqueShrimp cocktail which they ran out of so they substituted the Coquilles St Jaques insteadBeef Wellington with chateaubriand sauceChocolate SouffleSounds delicious no
I guess the next time we're in the mood for actual New Mexican food we'll have to drive over to Rokerij and hit up the Robertson's menu there
We also ordered antipasti a separate menu resembling those you find in sushi joints where you check how many you want of each item
After food allergy issues were covered I ordered the two items I spotted on the online menu beforehand- Chicken satay app and Dhal curry
Thankfully the two menu items I ordered almost arrived simultaneously albeit after what I thought was a long wait for an app dish and soup 15 minutes for homemade soup I can understand but 15 minutes for an appetizer of four 4x1 skewers of grilled chicken skewers
Thought I'd also mention that while the take-out menu only indicated two dessert items Sanwin Makin and Mango-coconut pudding the server did show me a menu with many intriguing gelato desserts ranging from $3 scoops to $5-$8 sundaes and other creations
then Rolling Hills is the perfect choice
Four adults and a two-year-old dined on varying combinations of the aforementioned foods there's not a lot of other menu choices and spent a startling $63
The portions are generous and the prices are pretty typical for food in the 'burbs
There are typically 3-4 specials every night and always a nice selection between a vegetarian dish and a fish dish
it was a nice hefty sized chicken breast and was very succulent not dry at all like others have suggested perhaps other reviewers aren't familiar with traditional dry-rub jerk
The food is cooked fresh noticeably healthy in large portion and is remarkably low-priced
They do have a variety of food selections on the Happy Hour menu
The portions are quite large and they give you a hefty serving of meat in the sandwich
The menu provides a nice selection but the food items are a bit overpriced for the quality but not by any means bad
The food and drinks are reasonably priced with a very good selection
They had a wine aisle with quite a few good reasonably priced choices and a meat aisle with plenty of sausages beef pork and chicken cuts
I very much enjoyed the food selections including Sugar Snap Peas Shasito Peppers Kimchi Scallops with Strawberry Seared Tuna  and Pork Belly
I ordered the bbq steak over rice the food was good the portion was ok
Price raise ~20-25% but food didn't get better in fact the portion gotten smaller
They have a good wine list I started with a chardonnay the Diamond T which pairs perfectly with seafood - a little pricey at $12
I was impressed with the food the ambiance and the service - I look forward to going back again for one of their prix-fix menu events and for brunch
Moreover - they had a print of Apparition of Face and Fruit Dish on a Beach on display painting by Salvador Dali one of my favorite surrealist artists; you don't see that often
I am not generally a fan of dough-based foods so I like the fact that though the oddly large and realistic pictures of the food are faded other stuff IS offered
The dessert menu obviously looked good as we were three people and ordered three desserts
She was not only nice and friendly but extremely knowledgeable with the food menu as well as the wine menu
Everything was pretty typical of any breakfast place but I'll give it to them there is a generous amount of healthy choice dishes on the menu
The chicken salad and tuna salad sandwiches are tasty and of generous size
Time passes pretty quick in here browsing through the extensive selection of Middle Eastern spices cheeses halvas and other specialty foods
Since my fiance and I have never tried any Cambodian food we thought we'd try a good varietyJasmine Tea hot Good tea very floral and aromaticSpring Roll It was HUGE and similar to Vietnamese spring rolls
I can get far more food at other places for less money and I don't have to buy on the HH menu to keep costs down
$1 $2 and $3 food menu plus daily drink specials are hard to beat
All of the quality was decent about what I'd expect for happy hour food but not up to snuff when I eat at a place with $30+ entrees on the menu
In addition to their menu they have daily specials you know the drill - all you can eat fish Fridays stuff like that
This menu specializes in authentic Chinese Szechaun dishes
I calcuated the approximate number of calories based on nutritional information from another fast food Hawaiiian restaurant with a nearly identicial menu for a Chicken Katsu plate lunch to be a whopping 1800 calories 1200 for the chicken and 600 for two scoops of macaroni salad and one scoop of rice
I can't comment on the rest of the menu as I've only ordered the Chicken Parm
Pro--I like the variety in selection of organic foods because quite honestly no other grocery store is willing to increase their organic repertoire out here in the west valley Pro- Great parking
Some of the other food on the menu looks pretty unappetizing
The Ahi Salad and the Miso Salmon are two gems on the menu and I was shocked when I tried those dishes and they were phenominal as far as bar food goes
Many of us were not interested the set 4-course meal and wanted food/drinks from the regular menu
Also the roll ingredients aren't listed on the sushi order sheet
The menu is your typical bar food but it's good
Putsy's has a great menu of sandwiches and salads but they are known for their chicken and steak
I go to lunch there at least a couple of times a week for the Caddyshack Basket 3 huge chicken fingers come with fries and toast and your choice of 2 sauces for dipping - however always looking for something good that's low-carb I get the Caddyshack Basket with no fries or toast
I don't eat meat so the fact that they have such a large variety of veggie choices makes it all the worth while for me
I've had other things on the menu but what keeps me coming back is their chicken katsu and super friendly service
the prime rib dip looked so good on the menu but what showed up at my table was a weak dried up little sandwich with no flavor chewy overcooked meat and served on what was nothing more than a tiny hard oversized breadstick
Their sangria is delicious also  Some of my  favorite menu items Butternut Squash Ravioli Prime Rib Eggs Benedict Tacos anyVeggie DipChicken Nachos their salsa is great Panko Crusted CalamariCilantro Jalapeno & Edamame HummusChocolate Cake MMMmmm
They have the same setup with the white rice with green seaweed things in it and choice of meat beans etc
The menu at Herb Box is filled with lots of options for salads sandwiches wraps flatbreads why can't we just call them pizzas
Big selections of menu from appetizers to sushi to entrees and noodle dishes
and Eel nigiri decent but prefer the ones at Sakana with much bigger size of the fish
I look up the menu and order a pesto pizza and decided to go get it our selfs
When it came time for us to order she was great help with the menu and we decided on the Cantonese Black Dragon Beef and the Szechuan chicken
My food was the perfect serving size with just the right amount of rice but the sauce was drastically different than any other szechuan dish I've ever had and the some of the chicken was diced into itsy bitsy little pieces that funked with the texture
After saying we were not interested in dessert she proceeded to spend 15 minutes telling us about the new items on the menu
00 the fish is a little expensive but was served with a nice size piece of fish and the good serving of fries
Also their sushi options are so limited that they shouldn't even have it on the menu
The price to portion ratio is very fair and $9 will get me enough food for 2 meals
While they carried personal-sized ceramic dishes I was looking for a larger metal variety--they pointed me to ABC Baking Supplies
The idea of the Cornish Pasty lends itself to a diverse palate and the desserts the beer selection even the coffee here is very good
I guess the spring roll part is like a sushi menu with boxes to mark off but the majority of the menu is not
There was a large selection of food from oysters on the half shell to artisan cheeses to fish and chips to steak to popcorn shrimp
The food is always good the service is always a little lackluster but without blame as those guys and gals bust their backends considering how busy the place is always and the prices are really fair especially considering portion sizes and happy hour specials
We both had the swordfish and were extremely happy with our choice
The portion size was just right for the main dish but we also ordered a salad and a side dish that put us a little overboard
I've tried a couple other menu items but always come back to the chicken
The service was good a lot of seating the menu was decent as well but both of our dishes we got were just okay
They offer up a full selection of spirits a nice variety of food items and a friendly staff
The pre-selected menu had good options and while nothing spectacular the food was still good
On Mondays you can get a brick-oven pizza of your choice normally 11
but you can have your choice of everything from sushi rolls to steak and everything in between
Why no fifth star-good portion for me for the chicken others might find it small; if so get the chicken/ribs combo-no sound on the tvs at the bar
-not a large variety of steaks on the menu more of a nice restaurant than a steakhouseOverall really liked the food here; would definitely come back here or visit the one in Sac or Chicago just for the cornbread
The pizza's were hot fired in the oven and just about the right size to feed one person
xx and listened to my kids gripe about being hungry for over an hour until the food came out
TIPS-* Try their breakfast on Sat/Sun* If eating dinner order some of the veg NOSH and don't be afraid to get a couple to try the 3 pair is the best deal* Pizza's are all very good* The meat/cheese board also yummy* Extensive wine menu
The food is okay but that's to be expected given the pedestrian menu
We also ordered chicken with broccoli with a white sauce which was an enormous portion and again everyone enjoyed
We probably could have gotten away with ordering three dishes or a small size instead of all large
I would recommend Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen to anyone who likes Cajun food or Seafood there is so much to choose from and basically the server said we could change anything on the menu to have it made just the way we wanted
And the Thai iced coffee is so damn good they should list it under desserts
Of course because I myself am tacky-yet-unrefined my choices only have gone as far as pizzas but pizza in itself can obviously pose a great challenge
I dont think there is really anything spectacular about this joint the food was good the menu was standard
I had the Tofu Manchurian a nice chana dish I haven't had before not Chana Masala plain rice there are several other choices for rice an okra dish some nice fresh salad and some IEEE NaF on the side
The menu is very diverse with many pork chicken beef seafood and rice and noodle options
It reminded me of an Italian Pei-Wei with the menu's on the wall and registers where you order then grab a seat and drink and wait for  your food to be delivered
I loved it but while the pizzas are good sized - 12 they aren't very substantial and after finishing off a whole pizza myself I had a piece of the bruchetta and two more  pieces of pizza and still was filled
All of the sushi rolls on the special menu were either deep fried or covered in spicy mayo
Their menu is vast  with many great choices on pizzas sandwiches salads appetizers burgers and some other entrees as well
The menu is extensive and of course since I wanted to get a pizza to go I didn't get a chance to try any of the menu items
We sat outside and enjoyed a variety of food from the menu
00 and they get a fairly good sized pizza I think it's their medium and a drink
In addition to meat and fish entrees the menu offers a wonderful vegetarian dish for each course which included choices like a potato saffron and parsnip soup and a salad that had fennel endive and olives
Foodwise the new slimmer menu was a bit sad for me
As I've mentioned before the Mediterranean Chicken Salad is my favorite salad on the menu but while dining with my Mom I learned a helpful tip that makes the salad even better
I also spotted Maine lobster bisque on the online menu and had asked Matt if roux or * was used as a thickener if * then I couldn't have it but like most quality restaurants Wildfish uses only roux
It's so refreshing to know that there are restaurants who have staff who are willing to take the time to listen to their customers and be willing to tweak their recipes so that people w/ food issues may still enjoy many menu options
Many years ago we'd visit for Sunday brunch which had a breakfast buffet with a huge selection of breakfast Mexican food
I'll return sometime soon for a full meal but I'm not going to bank on this place topping my list of great Mexican food
The food and service were great with large portions and a good selection of organic meant and fish
The menu has pizza salads two appetizers and two desserts
The selection of stores and food is vast
Dessert selection isn't very extensive but who cares when they served up the most amazing Banana Creme Pie
The menu was huge so you could pick from a  huge assortment of foods
It is cute that desserts are placed at the top of the menu in the beginning but they should put the dessert at the top of the bill too
Great selection of toppings and variety of pizzas HOWEVER it does you no good when you can't taste them with wet dough
There's a ton of busy Camelback restaurants but it seems the choice is often between fast food pizza or pricey event dining in the Biltmore or Esplanade
Order the chicken chimi supreme it's not on the menu but it's always a known by your waiter
I enjoyed the personal sized thin crust pizza and chicken noodle soup
Old Chicago has a decent drink menu so if you feel like accompanying your pizza with an ice cold margarita or beer I promise you won't be disapponted
You get your choice of meat and they cook it on the tabletop with fried rice and seasonal veggies which I liked bc usually you get white rice and some brocoli with carrots
LaceyChipotle cream was hard-hitting like Dick Tracy Had a slurp of buffalo chiliBona fide good if only I had a WillyPortions are healthy not large and sillyDessert sampler was flavorful and dreamyMocha Macchiato was caramel and creamyMmmm Mmmm-Smile so big it's gleamyLunch menu less than 475 caloriesPrice points easy on your salaryEntrees change as often as Facebook galleriesWill have to come back for some moreTrying new things is never a boreEspecially if it helps my washboard
We were quickly seated given menus and water and then left to peruse the food selections
The portions on the food were generous; I definitely had enough left over to make a good-sized lunch the next day
We tried a variety of food including arancini drunken cheesy bread strands w meatballs and minestrone soup
Roaring Fork's entire menu is a blend of comfort food and Southwestern flavors
I enjoy it a great deal and I'd say this is a very solid choice if you're in the mood for inexpensive Chinese food
While I disagree with the philosophy of their menu I respect their methodology and see that they are interested in doing something more than just sell as much food as possible
After watching Payton butcher a pig at Devoured I really had no choice but to see what kinds of food this guy pumped out
Quite the opposite in that fresh quality ingredients are used and a lot of thought has gone into creating the dishes on the menu
Thai food to me is about the spices- the portions can easily be bulked up with tofu or veggies or something
Good selection of made-from-scratch Italian food
Recently enjoyed a thali dinner which consists of papadum; choice of chutney mango or hot carrot; sambar tomato-based soup; raita yogurt-based soup with cucumbers and spices; daal curry-based soup consisting of lentils and spices; tamarind soup*; choice of entree; two pooris deep-fried bread puffs- I asked to substitute paratha- pan-fried wheat bread; basmati rice; and dessert one pc
The food was disgusting and the waiter wasn't able to give me any details on what was on the menu
The lunch specials are affordable and in portions that are just right for someone who doesn't want a food coma before 3PM
After finding myself in a 50 minute wait for sushi and hunger pains greater than I have ever experienced I had to make a choice
Although the food was divine the staff I encountered seemed to be the element that truly places this quaint authentic Italian restaurant at the top of my list for all time
My wife and daughter took me to Secreto's last night for Father's Day Dinner and we were all very impressed with the menu service and food
The menu also mentions that most food can be cooked in 4 or 5 minutes which is interesting since with a half full restaurant we still waited 30 minutes for our food

I got the menudo which is more like a beef stew
The restaurant itself is nice but it just doesn't seem to fit the food it seems very western and I would expect to see a menu for rustic American food as opposed to the Italian fare they serve

They are smaller than what you'll find at RA or any old Uncle Wangs's Sushi Parlour but what they lack in size they make up for in pure culinary devastation
They are a very consistent 3+ to 4 star rating although with some minor changes to their menu to include lamb and a few other more popular Mediterranean dishes they could easily go to a 4+ to 5 star rating
The same AWESOME/CHEAP food menu 2 & 3 bucks for several appetizers still applies

It seemed like the parts and the sizes were right but somehow it didn't have the taste of good sushi
As of now the menu is divided into Freddo and Caldo options and I made my meal of the Butterfish with a citrus glaze the Hamachi with black garlic and truffle oil and the Risotto which had a massive mushroom seared on top and kind of gross to think about but tasty nonetheless cock's comb
However if I'm ever in the area again I know you really can't miss with this place with it's great atmosphere excellent service and solid food selections
They have so many dishes that can only be found on their menu like Thai Jerky and Duck 4-5 different ways that one must go back
Sunflower is still my place of choice for prices but I come to Whole Foods for the hard to find stuff
the Hawaiian Martini is great and wonderful choices on the food side we had spicy tuna roll
For around 10 dollars and less you can choose from a variety of meats and sides
For the price and the quality of food this makes it an easy choice to come to
Salads are always a great choice and don't worry you get a plate overflowing with food too
they have every teriyaki dish available and bunch of fried rice and noodle choices and for those that like rabbit food vegetable dishes
As other locations Trader Joes has a good selection of organic food items for really good prices
I was impressed with the good variety in the menu from salads to burgers pasta seafood and more
I came across a different kind of listing crepes and decided to try their seafood one
There's a variety of tapas such as jalapeno-bacon-wrapped shrimp as appetizers and the entrees are classics such as Delmonico steak chicken breast char and a seafood medley
We stayed away from the menu items that are obviously there to satisfy the less adventurous and aimed at what we thought were the more traditional Burmese dishes
On subsequent visits we have been treated to most every Burmese dish on the menu including a number of items not on the menu
There are many more authentic Burmese dishes on the menu but if you only try what might already be familiar to you you will not have mustered the courage to try something new and wonderful
The grilled meat smelled good although when does grilled meat not so I stepped up to their little table setup and surveyed a grill full of what looked like flattened chicken thighs and their menu sign which offered a limited selection from their regular menu $5 Chicken $7 Beef Short Ribsor $7 Meat Combo-all with white rice and macaroni salad
After spending a few moments politely describing the larger portions I've seen everyone else sporting and asking for either more food or a discount YM refuses
The choice of Shreiner for their meat provision told me a lot without having to ask
Tucked away in the main dining room our little group of four decided to order a number of items for the table to share Thyme & Parm Crispbread Garlic Chicken Flatbread Artichoke Stuffed Artichoke Leaves Crab Stuffed Mushrooms and the dinner-sized portion of Goat Cheese Ravioli
Everything was palatable though I couldn't really recall any particular dish without taking another peek at the menu
Despite having about as many restaurants per capita as is physically possible Old Town offers up a pretty meager selection of wine bars and good Mexican food but that's a topic for another time
Cafe Villaggio is scrupulously clean the food is really pretty good and people running it are sweet as pie which they should immediately add to their menu to achieve lunchtime perfection
The food on the other hand was extremely overpriced contained small portions and lacked flavor in general
Big selection of products and their own Sprouts brand is more affordable than the Whole Foods brand
For here not just food is on the menu but a spiritual awakening itself as proven by the restaurant's liberal use of wise sayings
Both dishes were incredible perfectly cooked and well seasoned with appropriate portion sizes
Shopping at Whole Foods is as much a political choice to say 'Fuck you' to Kraft Coca Cola and General Mills as it is voting with your money
The food is pretty good and the portions are definitely fillings
The food is very reasonably priced huge portions very fresh food and very very delicious
Here are some of my favorites some have meat from before I was a vegetarian*the medchilada a giant burrito wrapped in lavosh no longer on menu but they still make them upon request at this location* the hummus I like half roasted red bell pepper and half cilantro jalapeno this explodes with flavor and is a great starter for non-hummus consumers* tsatziki they have the best tsatziki ever omg just the right amount of seasoning I could drink this stuff* gambas con ajo jumbo shrimp swimming in a delicious light red sauce served with a pesto cheese covered pita* MTB mozzarella tomato basil with evoo and balsamic huge slices and very fresh* grilled vegetable salad huge and covered in yummy veggies thought it would be weird to have hot veggies on a bed of salad but oh-no-sir this is sooo yummy
Only further up on the list is my love of Pizza and Pasta more on that in the next post
The sandwiches use a reasonable portion of meats and other ingredients which balance the sandwich not bury it in the bread
I wish I could shop here all the time because they have my favorite types of food and the quality of their food selection is second to none
I love their meat and seafood selection because they have the premium cuts and freshest seafood
Make sure you look over the menu first so you could put in your food order right when the wait person comes around
Not this place - lots of big machines available on a Saturday afternoon and lots of other size machine ready to roll
The fish were fresh the spice was just enough the size of the rolls were perfect I hate it when I cant fit the whole thing in my mouth
Hoan has a diverse menu of Vietnamese and Chinese dishes
We were finally seated and were provided with food-covered menus and a basket of chips and watery flavorless salsa
The Starbucks drinks are a dollar higher than the other Starbucks locations and the food court menu is expensive and leaves a lot to be desired
Haiku Grill has a pretty extensive sushi and non-sushi menu and is a good alternative to Mill Ave
they also give you a goodly sized snickerdoodle cookie to munch on after you've gorged yourself on chinamex food
Dragonfly combines what I like about Vietnamese food variety flavor price with what I like about a modern trendy restaurant good decor modern music attentive servers
It needed more spice which I assume probably came with the chicken portion of the meal
One menu describes the variety of dishes offered while another is a straight list of appetizers entrees & desserts
At least we can cross this place off of our Food Bucket listHappy Eating
The portion of food you get for the price definitely won't leave you hungry
Can't wait for them to extend their hours and add more Korean dished on their menu
The menu Not as many dishes as I've seen at Ethiopian places back home but they have all the classics
I have eaten through almost the entire menu and have not found one dish on the menu that I ever crave and WANT to eat again
Didi our server moved quickly was efficient and attentive and was even helpful in suggesting alternate selections to those who had never had Thai food before
Food selection is great lots of snacks and alcohol
To be honest though you can get the same quality pizza at Cibo's in a tiny fraction of the time that it takes your name to move up one spot on the list
The 'Aunt Chilada Special' is my favorite - a cubed spicy beef filled enchilada covered with both red and green sauces topped off with cheese and sour cream served with a choice of sides I normally go with rice and 'fidao' sp - kinda Mexican spagetti
The food is a slight step up from regular sports bar food they have a great variety of Italian food
To me this says that the staff does not want to do dishes If something is on your menu keep it there when people find something they like they will come back no matter how much it costs if they know it will be there
with the crusts cut off followed by 2 scones with an assortment of toppings followed by a pastry dish of 8 different bite-sized desserts

They offer a variety of sandwiches salads baked goods and mesquite rotisserie chicken yum
What we hadChicken Florentine Crepes and Crispy Banana Caramel CheesecakeThis was not our first choice
New favorite pinto beans in town sorry America's Taco ShopNot a fan of the Dogshark tacoChicken Mole & Conchinita were T'AstyGenerously portioned $6
Once I first tried the food menu I was insanely hooked
Our waitress never asked us if we had any questions re the menu once we ordered she never came back to ask if we needed anything else or if the food was to our liking
It has good portions of ribs chicken pork and beef so you can sample from everything
The portion size are moderate which is nice to not be served enough food for a small village for one
We each sampled the other's selection and all agreed each dish was savory and unique
Even though that is the correct portion size I guess you are just so used to seeing huge slabs of meat when you order steak
Our server Cort was informative and answered our questions about some of the menu items and we watched what others ordered as the dishes came out of the kitchen
Unfortunately everything I have ordered the pizza salad and a tuna sandwich have sounded better than they actually tasted the service is also really slow even in the middle of the day and both times they have been out of my first selection
The food offers a wide variety to choose from and I like that many of the apps and entrees are created for a sharing environment

The desserts are not on the happy hour menu but they are definitely delicious
We waited forever to get menus drink and food orders etc

Pretty disappointing especially since the saucer sized side dish was $3
Cafe Zupas has quite a few healthy choices of food from soups to salads and sandwiches
I can do healthy food and if the menu were more like Zoe's I would probably be a fan
The lunch menu is limited to rice dishes curry and pad thai noodles
We try their signature dish of Thai Basil which is a stir fry of your choice of meats and vegetables
The hostess recommended the chicken tikki masala and perhaps we should have listened to her
The staff is knowledgable about the wine they serve the food and preparation methods used by the chef which is nice to hear when making and selection
The chicken was okay but barbeque chicken isn't really my thing I only ordered it for variety because I didn't want three pork dishes
Barrio Cafu00e9 has an interesting menu presenting thoughtfully prepared Mexican dishes with flair
The price point is a bit higher than average for Mexican food in Phoenix but offers a more sophisticated and elegant range of choices if you're looking for something slightly upscale
meals included meat choice of Chicken pesto Tri and Pork and two sides
Great food and service and loved the variety
Their burgers come in various meats later and three sizes - sliders regular one-third pound and call-the-coronary-ER
I haven't tried the sushi but their dessert selection is kind of sad
OK guys and gals - this is it number one in the valleyNothing compares we have eaten the menu from top to bottom - its all 100% quality food
Ordering your food is really simple their menu is really basic and its easy to figure out what you want to eat
I typically like sausage on my pizza but their seasoned hamburger has replaced it as my topping of choice
Since my last review they've changed the happy hour menu to a Customer Appreciation menu that is available Sunday through Thursday with smaller portions of the normal sushi no more lettuce in the rolls
Listen we all know the food is ridiculously good no matter if you're sober drunk or whether it's day night or after you already ate somewhere else
My favorite menu item is the Lady chipotle cream cheese fried pickles and sauteed onions with a chicken dog and easy on the cream cheese
While I've tried nearly everything on the menu at least once during my 20 years of frequenting the place hell does that date me or what my AZ88 standard is the Picnic Chicken Sandwich with a side of homemade waffle fries and a Long Island Iced Tea
As far as the food goes the menu is a kind of bastardized Italian

The lounge has an eclectic menu which features Fruit De Mar tempura fried calamari shrimp and scallops the very popular Belgian snack of Mussels and Frites mussels dish served with a side of french fries Adana Kebabs served with pita and yogurt and even an American favorite the short rib sandwhich
Many more seafoods and steaks grace this menu for an average cost of $32
It's a bakery and deli that offers a fine selections of meats cheeses and breads
I'm definitely going to go back and get that pizza again and try some of the other things on their pretty vast menu
It might be one of those things like true food kitchen where you need to ask your server to guide you to the menu items that have good value for the price
Towards the end of the meal the waiter was getting a little short tempered and we had to ask another waiter to bring us the dessert menu
Didn't really bother to peek at the menu so when the waiter walked up and asked what I wanted I said chicken and waffles
The extra charge for meat isn't even listed on the menu but they do list the extra charge for their sucky guacamole
For lunch or dinner - not the greatest menu but the food isn't horrible
One of the choices was fry chicken with mash-potato yes that is on the list I think you can go to KFC and get better chicken and potato
There were plenty of food choices and all I tried were good
I have finally come to the conclusion that 2 plates of food plus dessert are all I can handle any more so I had my two plates of food and in that I had at least 20 different items in small portions
i also appreciate the portions you get plenty of food but its not huge like most places now
So as I was perusing the menu -- scanning scanning -- I was anxiously asking myself Where's the meat
i liked the limoncello cheesecake without absolutely loving it but it was good enough that i'd try something else from their dessert menu next time
It was a really sizeable piece of chicken but I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce and the beans and rice were just so-so
The food was of a generous proportion so bear this in mind when ordering
Its a small family run place that specializes in chicken tenders and that's about it but what they lack in menu diversity they make up in quality
The corn pizza was also a generous portion and seemed quite good from the bite I got
The food is slightly pricey and none of the menu items jumped out at me
We've been 3 times once during the weekend when every table was full but the variety of food was better
I ordered the lunch portion of the Crawfish Etoufee and M had the lunch cocount shrimp and fries with a side of hush puppies

We ordered four entrees --  A combo Nam Yeung Noodle salad I forgot the Korean name Pork Tonkatsu Seafood Tofu Soup and a dinner portion of Kalbi
The Airport has lots of mini art galleries and great internet and the book stores do me right and the food choices are good for an airport
Food's decent with reasonable prices for BBQ wings and more but the extra star comes from the variety of flavors you can get
As with most restaurants in this genre the food can be heavy and portions are stupidly big but for the most part everything tastes okay
Food portions are huge so well worth your bang for your buck
We also go the souffle cake the only REAL chocolate dessert on the menu
We had a lot of fun here splitting the cheapest bottle of wine on the menu and enjoying some pretty good food
There are over 20 items to choose from and it comes with rice white fried or brown and a choice of either an eggroll fountain drink or soup egg drop wonton or hot & sour
I mean the menu stated that all lunch specials include rice but usually when you order a noodle dish at an asian joint that does not apply
You won't have to listen to complicated explanations for why their pizza takes so long
There isn't much variety though and some of the food from here tastes like crap
I do appreciate their 'healthy' options on the menu with calorie #s too and I do appreciate their salad bar that has a pretty good selection note that dessert is part of the salad bar
If you can't get burger right when a big portion of your menu is burgers and you send out clearly burnt chicken nuggetswhich are frozen from costco then someone in the kitchen is looking at the food as it is sent out
We had expected reasonably good bar food although the menu definitely showed some aspiration to better things
They were serving food and drinks so we ordered a round of drinks and took a look at the menu
I was happy to see a wide variety of food including boneless wings pizzas and sandwiches
I've tried most of the dishes on the menu and everything tasted great
I love Whole Foods from their abundant selection of vegan and vegetarian options to their wonderful employees
I'm no food critic but if I was this place would be on top of my list of places to go
They've got more of a food selection that you might think
The sub was good as the bread seemed fresh the meatballs were well sized and full of meat and not too much bread/filler
I always order the appetizer sampler with my brother Spring roll egg rolls crab puff and fried shrimp and the variety of flavors was superb
I ordered the Pollo Encebollado described in the menu only as chicken with onions
Because every roll on the menu and specialty rolls not on the menu are all glorified California rolls
The pizza is pretty good artisan style pizza but small portion for two
We were still hungry after an appetizer and pizza good lunch portions
Other than the lack of variety with taste the restaurant is great to pick up food from
What we ordered1 Pork Belly Pastrami2 Bacon Fat Popcorn3 The Original Chopped Salad4 Chicken & Waffles5  Burrata6  Grilled Halloumi Cheese7  Everything Bread Pudding8  A variety of cocktails including The PersianI highly recommend EVERYTHING listed above to order for the table

Highly recommend this place the items on the menu are extremely well thought out the prices are amazing for the food you get -5
Food was good staff was ok they do need to update the menu discovered a minor mistake on something they no longer offer but we thought the prices were decent anyhow
But it was definitely quality white-meat chicken - and they gave you a large portion of it - for only $9 so you gotta give props to that
The portion was average sized and came with fried rice an egg roll and a wonton with sweet and sour sauce
the name of the restaurant features food-brats specifically but then the menu says they created the food to complement beer
The menu doesn't pair up food specifically with beer
The new menu was the only reason I tried RT food again I usually just drink there for HR

The lemon chicken was so crispy and perfectly cooked and the shrimp dish was absolutely delicious and a very ample portion
I like the price and food selection ranging from pho to noodles to shark fin soup I must try it
With so vast a selection I find it hard to be on point with all dishes
I thought the fired rice was rather bland and greatly benefited from a healthy dose of soy sauce WARNING not fish sauce is in smaller sized soy sauce bottle
Extra star for doing b-fast foods during the day and for having the California burrito on the menu
The staff was immediately friendly and the menu offered us our choice of a variety of options ranging from salads to brunch to pizza

It's set up as a restaurant but really there isn't that much food on the menu
so I end up ordering my favorite roll the veggie tempura roll off the menu
The food is excellent and from what I can tell the set menu changes regularly
There was a separate menu for the Deal Chicken people which was nice - it was a 3-course meal for 2
The simplicity of the menu allows us to center in on the food & not be drowned under 5 pages of fluff like other restaurants

Almost everything on the menu has meat butter or cheese on it
Moving next to my dessert selection one of the frequently noted best dishes in Phoenix and denoted as an Award Winning Favorite on the restaurant menu the Chocolate and Butter Fry Bread would prove to be every bit the Fair Food extravagance I expected with the same airy dough this time served openfaced and drizzled - nay - ladled first with butter and then with melted dark chocolate tinged with what I believe was adobe spice and cinnamon

I had the following geisha roll which has ahi tataki cucumber lotus root cream cheese and red bell peppers osuimono a soup with ebi & japanese cucumber snow peas carrots w/ ginger in clear broth maguro tuna nigiri The roll was tasty and just the right size for enjoying in one large yet manageable bite
The most popular dish they ask me to bring back is Mongolian Beef which is a huge portion of thinly sliced beef mixed with scads of green onions
Oh and also they menu was very limited and the food was bland
They also have quite a few desserts on the menu including a really delicious oreo shake
The food included huge portions at fair prices and it helped that it was delicious
It's clear they've put a lot of passion into the space and the menu and the food and it really shows
My only gripe is that after I had ordered and sat down to wait for my food a couple of guys came in and the guy at the counter immediately handed them paper menus with actual descriptions of the menu items I'm sure unlike the chalkboard on the wall which I would have liked
Our favorites* Plato de carne basically a huge fajita plate with better meat--you get your choice of meat with grilled veggies beans & rice and tortillas* Chicken chimichanga their chicken is marinated and always fabulous and I'm a sucker for a good chimi* Salmon tacos big chunks of salmon white cheddar and homemade mango salsa--my wife's staple
The food is great here and the portions huge
Food is good drinks are good and THEY HAVE COTTON CANDY along with a mechanical bull which is on my list to-do
As I filled up on chips I checked out the menu and was torn between the shrimp fajitas and fish tacos
The food was the tiniest portions ever too
The side dishes are a value at $5 and were healthy portions
Big portions I always had lots of leftovers cheap food and a simple approach
When you go be prepared that not all dishes may be on the menu during your visit
I'd be happy if I didn't catch it just before dinner hit so I would have had some hot food choices but no luck
I would love this dish in a small appetizer portion with a creamy polenta or some other starch
They have a large variety of rices generally in large bags various fruits and vegetables not normally found in American groceries many prepared foods seasoning packs and much more
I know often times the food off the menu is better but I can't honestly see how it could be too much better at this place
3 Soy - Do your own research but too much soy is just not healthy yet it is in nearly every dish on the menu
Dessert tray consisted of a collection of espresso cups filled with a variety of standard offerings
The menu is extensive and has all the traditional Vietnamese dishes I expected
Most places I goto that have a smaller menu I figure that it's due to them keeping it simple and as a result having really good food
Now I totally missed the disclaimer on them menu saying that they do not season meat but had I seen that it would of explained alot
Also, for those of you who are cautious to try raw fish sushi, Kiku Sushi offers a variety of sushi with smoked fish and also 100% vegetarian sushi
and a variety of other non-fish based dishes
The portions are purposely small to encourage trying a variety of dishes, and it also keeps lunch and dinner more affordable for those of us on a budget
Poor front desk service large portions average price and mediocre food pretty much sums it up
this pizza wasn't on the menu but clearly should beThe price to portion and price to value ratio are so clearly positive at Tommy V's that I didn't even bother to create a chart
There were no booths the portions of food were smallish served on picnic plates & the chips were very ordinary
I would feel comfortable bringing my parents and dates here as I was impressed with the overall feel of the resturant along with the excellent food good sized portions wide menu variety and cheap prices
friendly staff good fast service huge portions of delicious food and very reasonable prices
The teppan is a little pricey the sushi is consistantly good they also offer the all you can eat sushi and the sake selection is ok very average
They have a big menu to choose from and the food is as authentic as it gets
They offered a selection of Louisiana hot sauces to zip up your dish
$5 giant sized appetizers are big enough for a meal and so delicious - especially the calamari taquitos and avocado rolls
This is a NY chain with an extremely simple menu - 3 types of pizza red white or pesto all with the same quasi thin crust dough and a layer of cheese
- regardless of pizza size - so you are best ordering the largest one possible and sharing it instead of ordering your own personal pizzas
they give you a pretty good portion of meat and peppers but the only thing that bothered me was how soggy the bread got from the juices
The menu is primarily Ecuadorian Peruvian and Colombian but is peppered with dishes from other nearby countries such as Argentina
Sat outside and the patio was nice and our waitress was great now lets talk about the food  the menu has changed alot since we were here and not  for the better  we ordered the guacamole $6
99 for a very small portion of flavorless guac we had to add so much salt just to get any flavor out of it we ordered the chicken fajitas and it had about six  strips of very dry chicken on a bed of greasy onions and that's it veggie fajitas were onions and peppers a few mushrooms and a couple pieces of zucchini everything was so overcooked and caramelized it was just a greasy mess
Excellent lunch menu with a few dozen options to choose from they specialize in hot and spicy foods but will make anything for you with no heat by request
Oh by the way lots of folks get double meat but with the soba I might go into a comatose state if I tried that one so I just get the regular meat portion
I wonder if there was no room on the menu for it and the Cajun pizza
Various grilled artisan cheese sandwiches cold sandwichescheese and meat plates adorn the simple menu
Food is well prepared good proportions and the little shop is well decorated
Meat is tender and there are a decent selections of toppings
As we came in near close the chef enthusiastically greeted us from behind the sushi bar we were seated promptly and a very nice young lady helped us through the menue
My ten point scale ratingFood - 5 averageAmbience - 1 poorService - 1Price - 5The January issue of Phoenix Magazine lists Mi Comida as one of the 85 best restaurants in Phoenix and I think this may have overwhelmed the kitchen and waitstaff
My two favorite Healthy Items on the menu is the Chicken Salad Fruit Plate and the Lean Turkey Pita
The food court is very large with a decent selection of food
You get a HEAPING portion of everything it contains I usually just get beef and the Pho staples
if you are looking for a boring way to sustain life for just long enough to have a boring night with boring people in a boring place and on a boring day of the week at a boring time of day and with boring food and boring drink boring menus and boring specials boring beers and boring desserts all while being mind-numbingly bored then I say to youe-l-e-p-h-a-n-t-b-a-r
I went to Old Town Tortilla Factory in Old Town Scottsdale which combines two of my favorite dining elements-a classy atmosphere with tasty Sonoran-influenced food the menu also has Native American influences too
They do passably good Cantonese barbeque and the stewed meats and on the go sections usually have good and tasty selections
If you opt for one of their soups their chicken noodle is quite good although it isn't at the top of my list for chicken noodle soups
Their take-out menu states on the front The Best Beef Noodle Soup In Town - believe it
Plus if you do succumb to being overwhelmed by choices and your food sucks it's your fault
The food is your typical Mexican/Southwestern variety and isn't anything fancy but also isn't watered down to Macayo's-level blandness
I've never been delayed and the food selection during layovers is decent - I recommend the burrito place
While they do have several vegetarian options on the lunch menu I would remind you that the sweet little family that owns and operates Beaver Choice is Swedish by way of Poland
The menu looks so lovely with all it's meatless fare and fresh sounding ingredients but I felt a kind of emptiness after dining here
But they are speedy with getting the food and drinks out despite how busy it is so it's all good They have a great beer selection of course  If I do get a beer I always like their Peach beer
If you are looking for other entru00e9e options their menu also boasts sandwiches Donburi style of meal selection of meats simmered and served over rice or other entrees such as Teppan Chicken or Samurai Steak
The mains were the Jalisco panini the club and the breakfast sandwich off the brunch menu  Now the Jalisco came out and was what seemed to be cheep deli sliced chicken and pre-packed avocado on the sandwich despite the jalipanios it was very bland the club came out not even what you would thing a club would be it was just a grilled turkey sandwich
As far as the pho the choices are limited and the meat and broth doesn't have the traditional flavor
because of the variety of ingredients and dishes I get to sample that I otherwise may not order if it was a-la-carte
Had three of the four desserts on the menu
Everything from the food to the wine selection to the waitresses to the chefs make this place an extreme diamond in the rough in Peoria
We have ordered a variety of items from their menu but our favs are cashew chicken w/extra cashews flamingo special chicken egg fried rice veggie chow mein beef & broccoli & their egg rolls
[Fortunate for Bloom the happy hour food menu is worth coming back for- we'll just know better to park ourselves at the bar like I usually do when I dine solo
However the food is great and portions are plentiful
Not sure who initially qualified this restaurant as such but my definition of a Gastropub is a location which serves gourmet-ish comfort casual beer-friendly food with an extensive selection of craft beers and select liquors in a Euro-type setting
The menu is small again small kitchen and based mostly on small plates and about 3-4 main dishes
FOODThe chic mini tapas sized portions are fun and look adorable

A large selection of food concessions are located on the main concourse
Their service selection and sushi are tried-and-true
The brunch menu is not as big as I would have liked for it to be but overall the food was decent and the price was alright
The menu has stayed the same but the food just doesn't have the same attention t detail
The BF and I wanted to share a few small things so we got a personal size meat topping pizza the name totally forgotten after what happens next and some buffalo chicken sliders
and there are lots of good reasons on their menu why they are still serving ono-licious Hawaiian style food
This steakhouse is definitely in my top 5 not because I like the steak but because they have a great fish selection as well
They have your choice of white or red pizzas - they have this white pizza with italian meats that is addicting
I'm not usually the kind of gal that likes bar food but really had no choice since my Mesa Chamber of Commerce Networking Group was holding it's meeting there
the flavors were good though and if the pork hadn't been dry and if the potatoes were done I could see this dish being a solid choice* $25 for two vodka martini's on a Saturday afternoon
The food is on par with Olive Garden though the menu is not as deep
The figs and apricots looked wonderful but they're on my food allergy suspicion list and I did not want to risk ruining a great dinner experience with these two women at my side
Great desserts which will make up for ordering a healthy but large salad on the menu
This place has typical grocery food with a decent bakery and bread selection
Their menu is nearly identical to Panda's with the predictable 2 or 3 item plate and their food offerings are all pretty similar too
They also keep smaller portions on hand instead of the giant heaps of food you find at Panda
My mom's beef stew was hearty and served with a good sized piece of fry bread and was quite tasty
I am always disappointed to see such huge portions coming out of a professional kitchen because I realize how much food is headed toward the trash bin each day
I love sprouts this one doesn't have as good of a meat department so it isn't my first choice but more of a   go to  place cuz it's close
All the Ah-So's are a chain but they do not all offer the same food choices

The smell is very indicative of the food - standard inexpensive delicious Ethiopian cuisine complex flavors huge variety vegan friendly if not encouraging and utensil-less
If you're super hungry you may just need all that injera and more because the portions of each dish are just a little small for a very hungry Joe
You receive a generous portion of meat and then the salsa guac etc
For the price you pay there's not much variety soppy rice + chicken + scraps of rubbery cabbage and broccoli + sugary viscous dressing that is teriyaki sauce
Food was pretty good although we just stuck with the happy hour menu
I am originally from the Chicago area so deep dish is my first choice for pizza
Gee thanks d*ckhead for doing us the favor of eating your lukewarm food while listening to screaming from the kitchen
A prospective customer at Sakana must check out the Customer Appreciation Sushi Roll menu before ordering from the main menu
Customer Appreciation rolls are the full size rolls at most Japanese restaurants in California and tastes just as good if not better
Pita Jungle is not a bad option given the choices in the food court here especially if you don't want to stand 5-people deep at Paradise Bakery but certainly not a destination for me
The chicken enchiladas were smothered in a generous amount of enchilada sauce and cheese and filled with a hearty portion of stewed chicken
This isn't the fanciest meal around and may not be the best in town but I don't think there is a bad dish on the menu
There were tons of TVs to watch an extensive menu that attempts to go beyond just plain bar food and cheap 25 oz
Small wine list but the Cab that was available went well with our dishes
The sushi was great very fresh and plenty of different choices to choose from
Stopped in for a personal size pizza had 45 min before movie starts next door
You can tell where the good food is because pork is not the only thing on the menu
I went here for lunch today not recalling that 50% of their menu is not available 100% of the time and that kind of bummed me out because that means no pizza until 4 pm during the week unless it is Friday or Saturday and no burgers unless it is Friday or Saturday
Their food is good to really good and I do think that most of the menu is over priced
The food is simple pita wraps beautiful salads burgers and pizza with many selections being vegetarian

The dessert menu is equally small with just one item
The menu changes daily and the food is fresh bright and light on both palate and wallet
The food is tasty reasonably priced and they have a decent selection of beers
Usually if the food is delicious I can shrug off the bad service the fact that I still patronize Cornish Pasty makes this evident but I think I hit my breaking point today when a female employee rudely told my friend that we couldn't get the food items on the happy hour special as takeout and that we would be charged full price if we wanted to order anything on said menu
Bottom line this restaurant serves good Mexican food the portions are huge and is inexpensive
Parking is free it's easy to get to the space is large so it's never too crowded even when there are a ton of people there drink and food selection is great and I love the decor
50 hot dog and soda or the pizza slices or whatever else it is that you desire from the usual choices
today I went with their daily special which changes depending on their butcher/meat selection which was a prime rib pihilly cheese steak fries and can soda for $6
The food at Beaver Choice Scandinavian Bistro is delicious; a little unusual but easily understood

Mr had Cheuvront Dip sliced beef on a baguette with au jus and a two giant portions of fries one sweet potato the other regular
The baguette beef  au jus and sweet potato fries were great the regular fries were nothing special and a little cold but we got two huge portions instead of one so we couldn't complain
I perused the menu but already knew I was going for the go-to dish
My chicken fried steak was HUGE like the size of my face
The result is an interesting menu and top notch execution where even the Club Sandwich and Pomme Frites both have interesting and subtle notes where everything is made with fresh local ingredients and obvious care and attention to detailNo kidding even the chicken wing appetizer is spectacular
Very attentive & complimentary on the food choices we ordered that he liked
Good beer list good food great location if you live downtown
Food was good but a fantastic wine list with a great variety to pick from

The group I was with ordered quite a variety of dishes from the menu everything sounded delectable and deciding what to order was difficult because everything sounded YUM
we didn't order off the menu and just let him prepare the rolls for us
As it always is the food was excellent and the portions were very generous
These at least were supposed to be some of the guys behind it so we thought of course the food would be delicious and the menu would be original
We nearly walked out with only two kinds of salads of four sandwiches on the menu and nothing out of ordinary either - I'm talking Caesar salads and turkey sandwiches when we spotted the burger and saw the special of the day was a half roast chicken with rosemary roasted potatoes
It had a gamey flavor to the meat and the bun described as 'Artesinal' on the menu had the taste and consistency of the butt ends of a loaf of Wonder bread
The key here is Jim has all the dishes you expect and he does them all excellently with huge portions and fairly reasonable prices
Would you be satisfied with an order of rolled tacos which list on the menu as coming topped with  guacamole

Last night they had a chef's tasting menu that included a dish he created on Iron Chef
I've only ever eaten sushi here but they have a lot of other menu items that I would like to try at some point but I always turn to the sushi as it has always been good and fresh
I was surprised at the limited menu but figured better a few dishes  well prepared then lots of dishes done poorly
Both guys ordered the beef bourguignon which the menu states is Julia Childs classic recipe and accordingly is served over egg noodles
They hire a bunch of kids who don't know there menu and really don't care about their food
There's no avant garde inventiveness coming out of the kitchen or anything like that but they have a huge menu with options for everyone and the nice things is if you are familiar with Mexican food you'll feel right at home in their menu
I ordered the trout off the regular menu after C pointed out the fish option
Their personal size pizza is loaded with cheese and toppings and is good to split as an appetizer or order and devour by yourself
The only really vegetarian items on the menu were two noodles and butter dishes which sounds as interesting as baby food
Nice selection of toppings and specialty pizzas I recommend the hot wing pizza
But the food speaks for itself and although my colleague and i ate the exact same thing I'm certain the rest of the menu is top notch
Dessert was a difficult choice between the skillet cookie with wild turkey creme or the nitro sundae
I've had just about every kind now and while I can't say for sure that I have a favorite the carnitas and the fish are totally on top of the list
Green provides all sorts of different menu items They have rice and noodles bowls with mock meats and tofu salads burgers and sandwiches mini pizzas and delicious Soynamis which are their soy based ice cream delicious They have specials as well so you may want to follow them on twitter or like them on facebook
Just like the menu suggested we really thought we were just getting eggs and a bit of meat
They have special menus pre planned for the all you can eat and half off lunch specials but if there is a roll that isn't on the list for the most part you can ask and they will make it
I ordered off their Specials menu and got the Baja Chicken Burro and asked for beans instead of rice no problem with the request
The food came out soon after - big portion and all very tasty although I have to admit the chicken itself was a little bland but the cream cheese sauce and loads of salsa was a saving grace
There was 6 in our party and we ordered quite heavily on both the food and drink menus
There was a standard selection of typical dishes from tasty samosas to tandoori chicken and chicken tikka
The delicious dish of Thai thin rice noodles sautu00e9ed with garlic sauce yellow onion carrots broccoli cabbage basil and bean sprouts was the perfect size
The golden brown thin and crispy crust topped with a variety of sweet peppers mushrooms and onions definitely makes this pizza a hit
They have a good wine selection and delicious food
For more commons foods it is entertaining to see the mini sized sized ketchup and mustard bottles that they serve with each plate
so I ventured straight to the salad section - although I did notice the pizzas sandwiches and lighter fare on the menu
And don't forget they offer lunch items- lunchmeat sandwiches served on a bagel of your choice
It's standard tasty Chinese food and the menu is HUGE

They have a good menu with pretty fresh food and good sandwiches
The portions are not huge but they are reasonable and enough food
I asked what kind of cuisine is it she said you'll see and I was thinking great one of those trendy little uptown places that are popular because of their local art bland food and pathetically small portions I was still pouting see
Food was cooked perfectly and flavorful and all I can say is come hungry because they aren't stingy with the portions
I saw them bring out pancakes to a girl and imagine 3 medium pizzas on your plate and that's what size these pancakes were
The food menu is simple but I'm okay with that because obviously the shining star of MacAlpine's is their dessert lists

I came with three other people and we decided to try a variety of dishes
I opted to try a more healthy choice the ground chicken was easily subbed in the green chile burger
We were not charged for my meal since I didn't eat it but for two lunches ordered off the lunch menu our bill came to $40 which I think is high especially considering the quality of food
Good variety of menu food calamari chicken poppers etc
food quality is very very goodFood Quantity 3/5 - small portions for the price
The meals are always good and I don't always order my favorite I bounce around the menu to see how there other dishes taste as well and haven't been disappointed yet
Described on the menu as sweet grilled corn in a cup topped with butter mayo aged cotija cheese tapatio salsa cilantro & lime at a cost of $5 what made the dish really shine was mostly the corn and the cotija - sweet savory and smoky at once with just a bit of acid to meld all the flavors
Moving to the biggest dish of the night the tripe and hominy soup entitled 'menudo' arrived in an enormous bowl and at a cost of $5 it was simply outstanding
Still with two and a half hours before dinner at this point my server again stopped by and after perusing the dessert menu I decided to end the meal with another duet one a must order anywhere I see it and the other a must order at any Mexican restaurant but at $6 a piece I should have probably just ordered a margarita entru00e9e or another half-gallon of menudo instead
The food menu isn't huge - but we enjoyed our turkey sandwich
Good choices for light meals tomato basil soup is super yummy love the Salad Nicoise with Salman pizza for the kids creme brulee for dessert
Exciting eclectic menu selection great service extremely pleasant ambiance and some really great food
The lemon shrimp app was pretty good -- a cold shrimp dish which we weren't expecting since it didn't say that on the menu
The burritos are excellent as well and are medium in size again they don't serve the super XXXL burritos here which is fine with me because I don't like the food baby feeling I get after eating one of those bad boys
Then you plate arrives with just the right sized entree rice egg roll and crab puff stuffed with actual crab
They mostly sell a variety of sandwiches salads HUGE potatoes desserts and much more
I agree with the reviewer who would rather spend eating out dollars at the variety of downtown restaurants that serve better food and I say with much much better service
She said that our order was delayed because one dish included steak menu said filet medallions
So if you're looking for good food at a great location making the slightly high prices acceptable and you don't care that much about correct menus good service or managers that give a care Local Breeze would be a good choice for you
The food is really good the wine is really well priced the beer list is interesting enough for beer lovers or novices and the patio is great for dining with children

D&E has decent food and a very good burger combo but the place does toy with the menu a lot
Again the pizza isn't the attraction  its just something nice to snack on while you listen to and watch this amazing machine
As well as pizza they have a selection of other Italian entrees just like you might find at most any other establishments of this type
I enjoyed the quaint setting friendly service and especially the meal that brings together a variety of foods that you normally wouldn't create in your own kitchen
50 Good thing we weren't hungry as the dish size was smaller than we expected but did have 7 shrimps
My initial concern was that the portion sizes may be too small for my husband who refers to those places that serve a tiny portion on a huge dish as foo-foo
Their menu selection is the classic Western food
They actually serve the meat in a different portion and bring out the entire ribs of the snake which is also deep fried
The rest of the menu is pretty standard Western food steak beans etc
The food was good too and they serve a breakfast menu till 1030
The sushi always tastes incredibly fresh and the menu has several creative options
the wine selection is good the atmosphere is charming and delightful and the food is amazing delicious and so very reasonably priced

The options are a plenty with regular breakfast items to enchiladas fajitas posole menudo made to order omelets eggs benedict biscuits and gravy chicken fried steak and it just goes on
I'd barely heard about the place previously but am planning to return try more food look over their menu more thoroughly
At first I was a bit skeptical since the entire menu was on my placemat but once we all ordered and I tasted their pizza it was absolutely amazing
This review is based on the sushi portion of this restaurant so perhaps I would need to update this review if I ever return to Narai for the Thai portion of their menu although that will be highly doubtful as I interpret skunky fishy tasting sushi to be indicative of the overall quality of everything that the restaurant serves
Carlsbad Stuffed Chicken Breast - Chicken breast stuffed with vegetables cream cheese and topped with queso fundido Served with rice and choice of beans
The food was delicious service quick and very courteous and the portions were filling
I cannot express enough how disappointed I am with the old Sonora; with the red chili gone the only vegetarian item on the old menu gone and the kicker are the fish and chips
I really have mixed feelings about this place because the food is quite good but really overpriced for the portion size
All breakfast sandwiches are less than $5 and come with heaping portions of eggs and meat/cheese of your choice

They have tons of tv's decent food and a pretty good beer selection
The variety of herbs brought out the natural flavors of the seafood

choose one main dish out of more than a dozen choices with your choice of beef chicken pork or tofu plus salad egg roll steamed rice

The food is already made but there are several selections for breakfast lunch dinner and snacks
I went with the Indian choice option and it tasted very much like Indian food and the best part is that it was very healthy

a great menu that would fly with kids and less adventurous diners and with thai food appreciators
In this suburban area of North Phoenix / Cave Creek the choices for carry-out pizza are Barro's diagonally across the street Pizza Hut and Domino's both a couple of miles north
But I do go to Sprouts for their selection of health food and supplements
Until I find a nice locally owned health food store that had a nice variety of supplements and homeopathics I will probably continue to go here out of relative convenience
I look down at the menu and the choices are called bypass - the severity varied by how many slabs of meat they put on
The Happy Hour menu has half off of individual pizzas several different sushi rolls fish or chicken tacos calamari and more
Just a bun a good sized patty of ground beef cheese lettuce and a slice of tomato
I had a Special Shrimp dish of the night that was much better than expected and a very nice portion
I hate the fact that they center load their sandwiches that make the meat portions look huge it's hard to get the first bite in your mouth  but by the time you get to the end of the bun it is just bread
Especially if I was hungry since the Pancit dish is a large portion of food
They usually have decent fish that is on their specials menu buy you have to remember that this is a beer company so don't get too crazy
All lunch specials come with soup egg roll and choice of white or fried rice
Also the sushi selections were not that great
In an effort to get away from both the menu and the crowd at RA I've been sampling various sushi restaurants across the valley with a friend over the last few weeks
The only veggie-friendly roll on their extensive sushi menu was a standard veggie roll a huge disappointment to me
I've come to expect at least two veggie-friendly rolls on the menu; to find only one was disheartening
Unfortunately food is only mediocre and the strip mall location is a definite detraction in size and ambiance
The menu is  broken into breakfast MLO BLO and the CLO's  that's  mexican burger and chicken like objects though there is a small salad bar but  come on I drive a bike  life's too short for salad
We normally order the same thing chicken yellow curry and chicken red curry so we can't comment on all menu items

We decided to try this place for restaurant week as they allow you to choose ANY app entree and dessert from their menu PLUS a glass of wine for $30
the quality and portion of the food for the  happy hour prices were impressive compared to other happy hours that try to do the same
They actually have really great prices and an awesome selection of organic healthy and imported food items that you just can't find anywhere else
The sweet plantains are regular fried plantains as found in some Chinese buffets or regular dessert menu
Not a whole fish as I was expecting and only about 6 good sized pieces but lawd haveth mercy it was phenoms
I was skeptical since so many people are uneducated on the cuisine the restaurant's website did not list many dishes that I enjoy and there was much english spoken on the menu
I ended up ordering a safe dish because that is all they had on the menu and it really wowed me
Overall I can't give Pho Ao Sen five stars because the menu does not have all the great dishes that is indicative of the cuisine and favors to the safe bets for Americans
We thought the portions were just right and I feel the price of the Jerk Chicken off the Grill dish to be very reasonable considering the quality
The dessert menu underwhelmed us mostly because I wasn't in the mood for ice cream so we skipped that course
Please note that the pasta and risotto dishes are modest in size and designed to be one course in a meal
The portion was very large and I wound up sharing partly because it was so good but also because it was a big plate of food
Fun atmosphere good food and large portions
not worth $26 to meFor an entree I got the the original combo or whateverIt came with small portions of ahi salmon and butterfishThey were all very good but not $26 good

The food at this location is consistently good & the portions are generous
We sat outside on the patio on a Saturday night listened to live music and shared some wine and food
The pizza isn't the cheapest but the portions are equal parts huge and delicious
The chairs the blankets the swanky menu the layout of the seats where servers aren't darting past you during the movie and the fact that they serve you all of your food all at once no interruptions during the movie
It's an Italian deli/store that also serves up a full menu of food
I like that you can choose up to 4 sides with each dish so that you can get a good taste for all the different items on the menu
It was your average chinese buffet selection with nothing really standing out as outstanding well except the mushroom chicken that was pretty good
The Chicken Yellow Curry my go-to dish at new Thai restaurants was very delicious and everyone was very pleased with their choices
They have a pretty large food menu for a brewery but is still pretty typical bar food so I'm not sure how good it is
The menu has a wide variety to choose from and some dishes are very unique
The coffee was decent and the food selection is limited but awesome for a small coffee shop
My staples were the cheese crisp chips and salsa Red Corn Chicken Taquitos Cheese Enchiladas Chicken Maxamillian and I have tried just about everything on their menu
Instead of one with appetizers salads sandwiches/burgers entrees and desserts they instead now have a lunch and dinner menu
You won't find any plain sandwich flavors here and the pizza choices looked pretty interesting too
They have a great selection of interesting pasta dishes and everything I have tasted there has been very fresh
They have great food and the portion sizes are pretty big
It's a great little fast food place with pretty good portions
I wish we would have saved room for dessert as the portions were huge and really two much for us to eat
No KID'S MENU but there are several choices of noodle dishes to chose from
We liked China KIng's Dim Sum much better but enjoyed the food off the menu at Phoenix more
From a couple of weeks back we were more looking for a place that did beer first and then the food would be ice to have  Early Oktoberfest seemed to be the theme as they were stuffing kraut onto into and around everything on the fly out menus but it was pretty much just the shape of kraut andunsurprisinglynowhere near what passes for it when it's been made by people that care
They also carry the largest selection of Amy's Organic frozen foods that I adore
The BBQ chicken and fish jun are the best large Hawaii style portions so come hungry folks
The meat was all mixed together and there were large amounts of chopped fat and bone mixed with the minimal portions of meat
If you are mainly looking for fabulous tasting pizza Dominos may not be the best choice
Didn't get to try too much of the food but what I did try the mac and cheese was really yummy and the wine selection wasn't bad and the fact that they had happy hour certainly doesn't hurt either
Federico's may look like David but their food is more like the size of Goliath
The burritos come with your choice of beans & cheese red chicken i
The restaurants are decent in addition to the food court and the store selection is one of the best
Pet Food Depot has a great selection of dog food and the staff is amazingly helpful and knowledgeable about the various foods
With over 30 tacos listed on a check off sheet similar to ordering sushi there is certainly something for everyone here
This is a great place to try some traditional Mexican dishes that don't commonly show up on the menu at other Mexican places in the Valley
Otherwise head in for lunch or dinner and you can score some seriously good food off their wood fire heavy menu
Menu is very large and has authentic dishes so bring a friend with knowledge
The favored crust makes this pizza different than most and makes it my choice for bargin pizza
I have made it my choice for eating pizza out on a budget I suggest you try it on a little ceasar night and you will make the switch like I have
The food is always glistening with oil/grease
The appetizer sampler platter was nothing but from the box frozen selections most likely created by some giant corporation in Nebraska and intended for the frozen food section at your local grocery store
The wine list is lengthy and  the staff is knowledgable about the wines and how to best pair them with the dishes
For the most part we chose items from the menu that were in red indicating a Roka Akor specialtyButterfish Tataki - scrumptious
Here's my takeWhat I liked- The food  There are plenty of pre-conceived pies on the menu but where this place shines is the emphasis on build-your-own
The food is okay they let me order off the seniors menu since they didn't have what I wanted on the regular menu
Fresh seafood beautiful cuts of meat and some already done up wings twice baked potatoes ribs the lists goes on
Every dish was truly delicious and we left full and very satisfied unlike some tasting menus
The menu is excellent most of the dishes are targeted to sail past the mundane competition but the serving sizes leave much to be desired
Quite simply I am a fat American bastard as such I expect a restaurant to roll out a veritable pig trough full of gourmet food european/french serving sizes do nothing to win my favor especially when I am paying premium prices in Scottsdale for flat iron steaks and house salads
Dessert was the notable exception regarding serving size my wife and I were quite pleased to not receive a smurf sized dessert portions
In fact two areas of exceptional excess were the dessert portion size and the bar I am absolutely convinced that the bartender is attending some type of veterinary school because the drinks seemed to be potent enough to load into darts for taking down large land mammals
The waitress was knowledgeable about the dishes and helped in my selection process
They have decent prices for food the sushi sucks but limited drink selections
I've had pretty much every meatless item on the menu and everything is good
I actually find Super L Ranch Market on 44th Street at the COFCO center to be a better selection of Asian food items with which I'm familiar and thus Lee Lee's probably suffers by comparison
There's a creative drink menu including some crafty beers and the sushi menu is definitely not your Japanese mama's selection
I was very surprised with the choices of authentic food from escargot to frogs legs but not my favorite
They do offer variety of Chinese dishes in the buffet line and a salad bar
Seafood is always a good choice and my roommate swears by their chicken parm
I have been a loyal Don and Charlie's customer since the mid 80's and the changes in the pricing platter size and overall quality of food is mind blowing
They do however have some American food on the kids menu
I had a Greek Salad with chicken and my two friends each ordered 1/2 portions of the lavosh pizza and side salads
After seeing La Piazza al Forno consistently listed in the Valley's top pizza joints by numerous outlets I decided to try it out before an event on the West side
I think La Piazza al Forno is a solid choice for pizza in the Glendale area but did not make my Top 5 Valley Pizza Joints
While I'm there let me pick up a selection of beers from around the world I hear Holland has some good brew browse the allegedly specialized food items and take a quick peak at their assortment of candles smell-good bath things and kitchenware
The dishes are pricey for the portions served; the only reason it gets 4 stars from me instead of five is the price point
Huge portion alsoOver Roasted Chicken - One of the best chicken dishes Ive ever had
For dessert the only real choice was creme brulee as the other choices were a scoop of ice cream or a scoop of sherbet
The owner informed me that all the menu items could be made in salad form to avoid any grain or beef could be substituted with a 6oz chicken breast
For food I have tried the fondue and some flat breads There's not much more on the menu
Now the food; simple menu; but I got the speciality the Zinburger but got mushrooms instead of grilled onion; delicious - it was cooked to perfection
very affordable given the quality and portions of the food
I had a full size BBQ chicken salad and all I could think-even after the second dousing of hot sauce was Ehh
Not your average run of the mill Mexican food place so don't expect the usual boring fare expect A LOT of awesome tasting food at great prices and they have kid friendly choices to boot
All in all they have a good selection of food for pretty good prices and the beer and wine selections treated us well
But then we sat down and I was overtaken with it's extensive menu--they not only have sushi but Japanese Thai and Vietnamese
I thought the pork was top notch but the egg was entirely too small for the size of the dish
Teriyaki chicken alone with rice or you can get the combo like the one I mentioned above so you have more choices
Don't forget to check out the life size Panda in a sombrero either while waiting for your food
My husband and I have been to several and while 99 Ranch Market or Lee Lees are LARGE they don't have the selection of Korean specific food
For the sides you get to pick from a selection of various Korean side dishes like kimchi and pickled cucumbers
I ordered the dark meat chicken teriyaki combo comes w/ rice & salad since that was my craving at the time and the BFF ordered 1/2 chicken 1/2 beef teriyaki combo it's not on the menu but the lady was nice enough to accomodate the request
It seems like the menu is created for those who understand Italian or know alot about Italian food
Or it's designed to be accompanied by an intelligent server who can walk you through the wine offerings and pizza choices
I grabbed a menu and realized they have a ton more dishes that didnt appear to be overhead
This location has no citrus besides lime so keep that in mind if you want something in your beer or waterFor our food choices we went withspicy wontons - great flavor and like other mentioned could use more filling - but definitely worth eatingsesame tofu - great light batter good sauceslime mint beef - not something i would do again - not bad but not carpaccioshrimp wrapped in bacon - how could that not be good
Lots of tofu and veg-head selections plus fabulous sushi noodle bowls and rice dishes
I have tried everything on the menu they give you samples if you've never been there before and I eat other things there often but I ALWAYS get the Jade Red Chicken
The menu is small - entrees included one chicken one duck one fish one pork one beef - but all looked appealing
The pizza is great menu says Chicago style
There are plenty of variety of dishes to choose from that include build your own to include Sea Food Chicken Beef and Vegetarian
If you are looking for a trendy place with a great variety of food this is the place to eat
It was so basic sounding on the menu but when away from home its comfort food
The menu says they don't serve breakfast after 11 and I was about to get really angry because of the lack of food in my belly but our server was super sweet and said breakfast wouldn't be a problem
They have the usual kid menu with good choices for fruit veggies and everything ranging from mini-corn dogs to pizza
I got the all you can eat fish fry wife got the corn beef and the kids had stuff from the kids menu
I've never been disappointed with anything I've ordered from their food menu
The Bombay Street Dog was at one point a summer only item which has found a permant place on the menu after appearing in Phoenix New Times article Our 10 Favorite Spicy Dishes in Metro Phoenix last year
My most favorite thing on the menu is surprisingly their spring rolls
A little bit large a portion of grits but my hubby always has some of my food anyways
For the entrees everything is pretty generic Mexican food but the item that stands out most on the menu to me is the #8 the Poblano Creamy Chicken Enchiladas
Me and the work crew eat here about once every couple of weeks great food huge portions
maybe they were scarce on meat but the slider patties were the size of silver dollars tasty but small
I recall the food was good and the portion size was just right
The dishes were with your choice of rice congri moros and tostones or plantains
The food is old and when I went in the morning for breakfast the lady was rude and didn't want to listen to what I wanted
The steaken was ok I mean it's huge on a 9 inch hoagie roll but there should be like a choice of wheat or sourdough and ummm where is the provolone and mushrooms
The selection ranges from a multitude of sandwiches to basic Italian pasta dishes
The food was good and though I might have had issue with the portion size that could be me just being a large man wanting more of a good thing
Overall the presentation was good portion size was good service was ok food was ok
While I went the salad route with a spinach and goat cheese salad adding pulled chicken the rest of the menu had more of an Italian feel
I would definitely go back to North and look forward to trying dinner and more of the Italian dishes on the menu
My wife and I both tend to critique food as we eat it and we both found ourselves commenting that the portions were small and the food was overpriced for what it was
The salmon dish was a flop; it was a chunk of unremarkable poached salmon menu descriptor said open-ocean raised huh
the menu screams comfort food and I am the queen of comfort food
My only complaint is the general lack of variety in the food
It's a large portion with two huge meatballs and plenty of sauce
Other sandwices on the menu include roast beef ham and cheese meatball sausage and pastrami not made in-house
I like them way more than Panda Express they have huge portions and their food is more flavorful than Panda
But every pizza I've had here is great too a rotating selection as is the Caesar
The menu covers most Italian favorites so it will be nice to try the calzones or pasta next but those rolls are what is going to keep me coming back 3 other varieties available
2 stars for the good food but shitty portions and veteran servers
Where were the lists of noodles rice and chicken beef pork and seafood dishes
The downside is that their meat selection isn't that big and their deli section only sells Boar's Head products
The options for the Sushi selection is quite wide
the variety of food changes on a day-to-day basis so sometimes when i go they don't have my favorite things baby corn water chestnuts but i manage to cram 6 feet of food in my bowl anyways
Their are so many different food choices and the prices are great
I have so many favorite items but here are few must-tries chicken lettuce wraps I'd been eating these here looooong before so-called fusion joints like PF Chang's had them on their menu sizzling rice chicken sesame chicken Desert Jade chow mein honey-dipped chicken wings any one of their delicious soups
I'm used to going to sushi restaurants and needing to ask for descriptions of their rolls  but I've never been to a restaurant that did not at least attempt to describe their main menu items
Whereas both of my friends were able to obtain satisfactory answers as to what was in the menu items that piqued their interest save the menu of sushi rolls for which we were only provided descriptions for their five most expensive rolls I was less than satisfied
I expected something better from Yasu which positions itself as a high end sushi restaurant in decor ambiance price and menu selection
A disclaimer on the menu disclosed that many sauces are made with fish oils nuts and soy asking customers to disclose any allergies or dietary needs so the chef can accommodate them
I further disclosed to her that I was allergic to shellfish I've found that sometimes servers are more serious when dealing with allergies versus dietary choices such as vegetarianism or veganism but that didn't help
We ended up leaving to go to a restaurant that has a good selection of food for everyone and we were happier for it
The portions are huge wide selection of food deserts and deli cases
The location is a bit out of the way for a quick dessert and the current selection isn't memorable enough for special orders although if I'm in the area I'd certainly consider it
The place is big and comfy and well over 100 food choices Everything i tried here was very good
Tiny little portion for the cost and I would say they need to rename it ONIONS with hash and corn beef
When we asked about Vegetarian soup we were told by two employees that the green leaf identifying vegetarian soups on the menu doesn't consider chicken stock in two of the Vegetarian soups
The price for the lunch buffet is high given the lack of options they offered four kinds of soup salad bar cheese pizza a few desserts and a rather small bread selection
Limited selection along with low quality of food does not make me a happy person or a satisfied customer
I ordered the General Chicken which I thought was deep fried according to their menu but it turned out that it seemed to be shallow or pan fried the batter was coming away from the chicken
The other dish I ordered was new to the menu the Cantonese style noodles with shrimp and chicken
We ordered the breakfast burrito banana nutella crepes and the simple breakfast I can't remember what it was technically called - eggs bacon toast The breakfast burrito was a good size and came with a little dish of salsa - I felt it definitely needed the salsa to complete the flavors of the dish the burrito was a little bland but the ingredients were all good The banana nutella crepes were yummy it is hard to complain about nutella for breakfast and the eggs/bacon/toast dish did it's job
The hostess barely acknowledged us the food was mediocre and way to expensive for the serving size
The sushi was dry and the size of a nickel
Fairly large selection of sushi but for me any sushi prepared an unknown time ago is suspect so I passed
The first few times I enjoyed it; the portions were large enough for me to save for another meal and there'd be a lot of chicken to accompany the salad
Things on the menu eggs oatmeal other breakfast burgers pizza salads and a few other random things
The food was out of this world AND  they have a HUGE menu with tons of veg options
Had a good variety of drinks and food and their specialty house drinks were what we tried and they were good
A group of friends and I sat at the bar and had good service great wine they have a very eclectic wine list and the food was AMAZING
They have a great little menu here and you get good food for a great price
My husband had the Barbacoa tacos and we were not as impressed with this particular meat choice
Overall Scratch is pretty reasonable for the quality of food you're getting at least for the breakfast menu we had
The menu featured seafood but there were plenty of non-seafood items
I do not eat red meat but there are menu items that I could chose from
Happy hour is a great deal with half off all appetizers 5 dollars for any burger and fries on Mondays after 4pm to close and a stellar menu of comfort food that's still inventive
The menu featured many foods that didn't sound very Mediterranean to me so I decided to be adventurous and try the Mediterranean Plate
We found a few cheap bites on the Happy Hour menu - Tofu and Pork tacos Spicy Fishcakes and Ceviche
Bottomline Beaver Choice has a weird-ass name but it serves some of the best food in Tempe
It's in the same plaza this place was there first you get larger portions same price but the food is just WAY better
The cheese sauce is the bomb and the grilled chicken will make you question trying any other of the meat choices
Service is first class food is a little pricy but typical of the airport menu is outstanding they aren't messing around with their french fries
He handled his underwear as much as he handled menus and food
The food is delicious and the portions are definitely sharing-sized
It's right next to Arrogant Butcher which is OK food with most of the choices being MEH
I didn't see the bathrooms and couldn't comment on that but the food was all  good; first place in a long time the hamburger didn't taste like it had been frozen and microwaved my daughter said it was like at home the Reuben was the size I expected except the herb rye made it better than usual the salad was fresh and they actually had French dressing and the club sandwich was huge it will be dinner later
The menu had great choices and our server was extremely helpful with recommendations from appetizers to full meals steak fish & even vegetarian dishes
The Food - antipasto and focaccia on par with Pizzeria Bianco excellent seafood/crudo and some of the best meatballs and meatloaf in town - all in manageable portions2
They have food here sometimes food trucks that are out front and a sort of limited food menu that the employees add things to every once in a while
The lollipop sushi was refreshing and fresh but most of the menu was a little on the steep side price wise
Our meals were exactly as ordered many choices at Cracker Barrel and the food was hot
I love spicy foods but they are not kidding when they write CAUTION all over the menu next to the habanero burger
They have a rather large menu mostly burgers and sandwiches accompanied by the typical fried appetizer type foods - think mozzarella sticks fried zucchini and mushrooms chili cheese fries the whole bit
What she got was either a very small piece of fish or half of a regular sized one
This place is wonderful -- great drink and food menu
I was very impressed with the large dessert selection that they have; including my favorite tri color cookies
My ideal pizza is more along the thinner crusted east coast variety than the thicker pan pizza approach
Since then I think we have tried a little bit of everything - lunch happy hour dinner the Date Night Menu and on one occasion just dessert
The food choices here was about what you expect an an Indian Buffet but a couple of things were remarkable
Postscript  The market has a huge selection of mediterranean foods and spices at very good prices
With a party of six I was excited to get to see a range of dishes and try out most of the menu via my dining companions choices
With little room left for dessert we ordered three selections for the table to share
I was not impressed with the cut roll choices; seriously do ALL rolls have to have cream cheese in them
There was absolutely no theme concept the music was atrociously paired and half of the acts were unlistenable they quickly ran out of food drinks and souvenirs within 45 minutes and THE TICKETS WERE 60 FRIKKIN DOLLARS
The menu is large with plenty of pizzas and pastas to choose from
From the pizza menu it's hard to choose between the traditional choices like the Sicilian or meat-a-ball and the more interesting varieties like the chicken alfredo with spaghetti baked on top of the pizza - but I think my favorite would have to be the barbecue chicken pizza
On the pasta side of the menu there are a couple dozen great dishes but the new three-cheese mac and cheese with bacon and Italian sausage may just be the best thing on the menu
The pportions were big but who wants to eat a lot of bad food
Food ~ They have changed their menu over the past couple of years and we miss a few of the exotic things they used to offer
The burger is worth it for five bucks on Monday the fries are awesome the drink specials are mediocre the atmosphere I found a bit stuffy and unfriendly the menu is all over the place with no solid direction or theme and the totally modern contempo art deco bullshit bathrooms make me roll my eyes while I pee
This dish was amazingly good - unfortunately it had been removed from the menu for some reason by the time we got back for our second visit
It's an oasis of refreshing Italian food with hearty portions that won't break the bank - although they may break your belt
I had the margarite pizza - a football sized/shaped pizza whose crust tasted as if it were made of bisquick
I was less than impressed with the treatment of the roll so I won't be getting anything from their sushi menu again
they have a wide selection of pizzas including two entire smaller sections devoted to vegetarian options
I ordered the small sized pizza & someone with a large appetite could probably finish most or all of it in one sitting but I was able to get 3 meals out of it
Our party of four had a couple of seafood entries some portobello mushroom tamales and a beef selection
I did love the variety of meat you could select from
I usually always get a seafood noodle dish Nagasaki Sara Udon or Yaki Udon and am always delighted at the flavors and large portions
Being a pretty adventurous foodie and coming from a region where we eat peanut butter on hamburgers I decided to dive right in and order a Bear Peanut butter Cracker Jacks smoked gouda bacon and BBQ sauce on the dog of my choice all beef wrapped in a flatbread
Maybe they will iron out some of they service issues the food is still good although the menu is a bit tired - or I may just be tired of it
Great steaks perfectly executed side dishes exceptional steakhouse wine list meaning lots of full bodied choices all the names that some diners seem married to and just enough obscure stuff to satisfy those who prefer smaller vineyards
I have tasted the chicken schwarma sandwich again another tasty delight on the menu
open late the menu looked promising but they couldn't even get the simple dishes right
Menu creation can't be all that difficult because of the classic meat + egg + potato + bread formula we've all come to expect
In all I wasn't all that impressed but the menu showed promise and perhaps next time I'll be a little more adventurous in my selection as long is isn't just thrown on the plate because going out isn't all about the food it's the experience as well
The food was outstanding as ever 10 oz Strips are delicious and the perfect size
So if you're not in the mood to cook or even sure what to eat but want a myriad of overpriced choices then Dish is for you
The whole menu looks rather large but in reality a lot of the dishes are just repeats of other dishes but with different proteins
- the salsa that came with the chips tasted generic and canned- the menudo was a quarter chunk of a potato half of a carrot cut in two and some blobs of flavorless beef- the mexican pizza was soggy and chewy no not in a good way- the green corn tamale covered in chilli sauce is the only thing that made me think the kitchen can be betterLa Fonda Del Sol is a place that I pass by a lot
I think the price was a little high but I would rather pay more for good quality food than buy something off the dollar menu these days
This is my favorite food choice in the San Tan Village center
A perfect amount to share a great way to get to try a variety of different things and I didn't feel like I was going to have to roll myself out of the place
The Thai portion of the menu is the best and definitely comes with the most food
They have more traditional Mexican food selections such as chorizo and eggs and huevos rancheros in addition to more fusion type brunch items such as seafood crepes
They have a good variety of food on their menu so there is something to suit every taste
For pizza we order two personal sized pizzas and that feeds four people with a little extra for who is really hungry
The menu is extensive covering the ambit of breakfast food
It's not a huge menu but they have all the standards chicken veal all the pastas and some fish
The appetizers were well portioned I got the sweet potato fries and the others got calamri and other fishy foods that I don't eat
The menu had quite a lot of seafood options from mussels to prawns to the catch of the day red snapper when I visited
I am excited to go back and delight in more dishes on the menu
My 12yr old sister was really hesitant towards the menu but fell in love with the Chicken and Cheese Pita Crisp and home made pita chips
They have a great menu with fair prices and a good amount of food to fill just about anyone up
The blue menu has more authentic dishes which you should try
I ordered my food from the cash register and couldn't believe that they thought the portions for my money were OK
There are a few paninis and pizzas on the menu for lunch
A thigh was about the size of a chicken wing at a pizza parlor
All I can think of is how treatfully delicious their larger-than-life muffins are how scrumptious their cookies are and how wonderfully filling their selections like the tuna melt and wood fire pizza are
I didn't get to try any of their other stuff although literally everything on the menu sounded delicious but then again what soul food dish doesn't
I've noticed recently that he portions are smaller and the prices went up but the food is still great
The portions and quality of food and presentation has changed within the last five or six months
-good service-wine list-full bar indoor/outdoor-patio-valetBoth times I have been there I ordered and Iced Cafe Mocha to go for the stroll home
Then after looking over the sushi menu for 20 minutes and finally deciding on what we wanted the waitress came over to look over our order and make sure she was aware of everything we wanted
I have never tried and will never try anything else on their menu except the Italian Beef with Cheese and an order of Fries
I love their selections of food in their deli area
You have two choices for the meal Pick a meat out of the deli case and two sides or a sandwich on ciabatta off of the special menu reserved for such tings
I understand your whitey white clientele might not want spicy but at least offer a choice and take people seriously when they say they want their spicy dish to be spicy
I love that this place has top seafood plates and choices
Although the actual food and presentation are terrific I find the menu a little overpriced since many of the dishes come in smaller portions
For those who don't eat hamburgers or hot dogs there are decent chicken and vegetarian options including portabellas; as far as I can tell the menu online doesn't show page 2 of the menu which has these options
Great portions great food great service
We were a table of four and we ordered two sides and two desserts which was more than enough since the meat portions are huge
The regular size is an obscene amount of beef and will leave no room for anything else
That being said when I want to find some great produce and a good butcher shop selection of meat I head to Sprout's
The menu suggests putting hot sauce and maple syrup on the chicken and waffles
Will I return sure will especially when a craving for good wet Italian Beef returns I will have to try something else on the menu sometime but the IB is what they are famous for and I can see why
On our visit the remodel wasn't quite done but you couldn't see anything from inside the restaurant and thye had just rolled out a new menu that had a lot of really interesting looking options
We had the bruschettas listed in my last review but subbed the tomato one for the pepper-crusted steak and horseradish so good
It seemed mildly pricey for the portions but the food was definitely good
Ourgroup decided we'd have only one person's portion of the finalcourse - dessert
For the final course chocolate fondue dessert you get a choice of Big Night Out Seasonal Chocolate The Original milkchocolate peanut butter Yin & Yang dark and white chocolateCookies 'n Cream Marshmallow Dream dark chocolate topped withmarshmallow cream flambeed and topped with Oreo cookies FlamingTurtle milk chocolate caramel and candied pecans flambu00e9ed PureChocolate dark white or milk Bananas Foster Bananas and a hint of cinnamon swirled in white chocolate and Chocolate S'moresmilk chocolate with marshmallow cream flambu00e9ed and topped with bits of graham crackers
Lots of choices for hummus and you've got to try the chicken curry salad in the fridge left of the deli
Their food is all island inspired with a hearty collection for seafood based appetizers pupus and mains as well as some other island inspired selections such as Duke's Luau Pork Plate
Give the cool vibe great seafood and wide drink selection Hula's Modern Tiki is set to become an uptown classic especially as they work out a few remaining kinks in the kitchen
My boyfriend and I decided to split the largest prime rib dinner and the waiter offered this option - for 5 dollars we get separate soup/salad potato side choices and our own cut of meat
It is a normal breakfast place with a lot of good choices for breakfast and cheap for the amount of food you get
While they do actually have other items on the menu if you don't eat red meat I wouldn't bother showing up
The food is mostly bar food with burgers pizza fried apps and wings as their specialties none of which are my top choice for lunch
The food came out relatively quickly and the portions were quite generous
Being from Connecticut I was so excited to see all the great food on the menu
You'll find a creative menu with such things as griddle cakes but my favorite grub here is the scrambled egg mish mash with beef sausage
The bartender brought me out to menu items that I did not order and tried to convince me that i ordered them The spring rolls could have been good if the plantains were actually sweet
also every bite of fish I tried was dry except for the cold fish selection
little meat not such a great choice of the sandwich on my part
And there are those who respond by listing all the things they don't like on pizza
They have the greatest food and a huge selection even for those who don't like seafood
They advertise authentic Indian fast food and have a very simple menu
I ordered a variety of Indian dishes and tried to make sense to a guy named Chris I think
And I can't wait to try the other items on their menu and maybe save room for dessert
We ordered a small portion of fish tacos grilled and the Carnita's
The small portion of the fish tacos was one taco rice and beans which I thought would be plenty
They have a nice 'family story' that I would love to re-write as a marketing person and I would like to try some other dishes on the menu so we will probably be venturing back another time
The portions are not overly large so you will have room for an appetiser but by the time we finished no one had enough appetite to order a dessert
Pay attention to the menu description when ordering since you might wind up with unfamiliar cuts of meat
I like the simple menu of pizzas pasta and casual American food
The menu is tasty enough but this is a place for bar food and not necessarily a special trip for dinner
Duck Club - unique complexShellfish linguine -  the $12 app portion mussels shrimp calamari and clams in spicy tomato broth  is a steal
But on top of their delicious mojito selection the food was simply the best
I made my way through most of the pizza menu
Now I am not a small appetite and it may be because the food is super good but the only downfall is the size of the tacos
There was meat loaf pasta and mashed potatoes on the menu
You know I finally noticed this place has the smallest selection of food items in all the grocery stores in the greater phoenix area
They have a great selection of dog and cat food
We ordered pasta meat loaf and pork chops which were all really good and the portions were really hearty
Got a regular box to go very reasonable price regarding the portion food was ready pretty fast and I received another appreciation from him
My tip-off should have been the Guy Who Saw Me Reading The Menu and came outside to tell me the food was good
I scanned the menu found Kung Pao chicken and ordered up
good salmon is much too subtle to be paired with a sweetness of dessert proportions
but the menu says it is pan fried and the chicken is clearly deep fried
And if I try everything on the menu eventually I know I'll be navigating my walker with the yellow tennis balls attached but I'm bound to find the fresh consistent and comforting dish I so want
Maybe the pizza or other things on the menu are what draw folks in
I was disappointed to see that their menu only has nutella as a chocolate topping for the dessert crepes
Their meat choices are pork beef chicken and hot links
Also I'm knocking off a star for service and food quality/selection actually I'm knocking off two since when I gave my original review of five stars I was an overzealous early yelper without a definitive rating system
Also for the quality/creativity the food is about $2 above the price point it should be and for my preferences the variety/options is really lacking
The food is stellar the lines are non-existent thanks to the flocks of people that essentially just go to drink and socialize and the selection is immense enough to cause death by gluttony if you're the kind of person who has to taste everything
fortunately for glc they have a fantastic menu delectable looking desserts annnnd awesome bread as a starter
GLC definitely has a nicer feel than cheesecake factory and the selection is globally inspired - and i like fusion food
You better be a fan of garlic to eat here because aside from the dessert it's in every choice of every course and something about a plate of raw meat and seafood being set down in front of you with instructions of how long to let it cook as in- if it walks boil two minutes if it swims boil a minute and  1/2 is less than appetizing
Service was very attentive and the prices were reasonable considering the quality and portions of the food
Food was Ok never saw the wine pairings so we bought our own which was good decent selections
The menu is pretty simple pizzas paninis pastas and salads and all are pretty good
All in all the food selections are great; can't really say there is a bad choice in the bunch
I'd love to see some bison and lamb added to the chili menu but the beef is pretty tasty the way they serve it up
From my extensive research - and it IS extensive the food pricing isn't too bad
For food the guys split the Green Chile Stew appetizer T had the one and only salad on the menu hopefully they will add another option for that in the future and I chose to start with a side of their roasted vegetables
I wish they would create some smaller lunch sized portions at lower prices because it really just is too much food for lunch
'Size matters'There's a small pet food store across from St Francis Xavier church that you must know about if you live in central Phoenix
The have this thing called a 'menu' which lists in an itemized fashion adjacent to each dish the PRICE
/It has a cool ambiance but not my first choice considering the plethora of cool places to check out in phoenix which much better service and food
Meat was cooked to taste and was served on a ciabatta roll with a healthy portion of French Fries
Both of our dishes were great examples of this incredible menu that I have to sample one of everything from
Nice beer list friendly and attentive staff good food cool vibe everything about this place is great
The fish was nicely cooked and made for two decent-sized taco but I just don't understand the presentation
The people are nice and friendly and since they have no kitchen you can order food from a list of local menus they have and it will be delivered right to your seat
The drinks selection is good the food is a little better than regular bar food
You sit in a fun environment order drinks and food from the menu and just have a good time with friends
Select appetizers and main dishes from a comprehensinve menu
The menu has chicken duck pork beef and fish
}Bison Burger not my choice but hubby enjoyed the changeI was in love with my Panang Chicken Curry Bowl
We also tried what looked one of the most unique dishes on the menu
I'm a definite foodie and the menu looked great so I was stoked to try it
Some creative food choices including those chocolate covered fruit kabobs and some tostada looking fried breads besides the usual park fare
Even my step mother who is still pretty unsure on sushi was able to find several choices that she was comfortable with
We finished up by asking the Chef to make us a roll of his choice
Unfortunately though the menu is extremely basic the food is mediocre at best and the service is sub par
Beside each of the parking spots was a lit-up menu with fast-food type stuffs drinks slushies smoothies ice cream sundaes banana splits etc
+1 Fast service+1 Good portions for both the pastas and pizzas+1 Chicken broccoli pasta lasagna and the extra bread on the side
They have an extensive menu for specialty rolls too and if there is a better sushi option in the east valley we haven't found it
The owner was at the register and named the Gyro Italian Beef and Philly Steak as their top choices
You also have the choice of meat with this dish
All in all it was a good portion of food and it came with a drink and was a pretty good value
But for $10 it's a great portion and the fish was prepared perfectly
Pay the $2 dollars and get them on the side in a nice sized little serving dish
We ordered some dumplings which they steamed for us a spicy pork chop dish and then I ordered my favorite which wasn't on the menu sauteed fish filet in black bean sauce
I stood in line and squinted at the barely visible menu of an array of deli meats smoked meats salads and more
The menu is rather large and maybe that's why they are having a hard time keeping the food at a high quality
The selection is terrible I can generally find more food to eat at a Toys R us than I can find here
The menu here is different though and my Chicken Pot Pie was big enough to feed an entire family
The food is reasonably priced and they have quite a big menu for a deli
I don't cook and even I was impressed by their big selection of cheese meat pasta wine and sauces to buy
Dish was tasty and portion was big but unreasonably so
Kool-Aid on tap and lots of other menu options like fish chicken fingers okra mac n cheese honey biscuits with honey and powdered sugar etc
and would of given more stars but yesterday I spent $32 on take out food ps the menu prices in house are actually higher then those listed on the website- naughty naughty and recieved an almost $13 steak sandwich with roughly 5 quarter-sized pieces of bland steak and entire onion and no flavor what so ever
So I guess what Im saying is if you plan on dinning at Fibber's skip the menu get the fish and chips and just get hammered on the patio
Food was tasty not over the top and more of the pub style of menu
My salmon was good & the sides were DELICIOUS not the same as the online menu BUT why is it that for me the opposite plate of food always tastes better
After trying more of their menu burger wings fish and chips I am upping my rating to 3-stars because the food is all respectable
I have not yet tried other items on the menu but if they are as great as the Italian Beef I'll be spending a lot of my time and money here
However  the menu said chicken tostada $9  and I was still charged $9 for NO MEAT
They've got a solid food menu try pretty much anything on the menu and you won't be dissapointed
The menu features accessibly delicious meals that men won't feel emasculated ordering the spit-roasted prime rib dixie pan-fried chicken but still accommodates that girly bitch who lives at 44th and Thomas but insists she's in Arcadia Arcadia Featured salad Vegetarian Nut Burger
Overall we had a great experience and can't wait to go back to try other dishes on the menu
The main course bar consisted mostly of sides including mac and cheese mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables and a choice of meats including barbecue chicken flank steaks which were basically thinly sliced strips of beef a pork entree with some kind of sauce and a carving station featuring ham
The desserts were pretty good consisting a choice of cakes pies and ice cream
Coming from Los Angeles with places like Sushi Mac and other inexpensive but yummy choices I was a bit spoiled
Meatballs are the size of your head and the tomato sauce tasted more like freshly canned tomatoes rather than one that has been cooked down to stew
With great food good wine selection personal attention I cannot find anything that was not positive
Although the store is on the small side the selection of healthy and natural dog food is amazing
There is a full selection of toys grooming supplies supplements food and of course treats
but when I got home and opened my food I was blown away at how HUGE the portions were
Fresh food and basic choices that are consistently good
Chelsea's food ambiance service and all-around menu choices are tops
And from looking over the menu I surmised there probably wasn't a dish that wasn't tasty
OoOoOoOh how I love the herb box & team The menu is packed with amazing healthy dishes that include; huge market salads a mixture of medium rare steak with watercress avocado bacon and sweet dried corn with a tangy blue cheese vinaigrette
There needs to be a grip-load more places like this one around the valley where they make you feel like whatever dogfood they deliver to you on your plate you're gonna gladly pay the fee with a toothy smile on your face and say 'thank-you good sir' and 'yes i will kindly see a dessert menu'
50 foods on some of the concession menus which is nice if you just do not want to fork over $5
The bad Shumai was just ok duck mint salad had an unharmonious flavor and I refused to eat it chicken with wasabi sauce was dried out lychee wrapped bacon was soggy and a strange proportion cream and goat cheese dessert with peach was not fun
Moving onto the food there are no lunch specials available so you must select off the high priced dinner/lunch menu
Our lunch choices were the Chicken Mole and one of those tortilla shell salads from the 80's
Good Asian market with a wide selection of fresh vegetables seafood
Since I did not eat I cannot comment on the food but I would totally come back for breakfast looking at the menu
Great food I have tried many things on the menu and The Pilgrim is one of my favs
I'm a fan and always will be the food is always good here and the selection is unbelievable
When I asked why vinegar was used instead of fish sauce she said That is how it is listed in the menu
Their food is consistently good the menu has both unique items and traditional bar fare and all the wait staff is incredibly customer service oriented Bill is A+++
I understand keeping the menu fresh but this was the BEST DESSERT EVER
There's quite a variety of offerings on the menu including salads pita wraps subs pizza and entrees
Awesome menu great tasting food and plentiful portions gives Crackers five stars
The best time to go is when this place gets cranking the style is smaller portions of the food that have to be replaced very often when busy allowing for extremely fresh food
If you think that price is too much for a pizza that size you can always order Domino's
We also had the ceviche as our appetizer and that was delicious super small portion though that is the reasoning for my 4 stars this time such a small portion on one of my favorite dishes CEVICHE
I expect food cooked from scratch to take about 15-20 minutes depending on the size of the party and I was not disappointed
The portions were a little on the small side but we got $6 lunch specials that came with an egg roll and fried wontons so it's likely that the dinner orders are a bit more generous
Don't put a pepper beside a dish on the menu representing a spicy dish and then have it be bland of flavor and heat
My eyes kind of hurt looking at the font of their menu but it was also quite fun to see all the unique sports related names they have for their food entrees
Listen we all know Ted's is delicious it just is so I will basically shy away from the food and let you know about the service of my most recent trip last night to Ted's
Good wine and beer selection sushi stand olive bar deli with ready made good sandwiches and a pretty robust nutrition/health food section
Unfortunately for Los Olivos this means that although they are a super-sized restaurant I think my whole neighborhood would fit in here for dinner their service and food are lacking
All of their different selections of meat have little to no flavor
There is pretty much beans mac & cheese chicken and waffles and that's your selection on the menu
Portofino has a cross of traditional bar & grill appetizers & entrees along with a modest selection of pastas and fish
25 which is a soup tureen sized bowl of wonderful broth filled with noodles rare steak slices flank brisket tendon tripe and beef meatballs and asked for the tripe to be left out since companion isn't fond of it
For those that don't care to have some of the more esoteric ingredients in their pho there are many choices on the menu including a pho made with chicken breast and another one that is vegetarian
The nachos are a good choice for a lot of food
In fact he said they were 2 of the most popular dishes on the menu
While I love all kinds of food Mexican is not normally my first choice
I wish I had seen brisker business the two times I've been there but hopefully it will pick up and they can continue to serve good Thai food in a neighborhood that really seems to need the ethnic and family-owned variety
For dessert we had a jaw dropping epic portion of Cheesecake they had me at cheesecake and strawberry sauce
Creme brulee has just never been a favorite of mine but if that's one of your choice desserts I'm sure it can't be bad
The food menu looked good but smelling and seeing the entrees of those around us was  tempting
If it was around I might try a piece but I tend to opt for other dessert selections
The menu will have a lot of shareable plates and of course sushi
I tried the steak and chicken teriyaki bowl and asked for the large size but they gave me a large bowl full with rice with small portion of the meat
I frown on tapas restaurants that use their status as such as excuse of having way way way too small food portions
The only thing that bothered me about it was they served the dish on a HUGE plate which gave an out-of-proportion feel when consuming my meal and they gave you a small dish for your rice
I don't throw down 5 stars for a restaurant often and I didn't expect that I would for this meal but I was really impressed with the menu and the food at Eddie's House
Chandler area and because they have many familiar safe foods choices along with the soy milk and organic collard greens
The steaks are beyond good and they always have a nice selection of seafood
I told the bartender I was going to order food as well and he slides me a menu
I am totally certain that the kitchen contains nothing but enormous bags of frozen seafood and deep-fryers the size of swimming pools
But for traditional Phoenix Mexican food it's at the top of the list
After working my way through a wide variety of meats I left in a meat stupor
Quite a big variety of meats cuts and they were all flavored really well
Didn't order any food the beer selections were great
I think it's a summer special but lately Monday's have been happy hour til close with $3-$6 full-size apps and $5 glasses of wine- seriously there is not a better deal in town with this quality of food
Second it's a perfect portion of moist grilled flavorful fish
Beginning first with the lesser known of Lo-Lo's signature desserts a house made banana puddin' served in a hefty mason jar and topped with an airy dollop of whipped cream - at $5 this is probably the steal of the menu as the container must have contained twenty spoonful of the rich parfait
She patiently went over some menu items with me that I might actually be able to eat but I ended up coming up with my own dish for them to make and server checked with chef to make sure they could do it for me
I think TFK was the only place in the Phoenix area with wholesome food that I found when searching online that had GF options on the menu
If you like seafood try the seafood risotto it is a tossup between that and the stuffed eggplant as my favorite thing on the menu
I looked over the menu it is typical bar food in my opinion HOWEVER not so typical was hummus so of course i had to try it and it was flippin fantastic
The beef carpaccio was delicious and it was a very large portion
They're open 24 hours and have a drive through although it's hard to find you have to drive behind the dry cleaners to find it The Carne Asada is awesome the Carne Asada Fries are teh ULTIMATE drunk food and I finally tried their menudo last weekend and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was
Any pasta dish from Cheese Cake factory is way better than anything on this menu -- and half price
The menu is pretty extensive - almost overwhelming and conveniently numbered for people like me who would butcher the pronunciation of the dishes
The ambiance is out of this world the food is to die for and the beer list is as good as it is long
Based on their restaurant list it does seem if they have found a niche in food court/airport type settings so maybe that will work out better for them
My food choices have varied and I have always been impressed with my choices although my favorites are still Spinach Con Queso for an appetizer and a Baja Chimi with Beef
We ordered the vegetarian spring rolls which were indeed lightly fried as described in the menu
Some of the other people at the table ordered the Chicken Lollipops the baked brie and the onion rings which were also just $5 per plate and looked to be really good and better portioned
Our favorites are the cucumber daikon radish and cabbage kimchis as always but they had other great choices
We got the ecuadorian fish ceviche to start and it was definitely enough for all four of us - huge portion and very fresh
They cook the potato in the smoker and then add cheese your choice of meatmoist brisket is the right answer sour cream and butter
The menu was reinvented this year and you will find appetizers such as Rock Shrimp Spring Rolls incredible Teriyaki Ribs Seared Ahi Sliders and a plethora of Tempura selections
Maki of Note Foku bacon salmon cream cheese scallions and crispy onions topped with baked spicy crab Gaijin spicy tuna spicy crab avocado cream cheese wrapped with a flour tortilla and then deep friend and topped with a chipotle cream sauce Harajuku Lover shredded chicken breast avocado cucumber topped with spicy teriyaki sauce and pineapple sauceAlthough they have an extensive menu I consider this strictly a watering hole especially during their happy hour
I asked everyone if they had any comments on the food and the only criticism I had was the coffee was only so so and not hot enough otherwise everyone was very happy with the choice
Great  steaks great wine list and half price wine in Tuesdays  The desserts are HUGE so only order 1 for 3 people
Having tiny bites of such a variety of foods caused me to feel sick the whole drvie home afterwards
This food was flavorful and was not boring at all and although the waitstaff does have a hippie co-op naturalist vibe to them they are really pleasant and very enthusiastic about their menu
Not the greatest selection of adult beverages but it is a kid's pizza/party joint so one can't expect too terribly much
So I had to explain to him that The Chairman of the Board is required listening when eating Italian food
So sometimes we need pizza variety and this was one of those nights
Lots of vegetables and chicken and a large portion overall
The menu is Asian with traditional dishes served with tofu or just veggies
Things I have tried that I would recommendedChicken Tortellini chicken spinach pink sauce which is a vodka sauceMushroom Ravioli with pink sauceButternut Ravioli in a garlic butterCalamariAntipasto SaladThey also have a decent wine selectionThe servers have always been prompt and attentiveWhile this isn't a place I would drive and seek out if you live in the neighborhood it is a great weekday go to and has made it in my rotation when I don't feel like cooking
We both were overwhelmed and delighted by all the choices in food wine and desserts available for us to try
I agree with one of the other reviewers that this is way better than the GAP event that is part of the Scottsdale Culinary Festival because there you have to pay for food and drink in addition to the entrance fee and so I spent way more money there last year but the quality of selections just does not compare to Devoured
The menu boasts an impressive selection of chicken sandwiches burgers and salads - none of which will drain your bank account in these tough economic times
I also like that they have a wide variety of ballpark food and lots of different areas to buy souvenirs unlike other places were it's only 1 pro shop which has a line just to get in
I do wish that they offered food on their happy hour menu but no such luck
The menu designates this as a 2-chile fiery dish and to me it was mildly spicy 1-chile or snappy according to their ratings
The sub was perfectly assembled the bread was crusty and warm but still soft and fluffy the variety of meats was layered nicely topped with veggies and melted provoloneyumm
Their food is consistently fantastic even with their large diverse menu
The prices for food are really reasonable and the portions sizes are generous
The orange chicken had nice size pieces of juicy chicken breast lightly breaded and not overly spicy
The menu consists of comfort food dishes including grilled cheese sliders burgers and fried chicken
The food was fine large portions but nothing you can't get at any other sports bar
A few people at the table had ordered from the regular menu while the rest of us ordered sushi
We did the tasting menu which meant the chef sent out any number of dishes in all categories of the menu until we were stuffed
Their menu was quite large and although the lunch specials were decently priced we ventured off an had the Seafood Tofu
It was great the portion was generous and they did not skimp on the seafood - there were mussels octopus shrimp and scallops
I will definitely be returning to try the other dishes that were jumping out at me on the menu
You order at the counter   from a good size selection of ethnic dishes plus a few typical American items
Since we had to order $35 of food from the menu we ended up with quite an array of dishes
The menu items that never disappoint  Thai iced tea yellow curry with chicken and pad thai
No substitutions is up on the menu I am not sure what you'd substitute though as there is also a half chicken half beef option
Out from the kitchen where a Pakistani woman was cooking came a size-able stainless steel container with this wonderfully aromatic succulent goat meat in tomato and garam masala stew
If you're looking for reliable dishes that come in generous portions at very very affordable prices this is the place for you
I bought selections from the food and skin care products they sell on sight
I really liked our server a young girl 18 or 19 who knew the menu so well and who also told us of some special dishes not yet on the menu that we could order
I've tried other menu options like salads and chicken burritos and everything is just so-so
We had the milanesa de res which is basically a breaded carne - it was fantastic - the torta comes with the meat of your choice some jalepenos lettuce and a couple small slices of avocado
They serve good drunk food even late at night have a great selection of beer as well as bar games to play
The food shows up on some interesting over sized plates
I'm not too impressed with the menu and it's definitely food you don't wanna order to go- just doesn't preserve itself well for a ride home short one at that
They serve fresh meat not frozen and the selection of vegetables/seasonings to choose from is awesome
Good to know info They have a menu on the bar from the Bar across the way Ice House Tavern where you can get a discount on your drinks if you take your food to eat there or if you want you can grab a few togos from them and Two Hippies will let you drink 'em in their joint
best mix your own cocktail sauce with a huge portion of fresh horseradish to make it hot like I love
The portions here pretty big but I ordered the horseradish crusted tilapia and the serving was just right
We asked to see the dessert menu I didn't have one in my little burgandy book
I got a half size Crunch Roll for an appetizer and an order of Chicken Yakisoba
They have a wonderful happy hour menu from food and drinks but this is defiantly a place that you need to plan on dining for a while
Did you know that Yard House has a whole menu section for faux-meat
* The chicken bento was excellent and the portions of chicken very generous
I was really impressed with the food here and I can't wait to try other items on the menu
Once we crossed off the few items that we did not want included in our meal this reverse sushi-style menu seemed bizarre at a place that bills itself as being improvisational and adventurous it took a surprisingly long time for the kitchen to prepare the miniscule bites of food that we received with each of our 5+ courses
And for my main the vegetarian dish made with love as the menu stated - was indeed
Onto the food -  we started with the Grilled Korean BBQ beef boneless beef short ribs marinated in garlic soy and brown sugar with jasmine rice sesame spinach carrots bean sprouts and green onions - very good great flavor nice portion could even be ordered as your main course IMO
**BUT** he and his wife have a few Korean dishes on the menu so I had the Kalbi Bi Bim Bap which comes sizzling in a stone bowl -  fresh veggies cooked just right kalbi beef over rice fragrant sesame oil topped off with an egg and Korean hot sauce
75 Amber Bocks ALL DAY and a late night menu with grilled cheeses chicken fingers and mozzarella sticks
This combo comes with very generous portions of all of these below listed items  S&S Beef Fried Rice Chicken Lo Mein 1 egg roll 2 crab puffs
I've only had sushi there so I can't comment on the rest of the menu
I ordered Tempura udon we also ordered some appetizers off the hh menu we got gyoza and sesame chicken
I would definitely choose the pyramid roll over the kabuki roll but if I was there for hh I would actually pick a simpler roll off the hh menu and be perfectly satisfied
What's great about their menu is that they offer a range of dishes to choose from many items the same from the Arcadia Vig so surely there is something for everyone
However when our waitress finally came over to talk to us about the menu the first thing she pointed out as gluten free was the one pasta dish on the menu
It's a great opportunity to try dishes you've never had before and if you want something stronger they're more than happy to let you order off the menu
We basically ordered everything on the menu and all the food was awesome
It said 'rare' on the menu but it not the sushi kind of rare barely grilled on each side kind of rare
I would like to try more of their food because the menu online really does look amazing but it is more trouble than it is worth
I had heard the portions were large and thankfully I did not get a signature dish as I was not that hungry when I arrived
The sampler platter included delicious pulled pork mini burgers two potato skins named Pat Tillman potato skins on the menu buffalo chicken wings and chicken tenders
For the same food I buy about a mile or two away at Sunflower Pet Supply   Choice charged an extra $15-20 more
My first impression was that this is a happy hour / weekend watering hole as the drink selection out numbered the food items 4 to 1
We got a pizza in the metro size which basically means this is the inside dimension of our oven/this is the biggest pizza we can possibly make size
With better food choices nearby why Rumbi
The good service cool atmosphere tasty bruschetta choices and creative thin crust pizza get this place three stars
It's taste made for me and I want to have a large pizza made for me the size of a car baked all around me and I want to eat my way out of it
They have a sizable menu - and the quality of the food is pretty darn good all around
You can make a combo with your choice of two meats alone in a burrito or in a quesadilla rice and beans for like $9
I do miss the beef tacos they used to have on the menu - with homemade salsa
Not my strong point so I had heard that Pomegranate had a small selection of desserts that were gluten free
I really wish that there were more of a variety of rolls
He didn't question my selection of burger joints I didn't question his selection of Middle Eastern Food
The food is really good all of the nutrition facts are right there on the menu board and they have daily specials so it's affordable
Saturday night my girl and I decided to check this place out excited for the change in menu and an Old School Mexican Food experience
but bottom-line they have great food and a wonderful wine bubbly and beer selection
The menu is quite extensive the bonus is they have Italian noodle dishes as well
The portions are huge but I  suggest saving room for dessert because it's also fresh made and the type you only find at a European baker especially the Pannacota with lime & berries
Yes there's sushi in the name but that doesn't excuse the lack of imagination on the entree list
Height on most chairs make it obvious along with no kids menu that your sushi loving 5 year old  should go fishing elsewhere
Pizzas are a good choice as well if you're dining alone
The menu was quite pizza-centric but when is that a bad thing
I liked how their crust was really thin and crunchy and they had quite a selection of pizzas and wines
Back east an entire full size breakfast pizza can be purchased for little more than the personal size available at Scramble
I'm going to admit that this is only the second time I've ever had dessert at The Greene House so I won't pass judgement on it's entire dessert menu but I'll say the couple times I've been there the dessert/entree ratio was way out of whack for my liking
With a great new menu and fantastic happy hour deals Fibber Magee's has become our new favorite place to enjoy food and cocktails
i ordered the chicken panino which is on the happy hour menu and comes with fries
The menu had some new dishes on it--as usual
the meal comes with an appetizer of fried onions and green peppers crispy not soggy or greasy choice of 2 entrees each with 2 sides and an apple pie a la mode for dessert
Coming from NYC I had my fair share of disappointing attempts at finding good sushi but Sapporo actually has remained on the top of my list for AZ for the 4 years that I have been here
Very small selection of organic veggies but I think everyone is coming for the cooked food and the people watching
And Gwediaw Graprao are wide rice noodles with a smoky flavored peppery sauce with wok fried broccoli and tomatoes and your choice of meat
Great meal on all levels the waitress was super nice too so much good food for the money and so many other delicious looking options on the menu I will definitely be back loved it
However this place has the most extensive menu I've seen at a Japanese restaurant that is known as a sushi bar
Their menu offered everything from chicken and beef to lots of seafood
Overall it's pricey compared to other sushi places however the ambiance of the restaurant and upscale choices on the menu make it worth it
When our sushi and rolls came out we were surprised to see generous portions of fish
The other reason but like the first one it is  a bit subjective is that the menu selections for dinner are limited - basically pizza
I'm not sure if its the case here but they always give us a menu stocked with authentic food
I wanted to try a bunch of appetizers and stuff on the menu but my tacos were like 19 bucks so I figured it would be a ton of food so I just ordered the entree
It came with some cured meats and cheeses that you select off a list along with olives and roasted vegies and great crusty bread
They have a very interesting menu but I had sushi only on this visit
When I used to frequent this place it had a great craft/local beer selection awesome specials and the food was stellar
The crabmeat and cabbage enchiladas regular menu were a tasty light appetizer
For entrees we had Bob's Big Burger and the chicken flatbread off the happy hour menu
The menu items looked yummy but when I looked at the prices and the food everyone was eating I decided to get my sandwich from the nearby shop instead which saved me $3-4 for lunch
The pizza isn't the best in town but it would make the top 10 list
I was actually a little surprised to see a very standard menu full of typical breakfast foods like eggs bacon sausage pancakes and the like
I went with the porch platter which included a choice of three different ribs BBQ chicken and a choice of meat along with your choice of two sides from an extensive list
An excellent choice for authentic Mexican food
Topped with provolone cheese and your choice of our meat or marinara sauce
the menu is full of all the favorites that my grandmother used to make me as a kid such as red beans rice and gravy cheese grits fried okra and any part of the chicken you want fried
It's brought to you on a burger roll glistening with pork fat as well
The fun of the place is that the selection is great and the atmosphere is unbeatable as far as fun places to shop and pick up food
I think the owners take their food very seriously so I would be surprised to find anything sub-par on their menu
When I got home to eat my food I wasn't very impressed with the portion size for the money and the food was so bland to top it off
A first look at the menu revealed a nice mix of pure sushi and fusion rolls
As a traditionalist I'm typically against ordering this type of sushi but heck it was my anniversary
They've got a decent selection of pastries and light lunch foods and also serve smoothies and other icy treats which are definitely welcome during hot Arizona summers
Chase Field recently announced that they have a new menu of food and during a recent trip to a Dbacks game I was able to try it out and definitely give my stamp of approval
per pizza  very decent wine and beer selection
The last time I stopped in to try a different menu item the server suggested I try the special of the day some kind of Thai stew dish
The cover of the menu has a piece of chicken wire under the plastic that I thought was particularly clever
All 8 pieces of chicken fit in the same size box as the 4 piece biscuit box
The 3 chicken legs and 2 thighs looked the same size as wing drumettes
Still have a the munchies after dinner - there is a great food menu selection as well
$2 for each meatball the size of a golf balls
I have only good things to say of the owner but would recommend he retrain his employees in the art of customer service and the food that is on the menu
By the time all was said and done we had spent a greater part of the afternoon sampling the happy hour menu and ending it with the chocolate ancho chile torte one of my favorite desserts of all time
Like its name Jalapeno Inferno Bistro Mexicana has a correspondingly large food menu & drink menu and it was all really good
So I hope that it improves because it really is a good vegetarian dish on the menu
Go for the gargantuan meat selection the amazing produce section the huge food court the salsa bar the bakery and the fun atmosphere
From the Dim Sum selection of about 10 items I tried the unusual Hong Kong Won Ton Soup Pork Shao Mai Shrimp Hauk Au Beef Tripe & BBQ Pork Bun
Our waiter didn't rush us to finish our food and answered any of our questions regarding the menu
We had a pesto pizza wongs wings not on menu- you have to ask for them stuffed mushrooms italian sub meatball sandwich and it was all great
I'm giving this 3 stars because I think that they probably still have some room for improvement in terms of the food menu and are probably still getting themselves established
Also they had a large variety of sushi and most were passable but not all I thought
Pizza or salad are your only real choices
Rosie McCaffrey's The short The best no-frills bar food I've had in a long time in a dim but clean and cheery pub environment with decent service--a good addition to a list of dependable casual standbys
First the menu is very creative and offers a great variety of healthy food with an Asian twist
The food itself was worth every penny and the selection of specialty teas was endless
There was an indication on the menu that you can pay extra for extra meat-- that should have been a clue as I never saw this before
Reminds me of a Dairy Queen or Fosters Freeze with the combination of a hot food menu
Every dish came out beautifully prepared very large portions everything was fresh
We tried the Shrimp Scampi pizza which was tough and undercooked and the Meaty Meaty pizza which was okay but had about six pieces of meat on the entire large sized pizza
The pizzas on their menu are unique and delicious and they have a great selection of toppings if you want to create your own
We have a big menu of affordable dishes to order from
Their meatless chicken wings are really good and have a realistic texture
They have a good selection of food from Enchiladas burritos and fajitas to mararitas and salsa

They also have pizza tapas sushi dessert stations and a variety of tea beers wines
Tonight I had a list of three things Dog Food; bike chain; and black flat spray paint
She knew the menu and made excellent suggestions concerning the food
But the fact is they do an excellent job of offering a wide variety of dishes such that you can eat here often and not have to order the same thing
Overall this place is cool and the servers are friendly attentive and knowlegeable about the menue      - the fries but I think the Head Chef should sample all the dishes himself and think about what he is doing in that kitchen
As I was walking away a lady opened the door and let me know they opened for lunch at noon showed me the menu and suggested the jerk chicken since I'd not had Jamaican food before

I found in addition to the lunch menu that one may order 3 sushi rolls for $11
There was really enough sushi in my order to feed two people but I wanted to try a variety of the offerings

All you have on your menu is salad and pizza
I've had pretty much all of the meat items and noodle items on the menu never have been disappointed with any of them
Unlike a regular buffet with limited choices and the sushi sitting out waiting to be eaten this is right off the menu and they have a very large selection
Me I have a sushi menu in my hand yes
Even though the portion was huge each monkey licked their plate clean and swore they would return again for the Wood Fired Chicken because that's where it's at in the Jungle of Pita
They use to stack their portions with a lot of meat
This would've dropped 1 star from my rating but I give it 4 stars for the food mini bombers & daily happy hour menu
The food is all microwaved listen for the frequent 'ding' including steaks
the original waiter one of the flashes was gone the menu was totally different the food sucked but the real low-light was watching the owner / chef berate a couple who had complained about something
Everyone got something different so I had a chance to try a variety of dishes
they have a great happy hour and a prefix menu which allows for most to get a taste of the wonderful food they have without breaking the bank
The sushi is amazing cooked dishes equally as good and the portions are great for the prices
For food we sampled+ shrimp po boy sliders - Awesome contained slaw and yummy sausage- cheeseburger sliders - Way to greasy wouldn't order again+ boneless chicken wings they had a fancy name that I can't remember decent- sweet potatoe tots - too greasy and served with a chutney that didn't really compliment the totsNow granted this was just the lounge menu
In looking at the full dinner menu there are quite a few dishes mac n cheese pot pies that I will have to come back to try and hopefully bump this review up a star
Second thing you should know about Old Dixie's Jen one of the co-owners is amazing and will happily chat with you about the source of every ingredient featured on their menu the methodology behind the various dishes and anything else you desire

Fish is always fresh and its nice that sushi was added to the menu not amazing but a solid option
I made it my personal mission to try all of the meats on the menu and I was so close
The waiters start hovering around your table with so many choices of meats and you just keep saying Yes I'll try that over and over again no matter what your stomach's limit is
He has been begging me to go but I don't eat fast food very often so it wasn't on my priory list
It was *spicy* as all hell I must've missed that on the menu and had a lot of seafood and a big tilapia on top
I was leery at first because there are pictures on the menu a la McDonald's but I swear the food is far better
Some of their listed salads are the caribbean cobb with jerk chicken chopped salad with salmon and the wildflower salad with cilantro-lime vinaigrette
Then she forgot my hashbrowns which was fine because the food that was delivered was huge portions and we just shared
We started eating at about 615 and we had what seemed to be a never-ending procession of amazing bite-sized foods to whet our appetites
If you like raw organic and natural food then this is a great mix of food choices with all sorts of flavors delicious smoothies teas coffee and sundry other treats
Further for those of you that spend hours on end in coffeehouses THEY HAVE FREE WI-FI -DThe coffee flavored coffee and tropical ice tea are good I personally tend not to stray into more interesting coffee drinks so you'd have to check those out yourself and the entire selection of both food and drinks is very reasonably priced compared to corporate coffee
They also always have a variety of foods varying from sandwiches Indian cuisine and Greek
The menu is fairly typical of good bar food
Unless someone sends me a note or a comment that suggests I try another joint in town and has at least 10 reviews of different viet places on their list I don't think that I need to look any further for Vietnamese food in Phoenix
And the dessert selection is always tempting
Its a semi formal dining hall serving bland white meat chicken in a variety of sweet and sour sauces
I understand they have a Meatball sandwich which is not on the menu
Not only does this dish sound wonderful but a menu item that is only available 4 hours a week has a strong allure for me
This place is definitely more authentic tasting than the ones listed above as well although it's still not the real deal but to be honest real Mexico Mexican food is not that good anyway Menudo anyone
Checked in on the later side and was glad there was food choices across the street
They were the perfect size had just the right amount of cabbage for crunch and the beef had a nice smoky taste
now I eat fish which opens up the menu a bit but Rula Bula's got a few really tasty veggie options including veggie potato skins vegetarian shepherd's pie that's right - never seen that anywhere else and oh so delicious and the four-cheese grilled sandwich
A friend ordered Corned Beef and Cabbage which they served to her cold not very cool that got sent back and to make up for it the Manager let her order anything off the menu and gave her the dinner free without her even having to say anything
All I want to know is why there are so many boobs in this place - painted on the wall framed on the wall on the dinner menu and on the dessert menu
I ordered the chicken curry special you can choose from all different kinds of chicken curry so i went with saag which comes with rice and also your choice of naan or bhatura
I was in a social situation where my menu choices had to follow the lead of my hosts so I wasn't able to sample the dishes I would normally have tried but the standard American fare we had was good if uninspired especially the chowder
Italian beef is my sandwich of choice in this setting so that's what I picked

When I went to this location last night to check it out on the day of its grand opening I discovered that the selection of non-food home goods is pretty small
To sum it up if you frequent larger Walmarts for food limited house goods and the pharmacy you will appreciate having a downsized version of the store
We ordered the basics off of the sushi menu plus one unique roll
Great menu options but very poor food I had a combo plate with rubbery texture ribs  YUCK
I've always enjoyed their great food and good portion sizes
Either way the wine selection and food are great
Our waiter was really attentive and recommended dishes and helped in our selection
i've never tried the american fare on the menu their new mexican food is just too good
a doggie dish outside of it all with a menu that has the best wings in town the best pasta dishes a nice breakfast menue and a neat coffee bar
All in all this is a consistent chain pizza place - most anyone will find something to enjoy on their large menu but it is what it is
Smoked salmon sounded like a good choice considering they smoke thier meats on the premise
Not just providing a service but an experienceLook when you go to a place like this half the fun is feeling a part of a larger community and trying new things and it helps anchor the farmer's market where on a Wednesday evening there are not only local farmers but often music and a nice variety of local food trucks
I had few things on  the happy hour menu Of course the spicy tuna roll simple nice down that calimari strips not over cooked just right maybe a little salty but super good and I had there spicy chicken wings which honestly was a little spicy for my taste even though I like my Sh#^ hot

Not in a bad way just a note to myself that it's best for all the plated selections more so than the sushi
They have a great selection of Middle Eastern groceries and products teas rice spices meat bread olives boxed and canned items juices sodas it is an amazing array
At the least if you are going to continue to serve shitty food to kids please make that clear on your kid's menu so we adults can make informed decisions
The portions are also very generous and the food is incredibly inexpensive considering how good it is
Three stars for the food we did have price and portions were good as well
In all seriousness though - it's a nice place to load up on Indian food but the buffet has a limited variety day to day
In fact it's the SAME thing every day so if you're a creature of habit like I am then you'll be happy as a clam but if you're always looking for a variety of Indian dishes ummm
I have had theEarly Bird Egg Tomato Avocado and Mayo on English muffin with your choice of bacon or turkeyNew Mexico Burrito Egg Potatoes Cheese Avocado Bacon and a side of homemade Green Salsa not a lot of heat which I like but still very tasteStacked Turkey Tomato Lettuce Avocado Provolone Mustard+MayoI would recommend all three and will recommend other foods too as soon as I tear myself away from the above
There was no wait to get seated food was decent freshly made and although it saddens me to see the enormous amount of calories I will be consuming since they list all your meal calories on the menu it is very helpful for those that are trying to eat healthier
I had the peach French toast which came with your choice of egg and meat
Both the Chinese and Americanized menus are written in English including the description of the dishes
The Chinese menu has tripe and meats not typically eaten by Americans which is why it's left off the American menu

Where the White Chocolate Grill really shines is in its dessert selection
The menu has interesting salads apps main dishes and the wine was delicious as well although I'm not sure what it was

My friend had beef pho which he enjoyed much more than the variety pho he picked up for lunch last time he went
We ordered from Comedor's catering menu  green chicken enchiladas chicken flautas substitution of their tacos and rice for our Halloween party
The menu itself is significantly less than uninspiring - something you'd expect at a Papa Gino's though the food may be better there versus an authentic Italian restaurant
i found the food overall to be flavorful the portions large and everything reasonably priced
With good food though definite room for improvement and I hope they work on their service and bar selection
Their sushi happy hour has quite a bit of variety and the value is pretty good for Scottsdale
You get some good size chunks of tender meat and lots of noodles important

Why do they have Chinese food on the menu
They also had a great variety of cookies and other little desserts
Nice menu of bar foods and decent entrees but I stuck with something that would go well with the beer
The portions are not large which I would normally complain about yet it allowed me to have dessert so I won't complain too much
My gf ordered the raspberry stuffed french toast which as selections go was my first choice but was nice enough to concede the dish to her and I chose the Breakfast Bruschetta
The female bartender was especially nice and explained the food menu yea a food menu in a country dive bar
The ahi is thinly sliced and layered presented in the size and shape of the entire fish
The portions of starters were big enough to feed the Cardinal's front line making dessert out of the question too
The pulled pork sandwich appeared to be lacking meat on the over sized bun but once into it it felt just fine
It's one thing to note that the dishes are one the high end of the price spectrum which they are especially for lunch but the portions are perfectly satisfactory
The portions are miniscule so we finished eating the dish within a minute but had to wait forever while we starved for the next dish
We also decided to get all 3 of the desserts on the menu since we knew they would be small
I don't usually complain about portion size and price when the food is so delicious but we were still hungry and didn't feel like sitting around for another 3 hours to get 7 more dishes that still wouldn't fill us up
They have a huge menu of both sushi and other Japanese delights and between the four of us we tried a lot
Philly roll -- deliciousSweet potato roll - AMAZINGAvocado roll - MASSIVE amounts of avocado greats size great tasteSpicy tuna roll - TastySprimp tempura roll - YummyThe weird mountain potato and sour plum sauce veggie roll -- sour salty and sweet all in one
So I go through my list of foodie options Delux
In fact I decided to try the oooey-gooey most fattening food on the menu
The only dim sum restaurant I have experienced out here is C FU Gourmet their selection is greater but their downfall is the food is usually cool to warm and the place has been steadily getting worse
One look at the menu and I decided on the Kobe Beef Burger and what was nice is that you can choose between 2 patty sizes

The antipasto plate was average the pizza was tasty but nothing special and the wine selection was decent
It's better then the local BIG Mexican food restaurants like Macayo's and Garcias even better then Top Shelf which was our only area choice since Ninfa's went under
With it's central location yummy food and fabulous vibe this spot is now on my list of regular dinner spots
The chefs are creative and offer new menu choices including desserts so you always have something new to try
The portion was huge and he raved about the dish
I am eagerly anticipating their new dinner menu and hope it's just what reminds all of Phoenix's foodies that Local Breeze is a good part of what make our downtown dining scene the best in the Valley
I ended up ordering a sicilian style pizza and got the full size pie
It would be nice if they possibly offered some of their dishes with a choice of noodles but being a ramen house they specialize in that type
The G-n-G menu is smaller less expensive and has more traditional American dishes although not limited to by ANY means whereas the Bistro menu looks more like traditional Swedish cuisine
Ordering from the G-n-G menu I tried the Swedish Cured Salmon Sandwich and an order of poutine
Both were incredible the sandwich was a very generous portion with plenty of fish on it yet it did not taste too fishy and was perfectly balanced
Excellent service  Johnny the owner was able to chat with us for a while and was very gracious excellent food with great flavors  I usually don't care for tapas because I like larger portions but these were great sizes and excellent deals all around great happy hour etc

My favorite dishes aside just about everything on the menu at Thai Basil has proved to be exemplary
Or try the crispy spring rolls that manage to be filling despite their humble size
The chicken satay with peanut sauce is also a very good choice for picky eaters or kiddos although they'll truly miss out on the more complex flavors of this amazing food
For about eight bucks you get a small salad with tangy sweet vinaigrette a spring roll with sweet and sour sauce and your choice of dish with a ball of rice on the side
One thing that's really cool about this restaurant is that they give you an antipasto menu that looks like a sushi bar menu single sheet of papter you can mark on with a pencil full of various cheeses meats and extras grilled asparagus olives elephant garlic $1 mussels etc
Menus with pictures *shudder* anyway the food was drab and not worth the fuss
The Cubano came on  a very soft roll instead of the baguette that was listed on the menu  and the filling was an extremely mild pulled pork in an almost mustard creamy Swiss cheesy sauce also extremely mild with flavor
You can choose the sandwich but the other parts of the combo have to come from a predetermined list   There are lots of desserts in cases too which looked ok but not appetizing enough for me to order them
Not only that the food is over priced and they give you small portions especially the Australian Lobster tail
Local wine a carefully plotted menu and a free dessert
Down to earth guys a variety of good Italian deli meats salads cheeses a nice selection of Italian grocery items and great sandwiches
This was further confused by the large amount of Mexican food options on the menu
Service here was excellent and you definitely get a wide variety of meat options but I only found two out of the 6+ choices tasty
It is not often that I eat out and feel that desserts are on par with the general menu but NOCA was an adventure from the mis all the way to the after-dinner cordials

Great hummus & bread had the spicy pepper Dessert a pazookie they don't call it that for obvious reasons didn't knock my socks off  but pretty darn goodVenue seems ideal for groups of 3-6 or so but can accommodate what looks like 10-12 is a good max sizeI look forward to promoting your venue to my friends

Late at night when the hunger could no longer be quenched by drinks my wife and I ordered some sort of a pizza thing that was reasonable priced and sized and was actually tasty

For what I thought was a small portion the taste of the fish made me forget about portion size and who am I kidding
I've enjoyed salads with salmon and chicken the times I have visited but who knows what will be on the menu on my next visit
And all of the food choices had an unpleasant sour component as well

The fish was below average quality and the preparation well-presented but not as describedhad no seasoning at all and small portions

The foods tasty too but it's only good value if you're there for the lunchtime menu or the dim sum
I love their egg white omelets and their sandwiches are very large and come with fruit their side salad and the First Watch Potatoes so you get an ample amount of food and the prices are really quite good considering you really do get two meals out of their portions
Oh and if you're going to have an amateur running the Teppan table serving up your six-shrimp and 3oz steak portions for dinner with absolutely zero pizazz that's cool but how about making it half price like the sushi

Agree with some of the other comments that the food and menu seems to have lost a step in the past 2-3 years but I can't quite put my finger on it
I had a hard choice to make between the various food trucks
Chandler with the pond the patio and the interior layout w/ live music this is with out a doubt their best location ask your server for the details on the dishes it will make your decision a lot easier great wine list too and again allow your server to guide you in the right direction
The rolls were yummy as usual & I ate half of the cha-shu so good & a big enough portion for me to have it again for lunch tomorrow
After scanning the menu we ordered the following to share lumpia crunchy pork eggrolls pancit rice noodles w/veggies & chicken that came w/puto-a sweet rice bread & ginatang sitao kalabasa string beans squash & shrimp sauteed in coconut milk w/rice
On a past visit I had a Buffalo Chicken sandwich which is no longer on the menu
It was the sort of quality I'd expect from a fast food drive-thru only a larger portion and served on a plate
My friend had the equivalent of Chicken Parmesan with a side of spaghetti don't see it currently listed on their website menu which he downed in no time despite the large portion
The pita chips weren't that good so we ended up chucking them out to our dog who gladly ate them all The chicken portion on the salad was HUGE as was the salad
The menu has a variety of options to choose from with lighter fare fresh rolls soups and salads to more traditional Thai fare curry dishes noodle dishes fried rice and more and of course desserts that sound oh so good
Here is what you will get in general as the menu varies somewhat from day to day chicken tandoori chicken and/or goat curry their goat is a rare misfire often too bony chicken or cheese tikki masala at least one creamy spinach dish a couple of other meat entrees lentils several vegetarian options at least one of which will be pretty spicy rice naan and one other bread a couple of appetisers like samosas for example a half dozen sauces and rice pudding and honeyed cheese balls for dessert
It was strange set up the restaurant is actually part of the food court and tucked away in the side with portions
Good choice and I don't eat Chinese food
which on the menu is described as Grilled Chicken Seasonal Fruits Pepitas pumpkin seeds for $9
Instead the menu is a list of 8 or so meats kangaroo wild boar bacon foie gras frog legs etc you cross off won't you won't eat then the chef will give you one of the ones you did not cross off
the food and beer selection kicked it up a few notches
Some highlights in my opinion are the huevos rancheros eggs Benedict with a choice of meat waffles & the Mexican omelet
With such Yelp reviews I felt the pressure when ordering my food and wanted to make sure I got the real experience so I asked the cashier what his favorite choice was
There's nothing like some good southern food on a blistering hot day
The menu to split between sushi and what they call bar food
Its not only one type of bread as they truly have a variety you can choose from bread rolls French bread regular bread pretzels etc
In general Delux is OK the food is descent nothing to rave home about the sweet fries are worth coming here for and the beer selection and bar is great the seating is cramped if your a big guy like me you will want to sit on the patio
One of the rare times I indulge in restaurant food is for breakfast and I wanted to try Taco Bell's new breakfast menu
If you're going to serve a breakfast menu please keep breakfast hours that suit the average commuting breakfast eater especially when you're competing with a dozen other fast food joints in a half-mile radius who are all also serving breakfast but open at 6 if they're not already open 24 hours
The food was better than I expected and they were perfect size portions for lunch
I didn't see any Irish food on the menu
Because the chef made us special food that was not on the menu and I am complete sucker for special treatment
Scottsdale area- Small locally-owned business- Safe intro to vietnamese cuisine Cons- Lack of choices/competition in the vicinity keeps the food standards    set to mediocre- Atypical pho menu  beef version omits tendon tripe and different    slices of beef- Where's the meat
Anyway they had 2 sections for the menu one with a few Japanese dishes sushi udon etc and the other completely Korean I wanted Korean barbecue but my boy wanted something else
Their selection of beers isn't staggering or anything but the food there is actually pretty damn decent and they have a fair number of appetizers to choose from that aren't too heavy
I was particularly happy to see that they have three vegetarian dishes under a separate vegetarian menu heading
This is an awesome twist on the classic especially since I usually don't like stout i happily ate this dessert  As for the portion it's huge - i think one slice was the length of my forearm and the width my forearms combined
While the dish was indeed advertised as shrimp tacos - Ninfas used a single shrimp 40-60 count size at most  and - incredibly - cut this into 3 pieces for use in the taco
No choice of soup or salad  you just get soup and No egg-roll
it's not really close to our house but i can see us heading back there my wife really enjoyed the food and the impressive beer selection might make it worth the journey
After I learned my lesson I did enjoy the rest of my dish which included tofu and chicken as well as advertised on the menu
Less than a minute after I received the menu I was also given the salty soup and petite crunchy spring roll that accompany all lunch specials
I immediately noticed the menu consisted of a fusion of french and southern foods
there food is generous portions albeit very salty cheap and pretty tasty
So unless I am itching for Swedish food I'll pass on Beaver Choice
By this time I have had an opportunity to try a number of the items on the menu and without doubt the best thing on it is the Margherita Pizza
I was amazed to see that they had a great happy hour with drinks and food anywhere from $5-$10 considering the fact that their regular menu consists of entrees that go from $35-$70
I'm not impressed with the food choices at all
Aside from the typical fast food stuff which I'm not a fan of they have some random restaurants that boast high prices small menus and ridiculously slow service
I appreciate the variety of food choices offered in particular the standard pool food offered at the Jackrabbit pool and the food from Sprouts at the spa pool
Food their menu is very much like a bar menu so don't expect ultra fancy things or cheap
Food  Average/Fair Nothing memorable and not a very big selection of food offerings
The waitresses who BTW are very good promoters & up-sellers of their food and products definitely make the limited menu items sound better than they actually were
Almost could not eat the soup due to the size of the sandwiches but it was full of homemade flavor and lots of meatballs
rrGranted Lisa G's still has only its salad appetizer and sandwich menu but we decided to split three of the dishes the Frutti de Mare salad the Empanadas and the Skewer Plate
I wish I took a picture of the menu or special items because I can't remember the exact name of the dish
I felt that the Kim Chi as well as the red pepper sauce were spicier than Cafe Ga Hyang and they also offer the option to BBQ your own choice of meat unlike Cafe Ga Hyang
I don't wantto get into a philosophical debate as it's not a persons place to judge my choices especially someone I am paying to make my food
Good selection of food overall- you're sure to find some good deals
I had a feeling this place was going to be good but became ever more excited when our Mexican friend started getting excited at the authenticity of the menu compared to the food she enjoys when in Mexico
I looked over the menu and when with the Steak Taco and a Fish Taco as well as the special on the board a Green Chili Chicken Burrito
Plus more low-cal than most other fast foodie type choices
For those of you who have read some of my previous reviews you know that sushi is not necessarily at the top of my list of lunch choices but when in Rome
The menu was not huge but let's hope that they do all the food as well as our dinner selections
There were also burgers sandwiches cottage pie and flat iron steaks on the menu and a ridiculous sounding bread and butter pudding for dessert that we will be back to try they were already out when we asked for it
Also a friend of mine go the bbq pork sandwich based on my recommendation and they totally skimped out on the meat portion
Oh and you get a golf ball sized dish of mediocre rice too
Other things I like about Sprouts- Their produce section is wonderful -- everything is fresh most of the time very rarely have I seen some of the items look bad- The meat selection is amazing
I am not too familiar with the menu because for this party the food was set up in the back--self serve style
It's not crowded service and food selection are still great and it's cheaper
There were also chicken enchiladas beef enchiladas plus lots of ingredients for finishing your tacos & tostadas including meat choices of chicken picadillo beef & tasty Al Pastor pork
As far as the service she seemed a bit overwhelmed and unencouraging with regard to our food choices
The Food was good but the portions are a bit small
The service was GREAT and while the menu is totally different than AZ88 as it should be it keeps to the concept of very well prepared simple foods
Hanny's menu focuses on pizzas sandwiches and salads
Note to Flo We were both disappointed that you took the Vietnamese Spring Rolls off of the menu and I miss the days of the green curry dish with calamari
Really great service and food and what seems to be a major selection of adult beverages
We as Americans have a real disconnect when it comes to food portions ends up being really overindulgence and gluttony
The food and yes all the food - have tried almost everything on the menu is amazing
The Tuck Shop delivers with top quality and innovative foods filling their menu and thats the reward for your journey
warm pita- Grilled Salmon sandwich- Half chicken with farro- Wild shrimp pizza- Apple Crumble do not have the exact menu name- Chocolate cake do not have the exact menu name- Blood orange and olive oil cake do not have the exact menu nameThey were all delicious
Other than this last experience the food across the menu is generally very good
The variety and price make this a great place to hit up when you want some savory food but aren't sure exactly what you want
Service wasn't so hot and we did encounter one nasty eye-rolling huffy waitress when I said we would like to sit on the porch how was I to know they had a wait list for that on my first visit
The staff has always been really polite and friendly- The food is always Excellent and the price is really good for the portion you get
The portions were very big and the food except for the egg rolls was less greasy than what you get at a lot of other Chinese restaurants around here
The night I went to YC's might have been badly chosen due to the car show but unfortunately is was completely packed and though I have no problems with people packing their bowls to the gills and  enjoying that all you can eat experience I really didn't care much for the quality of the food and the limited choice of rice as well as the fact that their meats were frozen and shaved
On a good note you have a larger selection of rice and noodles than YC's and the meats are more appetizing as well as the veggies
The service can be a bit awkward in my previous visits with refills indeed taking some time and I have to feel bad for the waiters who have a limited amount of work to do since clients basically choose their own menu barring some dessert choices that I haven't nor may I ever choose to take
They have a good selection of Korean food from various jigae's hot pot to nengmyun cold noodle soup as well as Korean-Chinese favorites like Jangpong spicy seafood noodle soup and jajangmyun noodles with black bean past sauce
We were offered a variety of seasoned veggies cabbage bean sprouts and radish as well as two kinds of kimchi cabbage and cucumber
I definitely enjoy the food at Blue Hound as well the zucchini corn dogs are awesome but I think the menu is a little light on vegetarian selections
There is a wonderful selection of cheeses and meats to choose from
My only two negatives about Sauce are*the wine list was a bit lacking for a place that says it's a pizza and wine place
They have a great selection of dishes and some very inexpensive lunch specials compared to the size of the meal
Even the items on the kids menu have unusual flavoring and most kids prefer plain food
We came here last night and ordered a bunch of our favorite dishes and left feeling that there was a new choice in the Northsight corridor
I opened the menu and we literally had an option of three different choices of meats and CFS
Our food came with a salad iceburg sopping with water and you had a choice of ranch or some other vinegarette
Two reasons why I didn't give them 5 stars parking is extremely limited and they only have one dessert available per season and I like choices
About the size of a chicken breast actually
They have a pretty extensive array of dishes available on Saturday and Sunday
the menu itself was drab and gimmicky and was full of unflattering pictures of the food; making it feel like a chore to even pick out something that looked appetizing
Bland and boring greasy food huge portions but zero quality and a wait staff that you'd swear just woke up from a long nap
Here's a breakdown of what I liked and didn't like about the food selections
FOOD This place is the epitome of quality over quantity in terms of its menu
irasshamase welcome good choice how is the sushi
Some of my other favorite menu items are the Buffalo Chicken sandwich YUM
Perfect crust that is pillowy yet thin a large variety of toppings to chose from and a great base for any pizza - awesome maranara
Florencia offers a great variety of pizza combinations as well as a make your own option
Their plain cheese pizza or cheese and sausage pizza also tops my list
Florencia also has a fantastic selection of craft beer wine and a small dessert menu
Bacon wrapped filet alongside freshly flown-in seafood morph the menu from day to day as only the freshest ingredients are selected
I will end this review with a summary of the individual meal options they provide made-to-order sandwiches wood oven pizzas Chinese food an extensive and I mean extensive salad bar including hummus cous cous & pasta hot sandwiches pre-made cold sandwiches a sushi bar and much much more
The waiter disappeared for 15 to 20 minutes at a time - food was cold portions were very small
I'm a big fan of the Chicken Tikka Masala which I've been ordering ever since it was an experiment listed on a sheet of A4 paper attached to the main menu; it's now a regular item
Double-size side item plate and a comped dessert for two - you folk in Liberia are sure missing out
I wasn't in the mood for pizza or salad and the entree menu is not that extensive
We ordered the sampler plate which comes with 2 ribs and your choice of 2 of the 4 offered meats so we got the pulled pork and brisket
I dont know if its the quality of the food the atmosphere or the great selection of beer here but Dean and the rest of the people over at the Cornish Pasty Co
The food was ok I ordered the trios or whatever their menu is where you order three items
At least kids menus come with dessert and due to the wait I'm getting free dessert to go
We were seated with dinner menus but not a sushi menu
The sushi selection was just OK on the night that we went
They don't have a permit to serve hot food so pita chips and prepackaged hummus is the extent of the menu
If you are looking for good sushi or teppan grilled food there are far better choices nearby
Their unique menu options for salads flat bread pizza's burgers and signature dishes are extraordinary and delicious
The Crisp Pomegranate Chicken is also an excellent choice
The food is cheap too and just the right portion too
That the food choices  would be so varied   I come  from Scotland so choices at our games were pie  or no pie    was a nice surprise that it costs
Great menu for restaurant week last month but honestly not the least bit exciting in the food department I had a boring salmon dish my wife had a boring overcooked and over-seasoned steak with mashed potatoes
The only downside to Cantina Laredo is their dessert selection
All the food we've ordered has been pretty good because of the plates it seems like small portions but they are actually decent sized
Of course when the dessert menu came out so did a bit more enthusiasm
My husband's souvlaki pita was tasty the meat was lean moist and cut in perfect sizes for the wrap
Besides that there was every kind of meat imaginable kahlua pig shrimp lomi lomi salmon banana egg rolls malasadas kona coffee the list goes on
While cruising the store I noticed that they seem to have a huge variety of not only mens and womens clothing but tons of different products as well from home decor to tents and even some food in there as well
Since the restaurant specializes in hormone free meats and organic produce the veggie selections tend to change often depending on what is available
* Pillow Chicken - minced chicken with a bunch of other crunchy good things fried up mouth-sized dumpling style and blanketed in black pepper sauce -  yummo
The prices are very good nothing over 8 bucks many dishes for under 4 They have quite a variety of dishes I haven't been too adventurous but I would like to come back and have some of the noodles
I have had two meals here and have had most of the appetizers on the menu I think everything was well done the food was great
They offer many variations of fish  steamed  grilled  battered and breaded with a variety of sauces
But we weren't full and wanted to order another roll so we ordered the Pink Lady roll off of the regular menu
I wasn't too impressed with the menu selections either btw there was like 5 salads and 6 sandwiches for lunch but i guess it is BREAKFAST clubThe omelet wasn't very good - I'm not sure if it was because I should've ordered a meat along with the mushroom or the 1/4 lb brick of cheese inside but overall it was bland and the cheese was just ridiculous even after I pulled the excess goo out
The beer and wine selection are above average and the pizza was excellent
Great service great food make sure you add this to your list of places to try
The plantain and avocado rolls are perhaps the only thing on the menu worth the price
Speaking of overkill the desserts will easily serve three average-sized diners
You don't go to Blanco Tacos if you are looking for Outstanding Mexican food the menu is limited and arguably there are places that are a lot better
I tried their Moroccan Pizza before they took it off the menu and it was awesome too
To be fair the last time I was there  the manager noticed I didn't eat very much and asked me why & when I  told her it just wasn't very good she was very apologetic immediately refunded me and offered me a free dish of anything on the menu
This is the same food as PF Changs just a lot cheaper and smaller selection
It's not Rio's Seafood Buffet in Las Vegas but give this place a shot and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised with the quality of food variety and freshness this place has to offer especially in Phoenix AZ
It's got as good of a selection of food and it's half the price
For dinner and lunch you'll find a huge selection of freshly cooked food to choose from like snow crab sea bass mussels oysters many different kinds of shrimp Peking duck escargot and so much more
I ordered one of each of the pizzas on the menu
Our knowledgeable waiter explained most of the menu and gave detail to where meats were sourced from
Amazing wine list fantastic pizzas with unusual toppings and gnutella crepes for dessert
The food is delicious but it seems as if the prices sky rocketed with the new menu
I haven't sampled the food here but browsing the menu I'd say the prices are a bit high for my budget
They have Italian Beef hotdogs burgers salads pitas Gyros Sandwiches including Pastrami soups baked potatoes wings nachos a kids menu and ice cream and cookies for dessert
Great selection of asian and other country foods & ingredients
Even though I felt jipped on the portions I would give it another shot as some of those pizzas looked delicious coming out of the oven
You can choose half of a sandwich or salad from their huge variety of menu itemsA lot of my friends are vegetarians and this is a great spot if your looking for meat free choices
The menu is somewhat eclectic and that's what makes it so fun to try the chef's various dishes
Unlike other fast food joints they have no chicken no patty melts no tacos no nuggets no chili no kids meals no breakfast no onion rings no egg sandwiches no cookies no bacon no curly fries no coffee no orange juice no sliders no rib sandwiches no pork products no ice cream cones no parfaits no burritos no salads no dollar menu no value menu and no cherry turnovers
I generally get the Thai Omelet with Pork or if I feel like getting a variety by trading portions with my wife I'll get veg/tofu dish
The omelet is stuffed with your choice meat clear noodles and other good things
The majority of the dishes can be prepared with your choice of meat or tofu for the protein and you select the level of spiciness you would like
They use to have a dish named Son-in-Law Egg but I think they took it off the menu
This is great place if you like Thai food want to introduce someone to Thai cuisine or have a party with people with several different diet/lifestyle choices
This place has some of the best dishes in Scottsdale supported by a huge selection of beer
Let me say this with more clarity great food differentiates this place not the huge variety of beers
Contrary to the menu posted at the front of the deli which mentioned potato salad or pasta salad as a choice of side dish I was automatically given fries as a side which was fine by me
I had previewed the menu online so we had an idea beforehand of what to expect and the food did end up being very good
This is a hard one because their food is so good and in such large portions but everytime I've been there the service is really slow and crappy
The Lunch Special menu allows you to select one or two of many main item choices all the same price each & one or two of a good number of side dish selections all the same price each
I went to the order counter checked out the menu  affordable but limited to normal Mexican favorites and selected the shredded chicken soft tacos a'la carte
The menu is written on sheets of paper shown in the Yelp photos but they offer a large variety of beverages and for the size restaurant a good selection of food
I looked over the menu and I kept going back to the lunch specials and landing on the Mongolian Beef lunch special
Typically I get the Meatball Parmesan sandwich the meatballs are fantastic that's a good meatball but I've tried many others including their pizza all tasty and large portions
I ordered the shrimp tacos- so fabulous so glad I ordered them- and the chicken tacos that were not on the online menu and made me change my mind from steak to chicken- were yummy yet was sooo full didnt really enjoy them till I ate the leftovers the next day
The menu had all sorts of delicious sounding sandwiches and the barbeque staples and most of it was heavy on the meat so keep the veg heads away from this butcher shop or they'll be forced to nibble on the sides
The dinner menu pricing in effect even at lunchtime on weekends is a fair bit more expensive for essentially the same nice large portion of food
Now I am a sushi snob so I don't think they have the freshest cuts or the most creative menu
Off of their regular menu I suggest you try their hamachi yellowtail sashimi with a side of Sriracha the Sunshine roll and the Spicy Hana roll are both good choices too
They have some solid choices for your sushi craving
IDK about the food not important or like the restroom size of a closet but it gets 5 stars so that other bars' staff can perhaps down a black velvet while they take notes
I normally go for a sesame or house special chicken neither of which were on the lunch menu and it clearly says no substitutions so I settled for orange chicken
For this price you get a cup of soup choice of egg drop or hot and sour which I was glad for your entree white or fried rice and a spring roll
My co-diners were very good they helped explain other items on the menu to me and help me pick out future dishes
We genuinely enjoyed our evening here and we will absolutely go back but it is pricey especially for the size of the dishes
I found the food excellent but keep in mind this isn't typically Mexican food this is Tex-Mex which is a whole different variety
Overall the food was really good but I wished the portions were bigger
Chicken portions are good sized and fairly apportioned you don't get stuck with just a neck and a wing in a 2-piece meal and very well cooked but much more subject to gristly weirdness than Supremo
I think I dined here many years ago when it was under different ownership and the menu was all over the place and the chicken back then was poor to fair
Now perhaps taking a hint from Supremo Sabroso has signifcantly cut its menu down to the essentials think whole chicken 1/2 chicken quarter chicken and the essential sides and a couple quirky add ons and that kind of laser-focus hopefully will keep them in business a long time as they perfect their chicken and the Sabroso folks REALLY have improved the quality of the chicken compared to the last guys Correatado
So in the ultimate final summary of the Sabroso / Supremo SmackdownCHICKEN  Supremo ***** Sabroso ***1/2SIDE QUALITY  Supremo ****1/2 Sabroso ****SIDE CREATIVITY  Supremo *** Sabroso ****SIDE PORTIONS  Supremo *** Sabroso ****LOCATION  Supremo *** Sabroso *1/2DESIGN/ATMOSPHERE  Supremo ** Sabroso **1/2SERVICE  Supremo *** Sabroso ****FINAL SCORE  Its all about the chicken at these dives
It has a simple straightforward menu that will delight meat and veg heads alike
The wine list was actually quite decent but the basic house wines were just-ok California large labels =  And the dessert wasn't good
They give fancy names to tired dishes and the menu is as big as the portions
You have about 9000 dishes on your menu; I'm sure SOMEONE asks for a substitution SOMEWHERE
They offer gluten free crust willing to do no chese and several sizes of pizza so your party can get one or two pizza's for all or everyone can get their own preference
I found out about this place today and decided to pop in for the lunch special till 4pm 1/3 lb pulled pork or chicken sandwich choice of side I had the BBQ beans and a medium soda for FIVE BUCKS
Listen it's not the greatest food in the world but for the price and service it's damn good
Most of the dishes were par for the course for Chinese buffets with typical choices - except for the salt and pepper squid which is not very common in buffets and is quite good here
We started with some Monkey Balls from the Happy Hour menu which was a very good size portions of mushrooms stuffed with crab meat cream cheese and fried tempura style served with 2 different sauces these were yummy not soggy at all
Their Crazy roll is also very good their portions are very generous and loved being able to see the Sushi masters do their job with excellence sushi rolls kept coming out non stop with the same level of mastery
they have a great selection of cheeses ne kind of meat ur lookin 4 and they will put it in a marinade that tenderizes perfectly fresh juices salsas and an awesome made-to-order deli
The spring roll selection is varied and offers many options for veg-heads and carnivorous folk alike
Since my sister had some questions about the menu she started asking some polite questions What comes with this dish
They have an excellent selection of premium foods and if they don't have your brand they can special order it
They try to be nice as they slop your food together always annoyed and skimping on the portion sizes especially the meat
You go in to the counter choice of white or brown rice choice of traditional nori or soy then there is a wide range of fillings and you get to choose what you want in your roll including toppings
This place is on the list for KAET donors and their discount passports so I do like to go eat here - great food great price for a great cause
The menu states 1/2 lb patty of Midwestern raised corn fed beef
The menu is a little intimidating at first since every dish has its authentic Thai name but the numbers next to them helped
He has sampled most things on the menu and has fallen in love with the chicken shawarma
Pretty normal food selection though we had a not so great hot dog here somehow
There is this cauliflower dish on the menu that is so friggin good I wish I could remember the name
Just because they have an amazing space and a well-thought-out and well-invested aesthetic concept that doesn't mean they have to try and make inaccessible food that you need to download the Oxford Food-Lovers app on your iPhone to translate the menu
You can get any of the dishes on the pasta course as a main course size
This guy was not helpful with the menu and I hate it when you ask what is good or what is your favorite or mabey the most ordered dish and all they say is everything is good not sure what the best is
It's no surprise that off of their regular menu my favorites are the buffalo chicken sandwich and the barbecue chicken sandwich
The pasta part was just ok- Beignets really good crispy small balls but more sweet than savory cheesy- Peanut butter chocolate pie my fave dessert combo which I liked a lotMidlights- Key lime pie I'm a big fan of key lime but in this version the flavors weren't distinct enough so I'd call in just okLowlights- Menu on website doesn't match menu at the restaurant so hub was disappointed on no prime ribFood was fine and hear it's fun for drinks so might try going there sometime when I'm in the area
They are average normal what size chickens are supposed to be pieces of chicken
There were two decent sized rolls and came with a peanut dipping sauce
That being said their food is terrific the portions are generous and I can't wait to go back
The last two bonuses are their huge delivery area and the fact that most items on the menu can be ordered as either an a la carte item enough for 4 servings as a meal which comes with rice egg roll and crab puff or in a bowl with just rice
The menu had excellent choices for pasta subs and pizza at reasonable prices
They had a decent wine selection and good food
My husband had a beef taco and ordered one of the new menu items  the chicken and rice stuffed poblano pepper
Took my 9 year old daughter there for lunch yesterday May 20 and the food was absolute garbage I ordered half a chicken ceaser salad for 8 bucks it was the size of a side salad and had 6 pieces of thin sliced chicken in it each the size of a quarter
Baked Chicken Wings with Point Reyes Blue Cheese  From the LGO Pizzeria menu that begins service at 4pm on weekdays and 11am on weekends it'd be hard for me to imagine a better way to watch football in a public space than at La Grande Orange
Topped with the superior ingredients that LGO is well known for and slathered with a lot of quality olive oil plus a bit of butter the crust gets a great crunch without getting much char and although the oven isn't hot enough to generate the same blister as Bianco or Pomo particularly as the bakers are opening/closing it frequently to put new pizzas in and take finished ones out the structure remains supple with a great chew
The food looked tasty but small servings and big dollar signs actually the dollar signs were in a normal font size
As far as desserts they have a wonderful selection of those too
Make whatever jokes you want about the name as if you're a homophobic 7th grade boy but Dick's Hideaway has really got a great menu of American food
The dessert treats are in perfect portions for a little taste of sweetness
There was a good variety of food here although I was expecting much more in the sushi department considering it was touted as a Japanese type buffet
Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it wasn't as delicious as the pho I had in Vegas and also there is only 1 choice for chicken pho
Although I am a long way from being a senior they allow anyone to order from it so I'm able to enjoy smaller portions of my favorite foods
I liked that they let you pair your meats and cheeses and how big or small of a portion you want
4 stars for pretty good food great ambience and nice wine selection
There was a good selection of 82 food items out today plus sauces & dressings
The menu selection was reasonable and the food was overall good
We had pot stickers $6 Kobe beef skewers the Tapas special for the day and the best dish of the night and reasonably priced at $11 and flat noodles with chicken $11 but a small portion
Overall the food was awesome the selection of drinks was great and we will be back for more
The staff and whom I presumed to be the owner/manager was nice and friendly but that cannot make up for the poor quality of selection and food
I would encourage everyone to stop by Fujiya Market and check out their selection of sushi bento boxes and other Japanese goods  They rock
Although in recent years they have added some standard Sonoran dishes to the menu Love the chicken enchiladas suiza with green chili sauce
The pasta was very good great flavor plenty of pesto a little light on the chicken and portion but it was a small size
Other selections includes side dishes bread and seafood
The dessert selection was probably the most disappointing section
The menu was clear and seemed to have a good selection so I got the veggi burrito and my friend got the fish tacos baja
I didn't sample the food but the menu looks like a step above what you'd expect when you walk in
The airstream they serve the food from is a cool touch marking your order with a nickname they have a list of some if you can't think of one is kinda neat too
Between bread or on top of lettuce is the main choice you will make here as the vast majority of the foods are either salads sandwiches or a few pasta options
For their startup today they were featuring a big 140 main food choices & I started with my usual Hot & Sour Soup which was excellent
In fact all the food was great here so I'll just mention a few of my very favoritesThe awesome Broccoli Salad the good selection of delicious Sushi terrific Cevichu00e9 featuring BIG shrimp great broiled fish fried chicken seaweed stuffed Jalapeu00f1os Beef Shish Kabob BBQ Pork Ribs Honey Chicken Bacon Wrapped Shrimp stuffed shrimp & more
He really cooks at the top of his craft & there were 4 tasty meat choices
they had a large salad bar pastas seafood selection and good choice of Asian American and Italian selections
Beer selection not bad but not on the level of Whole Foods across the street
Selection could be better for a store going toe to toe against Whole Foods
The menu was orange and you couldn't see the pictures of the food on it cause the color of the food was orange too
As for the food me and my friend shared two of the lunch bento boxes with a variety of food from miso soup salad tempura teriyaki sushi to roll and dessert green tea and red bean ice-cream
The food here at Golden Phoenix is your standard Chinese fair nothing too authentic but I hear they have a separate menu they provide to Chinese people
So pointing to the menu 3 or 4$ charge to add chicken  It's printed here
I will at least try anybody's pizza pieSome are better than others but very few are truly badSo when the Beautiful Carin and I wandered over to Oregano's the other night it was with the anticipation of a pretty good pizza and a pleasant atmosphere to enjoy it inWe were not disappointedThe entirely reasonable 20 minute wait went by quickly with free pizza slices to nibble and frequent refills for our drinks while we sat comfortably and listened to the musicWhen we got our table
The menu is beef beef and more beef with a smidge of chicken and pork
Tons of things you can but in bulk by the pound Candy rice dog food snacks nuts coffee honey peanut butter and moreWe're going on a camping trip soon and we found packs of hotdogs for like 60 cents camping-size tanks of propane for about 3 bucks giant marshmallows and 3ft wooden skewers for them all on the cheap
The portion was large and the dish was flavorful
The pub food menu is reasonably priced and the nachos are delicious
The food is so seriously yummy that it takes a couple of seperate menus
Ordered the 3 FINGER 3 chicken tenders crinkle cut fries Texas toast regular size drink side of cane sauce
The way the food service works is awesome too you can order off the TV with the remote control or over the phone from a huge menu and it's there within 45 minutes
One of the reasons I like this place is their menu - so many sushi bars only have a selection paper to pick your rolls and don't actually tell you whats in them
The bruscetta and pizza are pretty tasty but I need to go back and dig a little deeper into both the wine and food menus
I am really picky about Asian food and this restaurant tops my list
My friend ordered almost every dish that didnt contain meat off the HH menu
Their food is usually fresh and their drink selection is good
The lemon chicken and sweet and sour pork are my favorite entrees but I also like the duck and eel selections
We loved the boba drinks and for those who were too timid to try the Filipino dishes they have an American menu burgers/fries/corndogs
Great food great atmosphere interesting menu
Are both selling the same variety of food
Also I love that they throw in a spring roll for dishes on their lunch menu
The menu is interesting with a mix of italian staples like pizzas and a diverse selection of seafood and pastas
The bread is fresh and soft the meat is flavorful and shaved very thin and the portion sizes are just right for me
It's wonderful for vegans and vegetarians because there are so many animal product-free menu items and so many meatlovers I've gone with have been crazy about meat-free items too
As far as the bar offerings the menu is simple but pretty solid for bar food
And yes I use the word Asian not Chinese - even though the dishes on the menu are primarily Chinese although even that word is used loosely the owners' inclusion of select Thai and Japanese dishes makes the cuisine more Asian than Chinese
99 lunch special of Spicy Szechuan with tofu and brown rice and asked how spicy it would be on a scale of 1 to 5 since the signature chili symbol on a Chinese menu doesn't usually mean much he took the time to explain that it was prepared medium-spicy and that if I really wanted to experience the full savoriness of the dish I would probably enjoy having it spicy
Practically an entire page of their menu is dedicated to pasties with quorn fake meat products which although I didnt try Im sure would be fantastic
I thought that he was pushing this dish just because it's the most expensive one on the menu
You literally just walk up and order fresh sushi off of a fairly extensive menu and it's all included in the price
Wife and sister=in=law had a hefty portion of the spaghetti and meatball but it was dry devoid of any sauce not a hint of red
I saw a few other dishes pass by and holly crap on the sizes of their portions
This menu had an array of choices and wasn't limited to chicken or pork
Rated by Bon Appetite as one of the nation's 10-best and focused on small batch artisan flavors just like the rest of the list Sweet Republic is tucked into a small strip mall off Shea Boulevard and while not simple to find the products are also available by the pint at Whole Foods
The decor/atmosphere rocked the food rocked the selection rocked and of course- I rock
The trays were not only impressive to display on the table but the variety and quality of cheeses and meats were outstanding
The size of the chicken fried steak is enormous there's no denying that; but that's where the goodness ends
The dessert menu was very odd we didn't order anything but they brought us a little dessert that had Happy Anniversary stenciled on the plate nice touch
The food was OK the service was pretty good and the menu options are very limited
There are no food deals on the happy hour menu but the prices are not too wallet-depleting
They also have a pretty decent menu with typical bar food and daily special that run the range of Tuesday Taco Night and Wednesday Steak Night
The deli is really big with a large variety of reasonably priced foods and usually a lot of people working so the line is never too long
The caterpillar and spicy tuna rolls were fantastic tasting and a good size
The beer selection is amazing and the food is really good also
Sushi is in really skimpy portions and not even that good to where spending that much for that little is worth it
There are many other great choices in the valley for this kind of content food and drink with your movie
I was also disappointed that I didn't see a thai salad with peanut dressing or summer rolls on the menu
The vegetarian options on the menu were non existent but they were more than glad to make whatever was on the menu without the meat
The meat's served on a layer of brown or white choice again your choice
The menu is simple and the food is fresh and ready to go in a second
Oscar's Pier 83 has one of the selections of not only food and cooking styles but beverages as well
If a member of your party isn't into food from the sea Oscar's has a nice menu of sandwiches and salads
and we ordered almost one of everything on the menuAppsAntipasto - Wood Roasted Vegetables Sopressata Bite of CheeseSpiedini - Italian Fontina wrapped in Prosciutto di Parma served warm PizzaMARGHERITA - Tomato Sauce Fresh Mozzarella Basil MARINARA - Tomato Sauce Oregano Garlic No Cheese ROSA - Red Onion Parmigiano Reggiano Rosemary AZ Pistachios SONNY BOY - Tomato Sauce Fresh Mozzarella Salami Gaeta Olives BIANCOVERDE - Fresh Mozzarella Parmigiano Reggiano Ricotta Arugula WISEGUY - Wood Roasted Onion House Smoked Mozzarella Fennel Sausage Of all of them the Biancoverde was my absolute favorite
The sandwich was so great the only downside it wasn't the traditional bread more of a ciabatta roll the fries were the shoestring potatoes were very good selection of BBQ sauces were available
Dried up meat bun a size bigger than the patty and toasted dry  Lettuce wedge  3  high onion slice a half inch thick on top of the patty  trying to give the illusion of a big burger I guess
There isn't a lot I can eat I'm a lactose intolerant pescatarian and they took my favourite dish off the menu the pescado veracruzano
It had a delicious foodie menu but had  cafeteria decor
We all agreed that the food was quite good for the price and while not as large portions as you might get other places - it left just enough room for ice cream
I'd travel to Postino next time for much better food larger variety of vino and better value
The salad bar was a little un-impressive with a small-ish selection of veggies cheese meats and dressings
I opened the menu and went directly to the noodle dishes to see if they offered Singapore Rice Noodle
The yakatori was good but I wish the menu offered items such as livers and chicken skins
We have heard of the mythical never ending line that Bianco possesses but I couldn't imagine the pizza being any better than this maybe it's the selection they have I don't know
Your choice of entrees includes meat loaf prime rib roast beef spare ribs and many more
Server was great also and gave us recommendations about the amount and food choices because we asked - very professional
We ordered a BLT salad off the lunch menu and a manicotti dish
Rather than getting crappy fast food for lunch or paying way too much for crappy food at a chain restaurant in Tempe I'll hit up Chipotle a couple times a week and at least feel OK about my lunch choices
When I first saw the small space and fold out chairs I worried I had made a wrong choice but when the food arrived we were blown away
Important to note they do have a dark chocolate lava cake on the menu for dessert
The pizza menu was also notably small and most of the pizza's were vegetarian
Food - we all ordered steaks that were cooked perfectly - sides are ordered separately and are quite large - example the potato I ordered loaded was the size of regulation football - I easily could have split this monster with the wife
Portion and Price- I know America does not need another restaurant that serves huge portions but Osha Thai's portions are rather small and lacking in the meat department
They always have great selection of pretty much everything I enjoy as far as cheese and meats goes
I ate 1/2 of the bun and mainly the meat portion since I didn't want to waste the burger
Service- SurprisingSeaFood - NOT even CLOSE to the portions on menu or in the commercialsNow Hamburgers and Fries---Awesome
I love the option of picking your food and portion before it is cooked
When our food arrived she had already divided the portions in half with each in it's own dish
I did rate this place with four stars though so while the pasta was not good and the fish portions were smallish I did really like the place and can't wait to try one of their famous burgers
Fresh flowers a huge meat counter and a decent craft beer selection too one of the best for a market
They do not have a big vegetarian menu so I just ordered a breakfast burro without meat and potatoes
One of my friends ordered the chicken fantasia which was a huge portion of chicken with sauce veggies and rice
The food was okay but well if I want Ethiopian food I have two choices and my wife will agree with me1 Between my wife and I we can make better at home as we have learned how to make most of the Ethiopian style foods from our Ethiopian friends in Nashville TN
I've ventured off the pizza list a couple times and it wasn't necessarily a bad thing
The server was plenty friendly and efficient but the food left us with a real buzz kill and that not so pretty feeling when you walk around with a grease stain the size of Texas on your shirt
It was a small portion of chicken and served in small lumps that tasted like they had been somehow friend in pork or something
Unassuming from the exterior in a strip mall with such high end boutiques as Enterprise Rent-A-Car and sharing a zip code with a cowboy tourist targeted bar that features bull riding of the non-mechanical variety Binkley's is a tiny destination restaurant that seems slightly uncomfortable with its surroundings and we were equally slightly out of place with our sinusoidal experience not for control freaks- Greeted by name due to party size and expected arrival time being unique resulted in feeling like VIPs confused by their own fame- Sending away the sommelier a bit dejected when we unanimously declined wine- Realizing our head waitress was a bizarro version of a friend from back home- Opting for the highest end 5-6 course tasting menus $82 - $89 wine pairing $40-50 extra like non-confused VIPs but skipping the foie gras surcharge +$14- Being thankful of no collective food restrictions or allergies to impede chef creativity- Impressed by a nearly endless train of experimental amuse-bouches- Processing that we were 3-4 courses in without seeing anything we ordered- Recalling that some of us were no stranger to this dining style when it's called omakase except then there's no illusion of input into the majority of the meal- Hitting our stride with the hot appetizer including a superb soft shell crab course- Enjoying the best black cod I've ever eaten in a sea of unusual but not quite as enjoyable candidates- Starting to feel full around the penultimate course an amuse of chocolate souffle - Understanding without bitterness that soda refills were not free $2
50 despite the staff's complete lack of hesitation in providing them- Taking home satisfaction levels ranging from grudgingly enjoying the expensive dinner show to thinking it was the best overall food experience in months if not yearsMenu guidance would be a futile endeavor since as the head waitresses helpfully informed all non-returnee tables it turns over completely around every two weeks
However overall the seafood dishes were stronger than those with meat of interest if one is opting for a menu with a single main
Here is a run down of the order Spring Rolls Lean Pork SammichPho with Filet Broken RiceThai TeaWe wanted to try a lot of food to get an idea of what the place was like and  even asked the waiter what the most popular items on the menu were
When the sever was explaining the menu he recommended us to each order 1 dish from the appetizer one from the salad and one from the entru00e9e
Huge portion sushi rolls that always fill me up
First off there's plenty of meat and seafood on the menu - but - everything can be made vegan
They're both vegan along with the saffron rice pudding and pumpkin pie on the dessert menu
I think I'd put them both in my list of Top 10 dishes
Nice pieces of lump crabmeat and a nice manageable size for an appetizer
Even though it's listed as an appetizer it was more than enough food for me for dinner especially after eating the queso fundido
I'm a seafood fan and so I mostly get their shrimp dishes since their shrimps are large and generously portioned
The vegetables seem fresher here  and maybe they use more organic veggies because they seem to have more taste too then at other salad bars and they definitely have more of a selection then most places so if your not a green freak about veggies and stuff they have a good mix of soups baked potatoes pizza and other such dishes to choose from
The food was fantastic reasonably priced for small plates and the sake selection is THE BEST in town
I had a few bites of what was a very large portion of chicken with penne pasta
We were somewhat disappointed to find an amended menu on a Saturday afternoon so I did not get a chance to try the favorably-reviewed fish sandwich which is offered Mon-Fri
I highly suggest that Giant Coffee add some more food options to their menu and perhaps start taking credit cards too
I was expecting a variety of firm and soft Italian cheeses and a variety of smoky spicy and salty cured meats but got nothing more than a few flavorful meats a handful of briny olives and a glob of mild gorgonzola cheese
I picked a breakfast sandwich from the menu and was informed they no longer had all the ingredients for that one and we went through the bread/meat/cheese options and he managed to make a pretty good sandwich
one thing that isn't on the menu that you can order is the beef jerky the name doesn't do it justice but if you know about thai food you'll thank me later
Lots of chicken on the Cyclo menu which based upon my experience at other Vietnamese places apparently isn't very typical Vietnamese
and dang it I'm allergic to chicken so I notice and dislike heavily chicken-biased menus
The menu is small steaks chicken shrimp etc
Recommendation when ordering the chicken fried steak at dinner ask for the lunch portion
They give you really nice sized sushi rolls and at an affordable price
Unfortunately we did not have dessert since the portions were more than satisfying
Everything on the menu - Thai Vietnamese Japanese and Chinese dishes - sounded good but it just didn't blow us away in the taste department
They also have a pretty good sized menu and the food looks pretty decent
Other than soup and a salad there were no meat free options that I could find on their menu
The menu at Pizzeria Bianco is extremely limited with two Small Plates two salads three if there's a seasonal salad available and six pizzas
The marinara is the plainest pizza on the menu
Less sauce is used on this pizza meaning the crust stays crisp and the flavors are allowed to complement each other in better proportions
There is a list of a couple dozen whites and reds though so oenophiles will be able to enjoy their pizza w/a glass or a bottle of the good stuff
I would have been happy only eating the meat portion of the platter
Food - Portions were reasonable and I would say more on the plus side than skimpy and I thought everything we ordered was flavored well
They were really nice to us and they even talked to us a bit at the end of lunch such as where we are from and why am I taking pictures of their food and menu  Just wish there was one like them in San Francisco so I can visit more often
the duck pizza is back on the menu though changed slightly so get it while you can
The reason being is that their chicken parmigiana is the secret star of the menu
And unfortunately since Meatballz's chicken parms and meatballs are so good I haven't explored much else of their menu
Majority of the same menu items are still being served along with some new tasty dishes and may I add Sushi has joined the family
The new location has a small area that includes Sushi Chefs who make a limited variety of fresh Sushi options to enjoy
This shows the quality of service this dayP factor 7 needed minor attention no checklist todayOrder waiting time 9 very busy but our order was taken quicklyAmbieance2 or 3 hard to want to eat an anticipated meal when the entire patio and dining room tables are covered in dirty dishesFood arrival time 9 for as busy as it ws our food arrived fairly quickly
They serve a variety of seafood which really isnt that memorable when I say memorable I mean you can find better seafood at another place
Appetizers are good they could have a little better selection but its a pizza/sports bar kinda place the pizza is yummy especially the Boce' Ball its other worldly
I said why notAfter dinner a manager offered a complimentary small dessert  with  choice between strawberry or lemon tart
No wonder it was listed as one of the 10 Best Restaurant Dishes of 2010 by Food & Wine
Not a big fan of beef so I liked the size
Elephant Thai is a good thai place with a varied menu freshly made food and nice atmosphere
We weren't able to order any dessert but I did notice that they had the sticky rice w/ mango on the menu
Brownies are never my first choice for a dessert
Love the portions - update to my previous review you get way more food here than Cafe Zu Zu
Love love their pizza along with most of their other menu choices
50 price tag for 2 standard sized egg rolls
- other menu options I have tried is the chicken/been taquitos
One of the less spicy items on their menu as well if you are not into spice-Mexican Pizza with shredded beef - Not bad but definitely not enough guac on it
We ordered a variety of items including the salmon-covered california roll and the unagi nigiri
The rolls in general were a bit losely made and the shrimp tempura roll was simply out of proportion there was no way to eat a single piece without taking multiple bites so it kind of ruined the concept of a roll
I ordered the seasonal craw fish as an appetizer since I had an hour to look over the menu I ordered right away
For dinner they offer a nice selection of options ranging from deep fried whole fish to a steamed fish with soy sauce scallions and ginger
Pretty soon after the server arrived to take drink orders and my bro and I looked over the extensive list of rolls
-Food Service Throughout the Movie I listed this as a positive because on the day I went I had the whole row to myself
The menu is terrific the service was great the ambiance was unique the prep tables and kitchen are both in the dining room but the food was a huge disappointment
After a quick review of the menu pizza seemed the best option and settled on the Capricciosa Tomato Sauce Mozzarella Artichokes Olives Mushrooms Salame Ham Parmigiano Reggian
After looking at the fish selection and the menu I ordered the Hamachi Spicy Scallop and the Chicken only because it sounded unusual rolls
Our first visit we ordered a selection of cheese and meats the beet salad the veal ravioli and the cherry zeppole
So skip out on the happy hour in the bar for food and actually get food from their menu
And their specialty rolls are cute not as much variety as other places but I do love the addition of sprouts in the roll
In case you think that I only like Hanny's because it's different or new I want to emphasize that I also really liked the food and drinks my husband and I tried
The warm weather enables the front of the cafe to be pretty much totally open nice garage doors and though that's not something that would work too well in Michigan in the winter I have a feeling the the wine selection and food quality offered by Postino would go over famously here in Ann Arbor and elsewhere
And Ra Sushi is at the bottom of that list
After trying pretty much all their HH menu I would have to say my favorites are Killer Bee and the seared Ahi tuna salad dishes
The menu is varied including hummus with chicken lentil soup pizzas pita sandwiches Greek salads and on and on
Their selection of natural organic and bulk food is fantastic
Great selection of cheeses olives hummus and deli foods
my bf and I decided to order the Oyster Duo appetizer and share the Pappadeaux Platter -- which is an amazing sample platter of all the fried variety they offer on the fried seafood section of their menu
Tried the vegan raw strawberry shortcake dessert from new raw and organic menu and it was ok
After reviewing the menu I settled on the feta spinach and green  bell pepper DEEP dish pizza
It's #2 on my list of favorite pizza's in the valley
Many yummy dishes on the menu - I wished I was hungrier
-There is a $12 pre-tax minimum for delivery -Food is decent quality for the price and not as greasy as one would expect-Paper menus have some decent coupons on them
In a sentence Culinary Dropout is a foodie mecca with its plush and lux furnishings amazing location in the heart of Scottsdale but away from the duche-ery of Old Town on point entrees that range from classic to what I call contemporary chef-y food and its trendy lil touches like dishtowels for nanpkins and placemat menus
They have seasoned meats such as Al Pastor style as well as a nice selection of Chorizo's
Aside from the candy that's popular today there are the perennial choices and drum roll please all the candy you remember from when you were a kid - whenever that was
They now have a sushi menu and it is hands down the best sushi in the area
There are a couple of really neat salads on the menu as well as some nice summery dishes that are served cold with fresh veggies
The stir-fry selection is great so great that both a very adventurous eater and someone just looking for some orange chicken Mongolian beef or sweet and sour chicken could be pleased
Many of the food aren't bite size which is a must and it is way too chunky which only poor peasant eat like that
We ordered a variety of items appetizers soups and main dishes and shared between the 3 of us
Their portions are HUGE their food doesn't taste plasticized or like it was just previously in a freeze-dried state
Instead we ended up staying for lunch after we got a peek at the menu and the dessert case
Great wine selection but you can't drink it there unless you're in the pizza side at night I think
Grabbed a quick lunch in the food court decent selection for omnis-- but vegans can only get a Boca Burger at Fatburger  or adapt the Veggie Wrap at Boar's Head so I can't comment on the restaurants or bars
I suggest that each person orders a pizza for him/herself because then you get to try a variety of pizzas and you might not have any left over because it's that good
Pizza sizes are bigger than the pizzas from Babbos Pizzeria but slightly smaller than/close to CPK pizzas I guess b/c the heart of the pizza is on the thinner size but the crust is still thicker but somewhat a bit flaky
The three of us had a taste of everything they offered but I had the pesto chicken pasta and their $2 mimosa normal brunch menu offering
The food choices for happy hour noshing were odd to say the least; a warm puddle of goat cheese with crunchy crostini; a cheese foccacia which was too similar to that served up at Sweet Tomatoes; cauliflower soup; grilled vegetables which was a pile of Lima beans with a few pieces of grilled cauliflower and carrots on top with some orange sauce drizzled over it all; Odd choices- and for being odd they should have at least been delicious to counter the strangeness of the selections
I have always come to Whole Foods for their wide variety of vegetarian options and the awesome salad bar but now that I have found they have a section devoted to gluten free living and have a plethora of vegan options I am absolutely in love
The musto khiar was generously portioned well mixed and delightful thrilling me to no end as musto khiar is one of my absolute most favorite foodstuffs
The food was decent calimari lobster bisque and salads and the portion sizes were fine
The menu was indeed impressive looking but filled with seafood and venison
I was annoyed but decided to roll with it and just told them I wasn't interested because of the menu but that I would try them again another time
For me it is always a good way to determine just how good the sushi restaurant because this bowl has almost every type of sashimi you find on their menus - albacore tuna salmon squid egg yellowtail tuna belly fish eggs etc
Now concerning Shimogamo not only were the portions very small for both the chirashi bowl and the spicy tuna roll there was absolutely no flavor in the fish neither did it look fresh
Portions are good sized the fish is fresh has flavor and prices are reasonable
The menu had a lot of variety and the 4 of us split dishes
Foodwise the happy hour menu wasn't super extensive featuring a handful of apps from the regular menu
Ridiculous obesity-causing portions we got the small which appeared to still be enough to feed a family of four moderately tasty food and an atmosphere that screams CHAIN
Happy hour menu includes salads personal size pizzas etc
We opted for neither and went for the chipotle macaroni/sausage dish and a couple different craft brews from their pretty healthy selection 50-something beers on the menu
The portions were decent the tacos could have had more fish in them
My choice was Udon noodles with beef as well
It's too dark the menu is too limited and while the food is good it somehow always fails to live up to the hype
I'm not a big red meat eater so its refreshing to have so many chicken and pork selections
Selections include gumbo pan roasts a tomato-based broth with chunks of seafood or seafood creole all with your choice of shrimp crab chicken crawfish oysters or all five with rice
At $10-12 for lunch portions and $17-19 for huge dinner servings and $25 for a massive platter of oysters shrimp crab mussels and clams it's a fantastic value for the quality and tastiness of the food
I am also a vegetarian so having so many non-meat choices was terrific
The lechon was yummy crunchy on the outside with some fatty portion between the meat and skin which tried and decided to cut the fat out
The food served and what the menu describes are seldom the same
The food is always good and generous portion sizes and reasonably priced
This is a great market with a great selection of dry goods as well as foodstuff
They have a small selection of sake and beer but most importantly all the junk food spices noodles etc
They don't have their desserts listed on their website so I asked the guy who placed our order & decided on the cannolis 1 for me 1 for hubs
I had gone to some of the other Torta La Presa locations and did not find the same food or drink selection and didn't know why
While Phoenix Ranch Market has very delicious food and a decent selection it's still missing a lot to be a real mercado or whatever
That and some loaded chicken nachos are easily split between friends; their portion sizes are fairly huge
The menu says the chicken is pounded but my chicken was like 2 inches thick so that was weird
We didn't try their food - the choices weren't very appealing to me and they are limited but other reviewers say it is good
I love Wor Wonton soup so I ordered the smallest size again disappointed; the chicken was in such large pieces it should have been served with a knife; the wonton was the frozen kind that has hardly any meat and mostly wrap; the soup taste was decent as was the one shrimp
The dish listed vegetables which were so few at first I thought they would come separately
With the food portions so large and delicious I don't know how all the staff stay so slim
The selection ranges from sushi fruits and King crab legs
They also have a good selection of meat including bison
I am trying to get into the whole sushi menu slowly so I hopped in here
We ordered dessert in an attempt to up the bill not knowing how far from the total we were and we were told that half of the desserts listed weren't available oh excuse me desert is what it said on the menu
The sashimi tuna the shrimp esceviche the mac and cheese the rotisserie chicken the swordfish tacos and the soft-shell crabs were all drool-teasers listed that we simply had to try
The  swordfish tacos were adequately portioned and flavorful
Nothing super special but the Bees is a good solid choice for food or drinks when you don't feel like thinking about where to go
Food was great I learned a lesson in time and apparently sizes
I had come to her before to do retouches on my hair so I trusted her but honestly my hair lifts so easily and my stylist who I moved away from did great hair so she had a great base and minimal job to do for retouching my roots I go in every 6-7 weeks and have dishwater blonde hair so you get the idea
Save 12 of those up and you get 50% off any pizza of your choice
the food is consistently good nice drink selection wait staff are always happy helpful and friendly
Bocca is just another Postino rip off only with average pizza added to the menu
Staples like the Butter Chicken and Lamb Vindaloo were excellent and I was surprised to see a HUGE selection along with a fresh looking salad bar
Cupcakes are a great alternative to having a variety of flavors when bringing dessert to a party or gathering
Oh and the food on the new menu is good too
Great food choices sandwiches ranging from a Reuben to a Cuban o more rhymes now I mean it delicious varieties of smoked meats fish and chips and fish tacos soups including a daily 'blackboard special' and salads
Overall it is a great mix of food without being too overwhelming of a menu
My date and I shared a selection of one of their house signature rolls a Sakura which is unagi snow crab maguro avocado rolled in soy paper
My gf hates sushi and one side of their menu is dedicated to the on sushi person
They also have a selection of Asian style desserts and meat buns
We then proceeded to taste everything on each other's plates so I can personally attest to their 3-course Prix Fixe menu app/entre/dessert for $37--she chose the Pan-Seared Trout over Black Couscous not fishy at all a bit dry for my taste the Dim Sum which was nice but I needed a bit more of the Shiso Herb Puru00e9e which was deelish and of course the Chocolate Souffle perfectly rich
Attention great citizens of AZ do not eat here unless you enjoy then have the fast talking guy from those medication commercials read a list of side effects eating this food may cause bubble gut late night trips to the ER stomach pumping the shakes and forced consuming of various intestinal aids such as tums and pepto bismol lol
Aside from being HUGE the menu is packed full of dishes
I can't wait to try out the rest of the menu this place definitely is head and shoulders above it's competitors such as Flo's and PF Chang because the food definitely tastes better
As the food arrived I was surprised to find the pizzas are actually a good size for a filling meal
They make their own bread and have a good selection of Boars Head meat
'Delish food at reasonable prices'-pretty generous with their portions
The waiter impressed me by rattling off a list of 7 or 8 specialty off the menu rolls that they had available that night
In addition to their large sushi menu they also have quite the impressive cocktail menu
They have a variety of dishes that will satisfy vegetarians and carnivores alike
I sat down ordered a water and 3 rolls from their lunch menu special
I'd definitely eat here again but if given the choice between here and Chick-fil-a I'd rather eat at Chick-fil-a because they use more flavor in the breading on their chicken and their waffle-cut fries are MUCH bettter than the fries here
I like their selection they have more meat options than OCB but nothing impressed me
I purposely save a portion of my dish every time just so I can have it stew in its own juices for 24 hours and reheat it the next day
The size of the food platters are generous but the food wasn't that good
Beer selection alone and this would be a 6 star review I know they only do 5  stars but I've got some dirt on a few yelp employees that I would use to make it happen Unfortunately there's other things to consider like food and attentiveness of the waitstaff etc
It was on a huge serving platter sized plate though and I felt bad leaving so much food behind
While the schezuan chicken lunch special seemed to be a popular choice for my compatriates I thought it just passed mustard
This location is pretty big has tons of TVs to watch the game on and a great menu to satisfy whatever bar food craving you may have
Thirdly the food is an expanded appetizer menu disguised as a lunch/dinner menu - there was not one thing that you have not seen before at a potato skin festival
With a relaxing atmosphere and fun menu Chicken & Waffles and S'mores for dessert I definitely enjoyed this place
I don't think I'll be returning because the kitchen has difficulty managing to push out food which is too bad because I really wanted to become a regular at this place; the menu looks awesome if only they could get the food out to you in under two hours
Good beer and great kid's menu even if the pizza has gotten very small -did I mention the fries
Their menu is amazing - it was so difficult for me to decide what I wanted and I'm usually not indecisive when it comes to food decisions
the food was amazing lots of awesome choices and innovative ingredient pairings and the price was definitely right - I'll be back
The fish and chips were very tasty but the price point for the portion I got- just didn't compute
Three pieces of fish think chicken tender size and a small portion of fries along with a small side of overly vinegared cole slaw
Some of you would beg to differ but I'm sure you have your list of now-defunct restaurants that served SUPERB food but lacked great customer service
For $4 you get your choice of hot dog grilled cheese beef pizza puff or chicken tenders all served with fries -- pretty standard
They were out of the peach melba cake for dessert so they brought us the other two off the blackboard menu which was very nice
I've since been back and tried desperately to look at something else on the menu but the chicken quesadilla Estilo del Rey kept beckoning to me
-appetizers and desserts are generally not required as dinner portions are ample
I ate here for 6 meals over my 2 day stay at the resort and I never ordered the same dish twice just so I could try a variety
My issue is not the size of the dishes we all knew what tapas are so we were already expecting small portions but with those small portions and the amount of money we were paying we expected good food
I thought their menu was extremely limited only have 6 pizzas 3 with red sauce and 3 with white sauce and then just a few toppings you could add
There is a dessert menu but we declined as we had eaten more than we expected
But the selection of fresh produce is lacking and the meat is really mediocre
Never a great selection overpriced and I have been really disappointed with the beef I've gotten here
Hope they can stay in business but I actually drive a bit out of my way to hit the Fry's as they have a better selection of produce and meat
Pearl sushi it is as they have Sushi Gone wild on Tuesdays where if you have a Pearl card you are able to order from a special sushi menu and have $3 Svedka martini's all night
I usually get the soul food platter comes with chicken 2 sides mine are mac & cheese and greans and a big azz stupid sized piece of cornbread
There is usually a somalier on staff to help with wine selections to go with whatever cut of meat or seafood choice you've gone with
Over that time my friends and I developed relationships with the wonderful servers there who always remembered our names our favorite dishes and who were always willing to recommend a great new beer from the extensive ever changing list
My meat of choice on the commuter is bacon
We all ordered various forms of the chicken shawarma pita or plate and they were large portions of chicken fresh vegetable additions and delicious sauce
Their menu is kind of fun if you choose to make your own burger; you start with your meat choice I went with Angus to save some $ then you choose the type of bun cheese and veggies you want followed by sauces and other more exotic toppings
The food is about the same as all the others but like I said it seemed a bit on the smaller side in portion
I am a food adrenaline junky so any time a restaurant has a unique enough menu for me to even waste my time with is an amazing feat
actually any of the noodle dishes #s 54-57 on the menu are really good
I was offered several choices of pizza slices and accepted a bruscetta one which was delicious
Maybe this is how they do it East coast style so we aren't too familiar but you get three choices of pizza and a pay for each topping you add
The others made their own personal sized pizzas but no one  was impressed
So for portion size they get a high five but a huge pizza with uninspiring taste didn't bode well with us
Even though the size of the plates didn't overwhelm us as has happened before neither of us could finish the food
Food selection atrocious hot dogs pizza etc
It had peas and grated carrots in it and was yellow in color see pics* They didn't really have a kid type menu but they did their best they made her chicken finger's all their meat's are all natural too
Our waiter worked with us crafting the best selection of dishes making modifications to dishes and cobbling together some special requests
The food was great and offered a lot of variety
The meat selection is good but again limited
My salad was fresh and my slice of pizza was pretty large too so I think their portions are fine
The drinks are outstanding the wine list well thought out the menu a perfect mix that makes you think gee I wish I could have the Scotch Beef best item on the menu and Mark's Famous Spaghetti and Meatballs
The menu said that the fish and chips were voted best in Phoenix and sited the fresh made batter as the key to the dish's quality
Good beer impressive local selection and really exciting food
But the rest of the menu looked so appetizing and our waiter was so enthused about the rest of the food that I went with the duck and my wife went with the restaurant week prix fix menu
The waitress was really nice and very fast she gave us our menus and left us to make our drink choice I ordered a mimosa and water and when she came back to get our food order for my dish I ordered a Coca Cola Ham Omelet with Pumpernickel Toast
Food was affordable and portions were large
Comfort foods should always be generous portions and have a nice home cooked feel to it in order to be successful
I'm not a huge fan of the food there but the liquor list is good enough for me
But if you are a fan of spicy food - this is what to order with your choice of meat of course
The menu was BIG and the food we ordered was very tasty
If there was one critique of the food list it was that it could be a bit repetitive across the categories e
The cashier said Good choice; the pizza cheesesteak is great
So the food arrived quite quickly but the serving size was smaller than what I expected for the price and not really a meal you would usually share
the menu is filled with tons of healthy vegetarian meal options they have meat options too and they give you the nutritional content info of each dish right on the menu
This place has a great selection of awesome natural food and treats
I asked if they could make a chicken alfredo dinner because I didn't see it on the menu and they were more than happy to accommodate making the alfredo fresh
Here is a list of the food I tried that day1
50- frozen dessert consisting of sweet beans coconut strings coco jellies ube taro-based pudding coconut milk choice of ice cream and shaved ice
But what makes they stand out would be their huge menu of cantonese and asian food
They have a good selection of organic and natural food at reasonable prices
And if you have meat-eating friends there are many many excellent selections
First my dad and his wife shared the Flan from the dessert menu and claimed it wasn't as light as it should be
The menu was filthy with dried food on every page
My husband put down his menu and without hesitation said let's leave     We walked over to Wildflower Bread Company where we were greeted with smiles and wonderful food
55 you get a pretty decent sized pork roll sandwich
After several minutes trying to decide on a choice I struck up a conversation with a friendly patron to my right and she recommended the egg noodle stir fry with chicken
TACOSTaco plates are generously portioned with meat almost too much in my book but who's complaining
The menu was pretty standard for an upscale Mexican restaurant seafood selection and all
Next level would be to add veggies  a choice of about 5 or so and from their you can upgrade to adding protein - choice of chicken or shrimp - while still having veggies
The pizza size is enormous so don't be thinking its a light pizza just because it is thin
Do check out their huge fruit and vegetable selection a massive frozen foods aisle with yummy exotic ice creams and frozen breads spices a go go and more types of noodles and rice than you can shake a chopstick at
I've tried all of the meats on selection there and the pork is by far the best
During happy hour drinks are half off so you wont feel bad throwing back that $11 martini or 5 and their HH sushi and appetizer list is extensive
you have a choice of fish Icelandic cod Alaskan cod Salmon Tilapia Haddock Catfish
Large plates consist of about a dozen seafood choices and then various poultry lamb and beef selections
I've tried just about everything on the menu and my favorite - by far - is the curry noodles with chicken
They offered several opportunities for brides to come with family members and fiances and bridal party members to a sort of dry run of the buffet so that choosing a menu was based on actual samplings of the food
The pizza antipasto and salads comprise the entire menu
The menu included Vietnamese and American food
Ah yes & then there's your choice of TWO HUNDRED FIFTY bottled soft drinks to go with your food
I had no idea what to order from their expansive menu I never know whether to order breakfast food or lunch food at places like this
I can't say the food was tastiest thing on the menu that night because I didn't have any more like that exceptional Mojito from the extremely entertaining bartender that made this lady give it five stars
I would like it if they added a meatball dish however but that is minor when you are considering a full menu of beers on tap
2% which could be my new favorite beer it is a unfiltered wheat bock amazingOne of the nice touches is that they have the proper beer glass to go with each beer they have on tap in the appropriate sizes and the largest karmeliet glass i have ever seen and they have a lot of imports on the list so they are doing great in the strong ale category - which is my favorite type of beerAs i was looking at the menu I asked if they had foie gras because i saw a picture on their facebook page and Mario told me they always have that as an off the item menu and it could be prepared however I would like it - which sounded great to meFoie Gras torchon with toast points honey comb apples cherries - also had a lemon tuille and some micro greens as wellThe honeycomb was a very nice touch because it got the sweetness however the bonus was the nice texture it added to the overall My friend ordered Heirloom Tomatoes and Gioia Burrata and i got a taste of that it was a great salad and had small bread sticks and fresh pesto on it as well very light and refreshing - just the thing after foie gras for my main i ordered the crispy half duck it was confit duck style the skin was very crispy and it was a huge portion - the duck was very good the crispy duck skin fat had lots of flavor with it - and i was happy to have confit again since i still dream of the chez dumonet duck i had in Paris this summer - my only change i would have made was the side items it was served with i would have liked dauphine potatoes - with that said it was the best duck i have had in AZ and i was happy it was not just seared duck breast My friends ordered the spinach Gnochi Black Tagliolini Mediterranean Sea BassI tried the Sea Bass which was was very good with the skin on crispy and crab on top the pasta dishes all looked amazing although i didnt get to try them i will certainly be trying them on my next visitrubee while i was there quite a few people ordered the crispy ribs - they looked great and everyone said they were deliciousSeems like there will be specials each day as well based on what looks good in the market everything coming out of the kitchen looked great - finally a place with an awesome beer list and delicious food - looking forward to seeing what they do with their cocktail list will certainly be back and it is nice they have parking
There was no rice in it making it a great choice for low carb sushi lovers
An obvious choice is the Pho and I have to admit I went safe with white meat chicken
They rank at the top of my best-egg-rolls-ever list
Anyway I stared up at the menu for about 30 seconds it's pretty small and decided on a regular bbq beef sandwich and a side of cole slaw
The menu is large and we were glad to be sitting near people who were just receiving their food because the food looks 1000x better than it is pictured on their menu
They also have a Korean bbq menu and a sushi menu
The menu while small is loaded with dishes that will hook you and ensure return visits
Secondly the food is solid and you cant beat the price for the portions you get
The food here is good but it's just not what I think of when I think gryos or Greek cuisine even though the menu is mostly that plus apps like hummus
It is a good choice if you are simply looking for something chickeny and in a pita which I am like 3 out of 5 days of the work week
$28 for a rib-meat combo $3 for a soda and $4 for a lemonade make it a good destination for an occasional dinner but their competition in the valley are all under $20 for similar portions
I typically don't prefer these fusion type sushi places but the ambiance and their menu + drink names are fun
There was a list of what's in each roll but on this day there were a LOT of dishes that weren't on the list
The rolls are a decent size and quite filling
Not knowing the menu the staff was quick to point out dishes they liked
While the food was very good and the proportions were satisfying the service was not good
My boss is a big foodie and I asked him what his top 5 fav restaurants in Phx/Scottsdale were and Roka was on that list
I have figured out that no matter what I order the chef behind the menu knows his food
The food is pretty decent especially if you are a serious meat eater - big portions and big value
However the Yardhouse has better food bigger sizes and better happy hour deals
One thing that is consistent with most brewpubs is that on the menu there are beer suggestions for most of the foods
The pastrami was a starter portion  which was fine and was NOT a good cut of meat
Because it was a small portion of meat it was apparent 1/2 of the portion of pastrami was pure fat
their parilladas grill platters come with your choice of grilled meats on a hot bed of coals with guac radishes cucumbers onions salsa tomatoes and two kinds of beans on the side
Also there are so many non-meat and non-gluten choices
pork sliders with white bread buns that turn to paste in your mouth flash fried catfish fingers that are slightly soggy with an irregular aioli sauce and flavor buffalo wings that rank at the bottom of my list not to mention that six for $3
While the menu is the same as all others my experience with take-out pizza and wings last Sunday was a few notches above the other locations
Many of the same dishes Ruperto's was known for appear on the menu at Vaqueros
In short An inventive menu food that is obviously prepared with fresh ingredients instead of poured out of a can and flavor
Great food and lots of it friendly staff who are happy to explain anything on the menu and one of the few places where 2 different atmospheres are offered
The portions are intelligently small and each meal comes with some of the best mini-croissants I've ever tasted and a rotating dessert
Dylan says their food choices are customer motivated
My wife and I were on our way to try this place when we both chickened out because the menu and ordering was so weird and different
They have a guy there who literally walks you through the menu ordering and gives you samples of their main dishes rices and beans
Scale of 1-10 multiple visits7 Food7 *Drinks*8 Service9 Atmosphere6 ValueCityScape is deservedly notorious for really shitty design with regard to its lack of integration with the rest of downtown but the Arrogant Butcher portion of it is pretty spectacular in how it makes love to the corner for all pedestrians to gape at
To me it is just another Cheesecake Factory restaurant NOT in terms of food portion but the style noisy dark crowded
I was very disappointed in my 1st visit here both in my choice of dish and in the service
The food is reasonably priced and the serving sizes are great - not too big / not too small
The menu consists of both regional Mexican dishes not found at your average tourist taco shop in Tempe or Scottsdale nor the mom-and-pop AZ-Mex places located in every strip mall in the Phoenix metro area
A really cool thing is the versatility of the menu any course can be had with beef pork chicken tofu or shrimp or seafood
A good sized meal for two sans drinks could ring up at $30-35 which is a good value for great food
My waiters have been nice ready to give advice and accurate on food choices
I may be biased because it's my 'hood but since discovering La's it's my Thai joint of choice for when I'm craving curry spring rolls or Thai iced tea
La's is reasonably priced you mos likely won't have to wait a century for a table and the food is generously portioned and actually tastes good
Yes I know it's a hamburger place but I CRAVE their portobello mushroom burgers - no it;s not a BEEF burger smothered in mushrooms but a marinated portobello mushroom which takes up an entire bun and then is topped with the most mouth-watering choices
The food menu is very limited but they make up for that with their beer menu
Many food and booze choices which allowed me to get stuffed and buzzed
Despite having a few guilt inducing items on the menu they do have a nice selection of meats salads and sides that are healthy and made with quality ingredients
So we had heard about this place from the pizza book and we show up and I kid you not the place is the size of my shed and there is a line out the door and around the front of the building
Food is always good love their pancakes and a lot of menu items to choose from
There's always somethin' on their wine list to accommodate Love their pizzas and salads
two sushi rolls and their shashimi tasting menu
First she forgot one of our lemonade orders she never even bothered to come to check on us after the food was placed not even once which gave us no chance to ask for the missing lemonade; after we had done eating for about 15mins she still didn't show up maybe for a dessert menu
I ordered a medium rare steak and my girl ordered chicken tempura we both were extremely pleased steak is how I grade restaurants and my steak was cooked correctly and meat was of good quality with a very nice sake list so good rating from me
Our food was tasty and our service was great I had the sirloin & fries - when I ordered it they told me I could get other steak on the menu too if I wanted
I would love if Hannny's expanded its menu or made thick-crust pizzas
But I do agree they need to stock up on a better selection of wine meats and even dairy products a written request for Fage greek yogurt went unnoticed
But you can also find meatless options in other portions of the menu
I just wish it came in a bigger size than the 10 pizza
The menu didn't list a side dish accompanying it so I asked our server if there were any fries or salad that came w/ it
Although the menu choices seem limited burrito tacos or bowl the combinations are endless with the different types of meat beans salsas etc
Pretty big store front bigger than most of the Whole Foods I've patronized back home and a good selection of food that doesn't seem over-the-top granola-y
First they need to perfect service so that they're not forgetting bread and amuse bouches; and second they need to change their dessert menu
When the feature of the dessert menu is chocolate chip cookies and a vanilla malt shake you know you don't have a great dessert menu
Nothing on the dessert menu made me say Wow I want that
I had the Buddha's feast from the traditional menu and the Orange Chicken yup
It is apparent to me that with a limited menu stocked with fresh ingredients a garden on the patio and their status as a CSA drop off point D'lish is trying to churn out food that is as fresh natural local and organic as possible
Then she messed up the order and there was an extra scrambled egg and bacon plate but when I saw my dish it looked like they cracked an egg and split it in half then scrambled the half portion it was so small
practically the whole menu & I've always been pleased w/ my food
They have a good selection of wine & beer and the food is pretty tasty and reasonably priced too
Bad things They've changed their menu a little bit so some things aren't included in happy hour appetizers anymore- throw some chicken tenders or something in there please
I know carne asada fries isn't real Mexican food but man I wish they had it on the menu I could only imagine how tasty El Rico's can make it and did I mention their sauce is perfect
I doubt we will be back Grazies is still number one on our list great food and service
I don't eat meat so I also appreciate that Genghis always has Shrimp Calamari Scallops Marinated White Fish and Krab Imitation for me to choose from  They have a very wide selection of veggies and fruits lots of seasons for spicing- and an delicious choice of sauces
Well the problem is that there are several different menus including specials sandwiches and hot foods
LGO has a good variety of food and for a good price
However they have a larger menu are slightly more expensive but WORTH it and don't take as long to make your food
I tried the fried chicken which was generous in size and cooked perfectly
The wings were also a good size with a nice amount of meat on 'em but not too big
Also they don't have a very wide selection of pastries/food
I am sure it's 1 in a million but I will admit that this location is on my black list and urge people to ask for the meat well done
The shaking beef might be the most expensive thing on the menu at $15 but it also might be the most delicious thing I've ever eaten
The sea bass's portion size was a little small but it is an expensive fish
healthy and tasty food good selection and the no-guilt feeling afterwards
Standout are the veg spring rolls spicy cucumber salad and bean curd/veggies stir fry that may not look so exciting on the menu but it did unspeakable things to my taste buds
Recently discovered by the Canadians Moto roughly translated means don't eat sushi here but everything else on the menu is great
My folks wanted to order sushi so I let them and sure enough the rolls they ordered as well as my sashimi selections were just not very good
The food choices were a little better than some other airport bars
Delicious food great service wide variety of options on the menu
They have a unique variety of out of the ordinary dishes
My wife and I are completely satisfied sharing one $13 pizza although we recommend going with friends to expand the variety
The Vegas roll was cut into gigantic wheel sized pieces that took two to three bites each
- and my own personal reason - I had hit up Lolos on twitter and said they should have a separate to-go menu and I even said on twitter that we were dining at the counter and it was way facinating to watch the food come from the window
The prices are alright and the menu has a lot more than just sushi
What are your expectations when you go to a bar that has mostly outdoor seating; Picnic tables; open fire pits; Horseshoe pitches; Donkeys; Roosters; One man band; limited food menu; serves only beer and sodas;  and is filled with bikers cowboys and lesser so tourists
For $50 you had a choice of appetizer entree side and dessert
For example we're still reeling from the Kobe beef on the menu that was listed at $26 per ounce
The menu is unique the food is high quality the prices are right the ambiance is cool and laid back and the employees/owners are super friendly and genuinely happy to have you there
The menu looks simialr to Southwester/Mexican not the dishes that I have had in Costa Rica at all but I like that that they they have the idea of Costa Rica in Phoenix
Altough the owners are not from Costa Rica Plantains with smashed black beans would have been nice to see on the menu you can find those authentic type dishes at Havanah cafe but o tiene de que qujarse
I love Thai food and my friend who is gluten free noted their menu provided many gluten free options
The best thing was the fish sticks on the kids menu which makes no sense considering there is an angry bull on the front of the restaurant
wine selection lots of fun prepacked meals to try interesting vegetarian products Trader Joe's chickenless chicken nuggets anyone
The selection will definitely appeal to the man's man with a variety of bar appetizers and entrees including beef pulled pork sandwiches burgers chicken and some fish
The place was getting pretty full for lunch so maybe other menu items were better Phoenix AZ 85008than the sad and pathetic dish that I got
The Baileys Bread and Butter Pudding is a stellar dessert choice as well
In the meantime I checked out the food menu
It's the little choices that seem to make a difference when we're talking about food
I have also ordered food to go several times and it is always packaged perfectly neat and they give you a generous portion of their fresh corn bread
- A smaller portion is offered for some of the dishes
But when you go to a place like Beckett's Table why get the one dish on the menu that's obviously there for the dieting Arcadia moms
I have my favorite foods like Brian's Enchiladas which at the small portion size is perfect for me
Here are some of my favorite food and drink items keep in mind that I'm a pescetarian so meat didn't make it on the list
The service was ok and food was ok but I had a rice water in a large sized cup
Come hungry because the portions are big especially one of my favorites KK's plate a mind numbing amount of food that is just what the doctor ordered after a night on the town
The food portion sizes were adequate and the Reverse Happy Hour prices were attractive
An interesting plus point was that the main dishes could be ordered either as a full or half portion which we appreciated
I've ordered the sushi a couple times but I have to admit I'm not a fan since the portions are indeed skimpy
I have had a variety of food here from sandwiches to the veggie pizza
Poor food selection especially when you are limited to the one cart directly next to your gate since they are already halfway done boarding
The portion was small price was high and the fish needed salt
Then when you get to the buffet the choices are very limited and the food is so full of fluff you don't get to put much food in
so it's possible to miss it when driving at night but they do have a med-sized arrow sign that says Pizza in neon florescence light as you enter the driveway
This place is great for out of the ordinary food items and they have a good selection of wine
For me the big draw to the vig is the food menu
it's not on the menu but it is a simple roll I like to order to see the quality of fish before I order a more elaborate roll
My food got there at last and the fish was around a 3 oz portion which the waitress pointed out that I had a bigger portion coming
We were offered a dessert menu but both of us were full
They had actually made the pizza when it was ordered even though the ticket listed a 7PM pickup
All of their sashimi selections are fresh and fish is flown in frequently
For those of you not looking to eat sushi the rest of their menu is excellent
The food is wonderful and the menu changes frequently
The Ahi and the Asian Pear Salad are amazing their quiches are delicious and every meat selection I have tried there has been well aged an cooked to perfection
They have a new happy hour menu consiting of Homemade Artisan Grilled Cheese with Roasted Garlic Tomato Basil Soup Flatbread Pizza with Homemade Mozzarella Fresh Tomato Pomodoro and Basil Herb Crusted Mac & Cheese with Southern Fried Drumettes and Smoked Chili Honey Antipasto of Cerignola Olives Cured Meats and Artisan Cheeses and Thai Barbecue Grilled Quail Skewers
Second off the menu is full of wonderful food selections and it's really not that expensive most items for under $10 including a damn good bacon cheeseburger
The food here is solid the drink menu is pretty decent the ambiance is nice menu is good service is eh
rrThey have a pretty wide selection of meats such as beef pork chicken and turkey
I do wish they had shrimp as one of the stir-fry ingredients though since they have such a limited selection of seafood
As for the food and any menu recommendations I like the Red Pepper Hummus Gambas Con Ajo 5 shrimp loads of garlic and tomato
What I liked was there were two sizes of dessert one size for yourself and one size to share
I really like the food and the choices
Cinnamon Rolls the size of a human face if you're into to that kind of thing share with a friend or four
Try to resist the incredible looking super-sized pastries and desserts in the case or not what the heck just get it
I had pretty much two choices; make your own pizza or spinach queso dip
I'd love to see some different wines on their menu - maybe a good Australian Sauv Blanc or some good white blends to pair with the spiciness of the food but the Melbec that we had was just fine
Dad ordered the ham and cheese but stripped away all the interesting flavors because well because he's a dad and likes the meat and potato type menu
Too many other great choices in the valley that have much better food and that I don't have to feel like I just got taken to the cleaners
Beef roll was oily but quite tasty and good size
The place had a food menu but there was no HH menu
Think a nice sit down Filibertos with bigger variety and a little more food
For quick meals the sushi bar is excellent so is the salad bar and deli selections
It's in a prime spot has great bar food it's way better and a good drink selection
In addition to the many noodle dishes available Cherryblossom also serves a wide range of other choices as well
Sushi rice dishes salads and assorted tempura are all on the menu to tempt your taste buds
Favorite dishPasta Bolognese - oversized shell pasta with seriously the best meat sauce i've had in Phoenix all toped with melted cheese
But there is a huge variety of other food available ranging from items unique to the theme of the festival like pasties beef & kidney pie bangers & mash etc
I had several minutes to study the menu and the dishes of the diners around me
Both types of Rolls were about the same size
[Other Vietnamese places the Spring rolls are at least 2xs the size of the egg rolls
They serve Bistro and flatbread style food - perhaps my choice was silly but it over salted my palatte to the point it started to strip the roof of my mouth
The food selection is wide with a short menu each day full of incredible selections
I even emphasized having a few veggie sandwiches because at the get together I was having two of my good friends do not eat meat
Everything looks amazing and sounds amazing and it's one of those deals where you cannot come in here when you're hungry or else you'll order way too much because the menu reads like a best of list of comfort foods
They are filled with amazing meat topped with your cheese and you choice of red or green chili every time i think about rellenos this is the first thing that pops into my head
Good if you're on a diet for portion control but may require more food if you're hungry
It came with a roll that wasn't heated enough to even start to melt the butter which we had to ask for at the counter plus two sides of my choice
we liked the cleverness of the sushi menu description - one of those spiky clip ball things and the albeit mostly useless river rocks
This is the only place in town where I can get a slice of speciality pizza  for under $5 no red sauce/ricotta cheese/spinach without having to order an entire large size speciality pizza like the other pizza places in the area require
I've tried a couple of items on their sushi menu and it was standard sushi fanfare- nothing extraordinary
Most people order the American Chinese menu for food here
Also a nice rotating wine list pretty good for a pizza place
No food this time around but I'll still support anywhere that supports local like their menu does
Find menu items like tomato bisque quesadilla cheese platters olive plates hummus salads gyros barbeque sandwich meatball sub smoked salmon figs and presciutto buffalo chicken and flat bread pizza's
Nice service with a friendly smile an 'average' wait time between ordering and the arrival of food and a large selection of beer and wine; although I didn't partake in these
The lunch sized portion was just right with 2 good sized pieces of fish a side of cole slaw and the chips for $9 served before 400pm
My husband and I are addicted to the Chirachi bowl which is packed full of rice seaweed and piled high with the chef's selection of the freshest raw fish
They have an awesome kids menu with food kids will eat but upscale - PB and J bruschetta or grilled cheese both accompanied with grapes apple slices and chips AND a cute little bendy toy - nailed it
Trader Joe's this is not - though the smaller size is roughly the same it has better selection and will cost a lot less to find food for dinner
Another menu item I must cross of my list  Oh but the dessert
The food menu at The Main Ingredient is simple and stocked with salads sandwiches and American staples such as mac n' cheese
After months of listening to a coworker talk about how amazing this pizza was I finally gave in and went for lunch
My hubs ordered a medium Kobe Beef Burger which was a nice size for him
They have a completely separate GLUTEN FREE menu to order food from including gluten free desserts
The best dish is not even advertised on their menu board - Iskendar
Tasty pizza dough savory sauce and any pretty much any combination of cheese/no-cheese and high quality toppings that you could want all baked to blistery perfection in the non-homemade coal fired brick oven
All that I tried from the soup salad sushi hot dishes & dessert selections were good & I particularly enjoyed these items*  The Hot & Sour Soup
If you're going to go despite my fair warning the pizza is NOT a personal sized pizza
The food is worse than before - at least mine was - and as others have mentioned the portions have gone on a crash diet
Reasonably priced a large variety or egg dishes pancakes and waffles
The food the atmosphere the staff/management and they offer Organic Gluten-Free preservative and hormone free menu items
The chicken and dumplings on the menu is apparently a typo
The one fish selection is served bone in skin on
The service was OK not overly helpful as we already to look up several things on the menu since it made no sense to us non-foodies
They have expanded the menu to include sandwiches and desserts the chocolate cake is DELICIOUS
The iced coffee drinks are delicious and although I haven't tried any of the food options I've noticed they have a nice breakfast menu
00 you get a giant beverage and a basket with fries and your choice of a burger fish this is what I have heard is great here and shrimp and oh something else but I cant recall it now
Nice variety of menu very good service and very good food
Maybe the Irish don't have much variety in their food
This 'personal' size pizza lasted me for three meals it is like a Barro's size small pizza something that one stomach can't contain no matter how tasty it is
Prices may have gone up a tad and portions were downsized but the food is still tasty the patrons are still trendy and the drinks still flow like the hoover dam
Care is obviously put into not only the choice of wares being sold here but the quality of food presented to the customer
It had a good portion of meat beans and rice except no cheese
They could do with a bit less salt on their meat  and perhaps the burritos could be a bit bigger then again I eat like a 400 pound man so I can't judge small portions
AJ's charges the same prices as The Persian Room but serves a laughable portion of sub-par food
The menu is varied and the sushi selection is the usual suspects
The rest of the selection is great with everything you would expect crab legs sushi salmon pasta carving stations omelette station and desserts galore
Portions are large and we always end up with food for the next day
Our menuSpinach enchiladasChicken tacosChicken enchiladaFideoRiceRefried beansHouse margaritaMargarita w/Tres Generaciones and Grand MarnierChips + salsaSpinach enchiladas were mushy and flavorless - probably frozen spinach and too much cheese
On the other hand their menu had many greasy deep fried things or meaty beef things that sounded like they might be good
;I'm sure the raw bar and other traditional fish dishes on the menu are equally as good I definitely recommend it
However if you want real Chinese food I'd recommend you skip right to the second half of the menu
I'm sure the other selections on the menu are also great but this combo has been a winner from day one so I tend not to stray too far from it -  I did try the jerk chicken once and wasn't a big fan although they do claim it is one of their top dishes
The pasta dishes are good as well with portions expected in a urban restaurant don't expect Claim Jumper portions
You know those mass-market wholesale version strips that are 90% thick heavy breading and leave you about a 10% chicken portion
You order off a menu that is painted on the wall then you step up to a Subway Sandwich type counter where they prepare your food in front of you
Normally the food is good and portions are huge
The menu is somewhat extensive for a small place like this but nothing fancy - sandwiches and a few salads; but there are some nice selections - turkey avocado roast beef with horseradish and a good veggies one too
Unfortunately the dessert selection is limited to a few sad-looking plastic-wrapped cookies and cake slices
They have a good selection of food and open at 6 am
The food selection is a bit overwhelming upon reading the menu
I liked the food here & the portion sizes were good
I asked for it to be made really spicy knowing full well it wasn't going to be no one EVER listens to me when I demand the food be spicy - listen dammit I'm brown people
The waiter* noticed I wasn't devouring my dish and offered to switch it for any other dish of my choice no extra charge
I'll start with the simple there is food here for everyone from the inexpensive happy hour to the reasonable local sourced true food and press coffee even the higher end lounge and bar scenes retail has choices from the classic styles of the Gap to the trendy H&M and most in between at all price points Nike store and a Lululemon for fitness conveniently flanking a candy store
Not that pricey plus the food and portions well exceed the price and service is really quick as well
Entering the store there is a selection of beer and wine to the right and a cold showcase of meats along the back wall
The menu is simple and outside of some small before choices do not expect anything other than pizza
My only option was to order side dishes individually or they would give me a platter of 4 smaller sized sides

You know those places that have gyros with thin insulting child sized strips of meat

As for the dessert the offer a variety of toppings for the fry bread I've had the honey and sugar and the chocolate Both are good but the honey and sugar is a bit messy so be prepared for that
That was my general dilemma with NoRTH-while the vibe there is casual the menu features handmade downright fancy food-served to you by people who look like they just stepped out of Urban Outfitters
NoRTH was too busy to be considered romantic but some menu items cost $20 or more with the pastas and entree dishes ranging from $14-$26
That said the food was delicious and the cocktails were strong though I thought the menu was better suited for a classier atmosphere

That sounds like a decent number of choices because in most places you get the choice of Chicken Pork a few different ways beef shredded ground or carne asada fish etc
For that price and size the food should be better

Microwavable edamame was my friend since I saw the costco sized bags sitting on the side I figured I'd be safe with these and I attempted to try everything else like the random seafoods mushy sushi and fatty meats

Happy hour menu looks decent but it doesn't look as fun as RA Sushi RA sushi has more raw fish maybe that's why it's called Ra Sushi but anywho

The flatbreads/pizzas bruschettas and platters are great balance for the wine selection they have
I really like the antipasta platter and always find it a treat to venture to any of the food selections they have available
Their food is solid the Farmhouse Benedict is perfect they have some great bfest sandwiches their french toast is super sweet they don't have waffles which is a bummer but their portions are generous

I am not sure if this was really such a good deal since the pizzas on their menu all sounded awesome and were much cheaper than the $30pp that we paid
We got a variety of options so that we could all sample each others food
My only complaint with the new menu was the vegetable roll
To our disappointment there wasn't a whole lot of items with mushrooms on it and wasn't until after our server told us there is a special mushroom pizza that isn't listed on the menu and it would also take about 30 minutes to prep
It's actually on their happy hour food menu which I'll get to next

They don't mess around when it comes to portions - with meats on the heavy side
to accompany me to taste the menu so that I could stop creeping and start enjoying the food
The portions were amble but with quality ingredients; boneless skinless chicken breast all white meat sliced chicken in the stacked enchiladas roasted pepper sauces fontina and goat cheeses
Overall great beer although selection never changes great food and a excellent atmosphere if you can get a spot outside
Im sure it was a hard road but there are few if any French restaurants in town that offer such splendidly sinful food choices
Friendly people really good food charm and HUGE portions
There's not a sandwich on the menu that doesn't sound mouth watering and the desserts
We decided on Kona Grill because we learned they had a decent selection of dishes which was what we were looking for with our large group
I am often crippled by extensive menus I find myself agonizing over the whole concept of But what if one of my all-time favorite dishes is on this menu but I choose the wrong thing and never come back and my life is
Rather than list everything I love about this place I encourage you to get a DD hop on your bike or take a cab on down to the Papago belly up to the bar grab the beer list or consult the usually very helpful bar tenders and prepare yourself for some good food and even better brews
Been here a few times and have tried various items on the menu from their pizzas to the hummus to their sandwiches soups and salads
FYI I'm pesco-vegetarian and because my boyfriend will do whatever I tell him to he also does not eat meat so my selection was between the avocado sardine and vegetarian
They have a sandwich selection including Italian beef chicken parmesan cheesesteak meatball fish and pork among others
Pro's because I always like to start on a positive note-  #1- Very unique menu with slider sized burger options that include turkey buffalo lamb veggie ahi swai white fish shrimp po boy reuben short rib grilled cheese and pb&j
I personally enjoyed the food we had a set menu and the food just kept coming out everything from their biscuts to the cotton candy was excellent
Since when do chicken breasts have bones and why isn't that the description on the menu
While the menu looks pretty good I think breakfast might be the only saving grace here the lighting for dinner the service and the food were all exceedingly below par
The selection of different types of tacos is very impressive and the food is
I like places with a lot of variety for pizza since I'm a total weirdo and refuse to eat tomato sauce
Love your tasty foods your prices your amazing variety of goods and your fresh donas doughnuts that kicks Dunkin's ass
As for pizza Oh my god there are so many great choices
When I review it's very dish based and if a favored dish disappears off the menu I feel restaurant betrayal
crispy skin with juicy meat inside and generous portions
The menu consists of typical fast food Mexican and is virtually identical to Filiberto's
By far the freshest tastiest and most generously sized sushi I have ever had
I like the decor service from our waitress was good not so much for the table next to us  and the menu had some great sounding dishes on it
It would be nice to match up a few choice  agave spirits with the meal without feeling like I've been rolled
as you notice no food is listed this will also ring up as a lunch special so you can claim this with your business expense
They have a great selection of seafood entrees that puts both my son and myself in heaven
Second we have a seat take a look at the menu and the server greets us by the way nice server but kind of spacey he takes are drink orders and recommends a few dishes
portions that don't match the pricesway over priced for what it is call me what you like but I'll stick to great food and some what reasonable prices somewhere else
5 to 3 stars for food 3 for the setting kinda cool but trying to be too trendy but lost it when it came to the service drinks and overall lackluster food portions/price
We were the only ones seated in the lounge took 35 mins to get our food while we listened to terrible music pounding way to lould
The chicken quality is ok but has a good portion of dark meat in it
We all had a variety of pizzas and salads
I tried the chicken wrap and it came with my choice of two side
Fresh and natural shouldn't lack taste and whether it was the salmon or chicken terriyaki all I could think is that I'm eating a step up from a healthy choice
be back to try some more food off of the regular menu
EDIBLE CHINESE FOOD IN THE VALLEYNot only a fantastic night time menu
Don't let the name fool you not one dish on the menu has elephant in it and even when you ask they don't have any off the menu
My noodles were good but they were the premade style noodle the wide variety of vegetables and texture of tofu really made this dish shine I really like the skinny green beans and thai basil
Normally I try to stay away from small sized Mexican restaurants because the food usually isn't all that great and a little on the greasy side
After all it was miss katie's pimms cup that lured me here being vegan food choice has become an after thought
After I read the menu and not only saw but smelled the delicious food coming out of the kitchen I actually felt guilty for being Vegan
It tasted of the same care that the signature dishes on the menu were made of
They have 7 different types of meat to fill your menu item with and my favorite is Don Rafa Style which is carne asada and melted cheese with green chile
The food was delicious I give them that but the portions were very small and the sharing concept was gimmicky and complicated
The variety is of smoked meats fixins and other Southern inspired cuisine is worth noting
The menu is mainly divided into sandwiches and meat by the pound
I would give them a try again as the menu is varied and I would give another dish a shot
All the food is reasonably priced and well portioned
Their food menu is huge too something for everyone
I never would have guessed based on the big sign outside the framed poster from Guys Big Bite on one wall the caricature of Guy spray painted directly on the wall the autographed photo of Guy on the other wall or certain dishes on the menu labeled as being featured on the food network
We've also had their garlic pizza I probably wouldn't get that one again but it's the only thing I've been disappointed in on their menu the truffled mushroom pizza awesome
I can't say anything for the dinner crowd but get here before 12pm order off the lunch menu and you'll have a healthy portion of fresh delicious Mexican food in under 10 minutes
The Parlor was on the Best of list for pizza and I believe they are right
The service and food quality has never let me down and I will continue to make this my primary choice in Queen Creek
Food menu is small to average but a decent selection of items
What a selection - lots of rolls if you're a roll person
The pizza is the foundation but with a great offering of sandwhiches and Italian dishes there isn't a bad item on the menu
I'm sure it's excellent -- but after waiting on line for 30 minutes on a Saturday morning we sat down and realized that their menu is pretty small and almost all dishes contain some sort of pork
I'm sure it's great if you like good ol' home cookin' diner food but for this New York food snob the choices are too few to wield my wallet
Their menu is a little weird in the sense that they don't have a lot of items and do not have the typical Thai dishes
Although they do serve authentic Isan food on their menu - they recreate it unfaithfully and only in shades of what you really get in Thailand
This is a vegetarian place with no meat on the menu
This might be in my list of last meal foods
Sort of a cool neighborhood bar with a small bar food menu
Friday and Saturday nights you can wait up to 20 minutes for a table because the actual restaurant size is so small but sooo worth the wait if you want exceptional sushi
I hope more food will be added to the menu
I can honestly say after eating nearly every item on the menu you can't go wrong with a majority of the dishes
The fish itself was so-so not much seasoning and the portion was small
Crispy fish well portioned wrapped in a flavorful tortilla filled with cabbage and pico de gallo
99 was a stellar portion of thickly-cut slices of mozzarella and beef steak tomatoes
So we let him do his best and he turned out a great collection of sashimi dishes none at least as far as I could tell on the menu
We started with some onion strings and chicken tenders off the Happy Hour menu along with our drinks
One observation on portions they are large -- like two Styrofoam take home boxes large For dessert we order some $1
We thought that was fair given the serving size and the tastiness of the food
Being a sushi snob from LA the portions were quite large and in charge and the sushi was fresh
The menu has a huge variety of breakfast dishes sandwiches salads and soups
They have a nice selection of toppings fresh fruit nuts cereal mochi some other British stuff I'd never heard of although it's always a little scary having it self-serve salad bar style so it sits out for people to get their germs on your food
The kids menu didn't had much for my 17 mo/old sonmost  everything was fried  he doesn't  like fried food much
My family enjoyed ordering food from the menus instead of waiting in long lines at Harkins
There was not an unrealistic wait for the food and we didn't miss a minute of the game
So not only are you paying to get into the overall event you are paying anywhere from $2-$6 for every one of your food samples which are bite-sized at best and $1-$4 for a 4-oz beer or taste of hard alcohol on top of whatever they charged you to enter the alcohol area
Only negative man the light is to dim to read the menu or see your food when it arrives
Given the almost non-existent variety of pho options in the north Glendale/Phoenix area Pholicious ranks above many ahem Avina- vomit to fulfill your hungover cure of beef noodle broth cravings
Completely fresh ingredients and a good flavor but probably not making it on my dying food request list
Safeway - please work on your fresh seafood selection - there was not much there to choose from
The portions are plentiful and never had an issue with the freshness of the food
The food is standard steakhouse fare the same delicious steaks have the ribeye  la carte sides and a good wine list albeit a bit Napa-heavy
Their regular menu is a tad pricey but the food is always fantastic so it's well worth it
I must say their prices are good with their all day every day happy hour menu which I don't really get anyhow why not just have cheap sushi call it what it is
The prices and portions are always just right and the food keeps us all coming back
However the food is a disaster the menu is all over the place and there seems to be no stand out item
Finally the lady next to use got her food complained that she waited this long  for a very small portion of quiche the server apologized and left and the lady was so upset she left thereafter
Holly big bowl of rice  we all got the med and were surprised to see a huge bowl of brown rice with a pretty skimpy portion of chicken and Teriyaki sauce and that's it  I got the combo bowl so I got some veggies and chicken and the veggies were pretty sad
Don't think we will order again it seemed such a waste when we all threw away all that leftover rice after we had eaten our meager little portion of chicken
the sandwhiches are generously loaded with so many different kinds of meat choices you're bound to find something that meets your needs
The crab legs were fresh and the buffet had a fairly good selection of Chinese food
I got 3 fish tacos and each one consisted of a nugget sized piece of fish on a small and dry it broke apart when you tried to bend it making it hard to eat corn tortillas that with some fresh veggie garnish on it
A few minutes after being seated the carts started coming around with lots of interesting food selections
I also hear the food off the menu is excellent so I would like to return to give it a shot
ALL food and beverage is deducted from the card but even so you only get 1-3 bites/swigs of anything that you buy - the cost is so disproportionate to what you get that I'm pretty sure that you're just paying for everything at regular prices if not more
three little mini-buffalo chicken balls about the size of ping pong balls for $2;4
I thought it was a bit pricey but the food was good and the portion was generous
When asked what to order the owner will point you in the direction of the steamed beef buns the cheapest and tastiest item on the menu
The fried chicken noodles are also delicious and nothing on this menu is expensive
YAYSomething Weird They have a menu but you have to prepare your own food on the outdoor grill
We had usual selections of sushi which turned out to be ok spicy tuna roll and kabuki roll which was very interesting
They make all their own desserts except for the muffins and have a large coffee/tea menu
They have a great deli with a large variety of meats vegetables and tofu a hot food bar a massive salad bar a soup bar a wine bar a sushi bar a great sandwich counter great coffee awesome desserts and a HUGE selection of wines and beers from across the world
The cheese crisps are a must- kind of a Mexican flatbread the size of a medium pizza
I had the Shrimp Etouffe the first time and it was an excellent choice and the second time I had the fried shrimp with a side of the Seafood Gumbo
What good food can do to us I would so love to go there again and try more of their menu
The times we usually dine here are during happy hour/ reverse happy hour because the menu has a wide selection of some of their popular sushi rolls to their appetizer
We tried two rolls from the wall menu and now it has become our favorite rolls
And can someone explain to me how they can afford five flat screen TVs just to display the menu but they still serve their food on styrofoam plates with plastic forks
Truly a treat  Not to mention their generous portions of fries  The cart was convenient for rolling back and forth between my girlfriend and I and it also created the illusion of containing less delicious sweet potato/regular cut fries than it actually did
The food was fresh tasted great the portions were good sizes for the prices
The small portion was a perfect size for me and the hoisin-like sauce added an almost vinegary acidic tang different from fish sauce that I hadn't had in a pho before
The owner was very helpful with choosing a variety of different meats and cheeses and let me sample everything
Wait staff knew the menu to answer questions and make recommendations both had food delivered just at the right time - not too early or too late - and was friendly without being familiar
Between the four of us we split two starters had four creative wonderfully prepared entrees ranging from pork to fish to vegetarian choices enjoyed a great bottle of wine had two cups of coffee and split a delectable dessert four ways come on now
My friends and I get takeout from here all the time and it's great because I can exercise my total indecision right up to choosing food because they have sooooooo many choices
The portion sizes were very well controlled
It would be 5 stars for the delicious inexpensive food and the huge portions of their lunch specials big enough for at least two people for under $5
The portions were generous the dishes were good and with rice it turned out to be too much food for the three of us meaning we had some pretty good food to take home
Good sushi great beers interesting appetizer selections including the justifiably famous Hot Rocks
Here is what I like-A trough of cheese for me to drool over and spread on a variety of toast-point options- Creative hot and cold sandwich's including the Chicken Gruyere with Pancetta and Balsamic Onions- try this on Sourdough rather than the Baguette and you won't be sorry
What so I'm going to tell you I want something you're going to leave your post to get me a menu wait for me to choose give my order to the kitchen and then bring my food to me so I can eat it standing up in the corner of the Kiddie Corral
All I was doing was minding my own biddness reading the menu posted in the front window as I strolled by
I ordered a full glass as i munched my salted feeder-corn-looking appetizer and selected from the menu full of great descriptions of the dishes and even several photos to help a gringo like me
Another fun item is the Rosita Chiquita Sampler - you choose 4 mini items from a list - I usually get a Chicken Taco Beef Flauta Green Chile Beef served in a little tortilla bowl and a Green Corn Tamale
It's got an extensive menu from pizzas to deli sandwiches
Where do some of you eat where you walk away barely full and have spent over $20 on so so fast food and call it cheap and large portions
The fish was nothing to write home about and if you're looking for actually delicious fish & chips and not just a cheap Tempe staple you'd be better off going to Rula Bula or 4 Peaks which have fantastic beer selections to boot
Get past that and you will discover a great variety from comfort food favorites to fresh and funky
The Happy Hour menu food and drinks were great too
The dessert selection isn't particularly exciting but they dishes they do offer are good from a light and tart key lime pie to a sweet creamy banana cream pie
You can't get fresher than live fish swimming around in monsterous sized tanks
True Foods has a delish watermelon/heirloom tomato salad on their menu so I asked my server to add heirlooms to my salad
Our server brought out the menu took our drink order and we asked for a few more minutes to fill out the fun sushi-like menu to design our very own antipasti
The Salumeria sandwich was our favorite packed full of artichoke hearts fresh mozz roasted peppers and a variety of meats
It's basically thin white noodles with veggies and an assortment of your choice of meat combo with a side of Nouc Cham sauce that you pour atop and mix into the noodles
The dishes provided rather generous portions we ended up taking half of our meals to go
The presentation of the food is really creative and it makes up for the small portions
I tried 5 different items on the menu and they all tasted the same like not good cafeteria food
But it certainly isnt Chicago style and its simply mediocre mid-size crust pizza
I ordered a shredded beef burro and a chicken taco combo plate because it was one of the best deals on the menu at $7
The sandwiches are the perfect lunch size and not overwhelmingly large that leads to a food coma
a mix of a simple casually-upscale atmosphere including a terrific patio area lounge music that sets the mood without drowning out conversation good service and of course excellent sushi and other menu items
From Yelp reviews we expected to find a great selection of Italain staples like dried pasta and canned tomatoes and also a great deli selection of meats and cheeses
The pizza arrived quickly and was also very big - the menu states the personal pizzas are 12 but it appeared larger to me - six slices of gooey cheesy garlicy goodness atop a wonderfully crisp crust
When I was waiting for my food the man who greeted me said that he felt the best thing on the menu was the #3 Hatch green chile and chicken enchilada which I agreed sounded good
Jalapeno Inferno has a separate menu dedicated to food items that contain Hatch Chiles and if you were to ask for recommendation of what to order they will tell you to order off this menu which of course we did
Anyway we did a phone order for a small pizza that was half Pesto chicken for me  and half marinara for hubby with other toppings of his choice
The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about the food and beverage menus so ask them for advice if you're having trouble deciding
It was pretty good but the meat was underseasoned and there wasn't enough for the size of the roll 10 inch I needed more onions than they gave me but it was still a decent cheesesteak
My chicken & sides were very tasty & at a smaller lunch portion I almost cleaned my plate
Were looking at the basics Customer service Food Quality of beer and variety especially when it comes to a brewery and ambiance aka mood or vibe of the restaurant
after a while of checking out their digs and studying over the menu and drink/food specials they had for weekends we opted to go for the order any regular appetizer and get you're first beer for $1 deal

The menu features all your traditional favorites plus some more upscale options such as mojo garlic shrimp and chicken mole
They've had consistently good prices with a good selection of meats vegetables and sauces to choose from
I wanted to get a full taste of Tea Lite Cafe so we ended up ordering the Tea Lite Special which comes with spring rolls egg rolls and Pho choice of chicken or beef
We were able to sing and sing until our throats were sore and our tummies wanted food; we didn't even get through everything on our playlist
In addition to delicious food and generous portions the prices are super reasonable
As I waited for my salad  I read over their other menu offerings and I will for sure come back for a taste of their wood-fired pizza panini and Gelato
Most of the food is good but the best thing on the menu is the Monaco Foccacia
The concession stand choices that we saw were pizza nachos pretzels and candy
When I asked about the portion that was to accompany the second dish he said he would check
They let you know the portion size is appetizer size but it is more a one bite size at least my husband's and mine our daughter's portions were a bit larger I guess because it was her birthday and she did like every one of her dishes
The desserts were delicious and you could actually share them since the portions were the perfect size
In SF Trader Vics has a poignant menu and a variety of different types of beef/seafood/chicken/wok
I don't eat seafood so I was expecting to see my favorite Peppercorn NY Strip on the menu not there
The portions of the meats were astonishing absolutely huge
I doubt I will be back but it wasn't a bad experience and for someone in the Ahwatukee area i would say if they have time and don't have a ton of money to spend on Teppan or sushi it is not  a bad choice
My favorite item on the menu is now listed under pizzas and described as a Spinach Pie
Looking over the menu my stomach told me to go with the chicken burrito
I liked the decorthe small feelthe art workservice from the barthe taste of the beefthe size of the pattythe cooked to orderI did not like the toppingsthe priceno side's includedThe burger is a great hunk of beef cooked to order on a huge bun served with burnt bacon and cheddar cheese
We got to Mark's around 950am took a look at the menu decided on the Irish eggs its severed over corned beef hash  I do love eggs & hash
my wife ordered a pasta dish from the menu and the bartender said he has never heard of it so she got a kids hamburger ok
They're great but Lon's is the only choice on property for food so even it would get old quickly on a long stay
Looking at the menu I saw many things I could certainly try but with The Big Unit staring at me it had to come down to that -- a 22 inch full pound Vienna Beef hot dog
They have the Mother of All Brownies on the menu and it is seriously the best dessert I have ever had at a sports bar
Thai food has always been on my list but I never was intrigued enough to go out and try it until now
They had Chinese type dish on their menu which I try not to want because I want to try Thai
He should have warned me of the size of this dish
The food portions are rediculously huge and the prices are good
The servers need to mention the size of these dishes especially when you order the full
Food good portions huge price reasonable service ok
I ordered the three piece chicken meal expecting to stuff myself contented with fried goodness and slip into a glycosidic stupor from a criminally sized slab of red velvet cake
Yes Mama's has an italian beef/ vienna beef dog heavy menu but they also have salads and sandwiches not including italian beef just in case youre not in the mood for it like I was
You really can't go wrong with anything on their menu although their seafood offerings are my least favorites
xx but their online menu has the same Pizza for $14
I ordered some curry chicken thing and my nieces had grilled cheese off the kids menu
Noble Beast has a fantastic selection of natural pet foods for both doggies and kittys

The $15 seafood pancake which had very little seafood and  tasted very fishy/gross was half the size of what would typically served
00 with your choice of tofu chicken or shrimp is a combination of ingredients made just for teriyaki sauce
It is the perfect portion of Asian vegetables brown rice cooked just right and for my serving - chicken slices glazed with teriyaki sauce
Executive Chef Payton Curry is also there to demonstrate pulling fresh mozzarella which is served with a variety of sauces and toppingsIt was fun walking around this bustling market sampling food like tamales which we intend to come back for next week
I would suggest the sushi rolls and the Chicken Katsu is probably their best dish which is pretty awesome but expect the other menu offerings to not quite exceed it's awesomeness
A lot on the menu sounded awesome too like the sandwiches and pizza but I am most intrigued by the 3-6 happy hour and discounted apps
Every single limited selection dish sucked
Great portions of high quality meat and yummy breads
I love the selection of Boar's Head meats as well as I can't find them at the Fry's down the street
Most recently i've tried the Rojo Diablo sandwich chicken breast fried & dipped in wing sauce of choice with medium buffalo sauce
Shane the bartender eased us into the menu both drinks and food and made some excellent suggestions
The food prices are a little high but the food quality and portion sizes are also very good
The dish also came with tomatoes which I hate and would swear weren't listed on the menu
We ordered the calamari a dinner size portion salad and split it and a pasta dish
They also do not have any desserts on the menu
I ran through the list and looked for whatever looked the most unique and I settled upon the apricot BBQ chicken sandwich
If you live far away I would say to not kill yourself trying to get there because you could just as well go to BJ's or Four Peaks and it'd be about the same give or take except that the creative albeit short food menu makes up for any shortcomings
Finally a legitimate cheese shop with a great selection of wine meats pasta and gifts
They are still small but you have to start somewhere and although limited seating their selection of cheese wine and meats is awesome and we managed to find a table
A large portion of Barrio's menu consisted of different variations of shellfish and fish
the mite sized insect that I found scampering on a lettuce leaf in the dish
I've traveled extensively in Sonora and can say the food at SMG is the real deal
I am a bit of a picky eater when it comes to meat and sometimes I have trouble with the menu
The portion of fish on the salad was the smallest I've ever seen
It was only choice to eat some Turkish food in Valley
I hope with this  new Turkish restaurant Med Fresh Grill can reconsider their menu again to find the true essence of Turkish food
Olive and Ivy is a restaurant in downtown Scottsdale that features great food a very extensive wine list and an all around cool atmosphere
+ Points- Calorie count for each item on the menu after all this is a health food joint- Taste of the food- Speed of Service- Points- Misleading descriptions on the menu - my wife ordered a heirloom tomato salad got some leaves and 2 slices of generic safeway tomatoes
The menu sounded delicious but it really wasn't- We ordered the tortilla soup which was supposed to have chicken in it it was so fishy tasting I'm really not convinced it was chicken not to mention it was one big hunk of chicken which needed to be cut with a knife
Boy can I just state for the record that it is seldom a good idea for a restaurant to screw around by replacing their menu with ethnic food to celebrate holiday's
they gave us a special menu with all Mexican food especial's and the only regular Wally's food available was the Wally burger and wings
The crepes are a different dessert choice from your standard dessert menu served at most restaurants
The portions are good and the spices and ingredients are perfect for the dishes they serve
Looking over the menu I decided upon the chicken pita
They have a pretty extensive sushi menu as well as non sushi items for those who can`t handle sushi
I mean the food is the same the menu appears to be the same and I swear that the lady working my register is the same lady who used to be there during the Miracle Mile days
My favorite thing on the menu is the baked scallop roll
While it may not be my choice for every Friday and Saturday night that I'm in Phoenix it's a great laid back spot to grab some food and a beer
Although still a bit on the warm side we sat outside underneath a grandfather tree and between the patio decor glistening lights and secret garden-like atmosphere it was already a positive experience without even tasting the food
I'm hoping the manager will see this review and thank Tim for his selection in food beer and being the best waiter we had this weekend
When I got there the biggest eyesore is that they tried to make their portion of the Food Court as a regular Chinese restaurant
I think it's a restaurants responsibility to narrow the selection down to those selections that pair well with their food offering
We each ordered a pasta dish me the pesto spaghetti large - $18 and my companion the duck chiatarra one size - $12
I'm not too crazy about their dessert selection so we passed on that
I ordered the salmon which is not on the menu but the raw fish was on display
Like I said food was good atmosphere charming but no choices in menu
More the most part you get good portions for the food you pay for
And if you're looking for a quality drink to go with your food Half of Delux's menu is alcohol
The variety is limited although they have many creative rolls - they all amount to the same few ingredients-crab mix fried eel shrimp salmon
In all seriousness the selection of meat is actually really good with everything from lamb ostrich antelope and kangaroo to the standbys of beef Kobe beef and turkey
Um no worries for her because she dominated the rest of that menu ordering a falafel sandwich [in pita] za'atar bread [dipped in labne purchased at the back deli] and six veggie grape leaf rolls
For the most part steaks run around $30 to $45 depending on cut and size and unless someone's cut out your tongue I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy or probably love your food
The fish always tastes fresh the price is good really good if you do the all you can eat menu
Mill Ave has a variety of different foods but working here forces me to grab something quick
Slices offers rather large portions of pizza for a great price
The dessert menu is very tempting with a variety of dessert crepes but I felt we should do a fondue so we got the chocolate fondue for 2
To maintain a successful restaurant you need a good menu with quality food nice decor/ambience and great service to keep the patrons coming back
To give you an idea of the variety and the general immenseness of the place I'm going to name of just a few of the things I saw there on just our last visit BBQ Beef w/ opt Buns on the side Tacos Black-eyed peas fried okra pork & potatoes steak spinach salad mixed green salad chicken salad fruit salad ice milk brownies cookies cakes blueberry pie bread pudding chocolate pudding cottage cheese fresh melon you can see them cutting it putting fresh stuff into containers Fried clams Fried shrimp fried rice fried chicken mashed potatoes and several soups
Only fast food and even the chains like Quiznos etc only have a limited selection
Daughter has limited sense of adventure for foods so I figure this place always offers her bail-out choice of Italian
I was a bit confused on the organization of the sushi and the fact that we didn't have a sushi menu to write on
Don't get me wrong I'm a lover of the majority of items on the menu and my all-time favorite meal here is the Secret BBQ Chicken sandwich with a side of coleslaw the best
The meat selection is pretty poor for a Korean/Asian market
The only advantage over the smaller Mesa store is the larger selection of banchan korean side dishes
Their food in my opinion tastes like a slightly better tasting healthy choice
We chose a menu that featured an antipasti a couple of delicious pizzas of our choice and a sweet nutella crepe for desert
Sometimes there isn't a great variety but if you don't see the dish that you want on the conveyor belt you can request it from the sushi chefs
So five stars for food and service and beer selection but I have to hold back one star for residual hunger pangs
Besides Mediterranean food the menu includes burgers hot dogs large salads chili & daily special combos
When I order my food I don't have some vapid 16 year old girl asking me if I want to super size it or asking me if I'd like to try their new suspicious food invention and it's not gimmicky and they don't enter into promotional deals with children's movies that require them to stick a $0
Robert has a great list of main dishes sides and deserts for you to pick from but will also work with you on any special requests
Over the years I've had just about every single item that Robert has on his standards menu and it is literally some of the best catered food I've ever had
Size-  A pet peeve of mine is when I get tossed a plate of wings that are so tiny  they look like they came from a preggo chicken's embryo
My orange chicken came in a decent sized order but tasted like someone dumped a bottle of sesame oil in the batch
The saving grace for this place is definitely its cleanliness but the flexibility on the menu the relatively high prices compared to the portion sizes and the taste of the food is really all lackluster
Pulled pork was also ordered and was given an good   - the star of the meal was chicken fried chicken - huge portion pounded thin deep fried and covered with a white gravy
the portions are big and we took most of it home - no room for dessert
The hummus was tasty and spicy they have a very good variety of dishes and dessert
Also if someone in your party is not very enthusiastic about Mediterranan food they have other popular choices such as Indian dishes lasagna fajitas etc
It was supposedly 5 courses I was thinking tasting menu like not expecting huge portions but they served it as 3 courses salad main dessert and the pasta was obviously premade and just glopped on the plate one big spoonfool to each corner
The pizza in my mind is a little weak - I don't like how they cute them in squares and the flavors are too overpowering like they need to take of one ingredient on each menu item
There were a ton of greens and the seafood cakes that came on top of the salad were both flavorful and well-sized
For $45 we had a choice of two salads one entree and a special dessert menu which meant fewer choices with the groupon than without
Whole Foods definitely reminds me of Nugget in Northern California but it has a wider selection of foods than Nugget
+Neat clean store great decor and atmosphere very casual and welcoming+Great food and selection fresh and delicious+I would go here for lunch so much delicious food and decently priced at least it's healthy no fast food
There is a good variety of speciality pizzas available for all palettes as well as the usual build-your-own option
We had the meat ball starter for 2 huge portion with Gluten Free bread - Delicious fresh and very tastyThen I got a pizza - Italian style with fine crust and plenty of topping on it fantasticAnd the best of all Gluten Free Chocolate Brownie with Coconut milk Ice Cream - DivineThe place looked great the staff friendly and the bill had a good price
The personal sized pizzas which are big enough to share are light yet filling
While you can create your own pie I order one of the pizzas listed on the menu and modify it if necessary
I had the San Jaun platter which had a variety of Puerto Rico dishes
The fish tacos were under seasoned portions of Mahi Mahi
Though not blow me away fantastic this place has large portions good value and stand-up food
They are known for dim sum but I found their almond chicken lunch special is my choice here for the time being
A  bit surprised at the high prices but figured that the trendy factor in old town and the atmosphere was the reason because the teeny portions of the food and the quality is just GOOD like the Good egg not great not bad just good
I went with a dish off their seasonal menu and it did not disappoint
The menu has a mix of Vietnamese and Chinese dishes with prices ranging from $6
The food is so plain and the menu so basic that it behooves me to come to this conclusion there's nothing new here folks
Stand-outs on the menu include the truffled mac and cheese with prosciutto and the citrus-brined fried chicken
Joe's Farm Grill offers selections for breakfast then the rest of the day offers burgers sandwiches pizza ribs lots of sides salads and more
Menu items change periodically but the duck cake appetizer is a mainstay and for good reason - it's a dish he's been making his whole career and it's delicious
I love the Desert Ridge location because they have sushi in addition to a really large thai menu
It's bright with fresh vegetables that aren't cooked to death and full of a variety of meats including shrimp pork and chicken
Take out only and very limited menu but who cares there food is great
I had the seafood provencal from their seasonal menu yesterday and it was so very delicious i was literally making yummy sounds mmmm
The pizza my friend ordered was good at least the portion of crust I tried anyway
Dessert of fall apple crumble was insanely good but also insanely small of a portion   / coulda eaten buckets of it
The sushi selection is alright but the rolls are poorly made compared to other restaurants
in couple weeks so I had a bucket list of all of these types of food to have out or/and make at home
And buyer beware the Suiza sauce - which at first glance on the menu one might assume that the sauce is a special house sauce that adds that great vibrant kick to food - is actually just sour cream
The menu was impressive with its edamame dumplings and teriyaki brown rice with tofu but the food itself wasn't AWESOME
With only a few TVs they may need to beef up the menu
Now on to the main points-Meal will set you back only $4 to $6 bones per person cash only-Chicken may be ordered white or dark and is the most flavorful and crispy grilled ignore the red-dyed skin it will be the best grilled chicken you have ever had-Carne Asada is always cooked to perfection not overcooked or stringy or chewy always is Carne Asada greatness-Not only do meals come with your choice of flour or corn tortillas they come with perfectly salted pinto beans not refried fresh salsa and red onions that seems to have been soaked not pickled reducing their flavor to a delicious subtle onion instead of a crunchy onion
The Fry Bread House has a decent menu of traditional Arizona Indian foods including posole mutton stew and yes fry bread
We scanned the menu and quickly decide on antipasto plate Rosa and Wiseguy pizzas
If you like Thai food and live in the SE Valley this place has to be on your list
The menu is simple which means they can focus on doing the food very  well
They had a New Year's menu that we all ordered off which included a salad entree seafood side and dessert
If you are a vegetarian and you love Greek food beware of Jay's Gyros their vegetarian selection is overpriced and tastes like trash
I understand the name of the place has Gyro's in it so I can't say that their meat selections are bad
Now they have chicken sandwiches and chicken bites on the menu
I peered over the menu which on one side displayed food and on the other displayed drinks
The menu is limited but had my favorites pizza salads and sandwiches
After plenty of time to look at the menu several times I decided on the Americano Pizza
The menu has more than pizza on it though
if you want to eat the good food on the menu order the Korean food
I didn't try any of the other food on the menu ie hamburgers
I had the chicken tacos which were the perfect size for me
Heaping portions hot food friendly but not overbearing thankfully staff
which is less than a block away but if you are dying for Mexican food in the winter when Jalepeno's is usually packed this isn't a bad second choice
the pizza was fine - I'll try another selection next visit
We noticed that on the menu they feature tons of different burger preparations/styles and let you choose your patty type between an Angus patty Kobe patty for $3 more a chicken breast turkey burger and a veggie patty and your bread type ciabatta sesame bun multigrain bun sourdough multigrain bread rye and bed of lettuce which is nice for those watching their carb intake
It's nice you can custom order your pizza just be aware that it will probably come out even more expensive than if you order from the regular menu
I've never actually eaten dinner here because the happy hour food menu is enough to fill you up but I think I've tried almost all the items on the happy hour menu and I would recommend every one Ahi tacos guacamole green chile pork stew big ass burger seared ahi lamb chops and fondue and the drink specials are all mouth wateringly delicious
Pretty setting friendly but inexperienced service fun menu generally tasty and overpriced food
I had been eyeballing the short ribs dish ever since I checked out the menu online and hoped that the dish would live up the hype that I built up
The sandwich bun seemed maybe fresh made but didn't seem like an Italian Roll listed on menu
these guys have really stepped up their game a notchback in the day it was subpar reallybut i ordered a spinach and sausage pizza a few weeks back and it was great not too much cheese and good thin crispy crustnot many places around the area are open latecome 1am you have a choice between various disgusting fast food chains ex$pen$ive $ilver mine $ubs or these guys which when you line em up isnt much of a choice at allgood job fella's now just dont mess it up
Everyone I know that's eaten the miso soup rates it above average There's a wide variety of rollsappetizers and drinks that are reasonably priced out-with happy hour
Their pizza sizes are kind of unusual as they start with a 8 inch mini and go up to a 16 inch extra large
I give the restaurant the most credit for having the few Lao menu items as it is rare offering in Phoenix the majority of the menu items were Thai dishes and they were good too
The food is delicious and pretty inexpensive the portions are also very generous
- The bread/roll doesn't hold up to the size and composition of the sandwich
there are six pizzas on the menu and we ordered four of them
We ordered a spicy tuna roll from the sushi menu treating as our starter their menu starters just didn't appeal today
Well we intended to have breakfast and they certainly have quite a few yummy sounding and smelling breakfast food options on their menu
They carry all the norms as far as snacks go but then they have their selection of foods you might need but don't want to go all the way to the grocery store to get
Our waiter was very helpful with the selections explaining in detail which dishes would suit our individual tastes
I ordered the individual size Spinach and Artichoke Deep Dish Pizza
We ordered the dumplings in chili oil from the dim sum menu as an appetizer and for dinner we ordered water boiled fish ChonQing spicy chicken and chicken with jalapenos for dinner
The menu is pretty diverse but their home runs are the Americana options Chicken strips and grilled cheese
I loved the beer selection it was great Chimay on tap very nice Dogfish head Raisin D'etre last one yum
They also have the now-expected Mongolian BBQ and a small variety of sushi
Not much was to be expected from this sort of eatery but it seems like most sit-down Mexican restaurants don't serve chorizo probably becuase it's more of a breakfast food and it isn't on their lunch nor dinner menus
Service was good - they were very friendly but when we asked for a menu they immediately pushed us towards the buffet special saying that the food on the buffet line contained the best items off of their menu
The food menu was small but had a nice variety of pastries sandwiches and quiches
Looking at the menu we really didn't see what we thought we were going to see we got some recommendations from the staff and ended up with Meatloaf very good by the way and a dried out pork chop that was covered in a chipotle raspberry sauce gave me a great idea for my next BBQ they stated this dish was there best/fav
The shrimp was huge fish was large square-shaped and the portion size was very large
Their rolls are good sized some places have really small rolls
Also the menu has pictures of all their food well 90% of their food so you can kind of browse that way too if you like to look at what you are buying
I swear my dad nearly cried tears of pride and joy a few times smiling broadly as we ate our amazingly savory large Combination pepperoni ham bacon sausage beef mushroom olives green pepper onion pizzas as we watched/listened to Lew playing
They have amazing food especially good appetizer options for group events the wine selection is wonderful and the service is the best I've had in Phoenix hands down
Lola reminds me a lot of Lux in terms of the food and drink selection and quality however the atmosphere is a more urban than grunge and the furniture is cleaner and does not have holes in the upholstery
Even with all of that rambling about the copious beer selection I must laud the great pizza that Papago Brewing makes
The selection of food was quite limited and we had to wait forever for service
The food selection runs the Italian gamut
SELECTION I was a little disappointed by the selection of food
About 1/4 of the steam trays were empty; it's possible that they might all be filled for dinner and the available portions of what they did have out was a bit small I'd guess that four or five people hitting a single dish would empty it
They have fairly typical buffet fare a decent salad bar; a few cold pasta selections; chow and lo mein; white and fried rice; roughly 10-12 entree dishes; miso egg drop hot and sour and a spicy thai soup; a sushi bar with probably 5-8 types of sushi; and a few dessert selections including a hand-scooped ice cream bar with 3-5 types of ice cream
FOOD I tried most of my typical buffet selections
Overall I was impressed with the quality of the food; most of the dishes were much more crisp than a lot of buffets with the vegetables retaining their snap and the coating on fried dishes still retaining some texture in the sauce come to think of it this might be why they do such small portions on the buffet
Their claim to fame is their large selection of burgers chicken sandwiches salads and drinks
Seriously with about 13 of  what they call their signature burgers 7 kinds of bread 7 kinds of cheese and a toppings list that would make old Mcdonald which they came from his farm this is the place to indulge all your grilled beef fantasies
Their pizza though not great is better than most of the kid-oriented pizza places in town and they offer more options on the menu including alcoholic beverages for the grown-ups
The food on the buffet isn't as good as if you order fresh off the menu so don't judge Royal Taj on the buffet alone
I wasn't blown away by the service and/or the food but the wine list did look very inviting so I'd be willing to go back for a drink when back in Phoenix
Minutes later right before dessert the chef came out-warm cookies and milk in hand-and told us that it was late the night before when the thought of the combination came to him and that he was excited to put it on the menu
It turns out that they serve both menus in either restaurant with Rokery having an impressive fish-steak menu - which we will definitely return for
I was not familiar with New York style Chinese food before but apparently it means dingy restaurant ugly chairs and tables the same generic menu that you've seen dozens of times before flimsy plastic eating utensils and damn good food

I also ordered a kid burger and the meat patty is the size of McDonalds cheeseburgers in a jumbo hamburger bun
Now I knew little about this place just that the food was very good and they had at least a few gluten free items on the menu
I don't know how anyone can complain on here that their portions are too small since that was a huge amount of food and we ended up taking a bunch home
The food was so good I am sure we will return since I have looked at their full menu online and I can't wait to try some of their other dishes
The menu was not fancy by any means but had a large assortment of rice dishes and one could either order the entree by itself or for a few sheckles more turn it into a combination plate with white rice miso soup a salad a piece of gyoza and a chicken skewer
I wasn't raised on Japanese food but I definitely wish I had a place like this in Vegas to add to my list of comfort food spots
The menu is interesting not your standard seafood/steak house however it is somewhat limited and somewhat unusual
They have a pretty large menu of food items too on happy hour from egg rolls and dumplings to even some rice and noodle dishes
I can't wait to come back to try other things on the menu as the food and other drinks sound delish as well

I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that I did order to-go and maybe they had more options at the sushi bar that I wasn't privy to but from the menus there was much
I settled on my go-to safe choice rainbow roll seaweed salad and salmon dinner
The beef was a little too rough for me and wasn't as flavorful and the rest of the bowl seemed out of balance too much tripe or too little meatballs my OCD self had problems trying to get even proportions of meat throughout the meal
Though the menu would lead you to believe the chicken is smoked I would certainly disagree
The portion size is huge and they weren't stingy about the vegetables or meat
Lunch specials run Monday through Friday and they usuall include your choice of soup or salad egg roll wth a little dipping sauce and the main dish which may or may not include some rice if it is a noodle dish no rice

Portion sizes much smaller than what I'm used too with Mexican food
Other items on the menu sounded great and AB offers a list of meats and cheeses as well as a daily special that rotates weekly and a nice array of sandwiches and salads for lunch

Our server said well the house salad isn't served in the big entree sized bowls it's served in side-sized bowl but it's the same amount of food
Their menu offers the typical choices salads breads wings pizza pasta plus some original takes on traditional Italian dishes
One thing to note is that if you order a burrito or a quesadilla one of the plain ones not one of the fancy ones likes the carne asada they usually don't come with ANYTHING in them besides meat and the listed veggies
The monster sized desserts were tempting but I'll save that for another trip as well
My favorite meal on the menu is the Chicken Lasagna made with Alfredo sauce
However I am only going with three stars due to limited BBQ meat selection compared to the others in town limited cramped parking and dirty paper menus
I have to admit I am an aspring gourmet in the sense that occasionally I find a menu difficult because I'm not familiar with the unusual dishes and don't know if I will like them while at the same time sensing that they are amazingly delicious and I should just get over it and take the plunge
The dishes are served tapas style in small portions by US standards because his focus is clearly on quality over quantity so if you lean towards more is more you may find reason to grumble

In any event I opted to order the cannelloni one of my favorite Italian dishes if made right I will order it if its on the menu and the hubby ordered the chicken marsala with a side of fettuccine alfredo

Large dessert selection although we were so full that we didn't try anything
All of their famous complete meals come with fresh baked bread and it is great sourdough providing you get a hot loaf soup or a crisp green salad with choice of dressing small upcharge for Ceasar and a beverage providing you order either coffee hot tea iced tea or milk - NOT SODA and their signature spumoni or vanilla ice cream for dessert
As is typical of a made-for-Americans-Korean-owned Japanese sushi bar you order off the check list menu which is handed to the chef

I do think these may have been pastries available at the market and not their dessert menu items

I was really happy with my choice as apposed to my dinner mates probably to their annoyance because I was making a lot of sounds as I engulfed my dish

Upon deciding our food our waitress was really sweet and very helpful in explaining how Carrabas' menu was setup

The ingredients were fresh but the shredded chicken that was described on the menu appeared to be sliced chicken breast
Certain dishes are definitely disproportionately expensive and too small portioned
I'm a fan of the chicken soup you get but just wish the serving size was slightly bigger

The portion of the short ribs seemed small until you realize the bones have been removed all meat
The decor is french bistro'ish the food is french influenced then tell me why I had to listen to base pounding club music while eating dinner

I start off with a small Chelsea Salad which can be a whole meal if you get the large size and put chicken in it
Their beer selection is average but it's better than not having any beer at all to go with delish food
I think the retail wine selection is less but the food choices are slightly expanded and the quality is wonderful

She seemed to have a good grasp on the menu as we had a few questions about what dish to get
Presented with sushi style menus we were instructed to strike through any proteins that we didn't like and note at the bottom any allergies or things we didn't prefer to eat
All conversation stopped as the members of my party hungrily consumed a variety of tailor made dishes and just as suddenly resumed amidst a chorus of oooh's' and ahhh's while we discussed the day's events and waited for the next course which in my case was an Heirloom yellow tomato sorbet sweetened with a little bit of simple syrup mint oil & tomato caviar garnish

There are so many more great dishes I could list but these are the ones we always come back to   Branch out and give everything a try
It has a pretty typically long menu - I narrowed in on the chicken satay and it was pretty good with a nice dipping sauce
The food is utterly mediocre I suppose what does one expect from a *factory* and personally I find the portions an affront to good taste
If you wanna take my word for it dont even look at the menu and order my usual orgasmic orderAppetizer CalimariDinner Big Rig Pasta w/ Chicken Dessert White Chocolate Chip Macadamian Nut PazookieFYI Whenever your taste buds feel like going on a culinary roadtrip make sure you hit up any of the various Oregano's locations located around the state; my personal favs are the Flagstaff and Tucson locations
The portions are smaller so you may want order at least a starter and main dish if you go
The food was awful my soup tasted like lukewarm bathwater with fermented fish don't remember what it was and it has since been removed from the menu
The fish used to be the size of something you would get at a pub when you ordered fish and chips
The food was decent but the portions were very small
I haven't tried all of the menu but if what I did have was representative their food is excellent
We have tried a variety of dishes but our 2 favs have to be the Penne alla Vodka & the Capricciosa pizza so freakin delish
Sicily Pizza with added mushrooms - about 10 inch size -- definitely enough for 1 hungry person and pretty yummy but there wasn't much sauce
Great location good beer and liquor selections prices on the higher side mixed service lame food
The amount of food allowed me to take home a good portion of it for an extra meal
I always appreciate a healthy restaurant and I am a foodie to boot but this place had the tiniest portions for the price you pay and the food really isn't that great
Could have gone somewhere else with better food bigger portions and a lower price
The rest of the menu varies from omelets to brizzas breakfast pizzas to good ol pigs in a blanket
The portions are gigantic but if the foods not very good it's hard to make a dent in your plate
The dish is awesome and the portion size borders on too big borders but doesn't cross into

I enjoyed the sheer mass of selection of Korean food
We eschewed the nouvelle cuisine menu items obvious there to please that crowd and  ordered the Escovitch Fish and Jerk Chicken since my favourite ox-tail was nowhere on the menu and that is the dish most jamaicans use to test the excellence of our restaurants
The Vig is a great spot for lunch dinner or late-night for some damn decent food served up relatively quickly and with a good variety of dishes to boot
- Menu huge selection of basic mom-pop italian food
The pizza is definitely the highlight Problem was that it was too huge including the goofy oversized menu that hit my partner in the head all the way across the table
-Portions  We had the garlic cheese bread awesome and HUGE - almost too huge though for an appetizer to the point where it filled me up too much and i could barely finish my pizza
The wine list has greatly improved and since they brought in a new chef Sarah the food is absolutely mouth watering
LOTS of meat I am glad there was a good proportion of rice and meat
The food selection is pretty standard but they offer great prices that easily beat Safeway and Bashas
Various types of meats and topping options were a bit confusing not because there were too many choices but because non of them were really explained
I also like that their food selection is WAY less greasy and has more of a focus on health
menu's the tortilla's our food our drinks our water the check etc
I'm not sure what the menu name is but look for the pasta dish with fennel bitter greens acid savory artichokes briny olives - it was 5 taste delicious
Although I've only tried one dish there the menu is a mix of Asian delights from Indian to Vietnamese to Chinese
Offering mostly sandwiches salads and chicken plates it's a good choice for someone looking for something quick and fresh
But the menu in my opinion just uses fancy words for sandwiches like chicken and tuna salad and isn't truly different or appealing
I'm torn with this place because i love it so much but dislike it for certain things so I'm going to stay positive because the things i don't like can be a personal thing about the music they allow in there it has a HELL a lot of beers it has a grand selection of wine it has no food but who need food when you've eatn before going to the LOST LEAF the music is a hit and miss some days a very kool unique style and other days not good and i think this is why i sometimes have a problem with the music is because with all the great local musicians out in phoenix it should be easier to play this place but it isn't
The fish tacos were very tasty the salsa was good and fresh and I was impressed with the $2 happy hour mini caesar salad that was served on a large plate and bigger than some lunch portion salads at other restaurants
Although I'm not one now I was pleasantly surprised with all the yummy choices they had on their menu that t would make anyone believe it's possible to live a long life of veganism; Most of their food is Asian influenced although they have some western favs too
The waiter was not knowledgeable about the menu items other than the steak forgot the side dishes
Local Breeze also has several vegan dishes on the menu phew
I've been to Sushi Q many times when I was attending DeVry University Tried almost every roll available at the time and they were all pretty good and decent sized for the price
They were able to substitute tofu for any meat on the menu and were able to hold one of the four veggies in my dish no hassle no problem and they got it right the first time
No crazy martini list although the bartenders are talented enough to do so if you ask great brews on draft nice TVs to watch a sporting event on and a standard food menu
The portions are HUGE - food is YUMMY Decor is relaxing - and the dining area is Clean
I also tried a few of the many choices of spring rolls and to be honest I don't think you could go wrong with any of them
Urban Grocery reminds me a lot of Foodie's Urban Market in Boston but on a much smaller scale and as is the case with most urban markets the selection limited
Glad we did very tasty food good portions and really good flavor
The food and selection was tasty but I've had better in San Diego
The meatballs were a little mushy and lacked a presence other then the size
They always have a nice selection of cold seafood pot stickers & sushi bagels & muffins fruit omelets and waffles and of course a nice selection of desserts
While Goldie's does have an extensive menu I would recommend sticking to the classics such as the Monaco Foccacia Golden Wings Bleu Cheese Chips and Chicken Tenders
The food was really good- we had the macaroni & cheese bites bite sized triangles not too greasy pretzel sticks soft & fresh with 3 dipping sauces & sliders really flavorful
The servers here are super friendly and are great at recommending items from the menu and their likes and dislikes about a particular dish
Stax is a great casual burger joint with a good variety of meat choices and side options
I enjoyed the flank steak I got for lunch except it was a very small portion and flank steak just isn't the best cut of meat to do very much with
FYI all deserts purchased until July 26th will have a portion of the proceeds go to a local food bank
World Market has a huge variety of products from food to wine to toys to kitchen gear to furniture - it's all here in one wonderful magical store
It was served stacked in three small portions but still plenty of food
I would elaborate on the dessert selection but all I can recall is that each one looked better than the next
I looked around to see what everyone else was eating it seems like couples like to split the food because the portions are big
You get a great portion of food for the price
They also have a full menu of various dishes that I would go back to try
There are so  many other choices for that last-minute meal less than going out to eat still feeding the family healthy food
There is such an amazing selection of services and foods that one must visit to fully experience this luxury
food is good atmosphere is cool and the music selection was great I heard two songs from Radiohead
We were supposed to grab a bite to eat but no one was really felt the food on their menu seemed appetizing and almost everyone opted to wait for the game where prices are much higher
Although we didn't have fish the fish menu is pretty extensive and always done well
We ordered a tableful of great sushi- alot of variety and had a great time
The scallops pieces were microscopic the few squid rings were rubbery and the fish fillet was gross--all on a bed of lettuce to distract you from the real size of your $13 or$14 entree
Upon walking in I had no idea just how famous this place was until I saw a wall covered in press articles of recognition & until I saw the As Seen on the Food Network stamped on their menu for one of their ice cream dishes the Toffee Banofi a double scoop of Madagascar Vanilla fresh bananas almond toffee brittle & salted butter caramel sauce
Our server was absolutely fantastic -- very attentive and extremely knowledgeable about the food menu drinks and even the schedule at the Dodge Theater
I'm a huge foodie and recommend many establishments to my clients and this one is definately off the list
For an entree I ordered the chicken and it was very tasty and a decent portion size
The pasta dishes were especially good but the portion size of the dishes were tiny
The Yard House is my go to spot in the afternoon--not because they have super awesome food but simply because they meet my particular lunchtime criteria- prompt service- broad lunch selection that include edible salads- skinny margaritas- booth seating in a dark corner so I can read my smutty novels in peaceIf you have the same set of requirements as above--Huzzah
With its new aesthetic renovation also came a rejuvination of its previous drink and food menu
The meat provided were goodnot the choicest and comes in varieties such as soft tendon tripe flank and boiled beef
The have a small but focused food menu and tons of great drinks
Family run the interiors are not very fancy  unless you want to look at the entire menu in picture format but really the food shines
They didnt just downsize it - maybe it's not a big seller - there's not one goddam indian frozen food entree in the whole goddam store
They also carry a better selection of baby strollers etc
50DOWNSIDESSmall portions by the time you order enough food it gets pricey could get really crowded if you're there at the wrong time just okay egg salad which is made entirely of eggs and not with lettuce like I was thinking the cute Italian breadsticks are flavorless have they not heard of garlic
The cheese and meat selection are particularly impressive
I haven't had any of the meat choices in quite some time since I discovered the veggie bowl
Great wine list  well thought out menu that delivers and service that fits the food and atmosphere
She was too soft spoke never stopped babbling on about the menu then dropped a dish right next to me thus making me leap out of my chair
Below are a few of the delectable delights that graced my tastebuds on a recent visit and it may shed light on why more than 100 of Arizona's top restaurants have featured Honeymoon's desserts on their menus
The desserts were amazing and even though they look small they are perfectly portioned for a full belly
I saw Caramelos meat and cheese sandwiched between 2 tortillas and crisp up on both sides on the menu and decided to stay and order a couple of asada ones hoping they were as good as the ones from  BK in Tucson
The day that I went had a green chicken taco special and I hope that stays one the menu
The rolls were great too not too much rice and a perfect bite size
Their lunch menu has a great variety of dishes and all below $10
It's a little crunchy lots of mountain biking spandex-wearing tree-hugging-like people but these guys do have one of the best selections of fresh organic fruits and vegs around maybe with the exception of Whole Foods at a reasonable price
The booklet contains a no-nonsense list of foods and brands that do not contain gluten that are sold within the store
I'm a sucker for Touch of Thai's catfish dish and they had the same one on the menu
Great selection of beef chicken and pork products
Even though it's dirt cheap the food selection and quality are on the same level as other $9-$10 lunch buffets
The food menu is limited to burger and fries
For food we ordered three items off the menu all were good but the surprising star in the food category was the home made chips
The main concourse has a large variety of food selection from your typical game day staples to panda express macayo's mexican kitchen and cold stone creamery

I like the selection of fresh soup meats and fruit they sell
That included a shrimp tempura roll a squid salad a regular sized order of the asian nachos and a buffalo burger
They offer variety of selection on their menu from Chicken tenders pizza salad
The red room in the rear near the pizza oven can be a bit tight but is a nice choice if you want to hear each other from across the table
First of all let me say this pho than blows the place out of the water price wise portion size and taste Vietnamese is my all time favorite food so I've had much to compare it too
The servers are friendly and the menu is really varied; I always question establishments that serve such a stark variation in cuisine but this place manages to competently serve everything from sushi to stir frys to burgers and sweet potato fries
This place is obviously not authentic Japanese food as you quickly learn from taking a glance at their amusing menu but I don't mind a little lack of authenticity for the sake of a more comfortable and fun environment
My one significant gripe is that they market themselves as a sushi restaurant but the menu appears to be lacking in the most basic rolls; I usually try to order off-menu standards when I'm there like a simple tuna or yellowtail roll and they're usually accommodating
We had the buffet and it was very good with a good selection of foods
We took a look at the dessert menu and really wanted to order something but had to pass
We'll definitely be back to try Happy Hour and the dessert menu
A few things one should expect when coming NOCA-you will never be thirsty waterboy is there stalking empty glasses like a hawk-the pasta is not at all impressive-cotton candy is complimentary and served at the end of the meal-this is casual fine dining = large rimmed heavy expensive ass plates with dallop of *insert food here*-great venue for a date-menu changes NIGHTLYDim lighting  small cozy atmosphere but not excessively loud either
While the food will come in sample size portions the flavor is packing
It's seems as if they are scared to give you a good sized portion of noodles and meat

tip order at least one side dish per person b/c portion sizes are small
Food was great and the portion sizes were GREAT
The food while a limited selection is excellent
Went there for dinner and ordered the sampler which featured a little bit of everything--chicken & dumplings a small slice of meatloaf and a thin piece of ham with 2 sides of your choice
For just under $25 the price was a little high for the small portions of mediocre food
She can't eat shell fish which eliminates a lot of the items on the menu but there's plenty of good options to pick from
The portions were so modest we ended up ordering dessert as well which was pretty mediocre as well
Summary very disappointed after spending nearly $60 for 2 while getting mediocre food with skimpy portions and subpar service
It's decorated up to be modern and sets the expectation of modern American but then it centers around a bar and has a lot of bar elements like a chalkboard menu and tons of taps and wide assortment of fried foods
I always order the Famous chicken salad or the French dip but my husband orders many different things on the menu and they are all wonderful
Their blend of Mexican Chinese and Cuban flavors is a very unique and delicious combination and for the money you get a very generous portion of food
The menus have real leather covers and the food sounded delicious
The drizzed balsamic was not too tart and had the preferred amount of olive oil also drizzledFor pizzas we ordered everything on their menu
Now the one vegetarian item on there dinner menu is a selection of 4 side dishes but that was more then enough for me
I also tasted the fish fry the Friday special and the portions were very generous - two huge slabs of fried catfish
You might not have guessed it by looking at the drive-thru menu board because it's the same as is the phone number and the sign almost looks the same BUT you can tell a big BIG difference in the taste of food
The salad was excellent although I wished all of the ingredients used were listed on the menu- I had to fish out a couple of troublesome items
The selection of food was very good especially for the natural stuff
Don't listen to the other reviews exclaiming how great the food is
Food there was so-so - the scallops were pretty good but simple dishes like the tortilla were disappointing not to mention the portion size was miniscule
If I was in the mood for a fast food burger In-N-Out would be just a smidge behind Five Guys for my first choice
On their menu it has family styles and we ordered one and I recommend the ones with sour chicken because it's good
They've got a friendly atmosphere inexpensive prices and a menu encompassing both the familiar enchilladas braised meat dishes etc
to the more special dishes in Mexican fare that you don't see terribly often in Phoenix like great chicken mole and offally good menudo
The portions were on the larger size but what's the point when the food was just
The food is good portions are decent but sometimes lacking presentation and even size
Anna ordered a chicken arepa $12 with chorizo corn aji amarillo the menu doesn't tell you but this is a hot yellow chili pepper from South America - be warned and Oaxaca cheese
They have a great menu full of creative salads sandwiches appetizers entrees and desserts
The selection is mostly breakfast foods and a small lunch menu
The last few times we'd gone we went omakase and had a variety of of his excellent sushi and creative cooked dishes
The chucks of fish were very good size and also you had a nice portion for two people to share

95  with a decent selection of apps nigiri and rolls
My toddler enjoyed chicken and french fries from the kids menu
My party ordered one of each pizza on the menu

First off I'll express appreciation for Pizza Fusion's choice of brand in  my preferred libation soda water  they offer Boylan's which even for a greaseball like me is a welcome change from the ubiquitous San Pellegrino
There was no pizza Margherita on the menu what the hoot
pizza which was a decent size for the $13
The food is always good and they have a good variety of all american food

STRONG SUITSMaps friendly volunteers food booze loads of variety entertainment shade tents Shiny Toy Guns Lynda Carter people treating one another with kindness and respect police on hand to keep it safe the sunsets the Janet Jackson group Darg Queens wish they were friendlier- some of em are so snubby
anywho this place has a lot of variety of asian food
Fantastic food menu - There were a lot of interesting options to choose from but we went with the Pan Del Padre Croustini with chorizi and manchego Nocino basically a Media Noche without the pickles and the Wonder Dog a very environmentally-concious frank with your choice of toppings
Things I specifically love 1 a stable dependable local outdoor farmer's market on Saturday and Wednesday - full of awesome local goods and repping the people who actually grow/make the stuff 2 a permanent building housing a stock of a selection of said goods open most days of the week 3 although i'm already a locavore discovering new sources for real food like DoubleCheck Ranch's beef etc - i'm a huge fan
I thought it smelled fishy and could be attributed to the salmon patties I saw on the menu but who knows
The food was great the wine list was extensive  and i was told by my client that they make the best drinks in town
Plus Decent variety of sushi on the conveyor belt
The restaurant is a good size but they seem to keep half of it closed including half the conveyor belt to crowd everyone into a small space where the sushi chefs work
Pros-Wings and tons of sauces my faves honey BBQ asian zing-Offer low-fat ranch regular ranch and bleu cheese for wing dips-Good happy hour food and drink specials-Tuesdays - regular wing specials-Thursdays - boneless wing specials-Service - I've ALWAYS had very accommodating servers and bartenders including changing TV channel to a different game-Calorie counts on menus - make better informed decisionsCons-Noise level - it's CRAZY loud in here even when there are no major games on-Misters do a better job of cooling down the area OUTSIDE of the patio than they do cooling the actual patio area
His knowledge of the menu food wine and the restaurant is flawless and his warm demeanor is incredibly welcoming
For that price the food and selection isn't bad at all
I do not complain often about having too much food but the size of the order of fries for one person is just plain stupid
We ordered the Hawaiian Pizza which was very good our son order from the kids menu only 3
The menu has 4 of the 6 pizzas that are featured at Pizzeria Bianco plus a market pizza
the menu is just appetizers but i guess you can order pizzas from La Grande Orange please don't call it 'LGO' that's lame which is right across the parking lot and owned by the DeMarcos as well
The enormous portions of food no matter from which corner of the world it hails are fantastic
What little meat I did get tasted good enough but the portions were scarce
Given the size and quality of these dishes the price was truly a bargain
The food was great and the portions were the right size and allowed for more than sufficient enjoyment of each dish without being overkill definitely a nice break from the huge portions typical of restaurants nowadays
Not much of an oenophile or drinker in general so I can't comment on the wine selection at all but overall you can have a tasty experience here with generally high quality food all around
The sushi selection is more on the limited side; however I was pleasantly surprised of how fresh the yellowtail and the octopus was
They are one of my favorite stores as they always had a wide variety of reptiles that aren't often seen at other stores and they sold fish as well
The food menu is small but I bet everything is done to perfection
Now on to the food the menu is affordable not cheap I like the cheese and meat boards concept although I realize when they say hard cheese they mean HARD cheese next time I'll go do something a bit softer
It sucks that you're not able to choose from a variety of selections but Not ALL vegetarian dishes are delicious
They had a white board with the day's special written on it a chicken salad sandwich that came with mayo mustard lettuce tomato and onion your choice of a side potato salad coleslaw or chips and a fountain drink for $5
The menu had a great mix of items from pizzas wings salads sandwiches and a whole lot more
I looked at the menu online and figured with the variety of sandwiches salads pizzas and entrees this would be a safe bet
They also had a full menu of sliced meats and cheeses for those who prefer making their own sandwiches at home - plus shelves of imported products seemingly mostly from Sweden
I had the ceasar salad which was THE BEST ceasar salad I have ever had in my life  Also ordered the chicken parmesan lunch portion - not the normal HUGE one and it was still almost more then I could eat
As another reviewed said it was a ground chicken patty when I was expecting a grilled chicken breast after going to places like Johnny Rockets where I believe they have a similarly named section of the menu that refers to chicken breast sandwiches
Well nothing to write home about and no creativity what so ever in any of the foods plus very small portions for the entrees
The breakfasty-brunchy-lunchy menu was a step up from an IHOP or Denny's because First Watch's food isn't as greasy
So if I had to compare I would say First Watch's menu resembles The Good Egg's menu - although I think that The Good Egg's food quality presentation and flavor is much better
The food was decent overall with generous portions and pretty tasty pho
The spring rolls were alright the proteins within lacked seasoning and the sauce was your typical peanut variety which provided them with a pleasant flavor
Proportionally however the spring rolls could use a thinner rice paper wrapper more greens and less noodle in my humble opinion
I have been to larger Whole Foods but I'm comfortable with the size of this store
Throw in authentic southwestern Mexican dishes served quickly and a great bakery with a huge variety of fresh Mexican sweets and this place deserved five stars hands down
Its not as pricey as whole foods but has the same great selection of fresh fruits and vegetables

Until this place opened there were really only a few choices for Hawaiian food
Not only a delicious dish but also over generous in size to be enjoyed again
They have a wide variety of classic breakfast dishes; something for everyone
With my coffee being readied and having already perused the online menu I would be ready to order by the time Samantha returned and with the time just before 700 I opted for two dishes both garnering a good choice and sat back to read the paper and listen to the overhead radio while I waited perhaps fifteen minutes for my plates to arrive
Moving next to my second selection the better of the two by some degree a half order of Caramelized banana & pecan French toast was delivered - a dish that would clearly be tasty based simply on ingredients but actually a nice preparation with the single slice of buttery brioche crisp on the exterior and custard like on the inside topped with fresh bananas crunchy pecans and a thick caramel sauce that tasted good on the toast and equally delicious spooned into my coffee
i have eaten pretty much EVERYTHING on the menu my own plate or stealing off others less the roasted chicken
i don't know why the F you would order chicken here but there's always some yahoo or it wouldn't be on the menu

The portions of the side dishes could be bigger
As with any upscale pizza experience they offer a wide selection of marked up wines
This is a pretty good deal consisting of three tacos of your choice loaded with meat chicken and carne asada on flour tortillas and then chips and salsa is served with the dish
The dessert menu almost tricked me also
Beer battered onion rings win for the appetizer the Philly wrap or beer battered fish and chips are my choice for the entru00e9e and desert is their bread pudding takes 2 to eat it
Also don't miss the monthly wine dinners in summer- they serve new dishes that aren't on the menu and are very generous with the pours

After visiting Lenny's last week they have definitely cut down the size of the meat but the service is still awesome
He promptly brought over a dessert menu so I then had to explain that the reason my entree was still in its entirety on my plate is because I didn't care for it and would like to order something to eat for dinner
Not the healthiest choice - but who ever said pub food was good for you
The seared tuna was cooked and cut perfectly - just the right temperature with a peppery rub the rolls were a decent size with thick cuts of fish and plenty of flavorful crab and the mussels were a tad overcooked for my preference but the creamy texture and buttery flavor still made it a winner
You and everyone youre witn can grab food from their shop of choice and meet in the middle to eat outside in relative peace

They're about 12 size pizzas which are good for individual pizzas especially since the crust isn't exactly thick
But their all-American menu with a wide variety of well-prepared dishes makes them the perfect place to bring out of town guests
I first visited this spot for a foodies like us event back in June where I was able to sample food off of their menu

The menu is varied and full of varied salads meats and pastas and the appetizers are just as good if not the best part of the menu
OMG - don't leave this place without ordering at least two items from the dessert menu
It's a meat-driven menu but there is a lot of options including scrambled eggs and pancakes for the less adventurous

Food AverageService GoodAmbiance Poor - feels like an akward size cafeValue GREAT
Good food but an oddly small menu with no appetizers listed
The food is full of flavor and the portions are perfect; when you sit down you are served croissants and jam before ordering you meal
I will for sure return for the pizza and/or other menu selections post wedding diet
Perfect portion size with a balance - meat grains and veggies
The flavors in the food is nothing special and the only thing on the menu that excited me is the mussels and fries since I lived in Paris for a while and thats like the Mcdonalds in Paris - Mussels and Fries
The food is fresh and prepared quickly and the portions are huge
Arizona losing to UCLAOh and there was a huge football size scrolling marquee on the front
One drawback of being located in a bowling alley and being constrained to add bowling-alley food to your menu is that you're bound to have a customer that orders bowling-alley fare which is never anything to rave about and writes a review bashing the restaurant based on that - which is what one reviewer did
The wine selection is as excellent as the food
Food-wise the menu is kinda geared towards comfort and southern style offerings including mac-n-cheese scallops with bacon and corn grits dungeness crab cakes with complementary slaw pork-belly etcAgain overall good place to go for a casual and relaxing drink or two

The food is consistently wonderful flavor and they have large portions
They have updated the menu to one menu that starts with Chinese foods and ends with Americanized Chinese
Honest to God the Hot Pot is a FULL SIZE COOKING POT filled with chopped up chicken on the bone with skin  if you order chicken vegetables such as bean sprouts cabbage  hot broth herbs  oil  and spices and lots of those Szechwan Peppercorns that have an illegal drug like effect that makes you crave it
The room was not ready the menu was not as we discussed there were meat dishes and we had a few vegetarians the A/V equipment didn't work
Our server was very knowledgeable of the menu both food and drink and you could tell he was very passionate about the industry
Though I have not tried a lot on the menu some of the food they bring out always make me say Ooh what's that
I completely agree with the other reviewers - the food's delicious and the boss and I resolved to return several times and go down the menu tasting each different thing
For food their pulled pork sliders are the best value on the menu - 3 sliders for $5
If you want to be yelled at for trying to get a bite to eat late night come on over to Best of Italy where the motto is Treat the customers like shit and make them suffer for all of our bad life choicesI understand that we popped into your pizza shop located at the mecca of late night drinking - S Scottsdale later than you wanted to be there but you kept the door open the open sign on and agreed to serve us and the other people in there pizza so I don't want to hear how you have been here since 9am
After the instructional portion and several glasses of Champagne we then moved to the bar-area and proceeded to partake in dining on the dishes we just learned about with a fantastic wine-pairing put on by one of their bartenders
I have trouble making food decisions it's a known fact so when I turned the menu over and realized I could order half a salad and half a sandwich I was sold
However it would not be my first choice for Chinese food
By looking at the menu online I thought this was going to be a stuffy overpriced quiet boring Upscale Mexican restaurant OR a Mexican restaurant in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale with great decor and awful food- wrong
Though the menu is fairly extensive we stuck to the basics and had shrimp nigiri no brainer 2 lobster rolls excellent a Caterpillar roll fighting over who got the last piece edamme 2 glasses of a decent Chardonnay for me not my daughter and finished off with some white rice strawberry ice cream
It came with a lot of rice and there was way too much food on the plate for me to finish but I think without the apps and bread it would have been a good portion size
Even so the lines at the concessions weren't too long and while there wasn't much of a food selection there were the baseball game essentials hot dogs and beer
The tofu is always perfectly crispy the dishes especially the chow fun are excellent and the drink menu is fun and creative
Our shrimp puff appetizer arrived - and to our surprise and dismay would guess that the pastry portion was a Pillsbury product rolled out thin and fried
After another long wait our entrees finally arrived and again while the portions were generous the anticipated flavor and quality of each of our dishes just wasn't there
before we went to the restaurant i did some menu research online to check out the menu especially the dessert menu
when the waiter gave us the dessert menu they didn't even have the caramelized banana whatever on it
The menu was a little confusing and little pricey yet the quality of the food is there and considering the location of the restaurant pricing isn't an issue
We're not steak and potatoes types so having such a variety of seafood vegetarian and chicken dishes is awesome
Mostly Asian inspired the menu also features a variety of burgers sandwiches salads steaks and at least one lamb dish
All in all the great variety on the menu good service tasty food unique atmosphere  and moderate prices make this a solid choice for lunch or dinner
We had the fish tacos and the scallops special - all perfect portions and cooked perfectly
He brought the food out and was not very agile in placing our plates my buddy ordered for both of us and always listens to his stomach
Low prices good food with good selection reasonably priced and served at all seats reserved seats if you want them good servers who work at staying out of the way clean new and nice but unpretentious
You go to the cashier and you pay for a your ticket and you also get a huge menu for food and drinks
out of the three filipino restaurants in Mesa i think this is the best lots of choices in the food and the cantelope drink is a must have
While the menu is limited here this allows them to specialize more in those certain items and as a result the dishes are excellent
For instance the dish I had was something I had never even seen on a Vietnamese menu in the US and um
The new chicken salad sandwich sounds fabulous or burger might be a better choice
I have never had anything but the pizza it is the specialty after all but all the other menu items I have seen come from the kitchen look fabulous as well
The beer selection was fine the tables were sturdy and all the Rock n Roll memorabilia hanging from the walls were able to bring in the post-game crowd
The chicken soft tacos are great and come with a variety of salsas and sauces
Here is what we ordered for the four of us two orders of fish and chips a kid's size bangers and mash a cheeseburger for our niece and an appetizer of Scotch eggs
The portions were huge platter size and food was amazing
You have your choice of beef chicken goat but no pork most Somalis are Muslims
I'm all about ethnic foods and Sekong will find itself toward the top of my list
mind you it is bar food so it is greasy delicious and big portions
They generally have AT LEAST 10 different fresh fish on the menu with the option of being cooked 7 different ways
My husband and I are fans of the breakfast sandwich combo choice of bagel breakfast meat egg & cheese with coffee or a soda
Otherwise Cowboy Ciao is relatively minimalist and focuses on the food- Pork belly $12 Pass
Unlike some Thai places I've been Thai Basil serves up nicely-sized portions and they do ask as seems to be the norm out here but not back East at what level of spice should your dish be prepared
This was one of the specials that Pizza Hut runs periodically where you can get any size pizza for ten dollars
But I'm not big on super sweet drinks so their signature cocktails were not on my list of big deal happy hour bargains and the food wasn't anything I craved
Don't plan on dessert unless you like flan since that is the only dessert on the menu
I wish the dessert selection was a bit larger overall we will definitely come here again and again and again
I looked at the menu online and though the food sounded really interesting
Foodwise there is a wide selection of baked goodsincluding some of the best bagels
I got the Italian Chicken and Portobello Sandwich and after the initial laughter at my table died down about how small the portion was I dove in and found it quite tasty
It's good to note and they do so on the menu that Asian Grill only uses white meat when it comes to chicken
Food isn't the greatest but it tastes pretty good when it is 130 am and you know your only other choice is a long line at a fast food place
The food choices are what seems to be lacking the most at PHX as there isn't much offered that isn't crappy fast food at sky high prices or basic ever heard of before eateries
Not my first choice for mexican fast food but I'm more the La Tolteca / La Salcitas type
Food was cold crying tiger steak was little bits of fat didn't even look like the picture on the menu drunken noodles were dry and lacked of seasoning had no vegetables pictured in the menu shrimp was half RAW in the papaya salad
Overall I say the price of the food is good for the portions you receive
They have all three of the essential triumvirate of a successful eating establishment - Great Fun Atmosphere Awesome Food with Ample Selections  & Nearly Perfect Service
Simplicity dominates the small menu at America's Taco Shop and the focus on quality is evident in the food
It will be mixed with some brand of rice you choose on the menu such as chicken fried jerk fried white etc
Great food good portion sizes great prices
Secreto has a nice atmosphere and great decor so I'm giving a second try in the future but I find it fishy that 2/3rds of the entree menu is steaks and pasta when this is suppose to be a New Mexican restaurant
The salads are the weak spot but the meatball sub had four bulldozer-sized soft meatballs
I usually go for the deep dish pizza stuffed with unending amounts of cheese but the flat pizzas have more variety and work well to share
I wish a took a picture now but had a variety of different sushi dont know all the names very well  but I liked the salmon spicy tuna yellow tale calamari and a few others I cant name
Our food came out quickly the service was attentive the prices were reasonable and I was REALLY impressed with the taste portions and quality of our dishes
We went late- 830 on Saturday night- but were pleasantly surprised by the friendly welcome and the full array of hot buffet and sushi choices
Oregano's relies on gimmicks--swing music gigantic menus that are awkward to hold and cutesy names for the pizzas
He told us about the Chef's menu that was basically a variety of foods he scored at the Old Town Farmers Market
I was so overwhelmed I just went for the Argentian sandwich-fake beef strips with hot sauce and fake cheese added WITH a choice of sides for 6
My husband and I split the small portion of chicken fried steak with green beans potatoes and a side salad
The portions are reasonable the service was great of course it was pretty dead that night & the food is quite tasty but not gonna change your lunch/dinner plans regularly
The menu appeared to have a number of options but when I viewed it closer most of the soups and rolls were similar to one another sans a one of two ingredient difference
I got to the third item on the menu as described belowC H I L E S  en  N O G A D ARoasted poblano pepper stuffed with chicken onionsgarlic pecans apples pears and apricots finished with a delicate almond sacue and pomegranates $21I didn't read any further
There are many options on the menu and in my option Mucho Gusto serves Mexican food with an edge
There was so much Sushi that I'm even going to list all of what I tried but everything was fresh served beautifully and at the perfect temperature
The parpadelle was a good minimalist dish
You check on a list of what you foods you'd like and hand it over to the cook in the back
The selection was meat pork chicken and fish
The beer selection is decent service is good and I really like the food
They seem to be known for their fish tacos but that's probably my least favorite thing on the menu
I could see the menu being a little overwhelming but I asked some people who'd been before and checked the other Yelp reviews and decided on the followingBeef Chow Fun - Yum
Everyone had great stories we had a friendly competition to photograph all the delectable food and we each listened in mouth watering awe when Isaiah brought us one new often local/organic treat after another
While it has a lot of cool home decor and imported food and drinks with a really random wine selection that are hard to find I don't really fancy this kind of place
I've always thought this place had good food and that the prices were fair for the huge portions so I was super excited to find one here in Arizona
Great food ample portions pleasant staff and reasonable prices with tons of parking and never a long wait
offer reasonably priced food that tastes great in manageable portions
Portions are relatively large compared to other dim sum places eg pineapple buns are 3 to a dish and large similar to bakery size
Anyhows this place was very pleasant I stopped in here late for a drink at the bar checked their menu and saw the usual American interpretations of Mexican food
The food is okay the service can be hit or miss and the beer selection isn't that bad
But their vegetable and meat selections are admittedly not good
What brings down the rating is that the is ZERO lawn seats my favorite place to watch a spring training game not much variety of food and the smoking
I perused their menu and figured I'd try their famous House Special Chicken Lunch Special included Sweet and Sour soup
- The Food and beer selection is AMAZING- The atmosphere is great - not too college-ey not to snooty like Scottsdale - but a great mix of college young adults and families
They have an amazing list of UNIQUE and appetizing rolls which compensates for their smaller size
My husband and I dine at this location at least twice a month and we order the same thing every time 14  thin crust pizza with cheese pepperoni and mushroom which I crave 2 side salads with ranch and our beers of choice
Their new menu is AWESOME the new thin crust pizza is some of the best we've eaten anywhere
2 Get some fun friends together Oregano's is great in groups of about six - keeps all seating options open3 Grab a deck of cards or two you'll see4 Get the whole group to show up at 6 they won't put your name on the list unless you're all there5 Hang out and talk or play cards with your friends for forty minutes or so now you see why they need to be FUN friends6 About 20 minutes before your scheduled seating order two things DEEP DISH PIZZA and GUACA-TONY
Most people would be skeptical but the meat selection and quality here is really good and their produce prices are awesome
The food is always amazing and never anything that is on the regular menu and the wine is perfect
while tasty each dish comes with two sliders the size of half dollars
Excellent service delicious food with ample portions and overall cool ambiance
So you are looking at over 8 bucks for a standard size beef sandwich before you add on fries and I really dont know anybody who doesnt order fries with their lunch
The to-die-for Veggie Burger and Chicken Enchiladas are stand-out good items on the menu
They have many options for meals with some of my favorites being their salads very large size I have yet to finish one their baked potatoes over a pound then stuffed with your favorites chicago-style stuffed pizza and signaure sandwiches the crispy chicken is my favorite by far
For anyone who might not have already been introduced a pizzookie is a big cookie in a personal pizza sized pan baked to be slightly gooey with a couple scoops of ice cream on top
The portions were WAY to small and the food was WAY WAY over priced
Good food good portion size good price
This buffet had your typical indian selections tandoori chicken lentilscurry chickenmixed veggies that were real good and some ground lamb burger that was just ok
We sat at the bar and the first bartender who was in the vicinity came over after a few minutes and asked if we wanted food menus
We said we'd like a food menu too and then he proceeded to completely ignore us
Places like this tend to tout their Chicken Fried Steak Uber AllesAnd If I remember correctly the menu claimed world famous or something of that degree chicken fried steakSo what was I to do
The package included facility rental food and drink for 50 people LUX Catering three appetizers  two entrees one salad one vegetable one starch basic bar service and a bartender a DJ and Master of Ceremonies for 5 hours a cake for 50 Nancy Rae Cakes ALL of the flowers for the whole event a security guard and a choice of linen colors for the tables and a coordinator to make sure the whole thing went smoothly
I peruse the selection of food available and am actually impressed with their variety
Overall a large selection but lacking in flavor for a lot of food items
I've tried several of their menu items and each time I end up making that holy Toledo this is awesome face that foodies are all guilty of
Food selection has increased since I left in 2007 so that's nice
The server was very polite and answered all of our annoying questions about the food on the menu
Great alcohol selections for happy hour but food choices on the discounted menu are on the greasy side and leave something to be desired
I have spend literally hours at this place working my way though the menu and all I have found is great well executed delicious dishes
The portions were nice and big we had the Tom Ka Gai coconut milk Soup Chicken Sate Masumum Curry and Gangari Curry
The food is delicious and the portions are very generous
Great variety of food - crab legs meat several kinds of shrimp and several signature Asian dishes
My work reserved a whole table and it was decked out with all sorts of apps including the hummus/pita selections different flat bread style pizza's and of course an open bar for our table
Vegetarians should roll their eyes and vegans should run screaming Honesty is the policy here where the Flatliner Fries are boldly declared to be Fried in lard on the menu
I couldn't tell you what my favorite dish is probably the entire menu
The meat selection is not only good the taste is out of this world
It was more the fact that they had probably about 50 2 person tables crammed into one of their big rooms to the point that you could not pull your chair out to get up from your table without being in someone elses lap and forget about getting the meat selection you want if you were in the corner which we were
While I did that he proceeded to tell me of about 3 or 4 items in the menu appetizers dessert etc that were no longer available
Good draft and bottle selection with nice happy hour deals on well drinks but stay away from the food
If over priced small portion dishes are your thing then this is the place for you
Two other dishes from the new menu that our party had was a great lightly grilled salmon on a bed of organic greens with a nice tart dressing
We then checked out the menu lunch menu as were out and about shopping after recovering from our New Year's hangover from hell and came to find the prices really weren't all that crazy; $15 for a Kobe beef burger with fries or slaw $11 for a huge Cobb salad $11 for a club samy $23 for a steak you get the picture
The menu is huge and I can't wait to go back and try some of the other dishes
They have a variety of sushi that can please anyone's appetite
This review is based on ordering many things from the overall menu over a 1 year period however one item there deserves a 5 star rating which I will get toOverall most of the items are fairly americanized and not traditional which you expect from a fusion place - however most items are very average and for the price I do not feel you get good value here That being said the one item that does stand out here is their Shrimp Tom Yum Soup which i feel deserves 4 if not 5 stars - it is excellent and flavorful with a lot of shrimp - make sure to order a side of steamed rice with it medium hot and you will have a stand out dishIn general their soups are solid but the only thing I have not found better somewhere else is their Shrimp Tom Yum soupGo for the Tom Yum get your Vietnamese soup from Khai Hoan down the road a few miles
The chicken was flavorful the toppings were fresh and you had two choices for rice sweet or Spanish and beans refried or black
The sushi and tempura were delicious but just knowing that the $20+ rolls were lurking on the menu made me feel strange
We opted for the couple's dinner essentially a prix fixe with a salad choice of sea bass or steak and the shared dessert
The menu indicates the meat is grilled at 1600 degrees
The menu described it as Poulet Rouge  roasted chicken Carolina-Gold rice vegetables $17
It's fine to under-promise and over-deliver but this menu is a clunker and it gets in the way of the excellent food
Maybe a lot of folks who dine here aren't familiar enough with French food to have expectations for classic dishes like this but the menu should disclose when they're monkeying around with a standard
Waiter did not know the food nor the wine list
There's plenty of choices food for all fans; child parent families and drunks
The pizza's is mediocre albeit very good crust but  decently sized
Ample menu of items to choose from with a small variety of burgers a hot dog or two and some chicken options as well
I never give up the chance at this red meat selection
There's nothing on the menu that's all that inspiring but the food isn't all THAT bad
We ordered off of the regular menu 2 orders or tuna tataki 2 orders of heart attacks and a dragon roll and the happy hour menu crispy spicy tuna philadelphia roll calamari roll shrimp tempura roll and a couple of others that I can't seem to remember
Very attentive but not overbearing   Provided several suggestions on the menu with it being our first visit and even provided a free dessert to-go for my wife's birthday
Just like a sushi menu you mark off what cheeses charcuterie meats cold veggies raw bar items you want and they bring them out with sides of breads spreads and sauces
New Mexican food is the cuisine and they give big portions and rich in flavor -
I am a huge fan of the kalbi short ribs its a good portion and the meat is always tender
As luck would have it it was suggested that we try the Austrian Beef Soup; a special menu item which may not be available everyday
My husband was pleased that they also had a few non-fish items on the menu and so he ordered the carne asada
I was excited to see a turkey burger veggie burger and seared ahi burger alongside the beef choices
they do not skimp on the fish and have such a wide variety of rolls - none of the sauces overpower or detract from the sushi itself
I like the fact that there is something on the menu to please everyone from burgers chicken picatta pasta salads you name it
The menu is creative without leaving out good fundamental dishes
I love buying produce at Sunflower - and their meat selection is great if you are looking for natural meats
To end the meal marathon the group tasted all the desserts on the menu
The Louisiana Chicken Pasta is also always a perfect choice
I have no idea how they were able to extract such little flavor out of it or why according to our waitress it is the most popular dish on the menu
It was a little intimidating to roll up and see the hoard of people waiting outside the restaurant on a Tuesday morning but we put our name on the list and took our place amongst the throng
Food is good with a large variety of choices and creation
My favorite barista Meschelle doesn't seem to work there anymore but I love the atmosphere of chill during the day the books to read and the drink AND food menus
My sandwich was mostly lettuce which overpowered everything else in it I had 1 little skinny piece of bacon my meat was 2 very thin slices of each kind I ordered to where  I couldn't even taste it and I had one little glop of avocado on the bottom portion of the sandwich
Our waitress gave us the dinner menus instead of lunch and forgot 1 of the 2 pizzas we ordered
The carne asada quesadilla blew us away-- HUGE in portion amazing meat and super flavorful
As a Mexican food traditionalist I balked at the Our beans do NOT contain lard
For $9 you get a monster burrito or tacos made to order your choice of carne asada or chicken or both
The yellow curry is awesome and the lunch portion is just the right amount of food especially with the spring roll and wonton chips
We bonded over fish tacos Bloody Marys and the complete disdain for the Breakfast Club Crowd milling around across the street in leather pants oversize sunglasses and hair gel
these were tasty but they weren't very warm-canteen wings $4 6 chicken wings smothered in either buffalo or tamarind sauce we got the buffalo it was good and served with some rubbery celery sticksThe food on the happy hour menu could use some improvements
The server balked when I ordered fish tacos and asked for the seasoned fries as one of the choices for side
She told us that even though the tacos are listed on the menu under the Sandwiches category which lists several choices of side dishes that automatically come with the order the fish tacos aren't included in that option
Then when I insisted because the menu specifically SAYS side dishes come with the items on the list DUH
The food at Oregano's is above average in both taste and size
The above average food and large portions gives Oregano's an above average rating of four stars
Rest assured you will find a wide selection of soy dairy gluten and whatever else is popular these days- free food
My husbands crawfish enchiladas were $14 and a very very small portion
are made from fresh ingredients and include a side dish of your choice for an incredibly reasonable price
I suppose if we wanna catch a movie after dinner we would visit this place but it is certainly isn't on the top of our pizza visiting list
We got a table on the patio and ordered a ton of sushi off the happy hour menu
To top it off the food is actually fantastic well portioned and also decently priced
The girls favorite is they order a large home made pizza size tortilla with a ton of cheese on it it comes on a metal pizza pan thats how large it isI think the only issue I do have is they charge for a second basket of chips for $2
Overall great food average to small portions nice ambiance but avoid if you are on a timed lunch or starving
They have veggie options and all kinds of sides and unique drinks and a variety of tasty desserts
My husband has ordered a variety of dishes and loved them all
if you REALLY want good Chinese food here bring someone who can read/speak Chinese and order off the menu
For a la carte options I recommend the Singapore noodles thin rice noodles stir fried with seafood and bbq pork all in a delicious dry-not saucy yellow curry sauce or any of the chow funs flat wide rice noodles stir fried w a variety of meats/veggies
All the food was fresh; nice generous portion of green leaf lettuce good-as-can-be-expected tomato 2 slices and the waffle fries were in the exact correct place on the delicate Greasy-Crispy Spectrum
Sure Chick-fil-A is not as cheap as other fast food choices but it's so much better feeling the clear juice of a real chicken breast run down your hand than the mucky slippery oil from a chopped & formed chicken 'patty' that a lot of places have
The menu carries a good selection the food is fresh and the desserts
The food here is great with a nice selection for vegetarians
I'm glad I live near Seattle so if I'm feeling the need for some huge portions of Italian food I can hit the one downtown
So many options on the menu and the food tastes so fresh
My favorite item on the menu for Baby Kay's is the crawfish ettouffee
With all the great dishes on the menu it was very hard to choose
We had already eaten elsewhere so I didn't even get a peek at their menu but I'll be going back soon and trying out the food
Now for my pizza I ordered it without cheese not by choice    and it was still outrageous
Then our waiter spent 15 minutes detailing every pizza on the menu
I wish the food had lived up to how delicious it sounded on the menu
Again all the meat was perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked with a wide selection of unbelievably good choices
I haven't fully explored the menu yet but I'd recommend the Chicken Lollipops ya I said that right or the Animal Fries
Beside for the seafood items everything else on the menu is affordable and decently priced
Maybe after that they can work on salmon flavored ice cream for a dessert menu
Had some chicken-part nuggets dipped in sugar sauces of your choice an Angus burger and the fries were cold gritty and tasteless
This is a fit-for-foodies place with a fairly priced wine list that has a pretty deep bench for a smaller place
They had a good selection of different foods a TV playing the basketball game that was big enough to see but placed in such a way that it didn't demand attention or take away from the dining
There was a large and unique variety of teas that I wanted to try out but I chickened out and just got a chai tea latte which was quite yummy
Their lunch meals will cost you about $10-$11 after tax + tip so I don't visit all the time but they are a great choice if you can't stop thinking about thai food and you're in the midtown area near central ave and thomas
None of our dishes was particularly flavorful and I was disappointed to find that the Mongolian Beef--billed as spicy on the menu--was utterly bland
The portions are humongous I ordered the chicken fried steak and it literally could have fed 4 girls
When I was first brought to BJ's with a friend I was a little skeptical of the huge menu and the fact that it wasn't busy but I was pleasantly surprised by their deep dish pizza which still keeps me coming back
We ordered chicken pho and combo grill with chicken pork and shrimp on vermicelli noodles choice of noodles or rice
The menu is extensive bbq sandwiches bbq ribs chicken beef pork fried catfish and fried chicken
The Brizzas breakfast pizzas and French Toast baguette slices dipped in vanilla custard are also tops on my list
Went on a Saturday morning at 830 am to the small coffee shop guess what they were out of almost all there food choices
Food Network turned me on to these incredibly creative entrepreneurs and so they were on my list of must try next time I am in Phoenix
Food prices are cheap portions large but quality and taste are not lacking
If you have no time to grab something before arriving at the airport Paradise Bakery may be one of the best food choices you can find
Vincents has a ton of different pizza by the slice all day everyday plus a full menu of appetizers entrees salads and dessert not to mention some family meal deals and they even deliver
It would totally be in the top 10 of an embarrassingly one-dimensional Stuff Lori Likes list Waiting at least two hours fueled by a jammy red to eat some pizza at 1000 at night
And yes I named half the pizzas on the menu and they are all my favorites
The menu does have an exotic variety of food and can be a bit pricey
The service was attentive and friendly the food was amazing and the prices were reasonable though the bartender encouraged us to order waaaay too much food not that I minded We ordered-Edamame surprisingly large portion-Shishito peppers really good but WAY too large of a portion - I hate wasting food and we only ate like 1/3 of these - only so many peppers you can eat
The menu of food paled in comparison to the beer menu but I didn't mind that a bit
The food portions are smaller & bland minus the Big ASS burger
We sat right up front and were brought simple paper menus displaying the myriad of authentic Mexican dishes available at El Napolito
The highly affordable and seemingly endless choices between 'a-la carte' tacos and burritos and combination dishes could be smelt cooking in the tucked away kitchen as we perused the menu
Their menu is pretty eclectic since they offer everything from stir-fried noodles noodle soups stir-fried meat/veggie dishes and fried rice
She suggested to have dessert but we are sorry we were just too full to take her up on the suggestion --- and there were desserts on the happy hour list as well
The Panang which should be ordered anytime upon entering a Thai restaurant was the best I've never had and the Beef Pra-Ram hidden on the back on the menu was like nothing I've ever had
There is a great selection of both pizza and gelato
This morning I got a dozen donuts here and not only did they charge us an extra 50 cents for adding a tiny cinnamon roll it was the same size as a regular donut so I don't see the need for a price increase here they only gave us 11 donuts
I had something else in mind entirely before we went in  you know the family-style Italian place with green or red-and-white checkered tablecloths spaghetti and meatballs and huge portions
The main menu item of course is chicken and they offer a few choices of family meals with 2-4 sides
I dismissed that and placed my order anyways I ordered the Aegean Club minus the gyro meat because I am not a fan of lamb but when I asked to have the gyro meat removed I got an eye roll then I asked for it to be paired with a Greek salad and would like a water for drink I don't drink soda and wasn't in the mood for tea then my friend placed her order and bill was rang up I handed her the card and asked her if there was a to go menu since this was my 1st there I wanted to see what all they had to offer without a single word she looked at me then looked to the left as in dummy don't you see them right there
they have an extensive menu tasty dishes and it's a family environment
portions are just right not globs of food and definitely not skimpy
They also have a nice selection of alt-diet foods
We went there for Sunday brunch for which they have a special menu and although the prices are a little up there the portions of the food are in line with the cost
the food I can't say never got that far my wife asked for a burrito and I asked for menudo but first I asked for a sample of the menudo to see if I would like it the server  said ok I'll get that for you ten minutes later I asked another server if he could get me a sample of the menudo he said ok then our first sever returned and said it would be about five or six minuets for that fifteen minutes for a sample I don't think so
A nice large slab of perfect meatloaf - followed by the weakest portion of mashed potatoes I've ever seen on a plate

The staff are EXTREMELY helpful with food and especially tea choices and the ambiance and aura add to the feeling of well-being after treating your body to the way food SHOULD be
If you're looking for a pub-like restaurant that has good prices pretty tasty food with a good variety of items on the menu and excellent cocktails Keegan's is your place
They carry a wide variety of good quality dog and cat foods
Whoever mentioned the small side portions of the lime radish and cucumber were dead on
My friend and I split the chicken rosemary sandwich which came with a choice of soup salad or slaw
They both found the dishes quite tasty and easy on the stomachs with only the complaint of the sanbusek's small portion size
You have to go for lunch don't go to dinner because the seen is kind of the same and the lunch menus food tastes a lot better during lunch
I glanced at the dessert menu but was just too full to even seriously consider it
The dish was very generous in size and overflowing with vegetables and chicken
Good selection of food and the non-stop Mimosa's are a nice touch
For our visit they had two salad selections a few unique appetizers belgian waffles made-to-order omelettes roast beef crab legs a very good sea bass and plenty of sweets just to mention the highlights
There are just too many good things to choose from and even with small portions from each tray I had to skip several dishes because I had gotten too full from all the tasty stuff I've taken
The place is huge and very clean  there's a staggering array of food choices and the staff is very efficient and friendly
We were initially brought a selection of lovely cake-like and crust-laden desserts
In spite of the poor dessert choices this time around I'm convinced that people who think their food is overpriced or overrated have poor palates and probably rarely venture outside of chain restaurants where the food is laden with corn syrup MSG and other fake flavors
I also get the entree add on which consists of an egg roll 2 crab puffs and your choice of won ton soup or egg drop soup for a small added fee as it is worth it
The menu is not huge but there are many standard fare selections and some dishes I have never seen before like the Jerusalem Meatballs that Hubby got
They have a great variety of health products and healthy food options
The staples I buy here are coconut water all my veggies they are cheaper than Fry's wine great prices frozen fruits and veggies meat although I wish they had a bigger selection especially more seafood and I really like the bulk department
There are a lot of pizzas on the menu and they are reasonably priced
Food highlights were the Escargots & Braised Short Ribs and a truly excellent wine list
The food here is decent and the food reasonably cheap so we keep going back but it's not really high on my list of preferred Asian places
The Thai Crunch Salad was quite good as well and probably for the first time I noticed that all the ingredients mentioned on a menu item were actually in the dish
I found it a little humorous listening to the waitress mispronounce the names of the dishes
The staff is hipster whatever you take that to mean the tea selection rocks the food is tempting meaning I don't usually go there hungry but I end up wanting a sandwich anyway and they keep dog biscuits behind the counter
The quality of food the variety and the cost you can not beat
This restaurant has a wide variety of foods from burgers to cheese steaks and much more
All three dishes we ordered came out lukewarm and the portions are really unimpressive especially for the prices
There were good sized chunks of tender beef in the burrito a ton of cheese on top extra sauce all over and generous dollops of guac and sour cream on the side
Too many Mexican food choices to say that I will be back
I hear from a lot of people in the neighborhood how they miss Our Gang what this place used to be called and they lament the old meat sauce or some other menu item that got dropped when they changed the name
The dishes are simple and there is enough variety to appease just about anybody
We ordered the Viva Las Vegas roll because it was 1/2 on happy hour menu
Their menu kind of reminds me of Pita Jungle's menu - hummus tzatziki baba ganoush wraps pasta pizzas and much more
As far as the food goes I guess I just don't ever see anything great looking on their menu
I hate the chickens I hate the chicken wire on the menu I hate their poor layout and I hate the pace of their servers
Well I call up expecting them to make a new pizza or at least make the half they got wrong in a smaller size
This place has amazing food separate menus for lunch and dinner and a full bar
I liked the food that I had but the menu didn't knock my socks off
When we sat down I thought the prices were high but when our food was delivered burger and sheppards pie we decided the prices were just slightly high for the portion sizes
I just can't justify taking food and not paying for some portion at a place I won't do regular business at
The produce is always fresh they have an interesting selection of frozen items including some great appetizers the meat department is outstanding - I've tried a few different kabobs from here spicy kabob rocks bakery is great nice selection of hard to find dairy items like fig yogurt fair cheese selection including a local fresh burrata and mozzarella that will knock your socks off excellent selection of wines and craft beer and a floral department that has exquisite arrangements
Every entree is served with a bowl of soup a generous portion of rice and a small but tasty eggroll
The food portions didn't seem like a lot but it gets filling very fast
The only thing I can find fault in would be the side dish portions
Rositas will be the perfect place to pick up some food for a potluck I'm going to take advantage of their catering menu since I've got a party to attend next month
For lunch the Southwest Caesar is a must and the southwest chicken is the best sandwich except they have made it a seasonal item and it is not currently on the menu
Our waitress did not speak English as her first language but was able to convey to us that she really liked the food and pointed out a couple of her favorites on the menu
There are quite a few pictures on the menu of the food so if you haven't eaten Peruvian which we hadn't you at least can be safe and order by the pictures if you'd like
The rellena itself was the size of a potato and the meat
Sure they have that stuff but they also have awesome corals a wide variety of Inverts you don't see everywhere and some really cool designer fish
They offer a decent sized menu of desserts and hot food but with a name like Sugar Bowl it is obvious that this place specializes in sweets
Everything on the dessert menu sounds delicious
Came here because they were on the list of Phoenix Restaurant Week and chosen the entries of Seafood Chowder Lobster and Creme Brulee
The food is good and they really do a great job offering a lot of vegetarian choices
We had an issue with the menu order printer which resulted in our food being late in arrival about 30 min
The food is outstanding the menu extensive the atmosphere festive and the service more like eating at a friend's home than a large restaurant
Had to find that fast food meal and this was a perfect choice for this Cali fam to try
The BF got a grass fed burger with cheddar and it was really tasty the meat was very good and the burger was a good size
I had stopped there for lunch and they had a decent selection of prepared foods and pastries as well as coffee and espresso drinks
We decided to splurge and get the most romantic dish on the menu the 40 oz
Menu reads well all the French dishes you'd expect coq au vin steak frites steamed mussels
Giant sports bars with lots of seating lots of TV's rock and roll memorabilia around and HUGE PORTIONS OF FOOD
My favorites sandwiches are the humdinger dilly club and then the mexi southwest and chicken cesar wrapsYou can't go wrong with any of the sandwich choices on the menu
The menu looked like comfort food gone wild
Adding a generous portion of chicken and just enough bacon made this dish a real delight
When they're done having bad california rolls and a happy hour menu full of pieces that fall apart take them to Sakana in Scottsdale
I chose the red curry chicken from the lunch menu at a level 3 spiciness - that was a perfect amount of heat for me
Its very dark and relaxing but there is just enough light at the table to read the menu and eat your food
The menu is small but i have had various items on it from the steak sandwich The Ribs Chicken Fried Steak and the Burger and they are all worthy of the 5 star
Each of us ordered a full size bowlHoney Orange Shrimp for me Jamaican Jerk Kalua Pork for Jamie Honey Orange Kalua Pork and Teriyaki Chicken for Jamie's parents
The full size bowls were more than enough to last the average person through dinner and then through lunch the next day; packed full of rice/noodles meat and veggies with each bowl containing a ramekin of sweet teriyaki sauce
the other reason is no real selection of morning food
The menu was quite extensive so we ended up ordering a variety of dishes
Just right consistency Chicken portion was ample
-Great food large portions and fresh ingredients-Best bacon I have ever had-Friendly Staff and excellent service-Small venue-Long wait if you don't arrive early If you come solo wait is much shorterIf I ever get back to Phoenix I will be go straight to Matt's
Now there were 15 main food selections for everyone to reach in front of each other to get including Huevos Rancheros cheese enchiladas Chile Verde chorizo Santa Fe Chicken sausage bacon beans & rice of course & much more plus a good number of toppings available but no salad or soup
Besides the Pho and the lemongrass chicken I haven't been too impressed with the other menu items
We all ordered the braised beef sandwich lots of variety in our group
there is a full menu and the food is on the cheaper side
I like to have the bartender all to myself to get the lowdown on drink and food choices
The first thing that I noticed was that the food being offered for restaraunt week was not on the real menu
or my personal favorite VOVO REALLY IS SPECIAL AND I LOVE HIS FOOD IT'S FULL OF RAZZMATAZZ I love the space the old house the location the simple non overwhelming menu
Of all the Japanese/Sushi restaurants in Phoenix Yasu Sushi Bistro is at the top of my list
I wouldn't mind trying some of their other dishes too but I think it is just to expensive of a place for a breakfast/casual food menu
After a movie at the Cinemark our choices were limited for vegetarian options at the Mesa Riverview so we decided to try Red Brick Pizza
