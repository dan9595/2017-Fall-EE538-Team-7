This is as hidden as a restaurant can get
It is really a shame that there isn't a good neighborhood restaurant in this area where someone can get some home cooking

Take 207/13/11Was in the neighborhood Tempe and thought today would be the perfect day to try an east valley participating restaurant I probably would never even contemplate driving to from all the way in north Scottsdale
This is by far one of the best restaurants in phoenix and my favorite
Los Dos Molinos was located near my hotel so I drove there one night without knowing much about the restaurant
Of all the restaurants and cafes in Tempe Marketplace Tea Infusion is the only one I'd choose to make the trip FOR as opposed to simply stopping by because I happened to already be in the area
The restaurant cant have more than 10 tables along with a bar open kitchen and a somewhat odd seating space for the bar that is totally hidden from the restaurant
The new location the old one was a mile or so south in a real farmhouse is in downtown Gilbert in an adobe building between a furniture store and small grocery
Located along a stretch of road where there seems to be every chain restaurant known to man and just as many hotels
Imagine this a swanky new Scottsdale restaurant that has down to earth prices fantastic food and attentive top-notch service
======  This review is for Saba's Sunday Lunch Buffet  ======I stopped into this lovely fairly small restaurant in foofy Carefree today to give their once-a-week Sunday Lunch Buffet a try
There are a number of novelties in each of Joe's restaurants but my favorite part about this one is that it is nestled right next to farmland
The setting is fantastic located in a farm the restaurant enjoys a cozy atmosphere and keeps the farm's feeling true
I'm not shocked at all that this place moved to a far shittier location
It's located in an unassuming strip mall which doesn't add to the credibility of the restaurant but Sal's is an exception
They've got free wifi at the location and it's amazing how many people bring their laptops in - like Starbucks
The service is top-notch something lacking in many restaurants today
This new location is quite a drive for me but when we're on our way to or from Sedona we try to stop by
Tea Light Cafe is an amazing little Vietnamese restaurant located on the cusp of North Scottsdale and Phoenix
I feel like there are so many other restaurants in the neighborhood that I love that I doubt I'll be back
So to end my tale about my introduction to the Village Tavern this is a great neighborhood restaurant that I'd happily visit again
Oggi's is located right in the middle of the Arrowhead Ranch area so location surely isn't an issue
District is also privately owned so you won't fall victim to any Sheraton miscues in the restaurant here just thier own which I have to say there aren't many so far
This restaurant is by the far the most unique restaurant I have ever eaten at
The owner stops by all the tables and loves to talk about his restaurant
This restaurant is a bit far for us and there wasn't a huge tea selection which is my favorite part of the experience typically
So far my experiences at this location have been good
The only exception I know is the ones in the Seattle area have a Produce Bar for about $10-$12 which is the mother of all salad bars as far as regular non-buffet restaurants go
This location is a bit of a drive from my house but I will definitely stop in again when in the area
Since this was on the Phoenix top list of Mexican Restaurants I guess I expected something else
I love the location even thoe its a bit far from me
We will NEVER go back to this location if you are craving BWW stop in to the McQueen & Elliot location where all of the staff are super friendly accommodating and professional
I can honestly say that the food was top notch but the only way I will eat food from one of Chris Bianco's restaurants again is if somebody went and got it for me
As far as I'm concerned Flo's Chinese Restaurant can expand their mini dynasty into MY neighborhood
While I will give 3 stars for the freshness and quality of the  food there are too many other great restaurants in Phoenix to go have to endure the mediocre service at Christopher's
There are three separate restaurant/eating areas on the farm
In fact when standing out front once I was stopped by a couple who asked me if I knew where the restaurant was
They also have a local farm that grows ingredients just for the restaurant
They took her from the plane to the next gate to a restaurant to eat back to the gate and to the rental car area located off site
The restaurant is actually located in a hotel lobby which I wasn't expecting so we passed it twice
One of my favorite things about this location is that it is hidden from the world
This restaurant may not be located in the better part of town nor does it look like much from the outside but do not judge a book by its cover
It's the perfect blend of self-service meets top restaurant quality food
It's definitely a value call for all of us but the peace of mind and shear delight afforded me by this restaurant's having a separate GF menu and cooking facilities makes this a top choice for me
We have been back half a dozen times already and I was also inspired to try their other location when I was in the neighborhood recently
The hotel is practically hidden from the normal tourist locations around Scottsdale which was fine with me
I've been to the big Dobbins Road location and just yesterday I stopped by the newest location the Arizona Humane Society Petique at the Biltmore Fashion Park
They aim to please and for a neighborhood restaurant they get an 8
That is a very large space Christopher is paying rent on and that night the restaurant was almost empty
chill location so far not totally packed and always seem to be able to get a spot right away
The food is pretty tasty and the restaurant is a hip house located in a downtown neighborhood
Since it's located in a neighborhood it can be hard to figure out which homes are actually homes and which is the restaurant
This restaurant is small located in the barrio and has a menu full of latin fusion dishes
I got excited when I moved to the area a few months ago and noticed a location called wing stop thinking I had found my home
This is a good restaurant that deserves to succeed and because it is off the beaten track I consider that most people are not going to have it on the top of their minds
We're always on the lookout for a centrally located bar/restaurant to meeting with our various coworkers who are spread out from the Biltmore Midtown Downtown and Gateway and some times Mesa
We arrived at Super Burrito at about 2AM on a Friday night first mistake and immediately upon entering the restaurant and identifying myself as The Taco Inspector these three ass-clowns got in our face and would NOT stop talking crap--even after we got our food and sat down
Carrying on as far as the usefulness of this review for my Southern California counterparts it is compulsory that you understand that Chelsea's Kitchen is owned and operated by the same company that just opened La Grande Orange in Pasadena and both restaurants share similar menu items
And as far as my comprehensive knowledge of the restaurant's offerings all you Phoenixers out there can rest assured that I come bearing the fruits of my foodie brother's many dining experiences at this popular yet low-key eatery that is suitable for a relaxing brunch lunch or dinner with friends or family
I recommend the Farmhouse Restaurant and Liberty Market
Everyone seemed new to the restaurant and everyone seemed happy that they stopped by
I also think this is more of a small group restaurant 2-4 people tops
There's a theory food-location relativity if you will that people will almost always think that the food in their hometown is far superior to cuisine in any other location
Lucky Boy not to be confused with the famous Big Boy burger shop although you cannot miss the shop there is a gigantic Big Boy-esque sign in red on top of the restaurant
Location  I live in the Ahwatukee area so this is slightly closer than Golden Buddha and far closer than Great Wall
You walk through this very unassuming door in this very plain looking building located in this very boring strip mall and you find yourself suddenly faced with a beautiful modern restaurant complete with a huge wall of wine that demands your adoration
That location also has stock from previous seasons since it is so far out of the way of the typical Anthropologie shopper
This location not so much however there is a far better Mexican place up the road that serves way better options and ummm real Mexican food and I don't care if it's cheap here either
The friendly owners/cooks of the previous restaurant were top notch hence the good reviews
I have visited all of these locations and the best one by far is the location on Greenfield
After the disastrous ASU Memorial Union fire I saved up all my CD-buying until Hoodlums relocated from the MU to their current location on the southwest corner of Guadalupe and McClintock in Tempe
I stopped in this location because it is close to my house and got my cut done by Amanda who did a great job listening to what I wanted and it turned out great
The idea behind The Greene House is to offer dishes that are inspired by the farms markets and ranches of California - fresh ingredients that can be appreciated by the non chain restaurant dining crowd
I prefer the latter built out of an old farmhouse I understand it was the owner's childhood home there lots of mature trees green grass not to mention the small working farm behind the restaurant really helps to  transport you back to a time when this area wasn't a sea of cookie-cutter homes and Walgreen's on ever corner
The neighborhood this location is in is a tiny bit sketchy
Walked into a empty Restaurant at noon only to find a very modern decor and thought OK it is clean and I like the stainless steel table tops
As far as the restaurant itself it really is a cool place
The location is a little hidden in the corner and unless you were looking for it probably would just drive on by
Lux has a primo location next to Pane Bianco just off a train station and in a great neighborhood
Biltmore is a top notch resort and this restaurant lives up to the standards of Blitmore
It's a cute little to-go for sandwiches and salad across the Acardia farm cafe which is a sitting down restaurant
I have no problem with the neighborhood--the issue is that when I walk into ANY restaurant in ANY part of town I expect the place to be relatively clean
I have been to this Loehmann's location once since moving to AZ about a year or two ago and then my car stopped working
It is located in downtown phoenix and the restaurant is a beautiful old house with a great patio
I enjoy taking out of town guests to this little neighborhood gem and love that they serve food later than most of the North Central corridor restaurants
I would definitely recommend this restaurant the positives far out weighed the negatives
One of our friends sucked it up and become a Designated Driver so we didnt get stopped at the check point but cops def are in the area
I went to use a Veebow discount at a restaurant next door but saw that this was a lil more kid friendly so we stopped in
My wife and I have been coming to this neighborhood Italian restaurant since before we were married over 3 years ago
Parking is fantastic as the restaurant is located at the end of a strip mall
They have a nice little casual restaurant for lunch located in the pool area and they have servers who will bring you drinks and even lunch at your lounge chair if you wish
If you're looking for a cute and unique restaurant in Peoria I'd say you should stop into Prime Pizza
The Mission has both; it's in an ideal location to begin a night out on the town and the restaurant's low lighting and sexy decor will had me feeling just as spicy as the Latin-infused fare
We walked into the restaurant located in a little strip mall - like I said not fussy and were seated immediately by a window
the restaurant is huge with an over-the-top DISNEYLAND in LAS VEGAS look
The new location will be a little farther for us but that won't keep us from going
As for as The Gap goes this is the best location I've been to by far
I have been to a lot of mediterranean restaurants and this truly tops my experiences of them all
Think I'll add this place to my list of go-to restaurants for when I am craving Chinese fast food and don't want to shell out $$ for PF Chang-like fare
I tend to be turned off by the slick over-styled sushi restaurants of Scottsdale so I was immediately charmed by the homey neighborhood feel of Hana
The up-side to eating at this particular location is that you can browse the shopping area before you stop in or after you're done eating
Yupha's is located in the same plaza as Vincitorio's Restaurant on the Southeast corner of McClintock and Elliot
They used to be located on Rural and Elliot but have moved to this new location in the past year
That being said I will say that the Black Angus on McDowell Rd in Goodyear has never served me bad food and only 1 in the many times I have ate there did I get bad service and that really wasn't the waitresses fault but rather the family in the booth next to us was letting there 3 year old run around the restaurant with a stake knife even going so far as to run into the kitchen and climb into our booth and hit my husband at which point we asked to be moved
Other chains have a wider variety and big chains in other cities have a selection that's literally 10 times as big but it's still a good location and a good stop late in the evening
This is not your neighborhood Mexican restaurant after all
This is a family-run neighborhood restaurant in a strip mall storefront next to a hair salon and a small boxing gym
Service was great as was expected for a restaurant located in Ritz Carlton
I'm reviewing yet another fast food restaurant and it's not because I'm totally into grease but because I'm admittedly overly critical of attention to detail in these drive-thru places because hello you're driving through usually driving AWAY and you're too far from the restaurant to remedy the situation when you notice they foul up
I live quite far away so we happen to be near the restaurant we jumped at the opportunity
The guy said the salon is really struggling because of the location very few people walk by that side of the Quarters it's on the far north end kind of by Brio
I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone based off the location which is in a questionable neighborhood; the customer service because of the pushy person who lacked proper english skills; and the quality of the food which lacked in holding up to its advertising as well as its lack of quantity value per price and lack of the traditional asian flavors
BT has an interesting balance of hip and neighborhood restaurant
I had seen a good restaurant come and go in this location so in an effort to support the newcomer my girlfriend and I stopped in for lunch on a whim
The restrooms and restaurant were clean and pleasant - everything top notch
Modern adaptations of classic Mexican fare make this place stand out from other Mexican restaurants
I agree with others when the selections are as big as other locations but their level of customer service by far stand out
HighlightsLocation- Located on Mill St with an outdoor patio that lends to a lot of great people watching or just hanging out

Not a bad spot to have a meal as far as chain restaurants go

The Fox Sports Grill at Sky Harbor is a true embarrassment not that one should expect a great deal from airport restaurants but if Kraft Mac-N-Cheese this is probably a poor example as KMNC provides a perfect vehicle for some truly delicious creations is far superior to what you're serving then you should just end it all
It was a cute touch I love when restaurants play up the neighborhood's culture
Many may think eating at a restaurant that sets up in a parking lot after the car shop closes might be dicey as far as the health code goes but as we all know the city health inspectors are crooks and hired usually through nepotism and political graft how else would Denny's remain open
We also stopped by the little restaurant and ordered some carnitas beans rice and corn tortillas grabbed some salsa and made us some carnita tacos at home
But so many people go over-the-top when rating this restaurant
On top of that the restaurant isn't very big either - small as well

The restaurant is located right up in Verrado which is a beautiful neighborhood in the little town square

I've never been to the South Phoenix location but if I'm going to drive that far I would go to Rudy's instead

Although it's a chain restaurant you really get a neighborhood feel
The food is typical Asian fare but with a deluxe restaurant twist--after all the place is owned by P
Not a Starbucks location that I will go out of my way to stop at nor one I would impulsively stop at either
It is clean the staff are friendly and the location is very convenient right off the light rail stop 3rd Street/Washington or 3rd Street/Jefferson depending on the direction you're coming from
That way it wouldn't have to stop for lights and it would keep the bad drivers from trying to make an illegal u-turn and getting hit by a train
The bar is short and in the front of the restaurant but it feels like the neighborhood bar where you know the names of everyone sitting there before you finish your first drink

Now with Christopher's Restaurant/Crush Lounge he has passed on the wine bar and opened a lounge instead
But don't take my word for it ask the chef at your favorite restaurant who their favorite chefs are in town and favorite restaurants most likely Christopher will make the list

there was a blueberry-filled donut a chocolate and blueberry shooter topped off with a balsamic cream some kind of blueberry cake but the real highlight that had everyone in the restaurant looking our way was when our server added the freezing soup around the edge of the plate a combo of blueberry consomme and liquid nitrogen
the combination of mindblowing food coupled with incredibly accomodating and informative service has to put binkley's at the top of the list of restaurants i've visited

This location also has a fair amount of seating and plugs for laptops

Although I''m reluctant to go to a theme restaurant inspired by an SNL sketch I found cheeburger cheeburger to be better than a theme restaurant with mediocre food I was here once before when Tempe marketplace first opened and was overwhelmed by the topping choices Think last time I had a burger with feta mushrooms and olives trying to imagine a Mediterranean    burger really what ended up happening was flavor overload that I couldn't really taste the burger so I decided to give them another try this time around I got 1/2 lbs burger sorry a pound is just too much food with cheddar jack bacon and sauteed mushrooms we ordered a half order of the best of both worlds which is a basket of fries and onion rings with a side of cheese  the fries are good very crispy well seasoned and appear to be fresh cut  or at least a very convincing fake the onions rings are very crispy with a light batter that almost takes on a yellow tone my burger was well prepared they use sliced whole mushrooms instead of pre sliced the bacon was crispy and the cheese was nice and gooey so all in all it was a pretty decent burger I must say my burger was a bit greasy I cut my burger in half to eat it and by the time I moved on to the second half  my lower bun had become one and fused with my burger pattyOverall my experience was good and I would go back but I don't see it being a frequent choice and not just due to distance the main attraction seems to be the wide variety of burger toppings and the build-your-own inspired menu despite the food being consistent and good it's nothing I haven't tasted before though if I ever get the urge for a pepperoni peanut butter coleslaw Sri racha burger I can sleep easier at night knowing I've now got that issue handled

However fresh creative toppings and not TOO overly priced especially for this McDonald and Scottsdale Rd location

Everyone who works at the Tatum & Bell location is friendly enthusiastic and on top of their game
My guess is this location is so good because of the management but whatever the reason the Tatum & Bell location is so far superior the difference is tangible
It is located in an unsuspecting place and in my opinion the location is something that makes it even more appealing -- the food is good enough that if the location was slightly more hip you wouldn't be able to get a seat there
The best part by far though was the owner there were only two people running the restaurant during our lunchtime visit

maybe a little over the top for its location

Maybe I'll stop by there again when I come visit my parents but if you're not in the area which you probably won't be unless you're visiting someone that lives in verrado or playing golf at raven there's really no reason for you to come to this restaurant
there aren't many good restaurants in the neighborhood to begin with so maybe it's worth a try

The owner even came out at some point to wish us a happy holiday& introduce himselfAbsolutely everything was taken care of for us as expected in a good restaurant ushered in chairs pulled out napkins placed water & wine topped off without even noticing
The location of this place isn't in the best neighborhood however the food is GREAT
The music was loud maybe too loud for some but overall I am grateful that I can have a great pizza and sandwich at a reasonable price since my former favorite neighborhood restaurant took a slight dive in taste and subsequent ratings
However this location gets the unfortunate privilege  of being my neighborhood locations less than a mile from my house and although this location has been prompt and delicious this is more a review about the man himself Mr
Was looking for a fast meal the other day and stopped by this location for lunch
What we didn't get however was a visit from the owner who seemed to stop by every other table in the restaurant

Its a restaurant that's still very much in its infancy and still has some kinks to work out but so far this new downtown spot is off to a pretty good start
As far as the restaurant itself I think it has potential
This is on my top 5 restaurants on the face of this earth list
A previous review mentioned Sticklers restaurant located across the street from Crazy Jim's

and let me tell you it is a FULL FIVE STARS for service quality of food fare location environment inside and out

this is by far my favorite pizza restaurant
Overall A top restaurant that I will definitely return to if only to have the steak tartare
Food quality is the same as the other locations and bears little resemblance to authentic Chicago pizza and Italian fare
Honestly I love that downtown has neighborhoods with character unique shops and trendy hold up on their own restaurants to boot

There is an old refurbished farm tractor in the middle of the restaurant
With a name like The Lodge I thought I was going to an old dirty restaurant with some of the neighborhood locals

This neighborhood desperately needed a locally owned non-chain restaurant to liven up the area

The only nice thing about this restaurant is that it is located in the W
To be fair I have never ordered off this restaurant's menu so perhaps their cooked to order fare is more impressive but the lunch buffet was just not doing it for me
Albeit it is JUST off the freeway - but so are a LOT of them around the country meaning there are times when the place is insanely full and the wait is far more than I am willing to wait for just about ANY restaurant - and I have eaten at a LOT of them around the country

It isn't exactly a cheap restaurant yet it has fared the storms of economic chaos that in itself speaks volumes to me
As far as the actual restaurant itself it is very help-yourself no-frills set-up
This restaurant is hidden off of random side streets but the catch is that you can see it from the 17

This restaurant is located in a storefront in the far southeast corner of a shopping center
Plus this location had a carryout special for a large one topping for $4
This restaurant is located next door to Bosa Donuts
They close earlier than some other restaurants so be sure to check the hours before you stop by
I'm pretty sure the menu has changed very little in all the time I've gone to Pita Jungle except for about 10 years ago when they opened the Chandler restaurant and got a beer/wine license -- had to add some more dinner appropriate fare but this is okay with me
I couldn't stop moving in my seat because the music was pretty catch-y The place looks like a dance hall more that a restaurant but still nice
The hotel is set up where the lobby restaurant and bars are in one building and the rooms are located across the driveway
Overall this is a really fun hotel to stay at if you want to party and is centrally located to all the restaurants and nightlife
For my 100th review I selected the restaurant that had been on my bookmark list the longest The Farmhouse and decided to give it a try and write a review
The rental car pick-up/drop-off location for all the care companies is FARRRRR from the airport
On top of the great food and service I love the ambiance and location of FEZ
We live about 20 min from Asadero Torro which for most people in Phoenix is way too far to drive for a hole in the wall restaurant but it's totally worth it
Gallo Blanco is probably my favorite restaurant thus far
All were very enjoyable - they were tasty had good texture and were more interesting than the standard sushi restaurant fare
This Target is in a convenient location not too far from the hotel where I was staying/working
Thank you to restaurant GM Anibal who stopped by to see us not once but twice
The restaurant is located in an old vintage house - so those complaining about the atmosphere or grounds are way off the mark as the antique and rustic feeling is part of the vibe
Parking a little problem in a weird location but it doesn't stop us from getting in there
The restaurant is located way up on a hill and walking inside is a chore for her
We sat on the patio which is behind the restaurant and nicely hidden from the street
Located near Scottsdale Road and Shea Sandbar has a pretty convenient location and is usually a fun spot to go out dancing and drinking
Real Japanese Restaurant here Yasu Sushi Bistro is at the top of the lists
Luckily they are far removed from the rest of the restaurant
Stopped by this 24 Hour Fitness location the other day to take a look around and get in a lil fitness
Went here because I love Joe's Real Farm Grill and wanted to see if his 3rd restaurant in Gilbert would hold up
As usual this restaurant offers flawless casual fare just like the other locations
Anyway I don't know if I would come back here especially given that I live so far away from the restaurant; However if you live around the corner it's a decent place to try
There are three restaurants Talavera fine-dining steakhouse Crescent Moon high-end Mexican and Saguaro Blossom poolside and lighter fare
This is in the top 2 of my favorite restaurants in North Phx

This is a delicious neighborhood restaurant
Not too over the top despite the uh giant lit up Eiffel Tower in the middle of the restaurant
This secondary location of Four Peaks is located in the extreme northern section of Scottsdale in a strip mall directly behind a Chuck-E-Cheese want-to-be
It's a quintessential neighborhood restaurant
Its location was hidden in a not so good sorta way
The design decor + ambiance will feel somewhat familiar as will the quality of drinks at the bar aside from much smaller martinis - but the food at Hanny's is a strange departure from the top-notch bar food found at it's sister restaurant in Scottsdale
The Ahnala Mesquite Room is a small but very nice restaurant located at the Radisson Fort McDowell Resort
This was our second stop for restaurant week
It is located next to My Mothers Restaurant on the Northwest corner of 19th ave and Indian School
I love Lee Lee but so many bad Asian drivers in one centrally located spot -- truly my peeps at their finest
So next conference I will stick with the hotel restaurants which have been good thus far and fair prices
The restaurant is located in a restored historical building called the Teeter House
It's a very small restaurant - the kind of place you'd drive by a hundred times without noticing in a sort of marginal neighborhood   Once inside you almost feel like you're dining in someone's home dining room
The doors are opening all the time so flies get in there probably from Joe's farm restaurant next door
And for those of you who might complain that the lightrail has made it unsafe for drivers especially those drivers making left turns might I mention that if the drivers just obeyed the traffic laws you mean red means stop
Of all the restaurants I've been to that have offered such delectable treats this place offers the best ones by far
Taberna Mexicana is definitely my top Mexican restaurant - but will wait to get Groupons or other deals to dine there again
The restaurant and meeting space is located at the top of the Chase building on Monroe and Central

Since Yasu Sushi Bistro stop servicing Long Island Ice Tea I started to look for another Japanese restaurant as my regular place to eat
This location is conveniently located near the freeway
I'm not a fancy restaurant type of person I don't require top-notch service
wasn't pleasant to have our food uncaringly slapped down in front of us but that experience was an anomalyThe service at the GILBERT location is top-notch and whoever is running the show there needs to be given a bonus
Except for the hostess - whose job apparently involved stomping through the restaurant periodically and angrily glaring at us like we were keeping her from something far more important
The restaurant is very small and located on an unassuming street corner just south of downtown
Anyways nothing about the menu would lead me to believe it's an Italian restaurant but I primarily dine here for lunch and maybe they switch to heartier fare for dinner service
Waiters/Waitresses are nice they're always on top on refilling your glass asking if you need anything the stuff you see in basically every other sit-down restaurant
The restaurant is located on the bottom floor of an office building and unless you were looking for it you would probably drive right past it
This restaurant has been here for quite some time hidden along a side street with office buildings surrounding this restaurant
They have some lunch specials that aren't available at the 7th street location and even some deviations from traditional mexican fare like ham and cheese sandwiches or burgers
Their location is nice it is at the south end of Morrison Ranch with a view of the man-made lake we will often take our dog for walk around the lake and then stop and sit outside
FOOD Top notch for an airport restaurant could do very well as a stand alone  in the city
My wife and I stopped in and were really surprised on how authentic the inside of the restaurant looked
So far this is the only restaurant style movie theater that I'm aware of in the state of Arizona
These days they have 2 locations and the new one is just as far away as the original
After my shopping was finished I stopped at Al Hana the little restaurant inside and had the beef schwarma as recommended in several reviews
They are a great quick item to grab for lunch and they tend to be pretty generous with the toppings at this location
This review is for the Farm Kitchen one of the thee restaurants/cafes at the Farm
The service at this restaurant was borderline terrible from needing to ask for everything including more chips and water refills to waiting too long for food which then came out on an extremely hot plate as if it had been sitting under a window for far too long

With Christopher's new location at Biltmore Fashion Park and favorable experiences at the old restaurant our expectations were high
+Good restaurants nearby - I felt like the stairs/elevators are not located where I wanted to be - ie the end of each side of the mall so it makes me loop around instead of going down- I feel like they don't have much bathrooms but nicer malls usually are limited in their bathrooms location- I am not sure how parking works but I found a small lot and found a space but I imagine parking can be expensive and difficult if you go during peak hours
It is the only place that can make better breakfast than me I make some mean fluffy scrambled eggs and french toast and the occasional breakfast burrito when I feel like going all outSeriously the best breakfast restaurant I've ever been to it tops a place in Austin I thought could never be toppedPortions are large and everything is fresh

I very rarely come here anymore because every location is far-flung since Claim Jumper is adored by suburban soccer parents from here to Chicago but my buddy out in South Tempe got me to make the trek last week for his birthday

Stop by Hana Japanese Eatery in Central Phoenix for simple quality ingredients prepared lovingly and skillfully by a knowledgeable staff and remember something else important while they will tempt your palate with a plethora of flavors and gladly fill your belly the restaurant is strictly BYOB so if you like beer sake or wine with your meal you'd better bring your own
The restaurant itself is nice but it just doesn't seem to fit the food it seems very western and I would expect to see a menu for rustic American food as opposed to the Italian fare they serve
This location is about 20 mins out of Scottsdale and we stayed in this located with a wedding block off
As somewhat of a Valley foodie I've been lucky enough to try some of the best restaurants in the city but have surprisingly never gotten around to trying one of the Valley's classic fine dining destinations Christopher's

Overall I have good experiences so far with this restaurant

So far I haven't found another BBQ restaurant in the Valley that's better
About par for the course for a restaurant located in a suburban strip mall
I think chef Silvana Esparza first located the restaurant here on CALLE DIECISEIS she renamed the street all by herself apparently to take advantage of cheap rent
As far as the restaurant istelf well it is run by these grumpy stubborn non-customer-service oriented folks apparently so I'm never setting foot in the place nor ever eating their overpriced underwhelming food ever again

Hillside is a top quality fast casual restaurant serving locally sourced and environmentally friendly products
Well you yelpers who read this far the art is gone but there is an old NYC cab hanging from the ceiling plus the names of hundreds of NYC cab drivers on the wall behind the bar
There still seems to be an issue with staff at this location they go through new employees like nobody's business but their yogurt and toppings really outweigh the negatives

I completely agree on the decor Autumn Court relocated from their original location and the place they moved into looks a bit Bill Johnson'sThe reason I return is the food
I was in Salt City for some tubing fun and decided to stop  by a Vietnamese restaurant for some pho for dinner

Also there are plenty of locations for plugging in a laptop or cell phone
The location is tough to find though hidden in the back behind a Walgreens and Brake shop
Moving finally to the last of my supplementary snacks I'll start off by saying I'd read about The Fry Bread House a couple of times when planning my trip to The Valley but it did not make my list of must visit stops until just the day prior during dinner at Kai when I was speaking with head Chef Michael O'Dowd about the lack of Native American restaurants in the area he explained this to me but that is for another time and one of his expeditors suggested I should check out Cecilia Miller's temple of fried dough calling it about as authentic as it gets around here
Beyond the deep deep personal connection I have with the restaurant I can tell you that the food is unquestionably great and the service is always top-notch
The restaurant in convieniently located next to the I-17 and Bethany Home Rd and is pretty cool little place on the inside
The restaurant is located in downtown Phoenix to what looks to be a residential neighborhood
While I don't know the Phoenix area well the restaurant seemed to be located in the industrial boonies - the street looked a bit sketchy and there was this ghettoish sign painted on a building pointing you to the way of Lo-Lo's
The funny thing is it is so far from any typical restaurant you've ever experienced
To top it all off this was the worst service I've had at a restaurant in years
There is also a Wells Fargo inside this location
The unfortunate thing about this location is it is a stand alone store so there isn't any other business's other than the Wells Fargo in the shopping center
This restaurant has now risen to my TOP 3 ever
Now there is another very similar charcoal grill restaurant in Tempe that offers hot dogs and hamburgers -ach*chuckbox*oo- but their fare is more hamburger friendly

Although it's in a pretty convenient location it isn't in a walkable neighborhood as you will still need to drive to get to the nearest grocery store pharmacy restaurant or entertainment facilities
Went here for dinner with the hubby on a Friday night - it was really empty which is a bummer because the hotel this is located in as well as this restaurant space have changed owners/names/styles/etc
It's a long way out there and even if I'm in the neighborhood there are more shops restaurants coffee shops wine bars and the rest 2 miles in either direction at Desert Ridge or Keirland so there isn't much reason to take the 56th St
Another nice to know is that most of the cafu00e9s restaurants and coffee shops have their own mini version not as artsy and far from crowded of First Friday activity
With traditional timeshare you buy a week at the same location the same week every year from Friday to Friday when airfare is at it's highest the same sized unit and you have to pay to exchange it to go elsewhere

That would seem to follow the logic of visiting Europe and seeing a McDonald's filled with Americans and drawing the conclusion that McDonald's is a top-notch American restaurant
The point here is that not everyone is discerning regardless of whether they are eating their native fare and I find it difficult to believe that this would be considered a quality sushi restaurant among discerning Japanese diners given how much better quality sushi is available in the Valley
The first time my family and I stopped at this location the restaurant was a complete disaster
I've been a fairly consistent customer over the years and one thing that continues to blow my mind is the apathetic could-not-give-less-of-a-shit attitude that you are greeted with every time you decide to stop in for a sandwich and a beer - and that's putting aside the ridiculous wait time you encounter no matter how not-busy the restaurant is
I wish I could say something wonderful about this new concept restaurant other than the fact that it was cute clean and the staff two people were very friendly but the good comments stop there
The location is a bit far from Scottsdale Stadium - only 6 miles but 6 long and traffic lit miles on Scottsdale Drive
I was so excited when someone told me Damon was opening another location right in my neighborhood
The service was over the top last eve at Houston's; Smiles easy changes of seat locations and a new frosted martini glass to refresh my slightly warmed martini

I am from New Mexico and the original Si Senor is located in Las Cruces NM and so when I moved here and found out that the same owners also have a Si Senor in Chandler I was pumped by the way other restaurants claim they are New Mexican style food they are not they are wannabes
As for location it's not terribly far from shopping and dining but we had our car and like sightseeing and visiting new places so we didn't mind
For those familiar with the east valley this may help get my point across This restaurant belongs in Scottsdale as the quality and service are far above anything else you'll find in Tempe
Well China Chan restaurant will not make my top ten list  it is still an A OK place and yes i would return
I stopped going to this location a few years ago after waiting 45 minutes in an empty dining room for a pizza
I particularly love this location because it's the only place I can find to eat in this retardedly far part of suburbia
I'm no food snob and definitely respect the neighborhood hole-in-the-wall restaurants but I will definitely be staying away from this place from now on
Stopped in for lunch today to this the smallest Mexican restaurant in the world except for Taco Bite
He even went so far as to walk into the restaurant to yell to his co-workers about my apparently salacious comments
We stopped by this Ah-So location because we were nearby
The location is a little hard to find because they are hidden away but it is so worth looking for
Still with two and a half hours before dinner at this point my server again stopped by and after perusing the dessert menu I decided to end the meal with another duet one a must order anywhere I see it and the other a must order at any Mexican restaurant but at $6 a piece I should have probably just ordered a margarita entru00e9e or another half-gallon of menudo instead
I don't normally go to Dollar Trees because the selection is so bad but when I'm taking the 87 to Shea into Scottsdale I make sure I stop by this location in Fountain Hills for the small necessities like greeting cards wrapping paper and even makeup

Filberto's on McClintock  & Guadalupe is probably at the very top of every mexican restaurant I've been to
Rosita's is conveniently located between work and ASU and sometimes that makes a huge difference when choosing a restaurant
This location so far exceeds its pint-sized half-brother up north its hard to beleive they came from the same mother
The location is spotless the toppings fresh and the staff friendly
The chips are obviously made in the restaurant because they are too greasy to have travelled far
I've had my favorite beer-buying locations throughout the Valley but Total Wine has become my favorite all-around stop
The waiter was on top of things but it took quite a while for our food to come even though there were only about 4 other parties there when we sat down and the restaurant is quite large
The vegetarian options at this restaurant were fairly standard for Asian fare
I've been here twice once for restaurant week and once for a rooftop happy hour
It's in a pretty convenient location so it's not too far for people to meet up when coming from different parts of the Valley
My gang thought it had closed one night and were super sad when we went to the location in Tempe not realizing until we read the sign on the door that it had relocated--but it's good enough to remain our only sushi haunt despite its location being less convenient now
Don't let racism dictate your business hours because it certainly doesn't dictate where I spend my money and so far you haven't received much of it since you aren't open in the evenings like the rest of your entire chain of restaurants
I am looking forward to visiting the actual restaurant soon; it's definitely at the top of my list
I have always been amazed that for years all the Barro's locations seem to rake in far more dough then they deserve considering the food is so darn mediocre
The Mexican furniture lined the sidewalk as I approached the restaurant and I'm not sure if it's attached to Pepe's or just conveniently located next door but it definitely adds to the authenticity of the restaurant
It was generally less than 15 minutes to get to my class downtown and the hotel is located to lots of restaurants and shopping areas
But the remoteness of the location also means you get to breeze in and out on rare occasions too seeing as this is too far out of the way for any non-Foothills residents
The restaurant is not really close to me so I won't be a frequent customer but if I hind myself around that part of town and a hankerin' for a big ass burger I would stop again
Did a search for top sushi restaurants in Scottsdale and this one popped up
From hair parlor to pizza parlor -- I found The Parlor to be a unique high-quality restaurant and a welcome addition to my Phoenix neighborhood

I used to head to the Tempe location whenever I wanted a serious cappuccino but now I can get that at the Scottsdale location without wading through a sea of argyle-sweatered wayfarer-ladened vegan hipsters
The atmosphere is surprisingly pleasant inside given the seedy nature of the exterior and neighborhood I always wonder why they picked that location; I get nervous leaving my car in back
I knew of it I remember eating it at the Matsuri Festival years ago but for some reason I just did not bother to stop into the restaurant

It's part of a chain of restaurants but this is the only one in Arizona so far
At first I thought the location was a bit out of the way but I now view it as a destination rather than a good meal while in the neighborhood
Located in a dilapidated plaza near the Metro Mall this restaurant should not be amazing
We love this place and hope people go there so it stays in business unlike most of the restaurants and stores located in and around Metro Center
I live really close to Cafe Wasabi and I had heard good things about the restaurant from friends so I was hoping CW could be my go-to neighborhood sushi place

Since this location is a little more hidden you can enjoy a quiet night with family or friends while you enjoy your meal
Where I come from  restaurants located in strip malls are not to be trusted
While your visiting the Phoenix Arizona area you may want to stop by the Biltmore Mall and checkout all the shops and restaurants in the center
There is a neighborhood directly behind the restaurant and the home owners put out pylons and road barricades to keep customers from parking in front of there driveways
Especially since its one of the few restaurants that is actually located in Northeast Phoenix opposed to Chandler or the Westside

We plan on stopping by to try their empanadas as those are probably what the restaurant will come to be known for
Sensational Coffee is located at the old Bad Ass Coffee location
This location on the street as oppsed to hidden away is important to create an authentic urban environment

So I saw this little bungalow-like restaurant which is located a block away from Chase Field and also not far from my hotel that serve authentic Southern and Soul food
Even though they're trying to do the upscale neighborhood sports bar/restaurant thing they are way overpriced even for Arcadia I agree with Erica's review and the ambiance is lacking that certain inviting
And by far which is probably the best part of the restaurant
The restaurant is kinda hidden in a business building area but just look for the signs near the road it's not terribly hard to find
The Via Paseo location is too far south for me to travel long term
I have been coming to the Vig for years and it remains a staple in my repertoire of centrally located reasonably-priced restaurants
I had the Land as my first course which constitutes 3 of the restaurants most popular items steak chicken etc and all were prepared absolutely to spec well except maybe my steak was a tad cold but meh everything was going awesome so far so why screw it up by complaining

Happy to see that a vegan restaurant has finally come to my neighborhood

As far as price goes - it is somewhat more expensive than other Mexican restaurants but it's not like I'm eating here every week so not a big deal for me
There is no reason to rush out and get to this NNY location if there is one by you but if you are in Sprawltukee its a more-than-suitable place to stop by for a serious game watch
Great location in Scottsdale good price from Priceline $70 but far from a resort
Now don't get me wrong here Four Peaks is a top notch brewing company but doesn't every hipster bar and restaurant boast their very own Four Peaks brew
I was sitting in the table at the far corner near the front of the restaurant and I kept seeing speckles of dust in the air
The service was friendly but could have been slightly more on top of our table as the restaurant didn't seem very busy the evening we were there
Tucked away by the south mountain and hidden from a casual observer the resort itself and its restaurant Latitude 30 are not something you accidentally run across but totally worth seeking out

I've only had a salad once never the tuna so I can't really say much about those except that I'm sure the ingredients and flavor combinations are top-notch - wouldn't be in a Bianco restaurant otherwise
If you want good short order style fish and chips go out to a real restaurant like the Fish Market/Blue Water try the Hidden House on Fridays
Its a darn shame because their food is top notch its kind of a hole-in-a-wall type restaurant
There was a nice patron who bought him a beer & maybe some food - didn't stick around long enough to see that- but that patrons brother got up to stop him because he said the restaurant didn't want him there

I enjoy going to Joe's Farm Grill not just because of the food utterly amazing onion rings but also because of the surrounding location
Some of the items I've tried were far better and more delicious than what I can get at the four closest Chinese sit down Restaurants to where I live

Some other really cool things to note about Joe's Farm Grill are that much of the produce is grown in Agritopia right next to the restaurant

Pro's- Beautiful spacious rooms and beautiful hotel lobby- Great central location- Great for business travel- Friendly and professional staff- Right by the train line if you need public transportation downtownCon's- They charge for parking - They charge for internet use- The hotel property is very nice but the surrounding blocks can be sketchy- The indoor pool is far from remarkable- The hotel lobby takes on the smells of whatever is cooking in the kitchen which can be good or bad depending in what's cooking
Dessert was also top notched and to make the experience even sweeter Mark Tarbell came by to congratulate us and thanked us for choosing his restaurant to host our special event
Patrick's Day since it's an American fare restaurant and bar they were not charging a cover charge to get in

The location is a bit odd to me but the food is good and whenever I'm in the neighborhood I'm happy to duck in
I ordered their club sandwich and fries because I have little faith in 'trendy' restaurants that serve American fare -- and I figured it would be hard to screw up a club sandwich

As far as the location and decor it is a OK
Out of all the restaurants we went to on my trip to Arizona this makes the top two
It's better then the local BIG Mexican food restaurants like Macayo's and Garcias even better then Top Shelf which was our only area choice since Ninfa's went under
You walk in and it is very clean modern and looking good but the chow line looks like a cafeteria then you shop a bit and find it is an extremely high quality top shelf incredible chef locally grown fantastic restaurant
This is the most convenient location for us to stop at but it seems like half the time we try and stop they aren't open
We went up for a friends birthday in April and were craving Paradise Bakery; we stopped but were not able to get out due to a massive swarm of bees outside the restaurant  I realize this is not their fault just a disappointment

Decided to stop by Streets of New York since I've never eaten at any of their locations in town
Notes Some reviews say this is close to the light rail and other restaurants but I'd say it's set pretty far back from Central Ave almost a mile where most of those nicer places and the LR station is
While Distrito may not be top of mind when it comes to choosing a restaurant in Old Town I hope it does well

we got to the restaurant at 840pm and were told that we'd have to come back in 3 hours at 1140pm keep in mind the place closes at 10 i guess they just stop taking names at 10
They had a big sign stating they just celebrated 34 years on 4/1/11  It is a cash only restaurant so make sure you stop at the ATM first
I think Ill stick to the Hilton Village location where I can have a smaller size and feel good about the fewer flavors and toppings
The Coffee Garden is probably one of the most hidden spots of Talking Stick Resort but definitely a location worth keeping on the radar for that time when you need to escape the craziness of the casino
But I found myself stopping in at this location the other day and was please that they started offering steamed veggies instead of rice even though they are probably drowning in butter I was glad that they had some other option
After visits on three different occasions I can honestly say that for independent restaurants destinations here in the Valley Tuck Shop is at the top of my list
With a light rail stop directly in front of the building this branch combines a clean and welcoming interior with an accessible location and -- as I've mentioned -- top-notch customer service
Finally a neighborhood restaurant that is just a great place to get a simple meal that is good and gives good value
Stopped at this restaurant - the food is terrific
The patio is big and if you sit farther back you'll be on the other side of a pond setting between this restaurant and Jade Palace
As far as decor the restaurant does a good job of sticking to an anti-doctor theme with signs plastered all over the restaurant warning you of the unhealthy nature of their food mandatory patient gowns for all diners and waitresses dressed as cute nurses
To top it all off the prices are a tad steep for a Mexican restaurant
The restaurant is hidden back from the road along with a few others and what appeared to be a deserted theater the night we were there

Since we moved to Scottsdale four years ago we had been looking for a neighborhood Thai restaurant that we could go back to again and again and we found it with Thai House
I think the location on the top floor is a lot cooler than the actual decor--nothing feels more urban than to know that you are enjoying drinks in the loft of a building that has other uses and to see the street lights through the industrial-looking windows
the restaurant is located in a mall the ambiance-- how does one explain it-- cozy semi elegant lo lit with a long bar on one side
Sure the ambiance is nice the servers are awesome and the location is great as it is located on the brink of north Scottsdale but the highlight of my most recent visit was sinking my chompers into a juicy fall-off-the-bone rack of baby back ribs with fresh mashed potatoes and french fries to compliment I'm all about potatoes but different sides may be chosen
I was waffling between 4 and 5 stars but the amazing location great service and the pork chop put it over the top - we can always choose different appetizers next time
And the Caribbean restaurants are few and far between out here
This place is perfect for tourists although we did meet a couple of friendly locals keen to hear about our road trip so far and at least you know you're getting the real-deal in an original diner rather than a tacky imitation or chain restaurant
This place is straight out of the top drawer but I have to ask what's taking them so long to open the second location on Dobson or thereabouts
It's not the cheapest in town and there are some full service restaurants around that may do the chicken better I would still choose LoLo's or Tuck Shop for chicken and waffle over LFC's chicken and waffle - but as far as fast food fried chicken goes - LFC is worlds better than KFC Popeye's or Church's
Location  This place is conveniently located right on the southeast corner of the main ASU campus
I ate at the old location a handful of times in the past but had no idea they had opened a new one hidden in the corner of the 40 Palms plaza

I have been to this location before and so far so good
I'm not generally a fan of restaurants located within a mall especially if it's a chain restaurant

Besides the LaJolla CA UTC location this is by far one of the better PF Changs
It is kind of hidden in plane sight and is easy to pass and whatever you do don't listen when a smart assed back-seat driver says it's right up here past the junk yard
Disclaimer Love the Chandler location on Ray and Kyrene they actually present fresh foods and are a much cleaner better run location that deserve 3 Stars at the very least but my neighborhood F&E seriously sucks these days
I would say I am glad to have this location in my neighborhood and will be returning soon
I'm sure many people do pee in the river because there is no place to stop along the way

This place is far from being the restaurant I want to come back to
We have martinis at many restaurants and this one was by far the best one we have ever had

I think Id like to try another location the one on 35th ave isnt to far from my work
Great prices great Tempe location located bus routes and Orbit and an easy plaza to get into and park in great selection and all around awesome store
and I don't go out to farms and gardens much but the whole idea of having a restaurant with a garden and farm makes pretty good sense
Beer wine and liquor prices are beyond reasonable  Basically this is the neighborhood restaurant you have been waiting for the place where everything is affordable and delicious and the menu is diverse and balanced enough to keep you coming back a couple times a week
By far this is my favorite Mojo location
The Panang which should be ordered anytime upon entering a Thai restaurant was the best I've never had and the Beef Pra-Ram hidden on the back on the menu was like nothing I've ever had
One draw back is that it is smaller than expected so if you come from a place like SoCal where Japanese markets were like large grocery stores with mini stores and restaurants located inside you might not be too happy
The restaurant is a needle in the haystack as far as location goes
The restaurant is located on University
I don't know if I'm the only one that feels this way but I'm just so sick of spending money on the same mundane restaurants that can be found on nearly every corner; ones that run more like corporations than friendly neighborhood cafes
Setting lovely South Mountain farm with pecan trees which includes Maya's Farm produce are sold at the Downtown Public Market on Saturdays and a brunch and lunch restaurant all 3 are in separate areas/buildings
There are far too many other restaurants with fantastic delicious food and tasty drinks PLUS FRIENDLY accommodating staff
Almost italian-esk but its located in the center of the restaurant which is odd
They have a great atmosphere and the employees at this restaurant are top notch friendly and respectful
I don't think I have too many go-to restaurants when I want to dine out on but when it comes to taking friends from out of town to dinner or just a quality meal FEZ is always top of mind
It was in a nice central location in Scottsdale not far from restaurants and shopping at the new Scottsdale Quarter on Scottsdale Road
Pavle and FnB delivered and I would have to put this on the top of my list for dining locations in Scottsdale
This restaurant relocated relatively recently and I'm unclear if they lost the magic or are experimenting trying to obtain some but for now I'd approach it with somewhere between cautious optimism and proactively limited expectations
Overall a thumbs up for a non-stuff neighborhood bar and restaurant
and it's Christopher's Restaurant's pizza
Kind of a random location but def worth stopping in
It is truly a hidden gem good food humble restaurant and great food
It's just a neighborhood diner/restaurant where you will see your regulars the wait staff hanging on their days off and oh yea just plain good unpretentious food just like the decor and patron
We always enjoy top-notch service food and spirits in this restaurant
Sushi Ken is a great neighborhood restaurant
Of all the Japanese/Sushi restaurants in Phoenix Yasu Sushi Bistro is at the top of my list
In many restaurants the 4-top he pointed out would have been a 2-top so our casual planning session was cramped and uncomfortable
