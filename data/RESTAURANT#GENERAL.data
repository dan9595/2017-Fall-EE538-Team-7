I have a lot of friends from New Mexico and they all love this restaurant
The place reminds me of a club turned restaurant
I have visited it a couple of times and last time was for restaurant week
I've always loved steamed and lightly grilled dumplings yet 99% of the time restaurants use super thick gummy wrappings and also charge $7-8 bucks -- Cherryblossom uses the thinnest wrappers I've ever seen and charge about half the going rate; they're absolutely first class like everything they serve
This place has been our favorite local Greek food restaurant for a few years now
---Atmosphere----As far as the restaurant itself is concerned they did a really good job converting a rather eclectic Mexican place into a nicely furnished and modern feeling Italian joint
True Food Kitchen claims to not be a health-food restaurant rather a place for great food that just so happens to be healthy
We both agreed that we would never wait 3 hours again for this place or any other restaurant for that master
The series of 1 star reviews below is unfair they place only has like 30 chairs in it total in order to serve 30 people at one sitting they would have to close the restaurant down
I don't get why everyone loves this restaurant
it has been over a year since I visited this hole of a restaurant but my experience is what counts
Francis is almost one of the best restaurants I've visited in a long time
For a restaurant that's been open well over a year these kinds of rookie mistakes while forgivable are just out of place and confusing
I consider this place a kid-friendly restaurant due to the atmosphere and concept
We love the family who owns and runs the restaurants
I think this place is well-known enough for their wings without the gimmicky ploy to get men into the restaurant
There's something special going on there and I recommend it to anyone who is tired of the same old restaurants the same old foods the same old
I personally recommend the brie-and-pickle with sliced turkey quite possibly the most delicous sandwich I've ever had from a deli-style restaurant and equally enjoyed with a frosty on-tap cream soda
We've eaten at this Chipotle several times and although it is not one of my favorite places to eat I recognize that the supposed quality of the food may be better than other fast food restaurants
I can forgive one oversight even two on a restaurant visit but these folks totally dropped the ball on ours
I heard alot of hype about this place from friends and my Hispanic friends as well that kept calling this place the Mexicans' Mexican restaurant
Overall I would highly recommend this tour to anyone and everyone that loves food & wants to learn more about great local restaurants
Discovered this spot by looking for restaurants nearby my workplace
We were informed by the General Manager on a table visit that the Ginger Margaritas are the only drink that is in all of Jean-Georges restaurants worldwide
All the food was great and the atmosphere was rather unexpected for a restaurant in Tempe Marketplace
However we did like the energy of the place & always prefer to support locally owned restaurants with owners who put their hearts and souls into their work
I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone it has proven that good customer service does still exist
Somehow this unassuming place in a strip mall in Arizona is one of the better Thai restaurants I've been to
If I could give a place 6/5 stars that would be this restaurant
I love this restaurant for the casual vibe and healthy food
Went in there because the other restaurants around this place strip mall didn't offer any healthier options
I don't think this place is trash but defiantly not a big time restaurant
If you could compare this place to a legit Indo-pak restaurant it'd be something like comparing Filiberto's to Chipotle
Smells the way I want an Italian restaurant to small - warm slightly tomatoey garlicky - welcoming 0We were quickly seated though the place was crowded
There are great Middle Eastern restaurants in Phoenix but a lot of the places have food that tastes like restaurant/deli food
Ive had this meal in Chinese restaurants before and can say this place beat them all hands down
The place was packed on a Saturday night and you could definitely feel the vibrancy and energy throughout the restaurant
My good friend goes home days later to find a charge on her account for FEZ that occured on a day when she hadn't even visited the restaurant
We heard about this place through a server from another restaurant and we were excited to check out the allegedly superb food
Went at about 400 on a Saturday not a busy time for a restaurant so I wasn't scared away when we were the only ones in the entire place next time I'll make sure to think twice
New restaurants and stores opening up all this time and I'm sure this place will be around for a while
They did a great job making a restaurant in the corner of a supermarket but with the cooks tucked away in a room where you can't see them and only two people working the floor I didn't get much from the environment of the place
Lee Lee's restaurant is a great place to grab a bite with friends
I hope others will try this place to keep it going because it's a wonderful independent restaurant that Phoenix needs
Hoping for an indigenous Mexican food experience  having read so on Yelp I trundled to this place which is next to iMart A thai restaurant and a newly opened Deshi snack food store
God damn this place another hype restaurant
Note to self fancy place not the greatest restaurant to take your 14 mo old on a whim and  you and your hubby are wearing casual wear
The restaurant is a really cute intimate place and my only problem with it is it's far away from my house
The restaurant inside was very modern looking and chill could be a fun place to hang out potentially
A restaurant with peanut shells all over the place
They do an excellent job at being both an upscale bar AND a upscale restaurant not many places are able to pull that off
A quaint little place out of a home renovated into a restaurant
Here's what I liked about the place~friendly staff~nice outdoor patio~reasonably priced drinks~an audio feed into the restaurant/bar area
Unless it's some sort of fusion place we normally stay clear of restaurants that offer two different styles of food at one location like those restaurants that serve Chinese and Mexican
He picked the place I do like that when the man picks the place and he even scores big points with me because it wasn't a chain restaurant not that he would know that I'm on this only eating at local places & Yelp about it mission this year lol
I had never visited an In & Out Burger restaurant and wanted to know what all the hype was about
First of all I love the coolness of the inside restaurant
We ended up sitting on the patio of the restaurant which was very small and lacking any sort of ambience we hoped for since that was the only place where we could both smoke hookah and enjoy drinks from the bar
I loved the decor and always thought that every restaurant should serve spumoni upon completion of a meal but the romance has since ended now that I am an adult
This is a very cute place--it's clearly not a chain-restaurant type of place that seems to be so frequent here in Scottsdale
The restaurant itself is tiny which is a drawback and there seems to be a lack of decent AC in the place
ambitious restaurant worth a visit on many levels
We had our friend over the other night for home-made sushi and when we compared sushi restaurants she raved about this place
We placed orders for appetizers and soup until he was able to make it to the restaurant but the owner seemed annoyed with our table anyway
Apparently changes have taken place and the restaurant has decided to sacrifice its four diamond status to cater to the family clientele in shorts
Very cute place but the food like many Italian restaurants in phoenix was pretty disappointing
In the end the place smelled very fishy which you should know is a bad sign when eating at a fish restaurant - especially sushi and we decided to just split and get food elsewhere
Finally a place to get an exceptional steak without going to one of the 'Prime' restaurants
went to try this place based on one review on yelp  the waitress was rough around the edges in her waitress/hostess roll the place smelled like one of those old town restaurants that people probley smoked in for years combined with greese that may not get changed as much as it should
No but this is a case where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts and the restaurant is definitely on my short list of good Thai places in my area
If you plan on checking it out I would recommend dropping by in the evening & early in the week as the restaurant usually has only 2 or 3 patrons enjoying a quiet dinner
There were several things wrong with my recent visit to this restaurant
Okay I am not a sports fan at all and even though this restaurant caters to that crowd I still love it for one reason
The restaurant is setup more like a fast food or take out rather than a dine-in place so taking a date there probably isn't the best idea other than take-out
Next we had the yellowtail collar off the specials menu I forgot what it's called but the owner explained that it is prepared with garlic and ginger and that her restaurant is the only place you can get it prepared that way
I love food and have eaten at amazing gluten free and other health conscious restaurants  in many cities so I think I can be a good judge
I've been to all vegan this place is no but is close Chinese restaurants in NY Philly and Boulder and was hoping that this would be similar
My wife and I always enjoyed the food at The Place at their previous smaller location so we were happy to hear they expanded into a larger restaurant
Chakra 4 is one of my favorite restaurants and I love healthy fresh veggies in their raw form
Upon entering the place you would think it's one of the smaller chain restaurants with greasy pizza barros
I really wasn't expecting this place to be spectacular because 90% of the Mexican restaurants in this town serve the same stuff the same way for the same price
Elbe returned with my bloody chicken salad an place it down in front of me informing me that he'd seen chicken do that at other restaurants in town and the chef said it was fine to eat
This place must be listed in the daytime drinkers directory as I think I was the only person in the restaurant not having a beer or margarita
There are times i wish we had a Thaitown or there was a cluster of really good Thai restaurants within a 5 mile drive of me but sadly most Thai places in metro Phoenix are just not that good with exception of a few gems
For some reason this place is my all time favorite restaurant right now
Decor wise this place is super rad completely redone and they open up the restaurant when it's nice outside most of the year
I guess we will be continuing our search for comparable pupusas though if I go by his standards there are no other places that compare to his favorite restaurant in the city
You will not find me visiting this restaurant in the near future
The restaurant itself isn't the most fancy place but it has plenty of seating for customers dining in
Excellent foodExcellent peopleAnd an excellent addition to Tempe's restaurant lineupThe place is family owned by three brothers and is owner-operated
Romantic restaurant for a special occassion is the definition of this place if you look it up on Webster's dictionary
House of Tricks became the first restaurant in all of Arizona that my food snob of a mother insists I take her to every time she comes in town to visit
Hyde Says - This place seems to be two different types of restaurants
Jekyll Says - Let's call this place what it is - a nice neighborhood restaurant that can prove convenient if you live nearby and can walk avoiding the hassle and frustration that awaits you when you have to drive there
On our recent visit to Phoenix for spring training we picked this restaurant based on yelp reviews
Before stepping a foot into the restaurant we fell in love with the grapefruit trees surrounding the building such a cute area with a lot of outdoor seating
This place has beutiful exotic views of phoenix and the camelback as well as upscale candlelit restaurants to see these views perfect for any couple
The place is fairly clean for a chinese restaurant
We asked the concierge for a recommendation for a medium to upscale italian restaurant and Bucco Di Beppo was provided
I loved the location and decor of this restaurant it was very inviting and I loved the fact that they carried LUX coffee since that is some good coffee
Oh well I found Da Vang restaurant to replace their PHO and spring rolls craving
This is a real shame because before this meal I liked the place and their food/service and preferred eating there over all the other restaurants in the Mekong complex which has a LOT of food options
I will be recommending this to anyone that asks me for any southern food restaurants in the future
We met up with a couple of VA friends in AZ and wound up at this place when we couldn't find our original restaurant choice
I think this place is a good alternative to other asian restaurants and would make a great option for a quick and filling lunch
Of course if you're one of those people that jet about the planet and dine in world class restaurants you'll probably think this place is pathetic
This place is my favorite Mexican fast food restaurant I have discovered in the Phoenix metro area in the past four years
Kona Grill will be a nice addition to the neighborhood the coffee place looks unique always nice to have original places rather than Starbucks not that I don't enjoy Starbucks and the other restaurants looks promising but they're all high-end
I used to just love this restaurant - all the history and fine service  Not anymore
Had to try this place out b'c of people's reviews and I'm always in search of a good Chinese restaurant
We had a friend from Italy who came to visit and heard PB is the best in town so we thought this would be the restaurant of choice
I had always wondered about this place because an East Coast transplant I assumed that it was some kind of a pub/restaurant typical of big Northeast cities
There are restaurants out there that have visually appealing entrees but lack with the taste factor and there are places out there that are visually and satisfyingly appealing and makes you have daydreams after the culinary experience that you yearn for it days after
You can also order all the ingredients mixed in equally on the pizza if you wish but we decided to go with what the restaurant recommended and we were glad we did
I would recommend getting there at least by 330 pm so that you will make it in the 1st round into the restaurant
I Loved the classy but comfortable feel of the restaurant definitely the kind of place I like to hang out not to say that I don't like to hang out at place unlike this but I really enjoyed the vibe going on here
The restaurant is situated in the corner of a strip mall containing a dollar store a rent to own place and a pawn shop
I love seeing the EXTRA detail in service in restaurants
Overall Fuego bistro is a great restaurant with creative latin american  dishes and would recommend this place to other foodies
The interior of the place is a little strange given the shape of the restaurant and lack of windows but we made ourselves cozy in a table next to the sushi bar
I promise to bring back my restaurant glass the next time I visit
The reason being is it was a Saturday night and   the place had only two servers for the whole restaurant
I would definitely recommend this restaurant for its service and its food
In my other reviews you'll see that I love nearly all the Fox Restaurants
I hope to someday open a restaurant so when I enter a new business I eat it up I devour the place I pick apart the ambiance the lighting the noise level the architecture and design everything and I really like Culinary Dropout
It truly pains me to have to write this review of what I would otherwise consider an excellent establishment but recent events prevent me from recommending this restaurant to anyone
While I do love their pizza and antipasto which is not irreplaceable I might add after many months of consistent patronage I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone
The place is small as this is their first restaurant venture
Well I was going to try this other restaurant and stumbled upon this place
Ok for those of you who like going to chain restaurants this is not your place
And that to me has it's own special place in the restaurant food chain
most restaurant places we go to include the toast and potatoes with your meal especially when you pay that much
but depending on your pallet I could see this place swooping in a stealing a lot of business from other more bland Mexican and ethnic restaurants nearby
Unable to find a good place to lock my bike the owner showed me a covered area between the restaurant and the adjacent building and told us he was currently building a bike rack thus I was impressed with the service even before I sat down
If you're in the market for a nice creative dinner I'd rather recommend restaurants such as Quiessence Atlas Bistro FnB or Binkley's all of which offer at least as good of an experience without requiring multiple wheelbarrows of cash to partake in phenomenally interesting and creative cuisine
I also love their location 5 min walking distance from the Arizona Center so we can have a great dinner before a show at a nice restaurant without having to stress out about driving and the need to find parking twice
The only cool thing about this place is the guy who pulls noodles in the big window in the middle of the restaurant
Francis or any of the other exceptional restaurants around town but the food service and atmosphere earns this place a solid 2 stars
I wish I had more positives to say I really wanted to love this restaurant
I really love the decor and the feel of this restaurant
A couple people have recommended it to me so my boyfriend and I decided to try it for restaurant week
If I rated them against restaurants I have visited in Mexico San Diego El Paso and a few other places I would drop them to a 3-star rating and if I rated them against a couple of my favorite ever places regardless of location price cleanliness etc
It is tragic because I love everything Hillside has done; the windows the open kitchen the casual environment remind me of the greatest restaurants in town; La Grande Orange True Food and The Vig
I dont know how people know of this place because it is very tucked away in this small airport you wouldnt think that there was a restaurant here
I dined at this amazing place on Sunday the last day of Restaurant Week - AZ
I would put this restaurant on my quarterly circulation but I can't see myself visiting more frequently
If only the food was better I might have been abe to give this place 3 maybe even 4 stars but it is a restaurant after all
With a valley full of so-so restaurants it is always refreshing to find a truly good place to eat
The price point of some of the entrees is a bit high which led to this place being close to empty during lunchtime even as every other restaurant in Westgate was packed because of the Cardinals-Texans game starting at 115
Just like many other new fast food restaurant concepts that are popping up all over the place the food at Smashburger tastes as though it is fresh and of very high quality
We took a visiting friend to this restaurant with us last time and he was very glad we did loved dinner
I do have to say in the realm of restaurants that are going this route I would rather go to a smaller local place
Place always seems clean when I pick my food up and has the type of decor you'd expect to see in a Thai restaurant
This was my first time eating at an actual Thai restaurant and I loved it
Don't miss The patio seating and atmosphere at nightSkip  the bar half of the restaurants seats are badly placed and save your cash with Kobe burgers that barely surpass the gut-bombs from White Castle
In any case I love China Chili because it allows people who would never walk into a more authentic Chinese restaurant to put a foot in the door of an enormous culinary world
I really love that there's the open grassy area in the back of the patio/restaurant area
um the place isn't very nice but it's not bad either just a casual small little restaurant
When my friend found out I was visiting Arizona she wanted me to visit her brother's restaurant  Tott's Asian Diner
I would agree with other reviewers that the music is really loud and kind of out of place for a sushi restaurant
So I was craving Mexican food being fully aware we wouldn't find anything that could compare to places in Phoenix we saw the Rancho 7 Restaurant and a sign that said Mexican and American Food
After this last visit I told them that there are no more redeeming factors for me at this restaurant and I am not returning
Thanks once again to ASBA's Leslie Barrett for recommending another excellent restaurant in the Valley
I've never eaten a meal at the restaurant but if you want a nice little buzz and a pretty full stomach in a lovely environment on a pauper's budget this IS the place
If you are a foodie or restaurant afficiando this is your new place
I must say of all theseChandler Mall/Chandler Blvd Strip restaurants we frequent for company functions - Majerle's Keg Firebirds Chili's - this place has my favorite menu
We've been coming here since day one and I wouldn't call it our 'favorite' restaurant but it's probably the restaurant we visit most frequently
BUT out here in the south west valley in the oh so lovely town of Tolleson I should be grateful for a restaurant that is not a chain and that there actually is a Chinese restaurant
The Cheesecake Factory in Chandler is one of those restaurants you want to take your family members such as your visiting aunt and uncle from Korea

we waked in to a very lovely patio and inside a small but nice restaurant
The restaurant is in a strip mall kinda place but it actually happened to be convenient so I could go next door after dinner and get a couple of groceries
This place is like somebody in Switzerland's idea of a real southwest Mexican restaurant
Besides that it's a great place for another restaurant
While these aren't Mexican dishes they were for the kids this is sky-high even for restaurant standards- The side dishes are tiny -- my portion of rice and beans was absolutely lacking- The carne asada tacos were decent but could have been more flavorful; including a lime definitely would have helped the causeAs there are many other better and more authentic places to get Mexican food in the East Valley search elsewhere
It's never smelled funny whenever I have eaten here and I would recommend this place for both bar and table seating you know how you get screwed when you order sushi at the table at almost any other Japanese restaurant
The restaurant is clean and pretty the servers are friendly and efficient and the prices are low for a lovely lunch or dinner special
There's a general positive attitude from the workers more in line with a sit down restaurant than with a fast food place
Chef MacMillen's restaurant sits right next to the Jade Bar and the idea of possibly seeing him there was enough to entice us to pay a visit
Already a huge fan of Culinary Dropout and other Fox restaurants I was super-excited to try this place
Overall this was a great traditional Italian restaurant that I would recommend trying

I think Cheuvront may be losing some of its steam to the newer restaurants downtown and granted I've yet to try this out for dinner and wine but it's really a very lovely place and I'd really like to see this neighborhood staple thrive
The restaurant was relatively empty at the time of our visit
I understand that we visited the restaurant at 920pm on a Wednesday evening but their website showed that they take reservations all the way until 930pm
I didn't do an exhaustive review of the check but it did not look like anything was comped though the restaurant put in a $25 gift card for a future visit
I was visiting Phoenix for a weekend and found this restaurant on Yelp
This Phoenix secret is definitely on my list of restaurants to visit again

Each time we have eaten here we have the same waitress who is just as quirky and charming as the restaurant itself loved her she just seemed like the happiest person on earth lol
The restaurant is nicely decorated in a somewhat modern Italian style but the bar and patio are is the place to be
I would love to see Roger's business thrive and develop into a larger operation as a sit-down restaurant as did the original Garcia's one of my all time favorite places
i absolutely love that oregano's makes the patio the focal  point of the restaurant
I remember we visited this restaurant more than a year ago and whatever we ordered was decent  my memory plays tricks on me
I absolutely loved the decor of the restaurant very minimalist lots of black and white with a really eclectic mix of old new and industrial furnishings
I love that even though this isn't your standard sit down restaurant with a waiter it is still classy and the staff takes care of you well
This place has a really cozy feel its definitely not a restaurant fit for large groups of people
There are freakin' few breakfast restaurants except trendy expensive places that serve alcohol
While visiting the area I'd gone to most of the bars/restaurants in that plaza

This place is pretty Americanized for an authentic Vietnamese restaurant
I have had it at other restaurants and loved it
On the second visit the restaurant was pretty dead and the manager completely ignored me while sitting on a little chair behind the counter
49th Avenue and Thunderbird two excellent Asian restaurants practically side by side and you can't go wrong at either place
In conclusion this restaurant is by far one of the best Mexican joints I have visited
I love the charm that was kept when turning this into a restaurant
Ironically the food at this Sauce restaurant is prepared better than the other two locations I have visited
First it is not a restaurant per se but a fast food place where one orders from the counter
The only thing that has ever gone wrong at this place is not the restaurant's fault at all
All in all the restaurant is a very nice change of pace especially if you're eating at sandwich places for lunch while at work
Being a semi-health conscious diner I loved that they had fat free dressings made tuna salad with low fat mayo and just had many many more healthy options than the average restaurant
The first thing we noticed walking in is how surprisingly nice and clean the place is for a middle eastern restaurant
A couple months ago I decided that I needed to break out of  my usual tried and true restaurant pattern and try some places nearby that up until now I've ignored or avoided
The Pappas family is an integral part of the Houston restaurant scene love them or hate them
We love the food and the restaurant is right around the corner from our house but we lean toward other farther away restaurants with a more weloming feel
I have visited this restaurant a handful of times over the last 7 years
No spa or restaurant visit at the hotel for me but the fitness center is nice and the lobby is inviting for just hanging out

I love that Phoenix restauranteurs are finally catching on that we appreciate a good patio situation
Know that when eating in the restaurant your meats will be placed on wax paper
This place is way too expensive for the quality of food you get when compared to any of the Greek restaurants around Phoenix

When ANY restaurant uses the word-of-mouth system to place orders in the kitchen there is a huge possibility for error as happened in my case
Couldn't find any decent sit down restaurants but they have some nice fast food style places for hot dogs and cinnabons and such
I'll admit up front Liberty Market is my all time favorite restaurant and I love it
This is a lovely restaurant with a nautical theme

I love when restaurants choose not to skimp on the quality or the quantity
I would definitely recommend this restaurant for gluten-free dining out
I don't know if it is specific to this restaurant or if the entire chain is this way but after multiple visits my honest opinion is that their menu is way way too big
This place was ok ONLY because we came here for restaurant week so we didn't pay the outrageous menu prices
This is the second Grand Lux Cafe that I've been to and I always love the consistency of restaurants like this
It's okay though because this place is by no means a club it's more of a bar/restaurant
Next time I will probably choose another restaurant to visit when it's time to pause the Saturday activities and have a bite to eat in a lively setting
It's such a lovely little restaurant with an truly entertaining view
The open restaurant concept keeps the place lively as there is always a good crowd soaking in the fresh air at the open bar or on the patio
I have actually been to both locations of this restaurant and I would recommend this one over the Glendale one
This restaurant is very clean appealing and has a lovely atmosphere and decor
I never came to the original place but I would be curious to see the new restaurant in Anthem
The only reason this place doesn't get a full five stars from me is because there was a very strange metallic smell towards the front of the restaurant when you first come in which could compromise the appetites of some
Considering we arrived with the after game crowd I think we got really good service and I would say at it's peak the restaurant inside was about 2/3 full and dwindling as we were thereOverall it is not a bad place and I would go again if invited but I want to try some other places in the area too on my infrequent trips downtown
The service - I have visited the restaurant four of five times and have no complaints
One had said Arizona but admitted that he hadn't really visited every Turkish restaurant in this great state

I called in and placed a take-out order as I was driving towards the restaurant
With so many good restaurants nearby Sandellas right next door I don't think this place will last for long
and Chicago and visitors coming here for the first time may have a hard time finding it if they don't routinely shop in the little artisan craft plaza the restaurant is in
You'd think wouldn't you that with a name like Hillside Spot this restaurant in Ahwatukee would be nestled in a pastoral setting with lovely views

As I'm sitting here this morning casting my Zagat votes I cant help but feel underwhelmed by the selections on their Arizona's Top Restaurants I cant help but wonder why some of these places are on here

It's consistently decent and delightfully predictable which is why people go to chain restaurants in the first place
The new stores should have their own identity and definitely should not have replaced an existing restaurant which always seemed to be crowded

I have always loved this restaurant but have had to stop going to it because my last 3-4 experiences were not very good ones
There's awesome greasy hole-in-the-wall everybody-speaks-Spanish places like El Tlacoyo and Moreno's in Mesa; there's a variety of fast food places like Filiberto's and Someburros; you have you generic family restaurant Mexican like Macayo's Garcia's and Tia Rosa's; and then you have your niche places

Tucked into the Firesky Resort this is a great place to grab a business lunch or casual date without all the public hoopla of other Scottsdale restaurants

Truly not your high end restaurant with almost the same quality of foodIf you hungry and in this area I woulod recommend that you try the Good Egg
No they don't greet you in the same way as every other restaurant in town but that's what makes this place so homey and comforting
I would say it's worth visiting and a nice change of pace from your typical chain restaurant
Just a place that I think distributes to mostly high end restaurants but will sell to the public also
That may be ok if you want to grab a slice of pizza maybe a hot dog or something else small and easy to carry from one of the nearby restaurant; but it seems like more of a hassle going from place to place just to find something to eat and carrying it back here

this place is another trendy flamboyant read Gay owned restaurant that serves good drinks offers trendy waiters that pretend they are the food version of a Sommelier and act like they have a PhD in food and know so much more about chicken enchiladas than you do so for the average Joe white dude in Phoenix they are impressed by this

Visited Italian Restaurant tonight their third night open
its just that the restaurant part of the place kinda doesn't fit with the loungey part of the place
It seemed to me that the food booths that were set up were mostly chain restaurants like Chipotle and that hot-wing place
Because  we've been burned often by Mexican places filling cheese enchiladas with Velveeta and similar atrocities it's a hard sell to get us to try new Mexican restaurants
I suppose that's evidence of the restaurant's overall quality but their general nonchalant attitude about the situation has frustrated me to the point that I rarely even bother with the place anymore - which is too bad because they probably have the best wings I've ever tasted
Love the feel of the place - it did not feel like a Mexican restaurant - more like an upscale bistro kind of place great decor
I just chalked this up to this restaurant not really being the best place to order pizza

It's probably a fun place to go with a small group of friends just to hang out order a lot of plates and just sample what the restaurant has to offer

I have to say I try to go to indie-restaurants as much as possible but I love Einstein's six-cheese bagels and the dutch apple bagels

I moved to AZ a few months ago from NYC where I lived in a neighborhood of great Vietnamese restaurants and have eaten my way through the Vietnamese enclaves in Boston and in Hong Kong -- and this place ranks up there with the best of them
The restaurant wasn't crowded at all which is beyond me because I think this place was exceptional and very fairly priced for the caliber of food and service we received

Sidenote Man peddling roses inside the restaurant is persistent - I'm still trying to figure out who he knows or how he's related to the owners in order to be allowed to interfere with the service in the place
Seems like it's a better place to go to visit the bar than the restaurant
I can't wait to revisit the restaurant this fall

I go here more often than I would normally visit a restaurant

On a side note the atmosphere of this place may not be up to par with the big restaurants or East Valley dining but I'm someone who goes for food and service the look of the restaurant is last on my list
So like the other reviewer said I also really love 50's-esque restaurants so of course that's what originally drew me in to Sonic

The restaurant was hopping with visitors which is a great sign in this economy
So to end my tale about my introduction to the Village Tavern this is a great neighborhood restaurant that I'd happily visit again
There were a couple of good stores in there that were fun to look at and a few good restaurants but mostly it is a just walk around and look at all of the stuff type of place just so you can say you saw it tick it off your list
Biggest plus for the place is that it has its own parking with some one checking to make sure you are there for the restaurant the one thing I hate about downtown is parking

At places like these I've learned that the sushi tends to be fresher when the restaurant is crowded because the chefs constantly have to replenish the sushi that's been taken off the conveyor belt and I'm not sure what the turn around time is before the sushi is removed I'm sure there's some secret protocol in place
I hate to say this but Chase Field food is actually better then this place the sad and ironic part is it's the same restaurant

A friend of mine and I visited this restaurant over the weekend
Let's just say for the actual price of the food that this restaurant isn't worthy of a revisit
I love that there a number of different restaurants to suit your taste in addition to the cheaper eateries such as Paradise Bakery Chipotle ColdStone Creamery etc
Even now that I live in GIlbert I am still bringing visitors to this restaurant all the time
It's not the kind of restaurant hard-core foodies would be impressed with but definitely the kind of place where a group of friends can just hang out and relax after a hard day's work

The consensus between me my friend and my sister is that Wong's Place IS the best Chinese Szechaun / Hunan restaurant in the Phoenix Area

The italian restaurant Alto on property is quite good I enjoyed a chicken dish in a red wine reduction and they have a lovely wine list as well

When I walked in the place was empty except for this kindly older gentleman who sat at the counter reading the paper I assumed he was the owner or had something to do with restaurant because he greeted us as we walked thru the door
I don't know if its the fact that this place is trying to be urban and hip but instead it's a bunch of overpriced stores and pretentious restaurants

I recommend staying here since they have a steak place across the lot that is part of the complex as well as other restaurants at the mall on the other side of the street

I'd say that I'd visit this restaurant again however maybe only during lunch to get the meals for their lunch prices
My only regret is that living in Sacramento CA I won't be able to visit this fine restaurant on a regular basis
Think I'll add this place to my list of go-to restaurants for when I am craving Chinese fast food and don't want to shell out $$ for PF Chang-like fare
I wondered if I had gone to a totally different restaurant than the 4 star Mint Thai I had visited several months ago
I would love to see them improve the interior of the restaurant to match the quality of the food but with a full belly I am not complaining
First off they picked just about the worst place to have their restaurant there's no parking at all
It took me 15 minutes just to place my order and after I ordered I realized that nearly everyone else who was in the restaurant was waiting on food too
I feel like the people running the place have cheated their potential customers out of the chance to try their restaurant
I LOVE the Souvia Sushi like the green tea served in sushi restaurants mixed with Mango Dream
I absolutely love Tom Kha Gai soup but almost every Thai restaurant that I go to doesn't offer just a single serving bowl of it they get all fancy and serve it in these giant silver urns so I rarely end up ordering it
I thought it was just some pizza restaurant that coincidentally had the same name as my beloved pizza joint in NY
This restaurant was recommended to me by Indian friends from my school - and I believe they visited Tandoori Times frequently
After visiting Pizza Bianco two days earlier my wife and I thought we would try the Bianco's newest restaurant in the Town and Country shopping center in Phoenix

Scramble could be  a great place in my list of restaurants because of a few reasons
Took my sister here and we love thai food and are relatively easy to please at restaurants as well as pretty patient
This place is used to be my favorite Dim Sum restaurant but I have not visited them for a while
I have not visited the restaurant since
The restaurant manager Jennifer Hawkins also paid us a visit in no time at all with some complimentary and remarkably delicious treats
I don't go to Mexican food restaurants often but I decided to try this place out because of how many times the place has switched owners and names
I've always tried the different restaurants this place has become
i wouldn't normally give an uninspired chain restaurant a Five Star rating but i just love their brunch specials and big patio
I hope this is helpful criticism because I do love the Keegan's restaurants and normally have good service
I'll definitely return to Liberty Market again- as I said I do love the restaurant and would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to eat
Between those and the shops restaurants outdoor games and golf courses it seems like this is truly a place you could just stay at without leaving for the entire trip
Viewing this place from the outside it sort of reminds me of a restaurant you might see at an Egyptian-themed theme park or water park or something
Although there are few good Middle Eastern restaurants in Phoenix and I have been trying since 2005 when visiting from California which I normally rate them 3-4
Do you know what sets this place apart from the sea of sushi restaurants that have opened up lately
In fact everything about this place is like a blast from the past - it's like walking into a museum featuring restaurant cliches from 25 years ago
Now I have written some reviews about crappy places in the past but this might be hands down the absolute worst experience I have ever had at any restaurant in my entire life
As L&L's closed down this sushi restaurant replaced it
I'm reviewing yet another fast food restaurant and it's not because I'm totally into grease but because I'm admittedly overly critical of attention to detail in these drive-thru places because hello you're driving through usually driving AWAY and you're too far from the restaurant to remedy the situation when you notice they foul up
Of course it is better when done by a professional but at most places when I ask for it they don't know what it is even at Mexican restaurants
i was a bit surprised as my in-laws picked this place out and we tend to differ in our restaurant tastes
Restaurants like Aloha Kitchen are a huge part of what I love about living in the Phoenix Area Honest amazing affordable food that's served by independent establishments
And lots of new local restaurants and shops and lots of places to people watch
Yummmmmm I love this place I will have to say though if you are looking for a typical Americanized Chinese restaurant this is not the place for you
FIRST PLACE - a tiny local breakfast/lunch restaurantPrice  $8
Modern adaptations of classic Mexican fare make this place stand out from other Mexican restaurants
I highly recommend this restaurant for excellent Thai food
Loved the atmosphere of this restaurant very sleek elegant young
The place was relatively empty - as expected of a typical restaurant
I am in love with the food at this quaint restaurant
It was a late lunch and there seemed to be some restaurant business being done-loud perveyor orders being placed etc
I would recommend that you go to a sit down restaurant and order quality food
I'd give Sam's a 10 star rating but then again this is my first time reviewing a restaurant so it's a pleasure to start off my Yelp career with such a great and wonderful place
I didn't make a stink because I didn't recommend the restaurant and I wasn't paying I was being taken out
In my line of work I recommend a lot of restaurants to out of towners and this place will definetly not make the cut
In fact we picked this place because it is a family restaurant  and we expected it to be kid-friendly
Mesa has a plethora of wonderful little restaurants and cafes with good food and good service and good prices so there's no reason to patronize a place that doesn't measure up
Overall loved the restaurant and we will be back again
Because of him the whole restaurant has a laid-back friendly appeal unlike places like Roka-Akor and Yasu which have more of an arrogant flair
I wish I had known about this place sooner because it really is such a delightful restaurant
It was my choice of restaurant and everybody loved their food
Their mashed potatoes have a ton of flavor as well and even if this is a done-up chain type restaurant this place gets it right a fair amount of the time
The restaurant is pretty much a little hole in the wall the best kind of place with some of the best food you could ever eat
Unlike the other asian chain restaurants in the valley that use poorly trained chefs to cook the friendly Thai couple that own this place cook every dish as if it were for their own family
The actual meeting room was sectioned off in the rear of the restaurant this would make a great place for any after wedding rehearsal dinner seminar/luncheon or even possibly an upscale bridal shower
I did not visit any of the restaurants but we did order room service for breakfast
I was expecting a sit-down-and-order experience but was wrong and I've talked to others who've thought the same thing there are places to sit it's just more like a deli than a restaurant
We love to drink wine with dinner and I get spitting mad at the thievery many restaurants present in wine pricing
In conclusion although this was only our first visit we were extremely impressed with this new Scottsdale restaurant
After contacting the restaurant I'm not sure that I can ever recommend this restaurant to anyone because the response I got was maybe it was a garlic clove
I love the house this restaurant operates in
I LOVE that this restaurant offers vegetarian vegan and gluten-free options
I LOVE that the restaurant also strives to buy local and be eco-friendly the staff even wears American Apparel uniforms because they are made in the USA
It was a cute touch I love when restaurants play up the neighborhood's culture
I've never reviewed a restaurant before much less a fast food restaurant but I really want to see this place survive
The restaurant is bright and fun and has a unique style which I love
The restaurant itself is such a pleasant place to be too
Brio was quickly becoming my favorite Italian restaurant in the East Valley but these two most recent visits have got me looking for alternatives
Recommendation #2 While Brio doesn't offer wi-fi there is an open wi-fi connection with a strong signal from one of the restaurants near-by
I love Fox Restaurants and was shocked that this is connected to that company
This is one of my go-to lunch places since it is one of the few restaurants in the area besides Quiznos  Chipotle or the food court at the mall where you can get a lunch for under $10
I loved the atmosphere of this restaurant I was a little disappointed in the service
However my aunt and I read some reviews and used our best cajoling to get her out of her mu mu and into the car to visit this little restaurant just down the way from Ranch Market
We call the front desk for a restaurant recommendation they have none that are open past nine
My girlfriend got the meat lovers scramble and considering the name of the restaurant we figured this breakfast would be a sure shot
I was impressed by the people at the front desk who were always willing to recommend restaurants and gave us rides in the shuttle to and from the airport and any time they weren't busy they would drop us off at a nearby downtown area too
For an Italian restaurant we would have loved to see this come out better
Also they have at least 5 mini-restaurants inside the place so you can pretty much find whatever you'd like to eat
After our visit to The Grind my wife & I gave the restaurant 2
This place is probably one of the better mexican restaurants we have been to
The reason this place is pretty good is because they have things that are atypical of other mexican restaurants
Visited this restaurant based on the Yelp ratings and comments
I waited and waited for this place to open hoping for a good fast food Mexican restaurant
The PlaceI'm not sure if the first review was before they opened the new restaurant
I have been to this restaurants a few times and still love it
We both agreed that the Spicy Eggplant was much better than the Thai Curry Chicken; I'd suggest going to a Thai Restaurant for Thai Food and going with a more traditional Chinese entree if you visit Shanghai Club
Again I realize that a lot of people probably love this restaurant
We ended up visiting this restaurant one day after our barista at Starbucks mentioned how the patrons at her 'other job' weren't tipping well forcing her to hold an alternate vocation at the coffee giant

Thanks to restaurant week and Quiessence being booked we decided on this lovely place for our 4th anniversary
A highly recommended restaurant from separate concierges at the Hilton Pointe Squaw Peak Resort
The glowing brick pizza oven is right in the middle of the restaurant and just makes a place  that is in the middle of a strip mall seem very cozy
I visited this place because I received a gift card from my parents for Fox Restaurants and I've heard quite a few people recommend this place
If you love local CenPho restaurants this place is a must try
After having visited the Tempe location I was excited to try the restaurant downtown
My daughter loved the music and chose to dance a bit while the restaurant was still empty
It's truly aggravating to have partaken of a restaurant's food and service at its best only to get half that on subsequent visits
If you want a better menu based but still inexpensive Chinese restaurant I recommend Ming and Gee on the south side of Glendale one block west of 43rd Ave
This place is definitely a special treat and was a splurge even with the restaurant week menu
I typically like to stay away from chain restaurants but the mister and I were looking for a cheap place and served good food
I love how the restaurant is open to the outside making it a great place to sit wherever you may be seated
My friends have recommended this place several times and I turned them down because I didn't realize that it is a sit down restaurant with food other than pitas
For a sushi restaurant in Tempe I'd give this place 4 stars
I've been one to use yelp to help identify restaurants and services in cities I've visited
This place reminds me of Nyala a restaurant in the Little Ethiopia district of Los Angeles
Crossing this restaurant off as a food destination when visiting Phoenix
For me it brings back memories of many little whole-in-the-wall Italian restaurants my family and I used to visit when I was growing up in Chicago and Cleveland

If you are in Phoenix visiting or a resident I challenge you to find a better restaurant to patron

I like the idea of the restaurant with all the bright colors and the cool patio but the place is actually really dirty
We really wanted a new restaurant to visit in the area
Don't think of this place like a restaurant
The restaurant is right in the same shopping center as the Trader Joe's near Camelback avenue in North Phoenix and that is a pretty cool place
The restaurant is set up as a sort of casual rustic italian sort of place like the ones I've seen in Naples and that is a nice bit of Italian drama theater though taking it to the point of serving the wine in small water glasses a little too authentic
The food is typical Asian fare but with a deluxe restaurant twist--after all the place is owned by P
Ive been eye balling this place for some time after seeing they offered a dining certificate on restaurant
Okay to get into this place you have to turn into the plaza behind the restaurant on Southern
The people visiting this restaurant were some of Scottsdale's finest
The place is super cute with the neat restaurants and the juice bar
I love to support independent non-chain restaurants and when Sala Thai opened up in my neighborhood I was very excited
When I arrived I was a little concerned as it was a convenience store looking place rather then a restaurant but one side is dedicated to the food
I urge you to try the food if it's your type of restaurant and if it's not I recommend it anyway to step outside your comfort zone
He loved everything including Moose Drool beer which not a lot of restaurants serve
I love the concept of a restaurant set in a historic house that in itself is cool in its own right  and the food is tasty but the service is horrible
It also isn't as expensive as other sushi restaurants and there are other menu options for land lovers
5 Stars doesn't even do this place justice but I suppose that's why it's a 5 DIAMOND restaurant
I love seeing these local restaurant's do it up right
Visited this restaurant while taking in some Spring Training in the area and based on the positive reviews listed here on Yelp

Take relatives visiting from out-of-state here for an authentic Mexican restaurant experience
This place was a fun and refreshing alternative to the conventional restaurant for date night
They are on the pricey side but I just love a restaurant that is designed for women
Squaw Peak Mtn is just a hop away and perfect for a morning hike I've already professed my love to the pool above they have plenty of restaurants on property including Rico's American Grill which is delicious and Hole-in-the-Wall which is fun old-western fun
The restaurant was cosy with the fireplace and well dressed milf's prancing around
This was my first time getting the donuts and it makes my prior three visits to the restaurant a complete waste simply because I haven't gotten these every time
There is also a lovely full bar in the lobby and a restaurant as well
Sure the building is cool the brick oven is neat the place is trendy but it's a restaurant
This restaurant has survived on the hype of being one of the only ice places downtown but luckily that has changed
As much as they claim to try hard at this place management hasn't got a clue how to run a restaurant
The place is very clean run by a super nice asian family plus the restaurant is located in an awesome asian market that give 10% off everything
I swear to Cthulu the entire restaurant froze in place
Sometimes it's a bit crowded being that it's not a big restaurant but it is an overall nice atmosphere and great place to eat
If you are looking for the Typical chain Mexican food type restaurant then this is not the place to go
Anyone who gives this place a favorable review has no taste buds and extremely low standards for restaurants or are very lazy if you live close by we do
This marketplace has a lot of restaurants AMC theater and stores such as Kohl's
Love Ling & Louie's Asian restaurant-ginger margaritas are great
I love when restaurants make traditional staples their own
That's like going to a sushi restaurant and paying for soy sauce or a burger place and paying for ketchup
The Dollar car rental agent recommended Pitic as a nearby mexican food restaurant
A bit of advice for those contemplating ordering sashimi or nigri -- always ask the sushi chef and not the wait staff what they recommend that evening -- sushi restaurants are at the mercy of their suppliers in terms of the quality of the daily deliveries  and the toro that tasted divine last week may not make the 'cut' this week
There is nothing better than walking into a restaurant for the first time and just knowing you're going to love the food because the ambiance is so good
Curious by any restaurants I find online I totally fell in love with their menu
There were/are tv's everywhere in the family/restaurant section of the place
I couldn't even finish it I use to make fun of restaurants that served a healthier cuisine and would get upset when my friends would drag me to eat at places like this
Located in the very chic DC ranch at Pima the restaurant is best enjoyed if seated outside in the patio on a lovely March afternoon
As a person being conscious of calorie counting right now I loved that ithis restaurant only uses one tortilla per taco as opposed to some other places that put two tortillas per taco just to make them more filling and that Milagro concentrated more on the flavor
I will forever love sushi and will return to RA Sushi Bar Restaurant until I die
This restaurant came highly recommended as an adventurous experience
Restaurant week is the greatest thing in the world because you get to eat at places like this for $30 a plate instead of the standard $50-$60
We would definitely recommend this restaurant and go back next time we are in town
The space is nice but I feel that they are trying to give the place a more upscale feel rather than a traditional family run Mexican restaurant
Now this place is Half restaurant Half OTB off track betting salon with quite a few local families for dinner and a few die-hard track betting happening at the bar on the farside
Let me back up I absolutely love vermicelli salad dishes at Vietnamese restaurants and I am a carnivore HOWEVER I am deadly allergic to fish and shellfish and I can't eat at those restaurants anymore out of fear of cross contamination but when I learned of the Loving Hut I was stoked
I drove by this place dozens of times not really knowing what it was about though I assumed it was some kind of restaurant
When I visit a restaurant I want to leave reality and enjoy a meal in la-la land
At this little oasis in the desert this quaint restaurant is situated amongst cowboy tourist trap central but there's nothing cowboy about this place
I always read reviews before visiting a restaurant and/or bar
The restaurant also features local artists from the community which I love
This place seems to be a Cantonese restaurant at the core like every other overseas Chinese restaurant
There are a lot more exciting places to eat within a few blocks but I'm old and I like restaurants that serve good tasting food
I loved this restaurant when I went for the first time three years ago
It's been a while since I've had a good breakfast sandwich NYC and London were the last places so to discover The Farmhouse Restaurant in downtown Gilbert is great news for my weekend mornings
The other issue I have with this place and this does not affect my star rating because it's out of the restaurants control is the crowd that hangs out here
The restaurant itself is a fast-food-ish feeling place with a decent amount of seating
The strange name would sort of you know ordinarily turn me off from trying the place because I think when restaurants serve this AND this they usually just serve two wildly different forms of food both of which suck
First thing I notice about this place is that it looks like we're in China   Second there is a  huge window in the back of the restaurant looking into the kitchen
Sadly I missed dinner service here so a couple of associates and I grabbed a late-night dessert at this lovely Italian restaurant
Two visits to this restaurant in the last two months
Other reviews of the restaurant are accurate as well in terms of pricing - this place is definitely a little on the higher side
On one hand I love the ambience of the restaurant and the waiters are always nice and friendly it's also my favorite place to get cheese pizza
I loved the outside of the restaurant
I love casual restaurants but I just was not overly impressed with this one
This was my first visit to a Culver's restaurant
Ok if you judge a Vietnamese restaurant based on the number of people from that culture who patronize the establishment why not apply the same principle to other places
To sit and visit while enjoying your drinks was interrupted by a waitress trying to get an order while half the restaurant was empty
went with my best Sara V and was looking forward to trying this place after reading the many five star accolades and reviews of this restaurant
All in all this place was OK but I would've preferred to try the sushi restaurant across the way which was closed
I love everything about this restaurant - salsas food drinks atmosphere prices entertainment on Wednesday
Place is clean and the staff could not be any nicer- from the owner to the busboy they all seem genuinely pleased to have you in their restaurant
Props to this restaurant for giving right sized portions unlike the super-sized join the race to obesity meals commonly served at many places
We tried both the hotel restaurants but highly recommend Frank & Albert's
After years of growing to love Italian food and trying many Italian restaurants in Phoenix and on the East coast this Maggiano's is now my favorite Italian restaurant
I like this place and even though I have moved farther from this place than other sushi restaurants I will continue to go there until I am thoroughly disappointed
The restaurant has a modern vibe to it and feels like a hip place you'd find in Phoenix
Love the small size but access to cozy bar at Lon's great restaurant pool allows Hermosa to compete with larger hotels
I have lived in the Valley for over 10 years and I FINALLY visited the Compass Restaurant
I will definitely continue going here and will recommend it to anyone looking for a good Thai restaurant in central phoenix area
The restaurant has that dark old school steakhouse ambiance that I love
you try to check out the local places and restaurants
It was neat the restaurant walls were completely open to the patio giving the place an open atmosphere
I consider this place a true family restaurant
Also that's the restaurant business - what I love you might hate and vice versa
My friend highly recommended this restaurant so we went for happy hour during the week
Do yourself a favor and break away from the mundane chain restaurants and visit this locally owned and operated New Mexican restaurant where it's clear the owners care about their food quality service and most importantly you - the customer
My girlfriend and I love Thai and have tried most of the restaurants around the valley
The food was of decent restaurant quality and definitely a good place to get steaks but it was no where near the quality you would get from Texas Roadhouse or Outback and neither is the price
I was really hoping this could be my new regular lunch spot and as many of my colleagues are Indian vegetarians I was looking forward to bringing them here as well but after a couple less than impressive visits to the restaurant I think I'll stick with getting Dr
While it's still not a 5-start spot nor the best Thai restaurant in town the service and food quality has been noteworthy recently and I have been pleased with every visit
I just can't get too thrilled about a place where the food--the crowning glory of any great European restaurant--isn't that flavorful and isn't generously enough portioned to allow everyone in the group to really share in the flavor experience
The food's quality is superior to any of the upscale fast food burrito chains it may even be better than many full service restaurants but you'll get a lot more for your money at those other places
Pay attention to their recommended restaurants in the area and trust them
The only way this place will continue to thrive is by the endless stream of business professionals who work at the Esplanade and nearby corporate centers who have grown tired of the Biltmore Fashion Park's mediocre restaurants
* Fat grams carb counts and calories are PRINTED on the menu - omg I think I'm in LOVE what a socially responsible restaurant
This corner has been lots of things restaurants seem to come and go here I wonder who or what will be next as I dont think this place has staying power
He loves Black Bear and first started to frequent these restaurants in Lake Havasu
A lovely family owned restaurant in the heart of Phoenix worth multiple visits
my husband and i are always looking for good locally-owned places to eat and after entering the name of the restaurant into google there seemed to be many good reviews so we decided to give it a try last night
I read a review from a yelper and have to go check out a new restaurant and God forbid Love it
The restaurant is a nice looking place with friendly folks who seem to be rushing around getting things done for a non crowded place
5 stars for my love of good dive-y Mexican restaurants
This place has cleaned up a bit--but its still definitely a hole in the wall type of restaurant
I have no idea how I worked downtown for years and never stumbled upon this place but I'm thinking they must have a huge lunch crew because the restaurant is enormous and has been around for quite a while I think
Clearly the place is popular with the downtown crowd - which is clearly starving for more quality restaurants
noca went from being one of my top 5 restaurants in AZ to having a 1 and 5 chance of my ever returning or recommending
My wife has had a few bad experiences with Caribbean-inspired restaurants here in the past but she was clearly impressed with this place
I've read a lot of reviews on here and it seems that the one or two people who were dissatisfied were either complaining about waiting during their visit Hmm that's what this is a restaurant not McDonald's Fast Food an no there doesn't need to be a hostess sitting people down for this to be called a restaurant
As far as the place itself the bathrooms are ok and the restaurant itself is clean and pleasant
I say iconic because I can't tell you how many times the restaurant has been recommended to me by locals resort concierges foodies etc
I never went to Pink Taco because I'm just not going to eat in such a ridiculously trendy Scottsdale hangout especially one named after a euphemism for female anatomy so when I found out that trash hole of a restaurant was gone and this new gastropub opened in its place I was anxious to check it out
We LOVE good quality  mom and pop restaurants and this hits the mark completely which makes it well worth the money
I loved the giant sushi bar in the middle of the restaurant
I don't have sex on the first date I don't friend people I haven't met and I don't give out five stars on my first visit to a restaurant
It's so lovely to be able to walk into a restaurant and order anything on the menu instead of scanning it for the 2 or 3 things you can actually eat
We were 1 of 3 tables in the whole restaurant Monday night so even though its a moderate sized place it felt very intimate
Unless you're a late 40's sociallite that thinks it's cool to order mediocre food and 13 glasses of wine in a strip mall restaurant in Chandler then I would avoid this place unless you have money to throw away
Unfortunately this place has a huge following of people that love it but the restaurant itself is tiny
There are so many great restaurants in the area and I like to support local business but this place just needs to start from scratch to make it great
Finally got to check this place out I had heard the restaurant in there was very good but just went to get a few things to make a couple of recipes
Bush would say Chinese Restaurants back east including Philly and NYC and this place can definitely hold it's own
You know a place is good when you come on a Wednesday night at 8pm 1 hour before closing and there's a 30 minute wait and the restaurant is packed
The Restaurant Manager on duty visited our table to check on our meal
I don't think that is a great sign some places I can walk into and already know that the restaurant is a hit
I have been wanting to go to the one and only Cambodian restaurant in the valley for quite a few months and we finally made it and LOVED it from the moment we entered
My second visit was almost like eating at a completely different restaurant
I don't think this place gets crowded easily as it could sit to my guess 5 times more number of guests that an averagely large restaurant
I would definitely go back to this place on labor day since every other restaurant in Phoenix closes
In a city full of Mexican restaurants you can find a better place by throwing a dart at the map
He even told us that he opened the place because he was told that a Cambodian restaurant wouldn't survive in this city
Overall I recommend this place one of the more authentic Thai restaurant in the valley and the location
I will vote this best of Japanese restaurant in town and I will recommend everyone to try at least once
To be fair Thai is not one of my favorites but we love to support local restaurants and this came highly recommended
For my dollar - go grab a spot and kill some time at Cartel grab some local foods at Bodega and maybe consider a bite at one of the locally owned restaurants like FnB or Praying Monk and skip any place with turquoise jewelry in the window while focusing on the galleries that don't quite seem to fit the 'theme
I checked in for my marathon and then put two-and-two-and-two together  it was lunchtime I was hungry and within Tempe Marketplace was a restaurant that had served me some of the best damn BBQ pork ribs ever three years prior
The developers scooped out the dirt cleaned it replaced it and built a series of restaurants and shops that draws people from all over The Valley
Considering this place is next door to several other really good restaurants I can't help but wonder why anyone would choose this particular establishment instead of one of the others
I really love the ambiance of this restaurant
My friends and I visited this restaurant for my birthday
The specialty of the house is the fifty or so broken rice dishes and my lunch companion and I decided that Com Tam something something shall be known as Broken Rice because the actual name is unpronounceable by most Americans and there is already a restaurant in the lunch rotation known as the Vietnamese place
We visited this restaurant late on a Sunday night which may have taken away from some of the excitement of this trendy upscale restaurant even still we both really enjoyed our food
It's a great place to hang out and maybe meet for appetizers and drink but hey it's Mill Ave and there are better restaurants within walking distance
When the restaurant closed and moved down the street on Indian School I wasn't sure what happened but the quality of food and the service started to wane and each visit become increasingly disappointing
I visited the restaurant TWICE this week and I am officially over OVER EASY
Valet parking is free when you're visiting the restaurant- very convenient considering I drove right on by the self parking area that was further down the mountain considering it was 95 degrees out I decided not to climb uphill
He seemed very happy to work at this restaurant and seemed to have a genuine passion for the place
This place is very original since it was an old house turned into a restaurant
Everyone had the same calm attitude and I could tell that this is a restaurant you visit to relax and still feel healthy when you leave
The buffet tables has been replaced by round tables after shutting down the Phx Palace Restaurant on Ray & Dobson & moving  the dim sum service to the Warner & Dobson location
I love that downtown Phoenix is starting to get a good variety of restaurants so I would happily go back and support the local flavor
it's what you've come to love about this trailer park/rocky point - inspired chain of bar/restaurants
Being that we live in Maricopa which is restaurant starved we will definitely make BLD one of our regular places to go
I'd recommend this place as a fun alternative to Macayo's Garcia's and all of the other well-known Mexican restaurant chains
The menu items include interesting dishes such as Squid Pickle Mustard Cream Rice and Pork Stomach Porridge see the picture I posted of the menu on the restaurant counter's base -- try finding THOSE in your local Chinese take-out place
I am not sure what it is about hip new restaurants and not having a system set in place for people to be seated but it is annoying frustrating awkward and somewhat embarrassing for the patrons who end up standing in the middle of a restaurant looking around for some sort of guidance
We had visited last year but got to the restaurant too late for sunset
Restaurant 's space was bright large windows facing the parking lot and street uncluttered and attractive shelf/bookcase with picture frames and a few knick-knacks gave the space a cozy atmosphere- don't know about the restroom as I didn't get a chance to visit it
Any restaurant with the sort of hype this place has is just waiting to disappoint
Although BJ's originally started as primarily a pizza place they now offer a lot of different types of foods many of which are not usually found in restaurants of this type
As of  our last visit in September 2009 this restaurant still comes up short
I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone
I'd like to visit the actual restaurant to try some other menu items
Or if you had to because it's your only form of transportation then I'd recommend parking it in front of the restaurant where you can at least keep an eye on it through the windows while you're eating
As a restaurant this place is really not bad
Nonetheless the food is very decent and I would recommend that you ask for a side of the hot green sauce which is entirely constituted from peppers with the same name as the restaurant
I would recommend come early have lunch in their restaurant and return to listen and look more
My wife and I love to try new places and support local restaurants
The place looks like a converted residential home turned restaurant
I didn't get any of that smokey goodness I love so much at the sister restaurant
Having searched for a true Caribbean food restaurant in the area for a long time I finally found this place
Luckily the restaurant happily took the tuna sandwiches back and gladly offered a replacement for my friends
LOVED the service at this restaurant/hotel
I think this place needs to figure out whether it wants to be a nightclub sports bar Chuck-E-Cheese or Italian restaurant
storeId=12&catalogId=11001&langId=-1&StoreName=localfoodI love the IKEA Restaurant
I've never heard anything bad about this place so I suspect AZ State Senator Cheuvront's restaurant must be suffering from light rail construction
I've been back a few times in the past 6 months and visited other Seasons 52 restaurants in DC and Chicago and have always had no issues getting meals prepared as requested
Service is pretty good about what you'd expect for a restaurant at Tempe Marketplace
This place has long been one of my favs whether getting take out or dining at the restaurant
I have also visited the Grimaldi's in Texas Allen - they really keep all their restaurants in great condition all with really fresh ingredients
I've gone to other Fox Restaurant Concepts in Tucson-Wildflower love Zinburger okay Zin Bistro loved and then they closed it and made it into Zinburger boo and have heard Sauce Blanco and North are good
No a visit to this restaurant is not just like going to Italy
While I love the concept of the mongolian bbq restaurant YC's is not even close to being a truly good one
If I was drunk and not able to drive and somehow found myself on this street in Phoenix craving sushi in front of this restaurant I will probably take off my shoes and pants and start drunk dialing my friends until someone picks me up and takes me to a different sushi place
A quaint restaurant with excellent food in a nice part of Phoenix makes Cyprus Pita Grill well worth the visit
I would not recommend this place to anyone and will continue my search for a decent sushi restaurant
The restaurant came highly recommended by a friend and we noticed that they had Foie Gras on the menu her fave so we decided to check it out
We have a one year old who gets kinda restless in restaurants and this place provides toys for them to play with
I'm on this mad hunt to visit every Chinese food restaurant in all of Arizona - without gaining 200 pounds
This is a pretty big restaurant but it's odd because it looks more like place to have a low budget wedding than to go out for dinner
I always loved that about European restaurants they serve salad with their egg dishes instead of potatoes
It would be a good idea for anyone setting up a large dinner party to visit the restaurant in question if possible
The worst part of both visits is that the restaurant was almost empty on a Sunday evening and the food was sub par it makes no sense to me
This Greek restaurant is a great place to eat
So if you are sick of eating in chain restaurants this place is for you
It was a great birthday celebration and a restaurant we will be telling our friends who live here as well as those who visit
He says fair is a four letter word and begins with F and therefore has no place in restaurant ratings
So yes this place should be on your list of restaurants to visit in the Biltmore area
Overall I really like the concept and the restaurant is lovely inside
I was visiting from Las Vegas for a horse show and this restaurant was recommended to me
His new restaurant REM will be located in the former Anderson's Other Place on Lincoln just west of Scottsdale Rd
This place will always be on my list of go-to restaurants in CenPho
This has been one of our favorite mexican restaurants ever since we first went to the original one in Mesa and is our goto place to take out of town guests
I was very impressed with how well our waiter knew the menu since the restaurant just opened and he made several recommendations even though we stuck to our favorites
As i looked at the restaurant i loved the decoration it looked really romantic and well decorated
You don't need to drive out to Manuel's when you have top-notch Scottsdale doorman that know all the best restaurants within 40 feet of Loco Patron like My Big Fat Greek to recommend to out-of-towners in case it's too busy in there to hear your children crying
I lived in Phoenix for 15 years and now that I live in PA I make sure I visit this restaurant every time I go back
Crappy Americanized Mexican restaurants are a dime a dozen in Arizona and disaster zones serving microwaved inedible food in PA but this place offers an innovative modern take on southern Mexican cuisine
I hate to see another restaurant that we enjoy being converted to another one of those places that ONLY works when you have a Groupon in hand
Overall this place is great but here is my gripe- last night we wanted to get some food but we were informed that they don't serve anything but apps in the bar area or outside and we couldn't get a table in the restaurant for another 2 hours or so
The place looks like a spanish style motel converted into a restaurant
I have been going to this restaurant since I moved out here over 1 year ago and continually recommend it
Of course he had trouble finding it because he thought it was a restaurant restaurant and not a hole-in-the-wall type place
The restaurant atmosphere is really intimate perfect for catching up with friends and loved ones
The location of the place is not very good and it looks more like a convenient store than a restaurant
Although I wish this restaurant all the success in the world I love the low-key feel of the place
I definitely recommend this restaurant if you like family owned pizza places and great New York style pizza
This family owned restaurant heaps on the Barbecue Love
Love going to this place when the temperature is nice outside and having a convenient low-key dinner a middle ground between fast food and fancy restaurant
Unless you are overly critical over ramen add this place to the list of backup restaurants especially on a cold day but this is AZland
I prefer local eateries over chain restaurants and with only 6 Phoenix locations I can classify them more as a local place than a chain
The first impression upon walking in is that the place looks pretty touristy but many sit-down Mexican restaurants do so no negative there
I'm compelled to rate this place even though it's closed on the hope that whatever restaurant lands here will take a cue from them
I've eaten here more than any other restaurant in Phoenix I think I love to check out new places so a location really has to knock it out of the park for me to want to become a regular
I would have no hesitation recommending this restaurant to friends
Since the Zinburger was offering a 2 for $30 restaurant week menu and my BFF and I have been wanting to try this place for a while we popped in for our BFF date night
I originally heard about this place from a sushi chef at another restaurant
Its exciting to see a new place like this in the area and nice to know that good restaurants and bars can continue to succeed and thrive in Central Phoenix
When the increasingly creepy chef-owner Jeff Smedstad lost his half of the restaurant in a divorce we had hopes that this place might actually serve normal food
I would even recommend the Matador restaurant next door
To be fair it's my first visit to the Roosevelt location - but then again the hallmark of a good restaurant is consistency
I sure hope they figure it out as Marston's was one of those restaurants I visit on a weekly basis
Recently an acquaintance of mine recommended a new Cuban restaurant in my area
The restaurant itself leaves a lot to be desired and the handful of times we've been there since then or passed by it the place is usually empty of diners
In regards to lunch you have Subway which I am sick of dirty water pizza at Cafe Roma hooters greasy tasting Starbucks great service Unos dark interior mediocre pizza 1130 Sams Cafe Big Fat Greek Restaurant Coldstone NY & Co AMC theatre and a barrage of touristy places as well
The restaurant in this place is excellent
All of the Yelp reviews I saw before going paint Durant's as a place of mystique a place where old traditions and dining styles thrive and don't change even as fusion and ew American restaurants surround it
This place is easily the best restaurant on the south side of Phoenix
I don't recommend their room serves especially with other nice restaurants around both on site and in walking distance
I explained our problem he kept berating a laboring the subject including 'where else would i put 15 people' the place was empty even after the 15top there were no more than 40 people in there; 'i have to have people help all customers' and 'in the restaurant industry when it is not busy i have to cut people' and 'if you would have brought your complaint to me i could help you' he had no clothing on that indicated he was a manager
I've yet to visit a Fox restaurant that I didn't like and Culinary Dropout is no different
Overall this place is a hidden gem not near as good as other Original Pancake House restaurants namely the one in Ohio where the diner experience was great and the staff were friendly
They have tons of great restaurants and shops but they're also always having festivals concerts art walks and all sorts of other special events for visitors
Because someone yelled at me for doling out stars like candy I now feel guilty when I give out five stars for a restaurant I've only visited once
My general rule is that when I find a place on restaurant
I enjoy visiting each week to sample popular dishes from the ever-changing lineup of restaurants
Being a parent I have probably seen bathrooms in every place we have ever been to the grocery store gas station and restaurants
We need more places like this and less garbage chain restaurants
The restaurant is small so I would recommend reservations
Disclaimer It must first be said that this restaurant is essentially a nice bar at the edge of the main casino floor--it is not a sit-down fine dining type of place
Most places have frozen meats Its a underground tube like restaurant I'm referring to
You see I love salad and all but typically refuse to order it at a restaurant unless it's a side but the Mixed Greens salad is so delicious
Willing to try the place again because we enjoyed the environment and this is a decent achievement for a downtown restaurant in a hotel but there is room for improvement
afraid to lookNope it's not the best Mexican restaurant in town and it's not the best bocce court you'll ever see but combined they make Aunt Chilada's a decent place to have a bite and a cocktail and to play the games that people play
But on the other side as a normal restaurant it is nothing to rave about kinda expensive and smaller portions love the mentality bigger is better so I would of ranked it a 3
It's expensive compared to other restaurants but the experience for us has always been worth far more the price and we are eagerly anticipating our next visit
Upon entering the restaurant you place your order at the counter and can take a look at the small kitchen where the magic happens
This sorry excuse for a breakfast restaurant only believes in two things which is to make your visit as expensive and quick as possible
We found refuge at the Marriot one block south with a lovely quiet restaurant where we could actually hear each other and where the wait staff was all one could ask-wonderfully polite and attentive
Perhaps I am overly critical having eaten at great Greek restaurants in other cities I've noticed that ethnic places - Mexican aside - are over rated across the board in Phx but as a 'Greek' restaurant this place falls flat
I'd rather visit a hole in the wall bar where I can find a seat without work or a restaurant with an actual seating system
The restaurant sophisticated but very comfortable with a back and front patio-- both with fireplaces
I know that bartenders do it to maximize their tips I used to be one but it is bush league and should have no place in a restaurant like Durants
The place is ran by a cute couple and their sons nice family owned restaurant
Living in Los Angeles my husband and I come to this restaurant every time we visit family in Gilbert
Overall I think that this is a great place to come to and probably doesn't have much competition as this is the only Polish restaurant that I know of
I noticed just today that I still haven't handed out the coveted fiver to any Mexican restaurants yet which is probably because I've only been rating places in Dallas
Now a birdie told me that the owners of this place are related to the owners of Restaurant Mexico--which is irrelevant to the food but it's nice to know about the little connections around town
The ambience is typical of a place that probably was a converted Dennis restaurant
Our local friend brought us to this lovely restaurant after a crazy night of Halloween partying
Overall I would go back to the restaurant but I would not stay there again unless they fixed the place up a bit
I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to my worst enemy
With so many other restaurants to choose from in the Tempe Marketplace I am not sure I'll return to Kabuki
I love the fact that this restaurant is a restored craftsman home in downtown Phoenix with a great patio area
Thanh himself is a young guy whom you will usually find seating you when you visit the restaurant
The point is a lot of love and thought has gone into this restaurant to make sure that every single ingredient put on your plate is of the highest quality possible and is prepared by a very talented kitchen staff
After my plea to try and understand the other side of this restaurant I know that I may not have been able to make everyone stop and reconsider any opinions they might have about this place the wait the small serving of orange juice the confined areas and that's OK
Every time we have someone visiting from out of town we take them to this restaurant
This place is pretty cool Japanese restaurant that offers food that other Japanese restaurant don't have
Only the negative thing about this restaurant is that this restaurant can be very busy during weekend since the place is not very big
the restaurant looks nice inside but the servers and food need to change or this place is going to disappear
cave creek was kind of a random place for a restaurant of this quality but did offer a nice view of the sunset behind a mountain in the distance
the combination of mindblowing food coupled with incredibly accomodating and informative service has to put binkley's at the top of the list of restaurants i've visited
This place needs blinking neon lights and perhaps a sandwich-board holder wearing a pig intestine costume or something because it's absolutely nondescript when you're driving past and I'm actually very surprised to see so many reviews - must be word of mouth visits because it sure as hell wouldn't be people going Hey check this Cambodian restaurant out that we're driving past
Drove by this restaurant so many time but did not know Yelpers love it so much
One thing I can say about this restaurant that I love
The general consensus about this place is the location is stunning but the restaurant is just OK
When you walk in you're greeted by wood walls vintage signs some that even light up this is the kind of place that influenced the cookie cutter crap on the walls restaurant du00e9cor
CPK is one of the first of many restaurants to open at Tempe Marketplace
While the restaurant is one of my favorites the new location didn't quite blow me away during a lunch time visit with some coworkers this afternoon
I would highly recommend Chen's Chinese Restaurant
Heavy on wood - both reclaimed and polished - constituting everything from the floors to the tables to the open rafters of the ceiling I was greeted quickly upon seating by a young man named Spencer who along with a female bartender were apparently the only persons working front of the house that afternoon and with the menu presented I spent a few minutes perusing as Pearl Jam played over head and with my decisions largely made before I even entered the door I had a full glass of water and my order placed by the time the song ended and progressed to Radiohead; to say the least I agreed with Praying Monk's recent nomination for best restaurant soundtrack
Once you figure out  who does and doesn't work there it is easy to realize that the place is always over staffed once again does the manager have no restaurant experience
If I had to put an analogy to this one - I would say that most restaurants are like watching a concert on tv and this place is like being in the front row at a great show
My last visit I waited 20 minutes and had to find the manager to get a server to come to our table and the restaurant was busy but not to the point that my party could be easily overlooked
Great place and highly recommend this restaurant
The place is huge and not really a restaurant but more of a night club
Marcellino had the quaintness of a family owned place combined with the experience and food quality of a fine restaurant
For a restaurant whose name sounds like a Coffee shop this place was pleasantly surprising
We like to order a little of everything and share when we try a new restaurant in order to give an accurate recommendation or decide to return
I always thought it was a unique special place and that the people that were in the photographs lived in there at one point and now probably haunted the restaurant from the hidden upstairs level how do you get up there
If you seek a quick place for some Hawaiian type comfort food this restaurant is pretty good
Oh judging by the lovely lady crawling up the pole in a karaoke room where the door was open from the outside of the restaurant -- that could be a REAL
This restaurant is located close to my husband's office so we've met there for lunch a few times and actually wish that it was closer to where we live as we would certainly frequent this place
This is an excellent family run restaurant with lovely food + service that will provide you with a completely satisfying meal at a good price and Yelpers should congregate to this location and partake in a  feverish frenzy of foodie bliss
Not a fancy place but comparable to most Jamaican restaurants elsewhere
Loved the name and thought we would check it out Had no idea it was a get seated and sit down restaurant
Our party of five visited the restaurant on a Friday night and we were seated promptly despite a fair number of guests

Only one person at the entire restaurant can place the order for bottled water
I've passed by this place dozens of times when I'm in downtown for a ballgame so a friend and I decided to give this place a shot during Arizona Restaurant Week
The place is probably more of a happy hour hangout for downtown workers than it is a sit-down restaurant but the atmosphere is still pretty cool
One of my daughters is allergic to peanuts so a Thai restaurant is not an ideal place to take her
We've eaten at all of the Thai restaurants in the East Valley and this place is still our favorite
There are quite a few restaurants located within the commons which is nice I love being able to walk around after a good meal
Here's an update because the buffet is out at lunchtime only now with a regular menu at dinnertimeThis old place continues to be one of my favorite restaurants in the Valley after 1 1/2 years & many visits
It is such a small place that I never noticed it while driving by but ever observant husband kept eyeing the interesting name and line that was outside of the restaurant
This place really is a gem among the typical trendy old town bars and restaurants
Overall I'm glad we finally got to check this place out and during Restaurant Week when prices aren't as brutal
The restaurant is very open which made the busy place quite noisy
If I didn't like trying new places I would go back to this restaurant much more frequently
I highly suggest you try this place out it is a guaranteed great meal but do not think you can stop at any Thai Basil instead they are not carbon copies like most restaurant chains
This was one of my favorite restaurants when I lived in Phoenix and one that I make sure to visit whenever I return
My family and I frequent this restaurant and highly recommend it to family and friends
Keep in mind my visit last night was during restaurant week but my previous visits didn't disappoint either
For a chain restaurant this place is pretty good
Think of this place is a Chipotle style restaurant that makes pizzas pastas and salads
It was the first place I went when I came to the neighborhood and everyone welcomed me to the area and the employees gave me tips about restaurants activities and really anything else I asked about
The place reminded me of any good Chinese restaurants back in LA YUM
I absolutely loved my first visit to this restaurant
Found this place on Yelp because of the high ratings of others so another couple my wife and I decided to give the odd-named restaurant a try
Other yelpers have done a great job describing the restaurant so I'll skip that and make some food recommendations
I loved the restaurant itself but honestly I was not completely impressed with the food
I love the different textures and openness of the restaurant
See that guy down below that's going to rate this place one or two stars solely based on the fact that it's a chain restaurant
Clue #1 that it must be an authentic and tasty restaurantSeeing the placed packed with Middle Easterns and Greeks
I visited this restaurant during the summer with a party of 8

The restaurant is also located right next door to the Phoenix Ambassador's office check it out if you're visiting the area and want to know places to go eat etc
I found this place on Yelp after searching for Mexican restaurants in the Sunnyslope area and was expecting a lot after all the rave reviews
It's a win for the rest of the bar/restaurants in the area until the space is leased to the next place
The ambiance is something unique as it looks like a big banquet hall not so much like a restaurant and certainly not what you expect for a typical Chinese place
Now I don't want to sit here and slam the place outright so I will give them this These were some of the freshest ingredients I've seen in a restaurant which was very nice
The friend who gave me the gift card recommended I go the the restaurant in 26th Street and Camelback rather than th one in Scottsdale which I live next to
I had visited the property once before a few years back when the restaurant on the premises was under different management; I was left with the impression that the hotel looked really cool and fun and I made a mental note to check it out sometime
for a chain restaurant this place really is spot on with a nice upscale feel
I had passed this place a couple of times and really wanted to visit mostly due to the outdoor seating and look of the restaurant
The restaurant appeared clean the staff was very friendly and as the place was mostly empty at the time we had our food a few minutes after orderings
He was pissed that there were 4 women standing outside of the restaurant we just spent a pretty penny at and if there was a place to park he would have gone in himself to complain to the manager
I don't often get over to this side of town but I was referred to this place by a friend who owns another restaurant nearby
It's always good to gauge a new restaurant by standard staples of the cuisine that's why my first orders at pizza places are pepperoni etc
Whose brilliant idea was it to place the sushi bar in the middle of the restaurant and to seat every sushi bar patron with a loud greeting in Japanese as they were led to the bar as if they were royalty
As a bonus the Al-Hana restaurant inside is a great place to grab a cheap but excellent meal during the trip
I've never had Mongolian stir fry in other restaurants b'c the only other place I've seen them at is at buffets and there's just other things to eat there
I kind of wanted to go some place else and wound up being S glad my friend picked this place When we pulled up I thought oh Im so not in the mood for ice ie expensive hotel restaurant its inside the Clarendon I was tired and not dressed for it
The place is a very small converted house and truly because of the size you feel as if you are there for a friend's homecooking rather than at a fancy restaurant
Lowdown Really greasy and bad tasting sandwichJust noticed that Lukes had opened inthe place of the greek restaurant next to paradise bakery
Two things really struck me about this place  the tasting menu portions are HUGE and the restaurant has an extraordinarily convivial let's-mingle-amongst-foodie-friends atmosphere
I doubt I will go back nor recommend this restaurant
It's more like a restaurant/bar/cantina kind of place
This places serves sushi and other goodies on a conveyor belt that goes around the entire restaurant
The restaurant was fairly busy so word is getting out because if you were just driving by you would not see this place
I come to this Vietnamese place and there are Mexicans working both front and back of the restaurant
It's a beautiful restaurant and having a place that serves healthy albeit somewhat pricey food is important in our fast food nation
Over all I'm inlove with this mex restaurant
I am a frequent visitor at popular restaurants I can handle the wait
Anywhoo It as an impromptu date night and we wanted to try out a new place and FEZ just happened to come up on a list of restaurants we were looking at
The place is an old house converted into a small restaurant
I went to the best pizza restaurant in phoenix and this place blew it away in taste atmosphere service and price
This is another Fox Restaurant Concepts eatery I'm a fan of most of their places so I've been wanting to check this place out since it opened a few months ago
I'll get the drama out of the way now and say unequivocally I love love love this restaurant
The staff was super friendly and I loved the actual restaurant
I searched Yelp for a highly recommended sushi restaurant and people highly suggested Hiro
I took my cookie and walked out driving up to Bell Road to McDonalds vowing never to eat at any restaurant that that douchebag Guy Fieri has ever visited
We came here on a Sunday morning on recommendation from the waitresses at Asian Hong Kong restaurant
I'm used to seeing big crowds outside of dim sum restaurants but this place was SO unorganized and chaotic
It sounds as though this place is a good breakfast stop but our dinner was definitely not up to par with what we've had at similar restaurants
I work in downtown Chandler and I must say that this restaurant is the most practical place to eat in the area
Restaurant week - Thursday night & the place was hoppin'
upon arriving i realized that it was the old pink taco space - i absolutely love that space and the layout of the restaurant
The beer selection was good - any restaurant that carries Red Stripe wins my love but they were out of it today so I went with Pacifico
This restaurant is a prime example of why places that have been around forever aren't necessarily the greatest places to eat
The place was busy mid week for a late lunch and that was a great sign that all was going well with this new concept because so many of downtown restaurants would have been empty this time of day
they make you feel welcomed and appreciative that you are visiting their restaurant
This restaurant is run by a large extended family and the place has a very convivial atmosphere
When she found out we had moved just a few months ago she was kind enough to write down her restaurant recommendations for us too
For those of you who are fans of modern concepts - you will adore the clean Zen-presentations and simplicity - individual salt/pepper dishes and homemade condiments ketchup for a Kobe Burger that give the placed a little higher image than its sister restaurant
So the mixture of very pushy service combined with tacos that were memorable in all the wrong ways make me hesitant to try this restaurant again when I can get really tasty Mexican food for way cheaper at other places in the East Valley
Although I''m reluctant to go to a theme restaurant inspired by an SNL sketch I found cheeburger cheeburger to be better than a theme restaurant with mediocre food I was here once before when Tempe marketplace first opened and was overwhelmed by the topping choices Think last time I had a burger with feta mushrooms and olives trying to imagine a Mediterranean    burger really what ended up happening was flavor overload that I couldn't really taste the burger so I decided to give them another try this time around I got 1/2 lbs burger sorry a pound is just too much food with cheddar jack bacon and sauteed mushrooms we ordered a half order of the best of both worlds which is a basket of fries and onion rings with a side of cheese  the fries are good very crispy well seasoned and appear to be fresh cut  or at least a very convincing fake the onions rings are very crispy with a light batter that almost takes on a yellow tone my burger was well prepared they use sliced whole mushrooms instead of pre sliced the bacon was crispy and the cheese was nice and gooey so all in all it was a pretty decent burger I must say my burger was a bit greasy I cut my burger in half to eat it and by the time I moved on to the second half  my lower bun had become one and fused with my burger pattyOverall my experience was good and I would go back but I don't see it being a frequent choice and not just due to distance the main attraction seems to be the wide variety of burger toppings and the build-your-own inspired menu despite the food being consistent and good it's nothing I haven't tasted before though if I ever get the urge for a pepperoni peanut butter coleslaw Sri racha burger I can sleep easier at night knowing I've now got that issue handled
I love restaurants that give you bread and butter
Went looking for a place to buy some fresh stuff to eat so I didn't gorge on all the great restaurant offerings in Phoenix and stopped here
This place is a small family owned Mexican restaurant common in CA if you're from there Maria is such as nice lady and the food is quite good and cheap
Susan and I patronized the Flagstaff location weekly for years and now we are fortunate enough to live in Gilbert and have the Gilbert restaurant to visit
I remember being sad when Lisa G closed her doors but I couldn't be happier with the restaurant that took her place
I really love this place for three reasons1 That nearly the entire restaurant is underground is really cool
Just an FYI most of the douche bags & bimbos they fear don't live here and only visit the clubs & a few restaurants and then they go home
The place is reminiscent of a 1950s drive-in restaurant  with shaded picnic tables abound in front of the counter
It was a goal of mine to hit up a new Dim Sum restaurant this year as opposed to the same amazing place we usually go to which is Great Wall on 35th Avenue and Camelback
very 1990's Chinese restaurant decor which I kinda love
To their credit they finished our order but the place heated up and filled with smoke from the grill the fans weren't working and by the end of the meal we couldn't see the back of the restaurant from the smoke
Both the bar area and restaurant feed out to the large patio which has mist system for summer and a nice fireplace for the cooler temps
The place is split between bar and restaurant- all the TV's are on the bar side FYI
The only thing I would add to the many reviews is that I recommend you study the menu on the restaurant's website prior to going so you understand that this menu is limited and different
I love this place because it's right next to my dorm and also it's one of the few Mexican restaurants that I've found that actually sells a Mole molay' dish chocolate and poblano chile's if I'm not mistaken
If you are looking for an old-school Sonoran style Mexican restaurant with a good assortment of foods on the menu this is the place
I usually do not eat at chain restaurants since i love trying out new places and seeing what other places have to offer
And I love the restaurant's devotion to its suggestively racist mascot a panda with a sombrero long mustache and ammunition sash Pancho Villa-style
The restaurant was setting up new tables shuffling people around and taking food to the wrong places while we are eating and other tables are barely getting their mismatched water glasses
This visit reminded me why I don't eat at chain restaurants
Since my visit I learned that this concept comes from restaurateurs Michael McDermott and Jason Merritt who have been involved with the development of numerous restaurants including the famed Kona Grill
Immediately this place felt like one of the Fox restaurants
But then again this isn't a family restaurant nor a place to take a date
I was expecting this place to be a restaurant but its TOTALLY more like a bar
This place has gotten really good reviews so I had to put this restaurant on my short list of places to check out
Feels like an authenic sushi restaurant not that I know what that means just doesn't feel like a glamarous overated place like you'd see in Scottsdale
Having lived on both coasts I'm always skeptical of going to seafood restaurants in landlocked states and have actually had some good experiences but this place was an EPIC FAIL
I do not recommend this restaurant at all
Chuy's is one of those places that doesn't quite qualify as a dive bar/restaurant but is close enough to count
I love the cozy ambiance of the entire restaurant but going down the stairs and into a basement in Phoenix is a rare experience--and this one in particular transports you to another place and time
All together a good restaurant I love this place
The restaurant was clean and casual and I loved my pineapple coconut raspado I opted out of the ice cream being added but may have to try it that way on my next visit
I'd say this place gets 3 1/2 stars for its taste which is a tad poised towards an americanized palette but nonetheless tasty it gets its other 1/2star for its cheap and unbeatable price in comparison to the average thai restaurant
I know I amaze even myself enough to visit a reviewed restaurant
Still the overall impression is of a place that's uncomfortably straddling the line between bar and restaurant
All in all a visit to Trader Vics reminded me of the hawaiian luau restaurant at Disneyland
My boyfriend and I visited for AZ restaurant week right away the old world spanish decor was lovely I loved the table in the little room we were sat in one side of the table had this nice big lush bench seat with a pillow- nice and relaxing
I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good cheap food
This place can be a bit deceiving when you are parking or even when you see the restaurant
He promised me that nothing but good things would be found in this small and darkly lit place  kind of got this feeling that I was in the restaurant scene from the godfather and  that I was not going to come out alive LOL
The du00e9cor is fun without getting into the whole chain restaurant kitsch and this place is HUGE
Guy Fieri of Food Networks Diners Drive In's and Dives visited the restaurant and the hubby and I were intrigued
I loved the interior like I do most FOX restaurants
The best part by far though was the owner there were only two people running the restaurant during our lunchtime visit
The main restaurant is a great place for groups however can be a little loud for intimate dates
Those two dishes alone almost redeem the restaurant for any other misgiving I ever had about the place
This place serves your usual Mexican-American style food but does not go over the top on portions like some other  restaurants of the same genre
I would say it would be a perfect place to come to watch ball games as they had a decent amount of LCDs around the restaurant
They recently added sushi to the menu which was odd to my friends since the place is a chinese restaurant
In a place where chain restaurants and fast food joints are king Pita Jungle only a local chain beckons - even though it's 7 miles away from the hotel I stay when I'm here for work
We had previously been to Rosita's place down the street and wondered how two Mexican restaurants could compete so close to each other
I'd like to visit the actual restaurant sometime soon
This place will definitely be added to my regular rotation of restaurants
This little place has more character in its little pinky that so many other restaurants in the Valley
We talked with the owner for a few minutes and he gave us some great restaurant recommendations
The only place where the Khmer food was better for me was Siem Reap but then it is perhaps a little unfair to compare a restaurant in the USA to what really is available in Cambodia
They also do take-out and unlike some places the take-out is just as good as if you were eating in the restaurant
I'd say my last visit to Macayo's was one of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had and it will be the last
I found that like many ice restaurants the place is pretty but the food was just OK
The shakes are amazing and almost too rich for a place of this caliber and really made Smashburger stand out as a restaurant/dining option
I thought I wrote a review on this place but we will try this again this place sits in a half empty mall but it is a great down home breakfast spot but they also do lunch and dinner Service is good wends day and Friday are fish fry night  which we gave a whirl as well it was good but being from Seattle we have a tough time finding good seafood except at sushi restaurants we frequent this place is well worth a try
A restaurant this painfully hip seemed slightly out of place in the small town of Scottsdale
The outside looks very old and the inside looks like it's a hip place due to the bar & restaurant but the hotel it's self was not impressive at all
I went to this restaurant for my birthday on the recommendation of a coworker- best recommendation ever
I love their bread they bring out of course not the best bread of all restaurants
When I visit an Italian restaurant for the first time I order either spaghetti with meat sauce or lasagna to form an opinion of basic pasta and sauce
This is yet another restaurant that my grandmother and I visited
A couple more places like this in an area begging for new young upstart restaurants and this side of town could be a bit cooler and hipper area
Although I think the place misses out on what's key the chief should focus on a better beef patty and not all the fixings there's so much that unique and done well at FEZ that I still walked away from an enjoyable dining experience with a desire to give the restaurant another try
So I yelped up this place and looked at their website and had to take my honey to this restaurant
The ONLY reason I give the restaurant 4 stars instead of 5 is that we'd love to see the food be local and organic
There are not too many restaurants where everyone at the table loved their food but it was the case this time
I loved that the owner walked the restaurant with a game of bingo
There's also an arcade attached to the restaurant it looked like it had tables as well so it'd be great for visiting with kids
Since I did say I try to find the positive I will say that when we made the restaurant aware of the hair in the salad they offered to replace it give us a pizza or give us our money back
And the food offered is all over the place from meatloaf and cheesesteaks to great dinner items you find in upscale dinning restaurants
The UglySorry staff and management I love you guys but pointing fingers does not keep a restaurant  clean
The complimentary bread is probably the best I've had in an Italian restaurant; very soft and the crust isn't too hard like most places
The restaurant comped us a ginormous dessert - flourless chocolate cake heavenly chocolate covered strawberries ripe not green like you get at other places and mountains of house made whipped cream
It's rare for me to give a place a low rating but My Big Fat Greek restaurant is nothing but gimmick anymore and has gone from bad to worse
A few days ago my favorite restaurant blogger Seth Chadwick wrote about a dim sum place with a twist - no carts
Sourcing top quality has been tough and on a several visits the restaurant was out of one thing or another
Visited this restaurant last weekend and while the food I had was good the service was slow and we had to wait forever for our check
Any time I'm asked for a recommendation to a Mexican restaurant this is the place I recommend
I loved everything about the restaurant but the waiter
Definitely would recommend it for any one who likes a little Cajun kick and something different from chain restaurants
Restaurant ~ Tacos Atoyac is small and not very appealing on the outside somewhat of a dive look but it's what's on the inside that counts and this place is no exception
I finally get back to town after my month-long trip and head out to eat only to be underwhelmed by a restaurant that everyone on this site loves
Fez was a great place before I knew Thomas and the world of Yelp and although those things make me like it even more now it is a solid restaurant to try out
This is one of the true Arizona restaurants and I recommend this place to anyone from out of town
I recommend making a reservation as this is a very small and very popular restaurant
Our favorite Chinese restaurant in Chandler Wangs on Ray Rd and Kyrene closed down over a year ago and we still haven't found a decent replacement
This was about the 3rd or 4th time visiting this quaint house turned restaurant and now is the time to YELP
I think people have a tendency to overrate this place because it is the only restaurant of its kind
Don't get me wrong the pasties are great but there are a few reasons why this place isn't a four star restaurant1 It's overpriced
The restaurant is very nice and above average for your normal pizza place around here
As one of my fave restaurant's in Scottsdale the Herb Box is the perfect place for a great patio and lunch
Hype the shit out of the place bribe/suck up to all the restaurant reviewers who convince the sheeple that you gotta go here if you're 'somebody' brown-nose the local celebrity crowd into coming there I'm sure they get treated much differently than us peons make the restaurant too small and get people to spend money at your wine bar while enduring the insane wait for a table
Hawaiian and Chinese cuisine with sushi prepared and served restaurant style but in a place that looks somewhat like a new dinner/fast food-ish
First of all I don't think it was stated enough it's closer to a fast food place than restaurant
Although not as authentic as some of my favorite small Mexican restaurants it is a great dining experience and someplace that I can bring friends and visitors
Not many places will say that since most restaurant in the Valley will fold less than 3 years and it has endured a good 20+ years
I love this place and it really is the only good Chinese restaurant in the area that's not super super casual
It would be nice if the restaurant wasn't so modern looking I love the traditional Chinese food places
This restaurant is great for people who love 'super healthy' food but not folks looking for healthy/normal food
The place feels like a whole in the wall restaurant with good food
We eat at a lot of fine dining restaurants and this place has a charm all its own that you don't find in new restaurants
It is an older restaurant that has been around a long time but I love the 'old' Chicago style feel of the place and the way the food is served
This happens from time to time with a lot of restaurants we visit so I can understand
Loved the way tacos are ordered just like at as sushi restaurant so they bring them to you as you want them
Overall this was a good restaurant but I would only come back when the place is less busy
Other than that the dinner was superb and I would recommend this restaurant for dates groups and business evenings
I have never given a 5 star rating to an Indian restaurant so far in Arizona and that's saying something already about this place
This place has everything on the grounds 6 swimming pools a water slide ponds the Gila River a boat taxi spa casino equestrian center golf courses a gift shop a deli/coffee shop a lobby bar and 4 restaurants
It only took me one visit to this restaurant to know that this is the real thing--the food was amazing the waitress close-lipped the prices perfect
Overall though I love this restaurant and I hope that my experience this past week is an isolated incident
When I'm in the area I'll have to check this place out again and would recommend the restaurant to anyone who likes Thai food
This place can't decide whether it's a restaurant bar Indian Casino the seating looks like poker tables or bingo hall
Was really disappointed that a place that calls themselves a resort didn't have room service or even a restaurant
This place reminded alot of those sea side restaurants
If you're looking for a nice restaurant with good food that has an American Tavern feel this is your place
What's great about La Tolteca is that it is a to go place a sit down restaurant and a bakery
I stopped by this restaurant yesterday because it was across the street from the Fry's I needed to visit the BoA bank inside
I like this place mainly because they are open early on Sundays & Saturdays and in walking distance to Breakfast Restaurants
Found this place because I was mad at my boss and was driving around and pulled in to try Essence Bakery and was distracted by the fact there was an Ethiopian restaurant in the same plaza
There are very few places to sit in or outside of the restaurant and even standing in line can get more than a little cramped
To encourage automobile sales and by extension their tires the Michelin Company begin to print free travel guides at the turn of the century with recommendations and ratings systems for restaurants hotels and attractions throughout France
The restaurant itself is a nice dimly lit almost wine cellar looking place
There's so many other decent Chinese restaurants to visit that this place must surely be on it's last leg
He asks that question every single time we go to a new restaurant and he's always got great recommendations
If in fact it's  true I will never visit this restaurant and will urge everyone I know to do the same as well
While on a short weekend trip to visit my son we looked up restaurants in Chandler to grab a bite to eat
I visited Restaurant Mexico the night before last with a friend who was craving Mexico City style
Cool atmosphere in a nice area of town - prices are pretty even with nicer sushi restaurants I've visited in any major city in other words a little higher than you'd typically see in a smaller town or in a place with less attention to decor
The way the restaurant is decorated is so different than most places around Tempe
I'm not vegetarian or vegan myself but I can definitely appreciate what a restaurant like Green can dish up to entice even the staunchest meat lover
This place basically has the same items as the restaurant namesake but in a to-go format
There's only a few tables inside this small restaurant so I recommend take out if you can
I had the tofu platter once figuring that a place billing itself as a healthful restaurant would pay particular attention to this darling of vegetarians
I would only recommend this restaurant as an option for those staying in the Arizona Grand and want the convenience of eating in the hotel
Definitely a place for Parrotheads or those into doing the trendy theme restaurant thing
It's a little place that feels like a converted wendy's or other fast food restaurant without much character
Anyhow the restaurant's dining areas are lovely but the hotel staff the bartender in the lobby area bar was rather cold - no smile not friendly in the least obviously we weren't hip  enough to be treated politely and the pre-lunch cocktail we had was greatly lacking in alcohol content
I LOVE this place- this family owned restaurant is one of my favorites
The same love and passion that they put into their restaurant in Mesa which has more of a country feel to it they've put into this very modern and edgy spin on breakfast and lunch
Maybe the place was filled with vampires waiting for nightfall like in Dusk till Dawn after all the decor has likely not changed in decades it even features tons of photos of past guests standing in front of the restaurant's sign when it had a different name and the street its on looks totally different but it's probably better it's not
For being a 24 hour Mexican restaurant this place is as good as it gets
Our family has been in the restaurant business for over 30 years and we have never found a place so highly touted yet so terribly disappointing
We visited this restaurant off the cuff we happened to see it as we were driving by
If you're looking for a red sauce kind of Italian restaurant lasagna meatballs spaghetti this is not the place for you
The edamame were great but the calamari had waaaay too much batter on them they were more like the calamari you get at an Italian American place than a japanese restaurant
I will start off by saying that my entire family loves this restaurant
It had been over a year since I last visited this restaurant
Paul Fleming is a respected restauranteur and rightly so based on my visits to his other kitchens
This restaurant was highly recommended to us - so much so that if we did not like our meal he would reimburse us
Even though I've only been to Sens twice it's slowly creeping up my list of favorite restaurants in Phoenix and will probably only continue to climb as I visit more often
Made me feel terrible for ever thinking of Digestif as a scene place & elevated it instantly up to the level of my very favorite restaurants in the state
This place is truly a compound with multiple buildings of hotel room suites 6 pools a few restaurants and an entire waterpark
We also love the meatball sandwich and if you like chicken caesar salads you have to try theirs it is topped with shaved chicken that has such great flavor its definitely better than your typical grilled chicken most restaurants have
I'll be looking for other bbq restaurants to fulfill any future bbq cravings because this place just didn't do it for me
The closest I've come is visiting local greek restaurants
The restaurant is very unique and it makes for a very neat place to dine at even though it can be hard to get a table at times and parking is always somewhat of a challenge
This is my fourth FOX restaurant and I love all of them
I also love any Italian restaurant that doesn't have the words meatball spaghetti and marinara on it; all these words are wonderfully absentI had the pappardelle mari e monti which was a spinach pasta served with scallops and a porcini tomato sauce
Whenever I come back home and visit Phoenix this is the number 1 restaurant I want to visit
They did comp us for the dish but I was glad that wasn't my first time in the restaurant or else we would have been robbed of frequenting the best thai place in the valley
I stay frequently at the hotel that houses the restaurant and consider this place one of the better downtown spots
I have to register for an account so I can show some support for MAXIM the Chinese name of this restaurant translates into Beautiful HeartAs a visitor from San Francisco CA Maxim is definitely a good find
I don't know why Yelp describes this place as coffee and tea when it's a full blown restaurant/sandwich shop
I'm from Chicago so I have pretty high standards when it comes to restaurant patios and this place rivals some of my WIndy City favorites
Maybe I'll stop by there again when I come visit my parents but if you're not in the area which you probably won't be unless you're visiting someone that lives in verrado or playing golf at raven there's really no reason for you to come to this restaurant
The family that owns and runs the restaurant is super friendly and really make the place inviting
With the opening of the underground walkway visitors are able to walk underneath Camelback to The Esplanade with its movie theatres and many more bars and restaurants
So when my old professor suggested we meet here I was astonished at the grandiosity of the place not unlike a colonial governor's palace on the Mexican Riviera Damn he said a Mexican restaurant pero este es un pinche EMBAJADA de la comida mexicana
Thai Paradise may not have the best location or with the best decorations but I find that of the Thai restaurants that I have visited that this is one of the better choices
With friendly service good food and reasonable prices I would recommend this restaurant to anybody
A small mom and pop's restaurant is definitely a popular place where people can dine discuss the day's happenings and even play games while waiting for their lunch or dinner
I would love it if Trattoria opened a restaurant in my neighborhood back home
But the wait is worth it and if you're not enjoying the company of your dining companions in the meantime enjoy great bar drinks awesome original art on the walls sports generally on the televisions and great upbeat ambience that makes it a fun restaurant to visit
I liked this place but it's hard for me to LOVE something that almost seems like an upscale chain restaurant
The setting of the place definitely has some cool decor but some of the people who frequent the restaurant are fairly lame
Blanco isn't a restaurant that I would frequent but I did enjoy my visit
I recommend this restaurant and Dick's Hideaway to everyone I know
loved wandering horse atmosphere it's a modern and open restaurant
At this other restaurant we ordered water ordered food felt like failures canceled our orders got up and left and finally found this place
While this place has a great ambiance and I love the patio there's nothing more annoying than a restaurant that serves a plate of food that doesn't come close to satisfying a normal person's appetite and it's a high price
This is restaurant is one of my favorite places to go for sushi
We never took him up on the offer because we frankly will never visit this restaurant again
Even for a new restaurant with lots of buzz on a Saturday night I thought this place was crowded
I will give some of the Thai dishes a try at my next visit but I have a feeling that the real standouts at this restaurant will be the Chinese dishes
Wildfish is a place I've wanted to try for quite a while and thanks to an excellent Restaurant Week menu I finally did
Carlsbat Cavern or rather Carlsbad Tavern is a campy New Mexcian restaurant/bar that was the ethnic concession made to me by my parents after pleading to go to at least one regionally appropriate restaurant during my visit
Made the trip into Scottdale to visit Yardhouse Craft Beer Bar & Restaurant to see what 125 Tap Beer Handles looked like
When we asked about the restaurant he gave us the history told us about the owners and said he had been there since it opened and he loved it
In Old Town Scottsdale with so many Breakfast restaurants or bars or sports bars you need to stand out- pick what type of place you're going to be and go with it
The owner even came out at some point to wish us a happy holiday& introduce himselfAbsolutely everything was taken care of for us as expected in a good restaurant ushered in chairs pulled out napkins placed water & wine topped off without even noticing
The restaurant is small with a lovely outdoor dining area - which is heaven in the winter
As a lover of all things German I spotted this place while first trying the neighboring Bavarian Point restaurant
and a new restaurant in its place there was a sidewalk sign stating Soft Opening 5pm
I may revisit this at a later time as they have only been open a week and my habit of reviewing brand new restaurants is kind of a shady practice
When I first heard about this place going in to this little space in  Scottsdale I initially thought it was going to be an Italian restaurant
When they do ask I'm generally hard pressed to pick out one particular restaurant from the five or six that I would consider the best places I've ever eaten
This is a great place for happy hour especially with a big crowd since they take reservations and let you order off the happy hour menu from anywhere in the restaurant
I know a lot of people probably have mixed feelings about this place because it's a chain restaurant
I have eaten at many mexican restaurants when I visit and this is my favorite
On my first visit of what will likely be many to come a group of us orderedKung Pao Beef and ChickenMongollion BeefSpicy ChickenYui Shan ChickenCrab PuffsEgg RollsAll of them were spot on the best I've had in the valley and I've been frequenting valley Chinese restaurants for 30 years
The guy conversed with me a little bit in-between serving the Buzz people about Sol y Sombra chef's new restaurant OverEasy which apparently was visited by some Yelpers and I wasn't invited
A new Thai restaurant was going to be in its place
We loved the available Happy Hours in the restaurants
No offense to The Living Room I will surely be back It's just that I'd really love to see a restaurant owner bring something fresh and new to the table
Considering the place is owned by a successful restaurant group Restaurant-America I assumed the place would be running on all cylinders by then
What we didn't get however was a visit from the owner who seemed to stop by every other table in the restaurant
For example despite the restaurant being very busy on a Friday night the hostess was lovely and polite and seated me very promptly
To me it's one of those places that I'd recommend trying at least once but there are definitely better Italian restaurants out there
Maybe it was our fault for not knowing that this place turned into a dance club I guess our first clue should have been when they carded us prior to entering the restaurant to eat but still
This restaurant has an opportunity to be a really lovely breakfast and lunch spot but someone needs to pay attention to these glaringly obvious shortcomings in basic restaurant hospitality
So M and I went to La Hacienda for restaurant week and loved it
I give Posh two stars because obviously the food matters more than anything else at a restaurant but I commend them for their terrific service and give them the benefit of the doubt that the night we visited was an off night
So it is the GO to place when you want to stay close to home and don't want the big chain restaurants nearby
Wait a restaurant with a seasonally changing menu and your entire plate comes in under 475 calories and it's not some weird little hippy place in a strip mall
Now as to the restaurant itself the place is beautiful
It also made me feel better that this restaurant is a sister restaurant to Sushi Roku in Los Angeles one of my friends' favorite places in LA
See when I was a little kid stupid place was an Indian restaurant called Gaylords in San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf because back then it was one of the only Indian restaurants in the entire Bay Area yes the irony that there was a restaurant called Gaylords in San Francisco that had nothing to do with gays or lords has not escaped me
Indian restaurants aren't supposed to break your bank but this place does it with panache
The restaurant was really quiet tonight as most downtown places usually are on Monday nights so we got quick friendly service
If you've had a wild night at a nightclub and you're looking to get some brunch the next day with a friend to share the details this restaurant is not the place to do it
This place is like a Panera Bread or Dickey's BBQ one of those chain restaurants where you order at the counter and they bring your food to you your table
If you love authentic Italian food in a festive holiday atmosphere La Stalla is the restaurant to try
I love steamed cabbage but since  most restaurants tend to overcook cabbage La Stalla stole my heart
I definitely wouldn't recommend the restaurant
Love and definitely recommend this restaurant - can't wait to go again
It doesn't seem practical to visit a casino just for a good meal but I think Willows Restaurant in Casino Arizona is well-worth the trip
Great restaurants if you want to eat better chains include Cheesecake PF Changs Morton's Tommy Bahama's Restaurant as well as smaller trendy places
I would definitely consider visiting this restaurant again
On the positive side they are friendly the service is good the place is clean and it's also relatively nice for a strip mall Chinese restaurant
It felt really tacky to complain but hey -- when was the last time you had a restaurant charge you for the little container of bread they place down in front of you before you dine
The menu was expensive which made me think that it was a fancy place but it turns out that the food was expensive because it was a restaurant inside a hotel
Apparently the shish-kebob lamb is real but may taste pressed or look unreal or something which must be common in various restaurants because this is the first place he's found what seemed to be real lamb meat
Being that this is a Mexican restaurant beloved by locals- you will hear Spanish laughter English and sometimes a combo of  the three
I took one of my friends to this restaurant when she visited from out of town
To be honest I visited this restaurant a couple of years ago so I couldn't tell you 100% what I had to eat
The place has the feel of a number of restaurants I've been to in Mexico
It really is more of a grilled food place then a Mexican restaurant
So we avoided the restaurants here after our 2 payouts and used yelp to find a super great taco place one exit up the freeway
If you want an authentic Szechaun restaurant travel down to Tempe to Wong's Place on Baseline Road off of I-60
All and all a good alternative to the chain monster restaurants that dot Scottsdale and a nice local place to take the fam
As Jennifer P already mentioned it is not super-close to anything particularly nice or interesting except for The Farm at South Mountain which is literally next door and features a great breakfast eatery a decent sandwich place and a oft-written-about dinner restaurant serving cuisine that features locally grown and sustainable ingredients but is definitely centrally located and convenient by freeway to downtown/central Phoenix and Tempe and close to South Mountain for hikers
I pulled into the parking lot not expecting much from a place called baghdad restaurant in Arizona but what the heck right
I judge a Mexican restaurant by how their rice and beans are because if they care about those items then there is usually a lot of love in the food
I also love a good dive restaurant too so I was excited when I heard about this place
i saw 4 1/2 stars on this restaurant  so instead of going to my neighbor hood sushi restaurant  with yaki soba on my mind i decided to try this place i showed up at 1130 a m  i was the only person there when i walked in the owner handed me a menu i went to a table and had a seat i went over the menu 3 or 4 times he sorta asked me if i was ready to order from behind the front desk i guess he did not wat to walk to my table to take my order  i asked him if he had yaki soba  he said no and left it at that so i ordered the lunch special w/chicken katsu the piece of chicken was maybe 3 oz piece 5/6 tempura battered vege a shrimp and a pot sticker and a small salad  6
50  he brought it to my table and left and returned to the back of the restaurant when i finished i went to the front desk he seamed ancious to cash me out but i ordered a side of pot stickers he brought those out and set them on the table as my glass of water was empty he never offered to re fill it  it is now noon and the place is still empty NOT A SOUL hmmmm I finished the pot stickers which were weak at best went and paid a rediculous 12
Leaving Big Lots at 30 minutes after we placed our order we proceeded to put our purchases in the vehicle and headed back to the restaurant to pick up dinner
On arriving back at the restaurant I was told that since I left before lodging my dissatisfaction nothing would be done about the order I placed as I might have peeled toppings off to express my dissatisfaction
Salvadoreno definitely stands out based on its uniqueness it's 1 of 1 restaurant serving Salvadorian cuisine in Mesa and accounts for 3 of the 5 noted Salvadorian places in Phx
I grew up in Arizona and always enjoy visiting to enjoy the great restaurants
Food I would say is good it just seems like the typical big box franchise Italian restaurant that looses that special touch you find in the mom and pop type of places
They continue to call me and harrass me with recorded messages to visit this restaurant
I think I have to give this place the nod as my favorite restaurant in Phoenix
The patio areas of the bar and restaurant also connect together outside which gives the place a much more spacious feel to it
They do not hesitate to tell when they have a less than stellar experience yet every one of them loved the food and loved the restaurant
Seems like common sense now but how many times have you walked into a restaurant with less than 10 people in the whole place and then walked away disappointed
This place has a lot going for it in terms of atmosphere and the food is like other Sam Fox restaurants consistent and pretty good
In sum the food is pretty good and the atmosphere makes this place an appealing restaurant to return to however the sub-standard service hit-or-miss drinks/chips can taint an otherwise good experience
I like hole in the wall places that you'd never expect to be great restaurants and Raimondo's is just that
That's actually my favorite part about this place - it's not stuffy at all but the service is akin to what you'd find in a more traditionally uppity restaurant - ably dancing between cloying and laissez-faire - in other words there when you need them and non-existant when they should be
Certainly not a place to go when you have to impress someone as it is clearly meant to be a comfy family-style restaurant
Everyone I've taken here has loved it and I will swear by this restaurant
In Scottsdale I normally have my guard up at upscale restaurants but this place totally put me at ease
Then a Russian friend told me about a Russian-Uzbeki place he heard about called Samarkand Restaurant and naturally I went and he came along with me
This was one of the worst dining experiences ever at a restaurant with a pedigree this is not the freaking Waffle House oh by the way I have been to The waffle house and it was better than this place
What I liked most about this place is that it is so different from everyday restaurants
But ultimately it's the food one goes to a restaurant for and in this the place fails
It almost felt like it was a restaurant that just happened to serve sushi but everything else about the place doesn't match
First of all I love small family owned type places and I try to patronize their restaurants over large chains
I would love to offer a positive review for a grass roots local joint but my third and final trip to this restaurant cements my initial impression - mediocre at best and not worthy of another visit
I'm sad that I won't be close to this place anymore since I'm transplanting from Tempe to Phoenix but when I do head down that direction I'll definitely hit up Wong's if I have a hankering for Chinese it totally trumps any other Chinese restaurant in the area
She says the pizza here is even better than any place in Italy or at Mario's restaurant
I love the atmosphere the music and how intimate the restaurant is
This place embodies all of the problems that can befall a hole in the wall restaurant and none of the charm
I'd like to give this place more than 3 stars because the food is pretty good but the uncleanliness of the restaurant prevents me from doing so
This place is similar to a lot of other Mexican restaurants you will find throughout town
Restaurant reviewA simple breakfast place that goes beyond simple on every level
I'd certainly recommend Macayo's restaurant but if you sit down and your server's name is Lisa - head for the hills
If you are a fan of independent unique restaurants you should like this place
I would not recommend this restaurant and suggest you stay far away
The owners of this place are the former owners of NYPD Pizza so they have the restaurant experience
It's one of those hole in the wall type restaurants but sometimes I think that's the best places for real authentic oriental food
It's a restaurant you probably would visit when you are hungry all the other restaurants are closed and you happen to be in the neighborhood
Although we've never sat down for a meal in the restaurant I highly recommend Pei Wei for take-out
Me and my wife go to this restaurant at least once a week and love it
This place reminds me of a outdated concept restaurant in Downtown Vegas
Again a safe nice place if you are looking for an americanized mexican restaurant
I've had terrible or mediocre experiences with some Thai restaurants in other cities but this place is excellent
However when I come to a new sushi restaurant I love to test the unique rolls and dishes of the place and thats where Stingray fell short
There are more and more thai restaurants popping up that I am willing to try but it is nice to know that I will always have this place in my back pocket
I had never sampled Thai cuisine though I had always been interested in doing so and when I discovered a Thai restaurant near my house last week I thought it'd be a great place to have dinner with the fam
If I owned this place the only thing I would do would be to add regular Ice Cream to the dessert menu but that's the same knock on most italian restaurants
And I say this having spent 3 weeks in Italy a short time before our visit to the restaurant
I have recommended this restaurant to so many people and I don't think anyone has ever been disappointed with the food
A friend of mine told me a couple of months ago that this was one of the restaurants she liked to visit
I just wish there was a second location closer to me in North-Cen Phoenixmaybe somedayPhoenix doesn't have a ton of Vegan restaurants but this place rivals other Vegan restaurants in much more Vegan friendly cities
I know we'll try Great Wall again and here's hoping that someday some restaurant can replace our beloved Big Wong
[can't even describe the taste but were yummy]Plus the restaurant is such a cute and trendy place to have dinner
The biggest gripe I have with this place is that it's a cafeteria style setup but the prices are more in line with a sit down restaurant
For some reason this restaurant shows up under two different places on Yelp
Located literally on the corner of 7th Avenue & Osborn this Mexican restaurant has great salsa which I believe is very important to any chips & salsa lover
I love that they have family history and the store layout is more of a grocery with tables shoved into nooks and crannies vs a restaurant layout
If you love good high alcohol beer on tap they are one of the few restaurants who carry Chimay on tap
Bottom line I do recommend this restaurant to everyone must pick a not so busy time
I was feeling nostialgic and only wanted to experience a restaurant that I used to visit with my mother with my child and her daddy and now I can say that I have and will probably never return
Also I recommend checking out their 'sister' restaurant Cyclo in Chandler
After hearing this restaurant was on Diners Drive-ins and Dives I suggested we take our friend here for her birthday because she LOVES Italian food
This is one of those family restaurants that believe in throwing some old junk and memorabilia on the walls and think it's a fun local place
It's the kind of place that once was common but was replaced in the last 20 years by novel and trendy restaurant concepts of other sorts
All in all a good place to go during lunch if you are over in this area and you want to avoid all of the restaurant chans that populate this area
During my 2 1/2 days in Phoenix at the Valley Ho I visited their restaurant twice
I was in the restaurant business myself for many years and love to eat out
I will always recommend any of the Fox Restaurant Concepts restaurants to any and all my friends/enemies
Unpretentious like sitting in a restaurant somewhere deep in Mexico this place has all the charm of well a shitty little restaurant deep in Mexico
although the restaurant LOOKS really pleasing they do not have enough ventilation in place to handle the copious vapors emanating from all the hot pots in action
In any case it's not my restaurant and I appreciate that Tediberto's is open in the first place
I guess this place appealed to me because it was a new restaurant to me and I figured to give it a chance
The restaurant itself Every time I've been here the place has been decently busy
We were visiting Arizona from CA and wanted to have the highest rated yelp restaurant in Tempe
My friend was waiting for me on the patio and it was a pleasant surprise; I kept staring back into the restaurant and gawking at the scene this place is really beautiful
Today was my first time visiting this restaurant which is conveniently located less than a mile from my new beau's home
The place cleared out all at once at 830 good for next time so we can have the restaurant to ourselves
We sat outside and ate our lunch in the patio/restaurant type place which was closed
I stumbled into this place while waiting for another local restaurant to open for breakfast
As with their sister restaurant Rokerij the smell of burning wood permeates the place
For a chef who has developed quite a large collection of restaurants across the country his places never disappoint
I love it when Italians work at Italian restaurants
They were so NICE to us while we ordered and waited for our food and when they brought it to us we ended up in a great conversation about the love of food and how much they care about what they are doing in their restaurant
I've heard good things about the restaurant downstairs but I stopped by the upstairs hookah lounge with some friends one night and was definitely put off by this place
i love small businesses like this - it makes me feel better knowing my money is going to support a family owned small business rather than a sweatshop of a chain restaurant
Decor of the place was nice and and low key; starting to wonder if all Thai restaurants use the same Interior Designer
We had a big group when we went but it really wasn't a problem for this place because it's such a large restaurant
This is one of those restaurants that has been on my list of places to try so when a friend suggested meeting here for lunch I was ready
If you have children and still enjoy going to fantastic places for date night with your other half or like going to nice places with a big family this restaurant can definitely hold on to its class and maintain the family size
Another aspect of this restaurant I loved was their cocktails
This place is a little hard to find because the address is on Rancho Vista Dr but the front of restaurant faces Scottsdale Blvd
As others have stated we walked through the kitchen to enter the restaurant and WOW what a clean place that was filled with cheerful workers who greeted us as we walked in
I love restaurants who give you happy hour prices on your drink even if you ordered them at 558pm when HH ends at 6pm
After being seated in the restaurant I can see why seating is an issue this place is a converted small house and the dining area is limited
The service was possibly the worst I've ever had and my family is in the restaurant business and I've eaten at a multitude of places
It's really beautiful to walk the grounds of the hotel and this restaurant is one if the best parts of the whole place
The service is absolutely perfect - balancing that reserved resort restaurant demeanor with the upscale casual ambiance of the place
Honestly I love that downtown has neighborhoods with character unique shops and trendy hold up on their own restaurants to boot
The interior was dark and homey like some kind of hunting lodge with large booths and a Fireplace separating the two side of the restaurant and bar
Ok so I was teetering between a 3 star and a 4 star review but I decided for the restaurant week price or the sunday supper price this place is great
The restaurant had a great look although it's decorated like one of those inexpensive places without servers
One thing that was distracting was the restaurant seemed to retain sound well and the place was loud even with the doors open
A bar and restaurant opened at Tempe Marketplace that differentiates itself from the typical outdoor mall chains-Thirsty Lion Pub and Grill the first location in Arizona with only two additional ones in Oregon

The decor is old and homey this place could use a restaurant makeover utilizing part of the current decor  modernizing it  EXPANDING THE BAR and DRAFT BEER LIST and using FRESH INGREDIENTS

i feel like when looking for restaurants on here if i see a three star place i'm likely to avoid it
anyway we'd passed the sign for this tiny strip mall restaurant and decided to head back and give an unknown place a try
The restaurant was small but felt roomier because of vaulted ceilings and cleverly placed mirrors
This place is like the Yoda of Phoenician restaurants in that it reminds you that Size matters not
The best part of the restaurant is the atmosphere it's inviting well lit clean entertaining there are 3 HD televisions in the place and family friendly
Now Vietnamese restaurants aren't known for their service but this place was amazingly bad
Parking is a problem because the restaurant doesn't have enough so there is spillover into the local neighborhood

The place is a little pricey but Barcelona's is easily my new go-to restaurant in Scottsdale
Anyway lots of restaurants and the swankier shops this is the place to check out some top-tottie as well
In general it's not a place I would immediately go to again if I were at the Arizona Center since I want to try the other restaurants they have first but it's a solid choice if you're wanting something familiar
Usually I love to sit at the bar but we all didnt want to have a yelling conversation the entire night so we moved into the restaurant area much quieter but still busy
Do yourself a favor and visit this excellent little restaurant
On the other hand in a city full of restaurants converted from houses this place blends in
I highly recommend this restaurant and I can't wait to try it for dinner

I hate chain restaurants but when this place is too crowded I end up at a crappy chain
I did have pho from another Vietnamese restaurant and it was ok pretty much flavorless but I tried it from here and I totally fell in love

The restaurants and grounds as well as the meetings rooms are what kept this place for me from getting a one star

This is the perfect restaurant if you love Sushi
This is a great restaurant that I highly recommend
I love that it used to be a department store and is now a chic restaurant
this is American Chinese food and this is AZ so I am grading on a curve and I am giving this place an automatic 1-star bump for great service something for which I am usually deducting stars from restaurants in the area
I think I had high standards for this place before I even set foot in the restaurant just b/c the name sounded so delish unfortunately that's where all the magic stopped
All of us Zonies know that a really great authentic Mexican restaurant almost always begins with a Mexican woman's name This place is very good for what it is it's a modern Mexican joint

this place is so much better than the myriad of stupid Chinese chain restaurants or nasty take-out type places
Forgive me if I am wrong but I think sunglasses should not be worn by wait staff at a restaurant especially for brunch if you are trying to make a statement that the place is as classy as Scottsdale thinks it is

I am biased since this place has been one of my favorite restaurants for years

It was excessively noisy and the bar definitely took priority over the restaurant aspect of the place
But I definitely would not go back to throw down that kind of money at a place that reminded me of an airport restaurant
And if you're a tourist probably a good place to still check out since theres alot of restaurants & such

This place is a great little hole-in-the-wall type of joint where you can go for good food as long as you can stomach the neighborhood and the dive-ish look and feel of the restaurant

One more experience like the last and I will most certainly resume my near constant appearance at this lovely restaurant

It is the type of restaurant where you place your order at a counter find a place to sit and then they bring your food to you
This isn't the place to go for a sit down restaurant experience though
Honestly this place never held the special plate in my heart that it does for some people I know even when it was one of two Italian restaurants in the small Illinois town I was raised

This is a great restaurant if you love meat and cheese
In his defense however I did have a few questions about the cut of beef I chose and how I might like to have it cooked and he did seem knowledgable about that but in my experience with a restaurant with this kind of reputation he should be offering us recommendations and telling us a little bit about the aging process dry or wet
When we arrived at 630 we were the only ones in the restaurant and had the place to ourselves until almost 8pm when several other groups rolled in
Upon the next visit requested by my girlfriend we were abrupbly told to leave the restaurant by the owner because we were rude according to Mr
Teens may go just for for Borders Books and Coffee Plantation and maybe dreaming a bit in Sharper Image while they play w/the robots By the time they get their own place they'll be exploring Pottery Barn and Williams and Sonoma and maybe taking their friends to the restaurants and bars up above
So for all of these reasons I do not foresee us returning to this restaurant in the near future unfortunately because there really are some great aspects of this place
I love it when a restaurant has good rolls or bread to go along with your meal and I didn't care for the rolls bread was tastless and too much seasoning on top

i love the restaurants atmosphere it's a small family owned joint surrounded by brick walls making it a comfortable kick back spot to get your grub on

I highly recommend this restaurant for people that like trying different foods and are willing to experience what the world has to offer if you don't like spices curries and different vegetables this place is not for you
Joe's Farm Grill is everything that other restaurants should strive to become and I HIGHLY recommend you go
This is not the type of place that you expect to find among the chain restaurants in Scottsdale
As a general rule I steer clear of chain restaurants across from shopping malls but I must admit this place has got some seriously delicious seafood

After visiting approximately 15 or so sushi restaurants in the valley on several occasions I've put Sakana located  in East Mesa on the top of my list

There are four pools and two restaurants free WiFi and a place in the lobby to print boarding passes
We went here on a Saturday night assuming the place would be full of questionable characters because the restaurant's location isn't in the best part of the city Buckeye and Central and at night on a Saturday we were a little worried about safety

Vintage 95 in the Old Town Chandler area replaces what was an embarrassingly bad short lived asian restaurant
Albeit it is JUST off the freeway - but so are a LOT of them around the country meaning there are times when the place is insanely full and the wait is far more than I am willing to wait for just about ANY restaurant - and I have eaten at a LOT of them around the country
The place is oddly named though -- they're really not a pho shop at least not in the sense of what I usually see at similarly named restaurants here in OC
The Breakfast Club is a trendy little restaurant located right in Old Town Scottsdale so be advised that this isn't the place you come looking like crap after rolling out of bed
I love the Carlos Santana inspirations all throughout the restaurant
I assumed the place was a counter service-type restaurant but I was pleased to find out that it was a bit classier than that having full table service
As good as the food was at Malee's and as much as my wife and I appreciated the ambiance of this restaurant on a rainy night corner table next to the fireplace nicely dim lighting the service was above and beyond what we could have ever expected
We are always wary of trying new places for Indian cuisine because we are soo often disappointed but this restaurant was a very pleasant surprise

This place is a definite must see as it is everything restaurants in up-and-coming neighborhoods should be
I haven't eaten in the main part of the restaurant but I would not recommend the sushi bar
This is certainly a special occasion restaurant - so my advice is to FIND that special occasion and visit Mastro's Ocean Club

I would recommend this restaurant though it may not be the best value for what you get
If you're craving for Korean and must have it and happen to be in the area it's a descent place to eat it but I prefer Hodori Restaurant
Add this to your list of favorite local mom and pop ethnic restaurants to take out of town guests it's one of those unique places that my return visitors tell others about and ask to be taken back to
I had high hopes for this place and it is really too bad because I love to support the Phoenix area restaurants especially a Caribbean one and I had already been to the adjoining Rum Bar and loved the drinks but the food was bad
This place was below mediocre first of all it had a very distinct smell in the whole restaurant and it was not a very appetizing one that's for sure
The high end restaurant in the place can't remember name is good but VERY pricey and with strange decor I understand that is subjective some people are really into the Frank Loyd look
We asked for an upscale restaurant and we kept getting recommended the TGI Fridays across the parking lot
Well in this case a couple of visits for Saturday lunches proved that I was wrong - this is a small restaurant that creates big wonderful flavor
Ruth Chris why does your food have to be so average and underwhelmingThe restaurant is very nice inside and they have a great outdoor patio for drinks when it is nice outIf you go ask for Bruce he is the best server that I can remember having for any restaurant - was exceptional and I dine out at many high end placesHaving not been to a Ruth Chris in 4 or 5 years it was time to give it another shot i remembered the food being very average and being underwhelmed by the steak which was the case again - The steaks were cooked correctly I feel their steaks are bland especially compared to other chains like MasterosThe desserts were very good and the highlight for us both the sin cake very dark chocolatey and the bread pudding with raisensWon't be going back however the location and the service are fantastic so if you do enjoy Ruth Chris steaks you will be happy here - go see Bruce and he will make sure you have a fantasic time as we did even though the food wasn't up to our level of expectation
Went there last night for AZ Restaurant week and LOVED it

This restaurant has replaced Saigon as my Vietnamese restaurant of choice in the Chandler area
ORIGINAL REVIEW updates belowThis place is everything you want in a neighborhood Italian restaurant family-owned decent if not giant portions it's TERRIFIC
Pita Jungle on Apache is the kind of place I want to love art on the walls specials under $10 good location a hip vibe and an eclectic and healthy menu but due to poor service mediocre food and other better restaurants  in the vicinity I can't bring myself to recommend Pita Jungle on Apache whole heartedly if other options are available
It is not your typical Italian restaurant so if you are looking for the standard Italian menu this is not the place for you
I loved everything about our dining experience from the service to the meal except compared to the many restaurants I've eaten at I thought it was over-priced even for the high-quality of their food
From start to finish we loved this restaurant
they are slow but when you get the chance to see your waiter they are nice I recommend this restaurant it's A-OK
I've gone twice with someone who LOVES seafood and her favorite restaurant is Red Lobster Ultimate Feast every time
There were only a few other people in the restaurant whereas the Firehouse Subs place a few stores down was jam packed
I typically don't write restaurant reviews but this place is such a train wreck i had to
The place was relatively packed for an east valley restaurant at almost 11pm

The restaurant started by a guy from San Francisco is only in like 15 places around the world
Love the ambience and open feel of the restaurant especially with the open wall to the outside
As a non native to Phoenix this place strikes me as one of those restaurants - every city has at least one - that represents a slice of local flavor and history
Overall i really have enjoyed my experiences at this restaurant and would recommend this and any other of the Fox Restaurants to anyone
This place is another Chipotle styled fast food Mexican restaurant brought to you by the owners of Delux and Zen32
Would definitely recommend for dining in as the restaurant food itself was still very good and if you're having a party or wedding this is the place to pick for catering
I wont' be returning  to this place anytime soon -- with some many other great choices i'm sorry my friedn chose this restaurant
The atmosphere of this restaurant may make you question your decision to eat here because it very obviously used to be a Yoshi's/Kyoto Bowl style place but I'd encourage you to ignore it
Slowly after a couple minutes I saw a ballet place and a quaint courtyard leading to the restaurant
Lovely decor hip urbane with the wood fire oven the crux of the restaurant was a wonderful sight to behold
I'll always take family there when they come visit PHX and we'll spend time walking around through the veggies growing next to the restaurant and then to the little shops selling plants jellies books etc
I really didn't feel like driving anywhere hence the whole reason for calling the restaurant in the 1st place
I love all of Johnny's restaurants and this one is no different
There are two things that set this place apart from most other dim sum restaurants in America never mind just in Phoenix
They are one chain restaurant that you can rely on to be delicious no matter what location you visit
After reading the existing reviews of this place and knowing that it's Carlos Santana's restaurant I was more than a little leery about trying it out
I love the fact that the food isn't your typical Mexican restaurant menu- they add their own touch to the dishes enhancing the entree rather than turning it into some odd fusion meal
If I were only judging this place against against other restaurants in the Phoenix area then I would have given it 2
I give it a 1 star because I am comparing this restaurant to the many others I have visited and base if off the entire experience from start to finish
in general this placed sucked service was poor the food was garbage and in general even though this place is huge it truly is like a hole in the wall shit bar restaurant
I hope this place is here for the long-haul because we could use more unique restaurants that fill an open niche in this case haute Latin American
Now as you all know with my review of Rito's Mexican restaurant i am not a Mexican food lover
Loved it - best restaurant experience I've had since I moved here three years ago
LOVE LOVE LOVE the Joe's line of restaurants
Went here because I love Joe's Real Farm Grill and wanted to see if his 3rd restaurant in Gilbert would hold up
Anyway I don't know if I would come back here especially given that I live so far away from the restaurant; However if you live around the corner it's a decent place to try
Restaurant ~ there has plenty said already about this place on Yelp and the pics are a slide show for you to enjoy
There are several more restaurants or cafes in the area that are good places to go but MacAlpine's is the one that will keep bringing me back over and over
The restaurant was pretty full when we came in at about 7 but we were immediately given a place to sit
When I visit a place for a week I generally only eat at any given restaurant once so I can be sure to try as many places as possible
A great day for lunch and I fully recommend eating in this part of the restaurant if you have the opportunity
I would recommend arriving about 45 mins before your just before sunset reservation so you can sit in the lounge area outside of the entrance to the restaurant and have one of the original creative cocktails
Unfortunately this restaurant is closest to our office so am often dragged here by fellow workers and visitors
Ok I don't like to give places 5 stars often especially on my first time at a restaurant but Upper Deck/Blitz was great place to watch the UofA game
Yes I know they had nothing to do with the restaurant but this is my yelp review and if I want to give them 5 stars because I love their customers I can
I think about half of my reviews are based on Greek restaurants so I certainly had to check out this joint that was within a few miles of my place

This place has been added to my favorite restaurants in Phoenix
Blackberry Yelp - restaurants nearby - helped me find this great little Thai place
I used to love going to Houston's at the Esplanade - even my 3 year old son said it was his favorite restaurant
Believe me I hate kids in restaurants too but it's 600pm and if it wasn't for my friend and his kids eating these mediocre $20 pizzas the place would be dead so sweetheart yes you with the grimace lighten up
However because of the Yelp recommendation and the fact that it seemed the only decent restaurant anywhere near the Embassy Suites I decided to take 3 work colleagues to Yasu
It was also very difficult to take the lid off of the trash can in the men's room and to be clear the ease or difficulty of doing so is not one of my usual criteria for judging a restaurant but it was so difficult I thought it worth mentioningOvverall I would definitely recommend this place and I would definitely come here again
A restaurant cannot survive if it is only respected for its charming building or place
I expected a lot more class from a place that bills itself in their own words Doc's Place is a restaurant and bar featuring a jazz music lounge
If you're a regular at chain restaurants you'll probably think this is a cute place call me a snob whatever
For coffe lovers- try the Viet coffee - it's brew French style = Do not come to Da Vu00e0ng expecting a clean restaurant and good service- because you will be very disappointed
I would recommend if they can't make their own to consider using the 'My Nanas' chips or another type which is more consistent with Mexican restaurants
There were two reasons I did not rate it a 5 star;  1  the restaurant is clean and nice looking but a bit crammed with tables - in addition to the conversation I had with my family I got to enjoy the conversations of the people on the tables to the right and the left of me and  2  Although the prices are not bad - the place is not cheap $10 to $14 not including tip and tax or so for a meal including a glass of kool-aid and it sort of seems like the sort of food you should be bragging about how much food you got for the money
I saw a sign in the restaurant that recommended my choice but it was definitely a let down
It's your typical fast casual Mexican joint and judging by all the chain stores/restaurants in the area this place is a good bet you'll get a good meal
After spending a long time on my to-try list I finally decided to pay the restaurant a visit just a few months ago
I love the close proximity to great restaurants even though it can get pretty difficult to find a good parking spot on weekends
I still thing going to the restaurant to experience the organ and bring friends or visitors is a must
I love Italian food so  I want to feel without even looking at the food that I'm in an Italian restaurant
I point this out because it seems like a lot of other reviewers think that anyone who doesn't like this place or the owner is an unsophisticated country bumpkin or a chain restaurant freak
This place is a self serve restaurant
We loved the hotel and loved the restaurant
It's a very small restaurant - the kind of place you'd drive by a hundred times without noticing in a sort of marginal neighborhood   Once inside you almost feel like you're dining in someone's home dining room
Other than that I love this restaurant
Of all the restaurants I've been to that have offered such delectable treats this place offers the best ones by far
I love the atmosphere of the restaurant/bar and the servers are super attentive
com/ I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you are dining with more than one person so that you can try a variety of their Tapas dishes and share a pitcher of Sangria
This place has the culture the food and the beer to be the perfect quintessential Tempe restaurant
Even though I was not totally impressed by the living room-looking speak easy it was still a fun and different way of getting drinks so I do recommend at least trying some of their drinks once because they serve different drinks upstairs from the ones down in the restaurant
This place brings back so many memories of what used to be very popular restaurant's back in the day ~  the buffet/cafeteria's
Absolutely love this restaurant and for so many reasons
I frequently shop at the great Lee Lee market and have often eyed this restaurant I thankfully had some time while waiting for some watch batteries to be replaced at the adjacent jewelers to eat lunch at Hop Kee
I could be a chain restaurant snob and rip this place apart but I can't
-Looks like a fast-food tex-mex place but it is a casual sit-down full service restaurant
But for now they'll be happy to welcome anyone who wants to visit their quaint restaurant on Broadway Road
People at the bar were friendly as well and I ended up chatting with one couple as they recommended other restaurants to try during my stay
Tempe is full of chain-restaurants and Four Peaks is the one really special place in town

A chef at another restaurant in Scottsdale suggested this place and for that I am grateful
After my birthday was basically ruined on my last visit to Fogo the manager of the restaurant personally contacted me to apologize and offer to make it up to my family
You know how classic diners and decor are trendy now and places are trying to make their restaurants look like they came through a time machine
I only had their catered sandwiches and salad before this is the first time for the real restaurant experience and I fell in love with it
Its obvious that Phoenix residents are so used to eating at strip malls with their chain restaurants that this place impresses them
When I first walked into the place and stared at the menu I was frightened that I had entered a vegan restaurant
Anyway just because I love meat doesn't mean I am not evolved enough to eat at a vegetarian restaurant
Perhaps the wait time is more in line with a typical sushi restaurant but not what you expect in a place with a soda machine and Judge Judy
The restaurant is an order and seat yourself kind of place
The restaurant section which was always dead before has now been opened up and TVs added so the whole place is more of a bar feel thumbs up
If you haven't figured it out by reading the other reviews this place isn't a 5-star restaurant
Okay - I shouldn't lie I think we were hesitant because it is a vegetarian restaurant and we love our meet
With most restaurants in the area being Mexican this is a good place to get quick Chinese
Also I *really* think that the new restaurant owners should have completely renamed the place if they were going to take over and completely change the menu the way that they apparently did
The unfortunate truth is that this place needs to be on the show called Restaurant Impossible
If you like Scandinavian food Denmark this place down on your list of restaurants to visit
I highly recommend both eating at their restaurant and using their catering services
I think the place delivered a great value on the meal a fantastic selection of nearly every Cajun delight you can think of although I have yet to spot the elusive Muffaletta on area restaurants' menus and a great dining experience
It's a sad state when the supply and demand market equilibrium of the Mesa restaurant economy allows this place to stay in business; perhaps people in Mesa AZ have low culinary standards but I think people should demand more for their money
Corporate chain restaurants aren't usually places I visit often and when I do I generally have much scrutiny and suspicion
While I have no problem paying for what I order  most restaurants would have just nulled the bill instead of running a debit for 1 soda this place was more assembly line
This place is different than most movie theaters because instead of standard stadium seating customers sit in leather recliners or desk chairs and have food served to them as if they were in a restaurant
This restaurant is for the die-hard-pho noddle lovers
Vietnamese restaurants within a block of my house back home my best friend is Vietnamese and his mother and sister cook for me when I go back for a visit
Sitting in a very dark restaurant with Beatle music blaring away this English pub type of place had a huge variety of pastys

This is the first African restaurant I've heard of in the Phoenix valley area and AS SOON as I heard about it I made immediate plans to visit with my friends
Let me stipulate that I am an American Born Chinese however I fatten up every time I go visit my Grandparents in Taiwan because the food is sooo good and my dad is very picky about the Chinese food he introduces to me here in the US therefore I am very picky about my Chinese restaurants that I go to
We're talking about correctly spiced Restaurant Szechuan style food this is the place to be
The family running the place is amazing and some of the coolest restaurant owners I've ever met
We had loved this restaurant the first time and have been talking about the chocolate cake dessert for the previous two years
Second lovely upon walking into restaurant but what is the very strong smell of wood smoke
I thought I would also take a stabInternationalIt may not be to most folksBut it beats BKThis is another one of those places near work that I end up at from time to time and since I have been catching up on those restaurants I thought I would say a few words
I generally take a half hour lunch so I don't get here as often as some of the other places since it is a full service restaurant
I love it when a restaurant serves bean dip and unfortunately not enough of them do
I love these specialty type of restaurants where they focus on one or two menu items here it's chicken and beef
It is certainly a classy place still trendy and cool inside and while the restaurant can be a bit stuffy eating in the bar area full service and tables is much more lively and has a better ambiance
We were in Phoenix last week visiting relatives and we went to this restaurant with my sister in law
Sure Smashburger is a chain burger place but that doesn't necessarily mean they act nor serve food that taste like any ordinary burger chain restaurant
I am writing this review because there was hardly anybody in the restaurant when I came in and I believe this place should be packed
I've been to plenty of restaurants that do this to set the mood of the place so I don't mind candlelight
I ended up at the restaurant on a random Wednesday night and the place was packed
BTW it is great to find a place that welcomes kids without being a true kids restaurant
I love this pizza and this restaurant every time I go there without fail
I almost don't want to say anything about the amazing happy hour because I'm afraid if word spreads too much it'll turn into Cafe Boa or basically any other place that has an amazing happy hour but only in the bar area so you end up packed like sardines in the eight foot space around the bar while the rest of the restaurant is completely dead
We loved the restaurant the service and the food so much that we actually came back and ate there again before heading to the airport
Personally I love it I wish American restaurants did this
We had made reservations prior to dining and I would recommend that to everyone; it is not that big of a restaurant and fills up quickly
They have a lot of the standard chain sit down restaurants and some standard mall food court type of places but I'm generally not a fan of those so I've never eaten there
I love Diners Drive-ins and Dives and it's been a personal quest to try the restaurants on Guy's shows
By the sight of the long line outside the restaurant at 1230 I had big hopes for this place
The family that owns the restaurant are lovely and treat their regulars like family as well
Their menu is built around things people love to eat now a days and it starts in their garden rather than in their restaurant
;- I highly recommend the restaurant and am very confused by the bad reviews on the restaurant
Inside of restaurant only half-full as everybody in Phoenix drives one to a car but patrons are seated in such a manner as to spread them out as thinly as possible in the very small interior space meaning there's noplace for a party of 6 except outside in the alley - I mean patio
Simple restaurant specializing in something they do best and this is the place to come for teriyaki
I have been a lot of hole-in-the-wall places around this restaurant including Haji Baba the Vietnamese place and others but neither any of my friends nor I have fallen sick coz of the food
I know this restaurant can make pretty good New Mexican food but something has changed at this store - either the manager is cutting corners by saving money on spices or she is just incompetent because this place is capable of better service and better food I just haven't seen it in a long time
I would recommend this restaurant to anyone whether you go with your family or you go to watch the game with friends because it is awesome
this place reminds me of my first job a hostess in a now closed chinese restaurant in chandler
I want to start saying that I'm new to Phoenix and I searched online and I decide to visit this place and my remarks about this place as the following Restaurant I have tried both beef and chicken shawarma; i didn't like the taste of their chicken shawarma so I wanted to try their beef shawarma; this is what I have to tell about their beef shawarma; They use the cheapest quality
The place looks like someone decided to open a restaurant and tossed in a few chairs and tables and said ok
I guess this use to be a chef driven restaurant he created a name for the place

They also provide foods I love the noodles and I think it tastes better than most restaurant in Arizona
I sat a few different places in the restaurant/bar areas and heard nothing but employees bitching about co-workers what shifts they had to work etc
There must be a reason why this restaurant has been here for 15 years I just happened to find that the most interesting thing about the place was the building itself
Also Zagat rates this place one of the top restaurants in the whole city
This place actually rivals my favorite vegetarian restaurant in Portland
I love when restaurants don't have normal butter and the sundried tomato and basil butter exceeded my butter expectations
I'd love to have more good local bar/restaurants in the Grayhawk/Pinnacle area
This is a non-discript place but once inside you get the feel of a real Chinese restaurant
My husband and I have been getting hummus from Eddies stand at the old town farmer's market for months and love it so we were really excited to go and try the restaurant

OK Sweet Pea and I love us some Coup and it's not just because we've been coming here for years- since I lived across the street and could see the restaurant from my window- or because we got engaged here which was incredible
You can go to restaurants and have varying experiences from the best meal of your life to terrible but Coup is not the place for that
Hillside has big chestnuts to open a place like this in a town that is used to ITALIAN ITALIAN and more ITALIAN restaurants
It is pricey but keeping that in mind I would highly recommend the restaurant
If you're in Tempe or Phoenix I HIGHLY recommend Pita Jungle - one of my favorite restaurants of all time - heathy tasty & amazing
The pluses are that the employees were very friendly and did their job well and the restaurant was clean and well decorated for this type of place think along the lines of a Rubio's or Taco del Mar
I love restaurants that serve tacos in a fried corn tortilla and not the crappy Mexican chains that use hard shells that you can get at any grocery store
The Groupon described this place as an upscale Mexican restaurant
They have a frequent dining card that's nice in that you get $10 off your next meal when you spend $100 total at the restaurant doesn't have to be all at one time it can be added up from previous visits
We visited the restaurant on a Saturday morning around 1130 am
After owning ten restaurants over 30 years I think I am pretty savy when it comes to food and service and this place blows me away
I always keep coming back to this restaurant because its just one of those restaurants you hope to get better every time you go visit
I can see that this place would be a good family restaurant but I also didn't think the prices were all that great in relation to the quality of the food
we visited Prado  3 times this week and we were pleased with everything that we had speacially the service was nice our server took his time to explain the food to us before we order so it was clear to us you know this restaurant they dont write everything in the menu you need a server help to order and their manager was cheking every table and greeding them which is nice
But I would recommend this restaurant to my friends and family
I look forward to visit this restaurant/ bake shop again
I love that the Hillside Spot is in my neighborhood because we need more places like this but I think they are just now working through the problems of opening a new place in a cool-restaurant starved area
First off let me explain what the HELL I was doing at a horrible chain restaurant I don't even feel comfortable calling this pre-fab big box pre-frozen place a restaurant
All in all it's a nice place to take in a flick and conveniently close to some restaurants and shopping
Besides the great restaurants here that everyone knows about the Ranch Market is a great place to find anything that you can't find at Safeway or what you can find at Safeway but don't want to pay an obnoxious price for
I loved the classy intimacy of this restaurant
The patio is definitely a popular place because by 10pm the inside of the restaurant was empty but the patio was still packed

I recommend this restaurant for any occasion or no occasion
I am traveling to Phoenix again this fall and this will be a must visit restaurant
Being a FOX restaurant the design of the place was great
So if you love baseball and the desert and warm weather and nice restaurants and getting away for awhile then this is a great way to go
I live right down the street so I thought of Perc UpThe new owner Jackie greeted me as I walked up to the restaurant and seeing my confusion at the dueling signage for Perc Up and Wy-Knot right next to each other explained that Perc Up was no more but reassured me that I was still in the right place if I was looking for some good breakfast
I believe she said she owns another restaurant in Pennsylvania which gives me hope that this place will last unlike its predecessors RIP Drip Toast and now Perc Up
I did love the experience in the restaurant however
I love their decorations and design of the restaurant
Even the kids menu has been good my kid has tried the cheeseburger and the chicken nuggets they all come with drink and dessertIf you want to go to a nice restaurant to have an excellent time and great food I recommend you this place is superb and the service is always friendly
The Place After reading many of the hundreds of reviews talking about the size of Matt's I was still surprised when I pulled up with my family and the restaurant was the building that looked like a small shed
Maybe the restaurant could have some discreetly placed fly-catchers  is that a thing
My only complaints really minor- Good yet Cheap Eats Only place to eat at the hotel without driving somewhere was the hotel restaurant
I am a sucker for easy going and calm restaurant environments and this place totally hit the mark

Not only is the restaurant itself just a cool looking place but everything is delicious
How many times have you been seated at a table in an interesting well reviewed or recommended restaurant been handed a menu and went about selecting your meal

Here's whyFirst I love the cafe style restaurant and the scenery it's decorated in brick walls open kitchen long tables etc

When I go to a new place I order a few control items just to see how they stack up against other restaurants
Now even though this place is relatively small the staff treat it like it's a large restaurant
This place is SO GOOD and I'm not a huge fan of all off Fox Restaurants concepts
Worst restaurant ever will not be back and I highly do not recommend this place to anyone
For seeing this on the food network as being on the top 10 restaurants this place is far from the top 10

We've eaten there before and decided the best place to fully enjoy this restaurant's fabulous atmosphere is out on the patio so go when the weather is just warm enough to dine al fresco and when it isn't crowded with a private party
I've eaten at many korean restaurants around the country and this is a really great place
I am very aware we probably caught this restaurant on a bad night  but we won't be going back or recommending it to anyone
SUMMARY It hits my list of places worthy of return visits and that is probably the highest compliment I can give a restaurant
The place just seems like a nice family business in the sea of chain restaurants known as Phoenix
The restaurant is inside of a restored house with a lovey outdoor patio
There is NO other place to sit than outside on the patio inside feels dismal and like you are in a subpar mexican restaurant
Much older restaurant pretty worn and it took some time for me not to be grossed out by the nasty overall smell of the place
This place has everything you can desire in a restaurant
I was getting upset & frustrated as we visited many supposedly high-end restaurants in this area and we were not impressed

In fact we chose this restaurant b/c of the raving reviews - all were correct - this is an AMAZING place to eat
This place is off the hook the only reason Im giving it a 4-star is because one time they had some soda machine problem and didn't have the soda service is not very welcoming place doesn't really look like a grand restaurant
Despite the slight lapse in service I highly recommend this restaurant
---I've had this Taste of Phoenix giftcard purchased through Costco good at restaurants such as Tapino Picazzo Gourmet Pizza Medizona and Little Rangoon since pre-Christmas so I decided to go for my first LRvisit last Friday

Ethiopian food doesn't quite break my top five favorite foods but it's pretty good and hey I love any restaurant that serves a lot of veg food

On a funny side note the space the restaurant is in used to be a little pizza by the slice place back when I was going to a near by high school
After entering the restaurant and approaching the hostess I was startled by the number of empty tables in the place and pleased that we'd soon have some saucy ricey goodness to sate our hunger

-not related to the restaurant but in a great area Old Town Scottsdale nice place to walk around in the evening
-not a large variety of steaks on the menu more of a nice restaurant than a steakhouseOverall really liked the food here; would definitely come back here or visit the one in Sac or Chicago just for the cornbread

This place is a Cheesecake Factory Restaurant wannabe
I can overlook the BYOB which honestly I find annoying in a sushi/Japanese restaurant since I love an ice cold martini with raw fish and the sometimes attitudey service and even the ho-hum rolls offered nothing special really
People line up around the restaurant to order/pay at the counter and then scour the place to find an empty table or patiently wait until someone leaves to get a free spot
When I try a new restaurant I pick a dish that I can get at almost any restaurant of that type eggplant parmesan at Italian places pastrami on rye at delis and so on since it's usually a good litmus test for the restaurant itself

Like Gabi mentions Phoenix is definitely lagging behind San Jose Honolulu Chicago name your place-they all got mindblowingly good ramen/noodle house type restaurants

FEZ and Rice Paper two pretentious restaurants that think it is a privilege of OURS to be seen in their restaurants don't have great food and have sub-par service and are ON my list of places that will NEVER get my support

This restaurant would not be out of place in NYC Boston's North End or Providence's Federal Hill
well sort of we love eating outdoors whether a restaurant has a patio or picnic benches

It is the only place that can make better breakfast than me I make some mean fluffy scrambled eggs and french toast and the occasional breakfast burrito when I feel like going all outSeriously the best breakfast restaurant I've ever been to it tops a place in Austin I thought could never be toppedPortions are large and everything is fresh
But the last few times I have visited it has been very underwhelming and with so many other Thai restaurants popping up in the area there are better options
I would steer clear of this place and try the number of quality restaurants with equal quality of service in this area
I would recommend improving the presentation of the meals upgrading and widening of the menu options or not misrepresenting themselves as a world class restaurant

So for pros--Comfy chairs and thank god for that because the service was sloooooooow--Good food--Takes reservations--Has their own parking--Love the rollup doors for a fresh breeze--Quality cocktailsCons--Really ugly chairs and tables think Denny's ugly--Small portions--Really slow service in a half-empty restaurant

Overall I think the abundant flavors that you get to enjoy puts this place above any of the sandwich chain restaurants
The service was the same relaxed approach that I've received over the last several visits - despite a full restaurant with several large groups
I also love that its a restaurant/bar
This is an Indian place that I sincerely wish could market itself better and make a name for itself in the valley's restaurant scene
Decided to make the rare drive out to downtown Phoenix to check out a highly recommended restaurant from my friends called Cibo
All in all I still highly recommend this restaurant for its quality ingredients and authentic flavors
As soon as you walk into this place you get that chain restaurant feel
The salad buffet place with the circular architecture reminiscent of Van de Kamp's restaurants is my favorite place for a quick satisfying meal in the MetroCenter area
Having visited & reviewed many restaurants now this amateur critic has come to the conclusion that the food can be so special at a restaurant that the look of the place just disappears into the background
I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who has never experienced Greek food and is willing to taste a different styled recipe from their original comfort zone
The restaurant down stairs looks busy so I totally plan on coming back to this place soon
Well This particular restaurant happens to be Hana Japanese eatery my favorite place for sushi in Arizona
My last visit on a Friday night the restaurant ran out of macaroni when I was looking forward to the Chorizo Mac and Cheese
It's a restaurant you plan on going to--a special occasion worthy place
I know it's not the restaurant's fault but they shouldn't have seated them in the first place
They recently turn this place into a sit down restaurant in stead of counter order
Though that should have been the first warning sign My Big Fat Greek Restaurant had the same deal going on and we all love it there
To the people who visited our table tonight  I hope you are never in a restaurant and receive the service we received while visiting yours
I don't know what it is with local bar/restaurants and their overwhelming lack of desire to serve my companions and I but this place has made me feel guilty for being there on several occasions
Our waitress was friendly but seemed out of place at this restaurant
I gave this place 5 stars cause for Arizona this is a great Chinese restaurant
I would have to say that DURANTS is the one restaurant that any visitor NEEDS to eat at to experience Phoenix
I visited this restaurant on Friday 12/11
I used to love this place but that's because I was a teenaged vegetarian without a car or the good sense to go into a restaurant that wasn't staffed by hipsters and next to a killer record store
I highly recommend this restaurant for food drinks wine list and local residents
They do have an extensive wine list though I tried one of their mixed drinks which is something I do at every restaurant I visit
Well if I were one to judge a restaurant by it's decor I probably wouldn't have tried this place
Rarely do I find a restaurant that gives out free samples like they do on your first visit that ends up having bad food
This place is one of the cutest/coolest restaurants that I have been to
For a chain restaurant it is different and dishes offer extra touches one just would not expect at an IHOP or similar place
Which totally doesn't fit with the rest of the mallThe design of the place is nice and decent restaurants dot the complex
I've been to locations here in Phoenix Chicago and Atlanta and I always love the swanky crooning of updated hits softly breezing through the restaurant
The restaurant was cool as there were a lot of places to sit outside as well as in
Oh by the way found t his place because it was listed as one of the best new 25 restaurants in Phoenix in Phoenix magazine and they were spot on
The place was stuffed to the brim on a Sunday night you had to find a place to stand and according to the nice lady in line behind me it's always like this The burgers are fresh better quality than most fast food restaurants & yes you get to pick your toppings but don't hate me
There are boxes of peanuts placed throughout the restaurant for you to scoop into little cardboard serving trays and snack on while you wait for your food
I think we made our first visit to this restaurant on March 21st 2008 at about 6 p
I recommend this restaurant to everyone looking to have a memorable experience
Whenever we travel we always look for a Korean restaurant and Red Kimchi was the only place that we found in the area
The place has warm inviting butter tones with wood accents that all come together to create this bright and spacious restaurant
When leaving the restaurant we noticed a protected private dining area in the back of the place
Wanted to go try this place out for Restaurant Week
Another restaurant of the LGO family that I love
Some restaurant industry friends of mine frequent the place as they serve food until 1 AM
Stumbled into Little Rangoon while looking for a parking spot for another restaurant and decided as we had never experienced Burmese cuisine before that we would try this place mind you we love Gujarati South Indian Korean Thai Szechuan and Hunan cooking
As far as the restaurant istelf well it is run by these grumpy stubborn non-customer-service oriented folks apparently so I'm never setting foot in the place nor ever eating their overpriced underwhelming food ever again
FYI they don't have a kids menu which is really DUMB because this place is such a family restaurant
Hardly the place one might think to enjoy deep meditation but as I would learn the restaurant embodies the Four Noble Truths of restaurants in Scottsdale perfectly
My dinner is always served hot and to my liking I would recommend this restaurant to anyone with a taste of Indian Food
It wouldn't be a bad place to watch a game either as they have tv's at every angle all over the restaurant
Worth a try and a place to watch for leading the way with community restaurants and natural organic foods
The interior of the restaurant is a little tight at lunch so I recommend the patio if it's open
I had never had something like that at a restaurant and I loved the bacon
Just like all the other mom and pop restaurants we have been visiting lately the staff was extremely friendly and really went above and beyond
I HIGHLY recommend you find this small restaurant and try the many fresh home made and tasty dishes
The interior begs for you to take this place seriously as a french /swiss alps restaurant  and to be honest it does remind me of a bistro we ate in Lucerne Switzerland
the foregoing reviews cannot possibly be speaking of the restaurant we visited during restaurant week
My husband and I love Toyama; we started coming here after Mo opened We used to visit him at a restaurant where he worked
The ideal place to sit is on the main part of the restaurant with all the televisions opposite of the game room with the pool tables
They also have several restaurants and a buffet and a casino but I didn't choose to go visit them
We've hit up all of the high end restaurants in the Phx/Scotts area during our stay here and I must say they were more accommodating than the majority of those places
I don't usually review non-buffet restaurants but there was such a contrast between Schlotzsky's yesterday & the place where I ate today I just had to write
I'm sorry to write that because by all accounts people who know good food love this restaurant
And I especially love that the restrooms are on the outside of the restaurant
My fiancu00e9 and I saw this restaurant on TV and knew we had to visit while in Arizona
Then I did a sign for him for his other failing restaurant the pizza place Melrose caf I created 12 beautiful logos for his sign and a magazine made him 3 more they wanted to charge him a grand for it
People are very nice and visits to bars and restaurants were enjoyable
The grounds are beautiful the restaurants on the property had good food and I feel in love with the Salvatore Ferragamo Tuscan Soul scent of products they use
Overall however I would recommend this restaurant
Overall it reminds me a bit of a european bistro a nice neighborhood restaurant where the staff knows its' patrons well and creates lovely meals
My parent's idea of trying new places meant sitting at a different table at the same restaurant
I eat out in fine restaurants a lot here and many other cities throughout the US and I LOVE Uncle Sal's
I went there with my mom right after moving in because it is the closest restaurant to my place and we had heard some good things from my real estate agent
This is a restaurant with a bar so the place is enormous
I did manage restaurant for several years and as manager you should be about customer service because when someone is coming to your place for first time as he was told make that extra step and have a customer who is going to come back especially today when restaurants are disappearing overnight
We have been to this restaurant twice now and absolutely love it
As a family we tried samples from several places including Culinary Dropout pretzels and popcorn for the little one America's Taco Shop $2 taco samples here and a YUCK rating according to my parents Green buffalo chicken wings - always delish and Nami Vegan cupcakes Spinato's Pizza my mom loved the spinach pizza Pita Jungle hummus and pita that somehow failed short of what they serve in the restaurant and some place selling my parents' fav - the shrimp creole I will find out the name shortly
This is a new building and I noticed the layout could be easily remodeled to a full service restaurant with a full bar and a private group dining room in place of the buffet serving area
The ambiance is nice both inside the restaurant and out on the patio nice fireplace
Anyway the restaurant is the least attractive part of the resort and still blows a lot of places away in terms of beauty
Like so many restaurants I think this place could use better ingredients and give you much smaller portions for the same price and it would be a lot better
in my mind this is one of the true must-visit restaurants in Phoenix
My advice to the Restaurant; you have a great food I'd recommend you also match it with great service
She recommended some nice restaurants and was very personable
The place was very packed & since the restaurant is a little ways from the main road in Old Town I suspect that it was mostly locals in there we were visiting from out of town
Finally got out to try this place had a restaurant
It felt like it would be a good place known for drinking like casey moores but features a menu that reads like it's a restaurant
Let me start by saying the place itself looks like a legit Hawaiian restaurant with it's low key vibe and simple style
The decor of the restaurant is lovely of course
But you always have the restaurant Fate next door is you want to sit inside; I imagine this place will slow down in the hot summer months
This is not a great restaurant but I am fond of this place
Just moved to the Scottsdale area and searched around online for a Chinese buffet style restaurant in the vicinity of our new place
ok completely ghetto half empty strip mall that also houses a chinese restaurant and a second hand clothing store the place does not look promising from the outside
From the moment you enter this place you get the feeling that you are entering some swanky underground restaurant the lighting is dark and the decor is mysterious
However I just cannot recommend this establishment with so many other great Mediterranean restaurants out there such as Phoenicia Grill and Haji-Baba
I took a friend to this place to try out Shabu Shabu the only restaurant in arizona to serve this style food for the first time and the server went through great lengths to give us the best experience
Aside from the fact that there's an In N Out right across the street this place is clearly in the same league as they both offer super greasy restaurant-quality burgers in a fast-food setting
My boyfriend had raved about this place for awhile so back when Phoenix Restaurant Week rolled around and Fogo de Chao was featured as one of the participating restaurants a group of us gathered together to go experience a Brazilian steakhouse
I would definitely recommend this place to those of you wanting to try something new and the price point makes it a great special occasion restaurant
-They need to 'clean' the place up a bit -The food at the restaurant isn't that good-The a/c is not good
Moving finally to the last of my supplementary snacks I'll start off by saying I'd read about The Fry Bread House a couple of times when planning my trip to The Valley but it did not make my list of must visit stops until just the day prior during dinner at Kai when I was speaking with head Chef Michael O'Dowd about the lack of Native American restaurants in the area he explained this to me but that is for another time and one of his expeditors suggested I should check out Cecilia Miller's temple of fried dough calling it about as authentic as it gets around here
The restaurant in convieniently located next to the I-17 and Bethany Home Rd and is pretty cool little place on the inside
this restaurant was really nice and i would recommend it if you're looking for something different and romantic
The restaurant is small but they have a very lovely patio
My wife loves the restaurant and I must have had a bad experience at the one in Tempe
This is just a fun place to go and a great family restaurant
I am just over these douche-y pretentious Phoenix restaurants that have crappy service but get away with it just because of the name of the place
I would definitely recommend hanging out in this bar until you can get a table at Pizzeria Bianco but be advised that Bar Bianco gets almost as busy as the restaurant
I love non-chain restaurants but Carrabbas is one of the exceptions
I have eaten in hundreds of Chinese restaurants in NY from high end places like Chin Chin all the way to delivery places like China Fun and this place does not hold a candle
Suggestion to the restaurant  You are an Italian place
The place is small - I recall about 6 or 7 tables and the restaurant had most of the tables occupied on a Friday night
Definitely not a place for big groups unless you want to take over the entire restaurant
We eat in lots of small ethnic restaurants and just because a place is in the hood doesn't mean it has to be gross
In the boom and bust world of Phoenix restaurants this place has staying power
I love to support Local Food and Local Restaurants and we all love the place
I've been to Brazil over the past 7 years and visited numerous Brazilian restaurants and eaten in  Churrascaria barbeque style food; let me say that Val's Brazilian Restaurant offers the same quality and atmosphere as the restaurants of Brazil
I have had more than a few friends visit me from Brazil and they all agreed with me that Val's Brazilian Restaurant serves the best Brazilian food and the fun lively atmosphere is outstanding
I would recommend Val's Brazilian Restaurant if you like to have delicious Brazilian food and lots of fun
It's such a cute little place and rings true to the style of so many restaurants I visited while living in France
I was so eager to go to this place after reading many good reviews here in Yelp and local restaurant guides
We will definitely be back and we'd also love to try their other restaurant Rhythm and Wine
Initially when I wrote on my fb status Hey I'm traveling to Phoenix Arizona do you guys have any restaurant recommendations the general consensus from everyone is to go to Pizzeria Bianco
along with a couple of restaurants that are open and a few places that are under construction
I had heard a lot about CD and while I'm not familiar with the Fox concept restaurants I was excited to try this place out tonight with some of my guy friends
I have been to this restaurant many times and have brought other people that love it too
All other restaurants were booked in the area that night so this place was the last resort
The solidly 4 star reviews directed me to not miss out on this authentic Middle Eastern eatery in my neighborhood so with happy anticipation we sashayed into the place named Fattoush; but it wasn't the restaurant I read about below in the glowing reviews
We were first-time visitors to this restaurant on Saturday night
If you want a similarly good restaurant go to Sorranos prices are about the same and it's a sit down place they also give you unlimited chips salsa and bean dip
In these days of flash frozen prepared dishes that are uniform from visit to visit at chain restaurants this food is made in a tiny hot kitchen
I was hoping it was one of those type of places where the restaurant looks terrible but the food is amazing- I was wrong
There are way too many Chinese restaurants out there to waste another meal at this place
For a restaurant that has been open only a month - the place nailed it
I loved everything about this place -- from the local papers about Indian reservation events to the chit chat with the guy behind the counter about which Navajo tribe managed the restaurant -- and I recommend it to anyone visiting the greater Phoenix area
Suddenly the time came and boyfriend and I parked right in front of the place and marched into the crowded restaurant
Besides the drinks i think this place is probably one of the most overrated restaurant in Phoenix
It's a relatively small dining room - not sure if they use the connected area a sister place called 18 Degrees for breakfast - with small octagonal white tile - Who uses white tile in a restaurant
Cuban restaurants are not real common here so I want to support the place as much as possible
The entrance to the restaurant features a seating area with a fireplace that comes in handy on the few cool evenings that we have here in AZ
I love this restaurant but if I keep running into these situations I'm going to have to deem it another careless chain restaurant which is NOT what I'd want to do at all
While other restaurants have been cutting quality and quantity this place isn't
All in all good but not spectacular enough to convert us to NY style pizza lovers and I would not return given the plethora of restaurants in this mall area
It is so totally unpretentious - a welcome break from so many of today's Italian restaurants - especially those that have displaced the little Mom and Pop shops
This place claims to be an authentic Shanghai restaurant but it was so Americanized
I ran several high end restaurants in NYC and would have been fired if I ran a restaurant like this place even for one night
Overall I love this place this is a great family restaurant and you wont break the bank
Love love love It's rare a restaurant group can have solid entries in multiple categories but in the case of our friends at the Joe's family they have done it
You got Ross Lowe's Office Max Best Buy Target The Vitamin Shoppe and basically any other store or restaurant that you may want to visit all at one intersection
Visited the restaurant tonight and was very pleased
Boy were we surprisedThe restaurant inside is so quaintly and artistically designed that you instantly get the impression that you are not in just another crepe place
I'm just visiting Phoenix and this is the only restaurant that is open on Sundays and open till 100 am
And they're honest with their recommendations too unlike some restaurants that will say anything about a bottle of wine if they think it'll help sell it
I like my restaurants how I like my style un-cramped; unfortunately this place is packed full with wall to wall tables and chairs leaving about 3 inches in between you and the guy at the table next to you
Fez is probably the first place I've been to in downtown Phoenix that has the look and feel of a restaurant/bar I would expect to find in downtown Scottsdale without the Scottsdale attitude of course
We had 7 people at a large table in the center of the restaurant and had brought in four bottles of wine purchased from the place next door
We stopped in this place while waiting for a table at a neighboring restaurant
I would definitely recommend both the restaurant and the flight school you can find the schedule on their website--it's held every Thursday
I first visited Zinburger during Restaurant Week
This place needs Restaurant Impossible to come in and liven the joint up
I passed through Scottsdale a few weeks ago to visit the Grand Canyon and the second I stepped off the plane at the Phoenix airport and secured the rental car we drove straight to the restaurant
The first restaurant I've ever been in when I visited Phoenix
Even among non-sit down restaurants or fast food style Indian themed eateries this place is subpar
Was highly recommended this restaurant by client
The place itself is kind of small and run down but Asain restaurants aren't known for their perfect establishmentsThe chicken was good it cut into really big chunks though
This place needs an over haul in a major way if they want to make any money at the restaurant which for a Saturday night at 7pm when we went was empty
This place is the best restaurant in Arizona
Overall I cannot recommend this restaurant although they do have quite a nice selection of italian groceries
You walk into a Chinese restaurant on a Saturday afternoon for dim sum and you expect the place to be PACKED
My friend says this is his favorite Mexican restaurant so maybe this might be your kinda place
That would seem to follow the logic of visiting Europe and seeing a McDonald's filled with Americans and drawing the conclusion that McDonald's is a top-notch American restaurant
I highly recommend this restaurant and have always loved the location and the space which was a nursery at one time I am told and has a wonderful patio
because if someone asked me to suggest a restaurant in the Waterfront area it probably wouldn't be my first recommendation
This place works best as a sports bar than a restaurant
When I saw that a Thai restaurant had gone in at Park Central where a greasy fast-foodish Chinese place had once been I immediately was turned off
The inside is also ordinary until you realize that this place was probably a house before it was a restaurant
It is a local little restaurant here in town and it is wonderful to have such a delicious place to have my favorites
Rimrock Bar & Grille is not a place I would ever seek out but safe and decent food for a hotel restaurant
I say this place is more than just another CHEESY restaurant
Sometimes when restaurants open 2nd or even 3rd locations they have a hard time keeping the food quality and service consistent so I was worried about that on my first visit
I normally love to sit at the counter at a restaurant as you get better and faster serviceOne of my meals the AZ scramble a special was pretty solid
I later visited their restaurant bar and had a margarita and it tasted more like sweet & sour than the liquor
I didn't even know this place existed but the restaurant gods have parted the seas and as I walked into the valley of PHX - boy what a surprise
In an effort to compete with the new more modern trendy places in the area BLT Steak Prado the restaurant has been completely revamped with a more modern brighter feel
The place was run down and the service indifferent  I know these traits are not uncommon in Vietnamese restaurants
I have visited 4 chain restaurants lately for an early Saturday morning breakfast
If you enjoy breakfast and you enjoy cute little restaurants you will like this place
I do not think I would return to or recommend the restaurant as there are many others to choose from in the area
It breaks my heart to have to write this review of a restaurant that used to be one of my favorite places to eat in Scottsdale
I decided to try this restaurant out today after visiting an historical church for Sunday service that is right across the street
The place is kept very clean and looks more upscale for a non franchise Asian restaurant
Well China Chan restaurant will not make my top ten list  it is still an A OK place and yes i would return
The problem with average is in how much this place charges--I'm not going to give three stars to an expensive restaurant that serves three star food
I've paid double or more to eat at some other Indian restaurants around tempe and I can honestly say that this was just as good if not better than those places plus the variety of a buffet is nice
The first thing that came to my mind about this place was how clean it was unlike most pho restaurants
That all being said I have no problem recommending this restaurant and will happily return
The Lariat restaurant was the only place open at the resort and had a nice special from 5-630pm otherwise was a bit pricey
If you have been looking for a true hole in the wall Mexican restaurant for cheap tasty authentic Mexican cuisine this is your place
For me no cheese and sub black beans instead of potatoesAlso they give A LOT of food I usually can't quite finish the whole burrito by myself so you get a bang for your buck um FINALLY an airport restaurant that doesn't follow the code of shitty and overpricedAlso the coffee has a nice flavor not the normal burnt black that I actually LOVE and it comes in one of those taller glass mugs I would prefer a regular mug but I guess it makes it look nicer
This is one of the only chain restaurants we went to on our trip to Arizona but they don't have anything quite like this in Chicago and I'll tell you that this was one of the places that made our trip worthwhile
I'm no food snob and definitely respect the neighborhood hole-in-the-wall restaurants but I will definitely be staying away from this place from now on
I was a little surprised when we got there as I expected a sitdown restaurant but instead it's an order at the counter and the food is brought out kind of place
I was pretty excited because I love artichokes and basil and the restaurant smelled really good
I have found that there is a serious lack of good restaurant places especially non-chain restaurants
I have found that there is a serious lack of good restaurant places especially non-chain restaurants
This has been our family's favorite restaurant but over our last three visits we have become so frustrated with the predictably slow service that we won't return
it IS a great place to meet with people -- much more room to chat than most starbucks or other chains and you can spend a few bucks on a beverage instead of going to a restaurant and feeling like you need to scurry away when you're done eating
When I saw the restaurant from outside it looked like a small hole in the wall place
Okay granted it is a small restaurant but like a previous reviewer I found the ambiance and decor inside lovely
The restaurant is set in the beautiful Fairmont-Princess hotel; great bars abound on this property all worth a visit
Now you are becoming a has-been a place that if it weren't for the good brew you would be just another forgettable restaurant
I've visited before for dinner in the summer no wait and had a good experience but I feel like Bianco's  has been over-glorified so much that my expectations are just way too high to give it anything but 3 stars - and after our lunch fiasco today they dropped to a 2-star restaurant in my book
Every city has one of these places--a restaurant for which people will wait hours
The Ho's restaurant/lounge Cafe Zuzu is great to enjoy high-end American food and at night is a cool/chic place to lounge and have a drink
First time we were the only patrons in the restaurant; my friend from Long Island is very particular about her Chinese food; she loves this place
Lots of food and fairly quick for a sit down restaurant this place had great service and is a treat on road trips
Maybe I ate at a different restaurant than the other people or once they got through the soft opening  they gave up because this place was not good
It is a safe place to live close to great shopping & restaurants and the grounds are always beautifully maintained
That's how I felt when we 8 obnoxious out-of-place mob of hungry/alcohol feening Asian girls from So Cal stormed in this low-key restaurant
Accepting that at least some of the personnel are unable to give correct change without the assistance of the cash register and that the registers have pictures not words in order for the employee to place the correct order they still have the inability to collect the components of an order place it in the bag and hand it to an individual correctly whether it be in the drive thru or in the restaurant itself
For those who are unschooled in the field of eating in combo fish-shop/restaurants the place will smell faintly like fish
The Asada restaurant was good having a breakfast buffet I visited a couple of times
When I moved to Phoenix Pei Wei was one of the first restaurants I went to and one of my go to places for Asian food
I tried this restaurant out yesterday with a few friends since it was recommended on a list of international restaurants in Phoenix published by the Arizona Republic
Don't let the exterior of this place fool you it's a clean comfortable albeit small restaurant
Also I love the restaurant and how it looks like an ex-diner
It sounds like others on this page really liked the place however I have experienced and seen places alerting people that a table is reserved and they  need to move in a nice way and if this restaurant doesn't want my money enough to allow me to eat at my reserved time then they really don't get it
I wanted to give this place at least 3 stars but the bad service completely overshadowed my experience at this restaurant
I love the atmosphere of this restaurant as well as the neighboring thrift shop that is fun to browse while the food cooks
I will not be back nor will I recommend this restaurant to anyone
Perfect example of a great restaurant that lives in a crappy place
We decided to try this place for restaurant week as they allow you to choose ANY app entree and dessert from their menu PLUS a glass of wine for $30
So we ordered drinks in the bar area which had some seemingly graffiti-type art that seemed totally out of place in this hip downtown hotel lounge/restaurant
Though we can figure out something to eat at most of the restaurants we frequent we love coming into Green and having an entire menu of deliciousness to choose from
First the red beef chili burro is _still_ one of the best in town I've been using that as my barometer for other Mexican restaurants and this place still wins
The music rules I love trance though and seriously most restaurants I think have the song soul sista on a loop--the trance rules the schools and the service is always good
Visiting this wonderful restaurant is like visiting Rocky Point Mexico only the food is even better here
The restaurant was very clean the service was great and the friendly owner Ruth even visited our table to be sure that we were happy with our meal
Here is the story of how we fell in love with a little Mexican restaurant called Habanero's Friday Did a random yelp search for Mexican food in the Scottsdale area and stumbled upon some decent reviews for this place
I am looking forward to visiting the actual restaurant soon; it's definitely at the top of my list
There's a restaurant I love in Flagstaff called La Fonda
I heard about this place from overhearing a conversation at a table behind me at another restaurant
We still decided to go and place the order in the restaurant
I like the idea of the restaurant and decided this would be a nice place for a pre-show wine and cheese snack
One of the things I love about AZ is that there are ample salsas bars at a variety of restaurants
I love how there is a more Korean influence since a good and cheap Korean restaurant in hard to find
Maybe if more restaurants offered to carry out super large orders like that I would love them more or I'm just eating @ the wrong places
BTW while the restaurant is good for kids unless your child is able to eat spicy food - I don't recommend it
I would definitely recommend it based on it's historical significance; however if you're looking for great all-around seafood experience you may want to consider some of the other notable seafood restaurants around the valley
My husband and I went to Bourbon Steak for Restaurant and had a very lovely time
Sure the food is pretty good service is fairly quick and the people seem nice enough but I have no idea how this place can function as a restaurant
It's a boutique restaurant and a must visit but I definitely won't go very often
The downstairs bar is a funky copper and there are 2 seats in front of the big fireplace I never get the chance to sit there darn it and all the seating in the restaurant upstairs and downis booth
Admittedly Someburros is a chain restaurant and it isn't like many of the great sit down/server mexican places we have around Phoenix metro but for what it is I thought it was great
Coco's is a great little diner/cafe/restaurant around to corner from Grams place and I will tell you I was definitely the youngest gal in the join staff not included
You know they are doing something right when the restaurant is 90% full of Chinese people and the consensus among local Chinese is this place rivals the best Chinese food found in NYC LA SF etc
Not like other restaurants i am feeling less guilty after having so many food here  So weight watchers here's the place you should try
This is also my daughter's favorite restaurant and the place she picked for her birthday dinner last week
If you don't have a table and/or are getting something to go the only place to wait for your food is a small area in the middle of restaurant
This restaurant holds a special place in my heart
It was an all-around terrific experience and we will undoubtedly go back for the art walks and other events in Glendale just to visit this terrific restaurant
Well we thought we should never have such high expectations for a family restaurant but we were really extremely disappointed and regretted about our visit and we both thought our lunch was over-priced ended up paying almost $30 including tax and tips for such standard of food
Going into the restaurant after the bar is slightly shocking because the restaurant lights seem too bright for the place particularly in contrast to the bar area and for the ambiance you expect in a steak house
Basically the dude that everyone just loves to be at a restaurant with
again I will NEVER return to this chaotic  joke of a restaurant when there are so many wonderful places to dine
I found the inside of the restaurant a bit over done with their ornaments especially with the small statues  all placed around their bar near the cash register but the picture frames with the elephants and buddhas were tastefully placed around the dining tables
Here's a tip though-this place has restaurant hours-you can't just drive here at 3pm thinking it's open
I LOVE RESTAURANT DEPOT because unlike Costco or Sams Club It is exclusively here for people to conduct restaurant BusinessThis is restaurant Owner Mecca
I love supporting the local restaurants in my downtown but I don't think I will be returning
Place is sprawled out expect to take a long walk to the restaurants and pool areas
After traveling to 40 different states and eating in countless Turkish Greek Mid Eastern and Mediterranean restaurants only one place had the best baklava in the US
I highly recommend this restaurant especially for some hearty food after a hike on Camelback mountain
I dont know the place is not terrible in my opinion but there are too many good restaurants around here to spend $25 a head to eat average tacos and chips and salsa
Also even though the restaurant has posted all over the place that kids eat free the kid's meals were on the bill and I had to ask them to remove it
How people can love this restaurant is beyond me
If you are looking for something different for dinner then the usual and like small family owned restaurants then this is the place for you
Defalco's is a great place for a quick bite or even an intimate evening for a couple who doesn't want the hassle of a restaurant
If you are looking for a wow restaurant I would rather recommend alto at the hyatt gainey ranch
I also love love love the decor in the restaurant
One word for this place AMAZING and I think I just found my new favorite restaurant
I have visited this restaurant several times when visiting Scottsdale predominantly due to its proximity to the hotel I stay at
This place is more of a sit down restaurant with great service and good food
Regardless I rarely visit Asian restaurants for their superb customer service but I go for the food
Overall I loved the restaurant the food and the customer service
We would recommend and return to this restaurant
Our server saw I couldn't decide on wine so he recommended the Novy nebbiolo which was really great - one of the best wines I've ordered at a restaurant lately and affordable too
The staff was friendly especially the lovely lady who blessed us with free guacamole from the restaurant during the FREE snack time after 10pm which includes everything chocolate chips sodas and more our room which was considered a Jr
=]This place has had an extreme makeover restaurant edition
The new restaurant has the most amazing olive oil cupcakes I personally love the lemon and the orange cupcakes because you can really taste the olive oil
This charming restaurant yes charming - it even has a fireplace
Another thing that happened and I can understand that this is a family restaurant and they are trying to create a fun and lively atmosphere but I just cant stand places that have the entire staff come out and sing happy birthday to a customers a-la Show style
During a recent visit on Sunday the restaurant was not very busy when we arrived but the entire place filled up during the time we were there
Ate dinner here based on a tip from a waitress at another restaurant in Scottsdale who had suggested other places for us to try
Francis was and why he's a saint but I love this restaurant
As a big fan of good fresh seafood and never having had a recommendation to eat here I was a bit skeptical when one of my friends chose this restaurant
I also love the atmosphere of this place with all the sport decorations on the wall which is very different from any restaurants we've been to
The decor inside was eclectic and it is not a big restaurant by any means but it really works for this place
We love this place and hope people go there so it stays in business unlike most of the restaurants and stores located in and around Metro Center
If you'v visited different regions in Mexico besides Baja Rocky Point and Cancun you'll appreciate the regional dishes at this restaurant and the inventive use of ingredients and crazy flavors
I live really close to Cafe Wasabi and I had heard good things about the restaurant from friends so I was hoping CW could be my go-to neighborhood sushi place
I think the prices are restaurant prices for a take out place
It's a huge place that offers pick up and a sit down restaurant
The restaurant is less than a mile from my parents' house and so it seems criminal to not pay Roma Garden a visit the next time I'm in Phoenix
Upon the recommendation of another local chef as well as some fellow Yelpers I talked to at that other restaurant I decided to try Petite Maison
Service was friendly and the restaurant albeit small on the inside though it has a big patio with a fireplace and heaters it was too cold for me out there had a nice feel
So while surrounding restaurants are cleaning their kitchens to close for the night this place is just getting started
It was a tough day at the liberty market as you can tell from my earlier reviews your restaurant has always been in our top breakfast places hopefully you can relay this issue to your staff

While your visiting the Phoenix Arizona area you may want to stop by the Biltmore Mall and checkout all the shops and restaurants in the center
One of the few Chinese restaurants that I'd recommend in Phoenix
Note that this a pleasant family run dining place not an upscale restaurant to go for a date or celebrate an event
and found this place to be above average for an east indian restaurant
I only deduct a point because service was so-so on my last visit and the restaurant smelled like a nursing home for some reason
Knowing the relationship with the LGO prior to visit I already had some understanding and expectations from this restaurant
On our visit the remodel wasn't quite done but you couldn't see anything from inside the restaurant and thye had just rolled out a new menu that had a lot of really interesting looking options
I really love Trader Joes carrot juice and would choose that over this restaurants and it is much cheaper
Again thanks to the power of Yelp I opted for this place instead of some chain restaurant down the road
I think this is a place that does not function well when they have a full restaurant all morning
This is one of the restaurants at the Boulders resort in Carefree and the entire staff from the bellhops to the front desk recommended it a little too hard which aroused my suspicions
This is the cutest little restaurant; it looks like an old house complete with real wood floors a fireplace and large windows making it light and airy
It's like a casual funky cafe dining place with gourmet nice restaurant prices
Fish Tacos 1 Star; Restaurant 4 StarsWe decided to check out some shops in Cave Creek Sunday afternoon and thought this place looked like a nice spot for lunch
Yes I am somewhat addicted to this place but it's easy to understand why and I am confident that it will become one of your favorite restaurants to savor a delicious artisan pizza
this has nothing to do with the Embassy itself but if you are a fan of Latin American cuisine you will love all the restaurants nearby
We ate inside and you can definitely tell this is an event space but I love that there were other patrons enjoying the restaurant already
However on my way out I saw that they expanded this year's lineup setting up a handful of restaurant booths and an entire strip of dessert places inside the cafe and Great Hall
While I can't claim to be an expert in Korean food I am used to the Korean bbq restaurants in Los Angeles and I can say that this place cannot compete with those restaurants

Sure the place is really nice and your date would probably be super impressed but there are plenty of amazing restaurants in the area
The place looks open and one can move easily around the restaurant without bumping into everyone and everything
I recommend this restaurant for a special occasion for any sushi lover and for any occasion for the diner who can both appreciate and afford fine sushi
I love the food at all of Los Dos Molinos restaurants
Also the place is run by the family and you can usually find one of them any given day at the restaurant eager to please
My boyfriend and I went here for my birthday dinner because we live close by and I always wanted to try the place because it looks busy and I like that you can see into the restaurant when you drive by
I went to this restaurant for happy hour from the recommendations on yelp
My first visit was for restaurant week
Fresh ingredients and well put together dishes definitely makes this restaurant a place for foodies as well as anyone who just wants a good meal
Not to mention our family foodie db's SIL Christine T recommended this restaurant
Well he's Chinese kinda - haha and recommended this restaurant because he grew-up coming here with his parents
The most important part of the visit besides the art was the youngster Anyone under 35 is a youngster to us but he was around 25 was down to earth and made you feel it wasn't the usual fake  restaurant dialogue
Another success for Fox Restaurant Concepts True Food is the place to eat healthy without sacrificing taste
3 solid stars not bad not extraordinary not worth rushing back toTo me the Tempe Market place along with this restaurant are very very touristy
This is a fun restaurant and a great place to celebrate a birthday
I have to say that I am usually not one to rave over a chain restaurant but I do really love z-Tejas
I rolled into the restaurant around 845 they close at 9 and placed an order to go
We're spending OUR money at your business and you can't even treat us with some gratitude when we place an order to go especially when there are other restaurants competing for business
I would love to go to a restaurant and say lay some thing in front of me that doesn't weigh me down
My BFF's favorite dessert is cobbler and she loves the whole soul food vibe so for her Christmas present it was decided i would treat her to lunch at your restaurant
The lack of tasty treats in the area definitely contributes to the buzz around this place since the only other decent restaurants of the non-chain variety are in 'Downtown' Chandler
We both decided that there were too many other restaurants in the area to give this place a second chance
they've got speakers all over the place and it's not a big restaurant
I know these types of restaurants are not the cleanest places but they did not even make an effort at hygiene and sanitation
We both visited during restaurant week and had the salad with apples which was a wonderful start
This outdoor restaurant's second floor overlooks the visitor-ridden streets of Old Town Scottsdale and nearby the Scottsdale Civic Center Mall which gives me plenty of fodder for people watching
I also love the fact that the PV mall area is NOT a parking or traffic fiasco like Desert Ridge and it still has the fantastic restaurants and shopping
This restaurant had a beautiful interior design that makes you really comfortable just sit and enjoy all the lovely Hawaiian theme and feels like you're in a beach
I kept hearing about how good this place was and with such a limited amount of sushi restaurants nearby my husband and I decided to try it
The place is a modern contemporary restaurant which was a little unusual especially for a Thai restaurant
If PastaBAR ever decides to add a lovely cream sauce to their menu I will definitely make this a five star restaurant in my book
I highly recommend the restaurant to any seafood lover
This place reminds me of the typical Pho restaurants in California
It's very much a Vietnamese restaurant they even have some menu options you find at any other Vietnamese place in Phoenix
Other than the epic Torta Del Rey this little restaurant is just one of those great hole-in-wall places that has the best food in the area
The place itself has the old southwest decor and some pretty murals of random Mexican traditional paintings; overall a very beautiful restaurant
The space has been the scene of many restaurant deaths the signage is terrible the parking lot is awkward to get into and even knowing exactly where the place is located it's hard to see from the east on Indian School
I seldom go South and West from work but last week I was headed that way for lunch and spotted this place Yelp has made me much better at seeing restaurants and thought strip mall Mexican need to check this out
I trust all the good reviews here on yelp and I love the ambiance in Dick's Hideaway but I believe that a good restaurant should be consistent and considerate to its guests to live up to the standard
Having lived in Italy I normally don't go to Italian restaurants because I don't like to pay for food I can make better and cheaper at home but Miele's is the one place I will go to spend my money
They were definitely different than other restaurants I've visited the shrimp were placed whole and the pork was almost sugar coated in small pea-sized lumps
Not a restaurant I would frequent but may visit occasionally if I'm in the area
restaurant to be the better of the few in the area plus it's around the corner from my place
Without a lot of good places to eat in the area it is nice to find a cheap sit down restaurant where you can feel comfortable eating alone
I explained that the reason we were there is our Marine friend had heard about this place from his sister and wanted to enjoy his first beer at his restaurant
I don't know if it was because the people loved the restaurant so much or if it was because Sarah Mclachlan was about to play live but every table was filled
It's a reality of modern dining and I love it when restaurants don't treat you like a pariah for requesting your own ticket
I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a little hole in the wall latin american restaurant with great food

I went out earlier this week and I had a good time there but it's not a restaurant it's a good place to have some drinks and karaoke
I just love watching the food go round and round the restaurant
I had a much better experience in my repeat visit to this restaurant
This restaurant and bar is a great place for dinner or just meeting friends
I also found this place on restaurant
I was visiting Scottsdale and searched high and low for a trendy Sunday brunch restaurant that had good drink specials and fun music and Yelp definitely took me there
The inside is very small looking more like a take-out place than a real restaurant
While I understand that this is a chain restaurant I still think there are much better Mexican food places to go to than Arriba
I love tapas style restaurants so this was right up my alley but as is normally the case with ice restaurants and especially tapas places the prices were sky high
If you are visiting or celebrating a special occasion this restaurant is the place
I visited this restaurant for the first time last week
Definitely on par with restaurants in NY and in some cases much better than some overly hyped places in NY I'm looking at you No
I would love a restaurant like this to open near my home
I do love restaurants that are in converted houses don't ask me why
You won't be disappointed I leave this restaurant with a full belly and smile of contentment every visit
I had high hopes since this is a Fox restaurant and I like so many of their places but was very disappointed
Decided to give this place a try since I found a gift certificate on Restaurant
I love it when a unique new bar/restaurant opens within walking distance of my house so I was very excited to try this place
I love Matt Pool's restaurants so I keep going back to Giant in hopes that it won't disappoint
It made me smile to get back to San Francisco pull up a chair for a quick review and see this place is trending #1 for Best of Yelp Restaurants
Now I know that I have higher expectations of many places especially restaurants that charge an average of $26 a plate and while I understand we were there at eight pm on a Saturday night I felt really unappreciated and unwelcome
Most asian restaurants especially with the vibe this place was giving off like it wanted to be reminiscent of the Chinese Restaurants back east where you are loaded up with all the crispy fried noodles you can eat and some smooth black tea
I thought of it more of a bagel place with some deli dishes rather than a full blown restaurant
I can't really write enough nice things about this restaurant and the fact that you have a 20% chance of seeing me there at any given time should testify to my true love
Dolmas seem like pakora  within Indian restaurants in that they nearly all have them  except  for the insane places that have them only at weekends but you never quite know what you're going to get
My boyfriend loves sushi and I don't eat seafood so going to these types of restaurants can be quite disappointing
However this place has the most extensive menu I've seen at a Japanese restaurant that is known as a sushi bar
Overall it's pricey compared to other sushi places however the ambiance of the restaurant and upscale choices on the menu make it worth it
If you're looking for a great place to take out of towners for some refined Latin style cooking and a taste of Old Town Scottsdale this restaurant really can't be beat
On the other hand I feel there is a need to evaluate a restaurant based on its food service and ambiance and not upon my elation merely at having a GF place to eat
It's not an everyday kind of place but hopefully McGrath will find success here as a destination restaurant much like Roaring Fork was when he was there
The place itself feels a bit like a fast food restaurant
I met a good friend of mine while here on business who had worked with a lady in Tucson who recommended her cousin Justina's restaurant in Phoenix
The restaurant name is perfect for this place
Secondly and it's nearly impossible to avoid due to the size of the restaurant and the proximity to the kitchen the place can get a bit hot and stuffy
The wait is because the place is tiny but the pizzas take time and any bigger of a restaurant would lower the quality of the pizza
As a Chinese myself I would definitely recommend this restaurant to any Chinese food lover
The inside was lovely for a Chinese restaurant
Really attentive and gave great recommendations on local beers the restaurant stocked
I've sadly become one of those people who turn to the Food Network for restaurant recommendations
they had a baby grand on one side and apparently they have music in the evenings - not sure if that ends up being overwhelming given the size of the restaurant or if it gives it that little something extrai got the spiced butternut squash soup and the baja salad - my dining companions got the turkey & brie sandwich as recommended by the server and they raved about itspiced butternut squash soup i would give this soup a 5 - it comes with a bruleed ginger marshmallow which is what really intrigued me - it was SO very yummy
I love that these little restaurants are popping up in the Coronado hood-- thanks to the owners for doing it
Only people who truly appreciate what it means to eat at a family restaurant will get this place
I hope that the owners read this review take heed and make some changes so that some of us who loved the restaurant so much in the past can return
Sure I'd eat there again some time but this place can't compete even with the average Chinese restaurant in the Bay Area
Given that there are lots of good Asian restaurants nearby to chose from I hope to see them do some innovating from a service and experience perspective as other local Pho places are progressing in that direction
I agree with another poster who loved the urban vibe of this restaurant/bar
This place makes me feel like I'm taking a journey away from the valley and right into a neighborhood restaurant in Chicago
This place is one of the most overrated restaurants in Scottsdale
I can name a dozen Japanese restaurants around the country including mom and pop robata dives neighborhood sushi restaurants and high end places like Nobu that do seafood and robata better than this place
Love the restaurant on Central but a tad bit far and expensive for frequent consumption so this smaller different twist on classic Italian is just right for me
i found the place obnoxiously loud with cheesy background music that was totally superfluous and did not add anything to the restaurant but rubbish noise
I feel that this place is gonna get popular or at least should it seems like a family owned business not some chain restaurant that you'd go to everyday
This was my first visit here during AZ Restaurant Week everything was the same on the menu - no prix fixe - it was just cheaper than it typically is by about $10
although I did notice that about 20% of my omelet was missing when I returned from a brief visit to the clean and shiny restroomsShe said there was a commotion in the restaurant while I was gone and when she turned back from gawking part of my Lunfast omelet was missing
Plan to try something not so staple next time like Tiger Crying had that dish at only 1 other Thai restaurant I've been to & loved it
With the very reasonable restaurant Cafe Zuzu downstairs and the popular bar next to it plus the frequently busy pool for people watchers this is definitely an entertaining place to stay
It was actually closed on the day that I arrived to check it out so I just looked through the windows into the restaurant and when I saw their semi-private partial glass enclosed dining room I knew this was the place
Let it be said though if you are looking for atmosphere or a contemporary hip restaurant this is not your place
However I am NOT a fan of* paying a RIDICULOUS amount of money like $5 and up for a very very small burger* the piss poor parking situation of the restaurant and old town in general* the service when the place gets busy
My first impression of this place was that it looked like a restaurant that in its heyday was considered a Scottsdale gem but has failed to change with the times and has turned into a perfect candidate for Food Network's Restaurant Impossible
The only other thing the restaurant has going for itself is that it's a family run mom & pop place and not a chain
Amados is one of those places you might see featured in the movie Clerks if Kevin Smith decided to use a restaurant instead of a convenience store
Unusual for a Vietnamese restaurant I hold this place to the same standard of cleanliness I expect from a Chinese restaurant if it tastes good and doesn't make me sick it's a-okay
I have grown up in Asian restaurants and really despite all the negative reviews this place isn't that scary
It being one of my favorite foods I've been to a great many restaurants for pho and have tried to find a place that can fill that big beef noodle soup void in my heart
All and all I'd say I much prefer other semi-vegetarian restaurants such as Pita Jungle over this place
I loved this restaurant although it may be a chain not sure
I'd come here again for sure and recommend that you try this traditional french restaurant out
Not 5 stars like a fine dining type restaurant - 5 stars because they do their type of ethnic food with unfailing perfection and authenticity and consistency across multiple visits
There isn't much that distinguishes this place from other Chinese restaurants
I know this is a fast food diy concept restaurant but for the prices and the fact that there are employees doing nothing a little attention would have done well by this place
If you are a restauranteur looking for locally-roasted beans or a coffee fiend who wants to support your local roaster look this place up
I was taken to this restaurant as a must see place during a business trip
One of the first things you notice about this place when you step in the door is how strikingly it resembles 'Houstons' -- the set of chain restaurants
So if you're looking for a good pizza and a nice restaurant Grimaldis is a place to try
Overall my experience was satisfactory I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys tasty meats and gooey cheese
OMG I am always on the hunt for those elusive 5 star restaurants especially in-out-of-the way places like strip malls
Alessia's makes up for ALL of those dreadful chain restaurants we visited in Phoenix that shall go nameless
Having visited the restaurant at the Promenade off Frank Lloyd Wright and also the one in Sedona I would say this was the middle experience
We love wood fired pizza restaurants and this one was quaint
The only dim sum restaurant I have experienced out here is C FU Gourmet their selection is greater but their downfall is the food is usually cool to warm and the place has been steadily getting worse
I don't expect Mexican food in restaurants to be like what we have at home so I don't go with preconceived ideas to judge a place but food should be hot and I should not have to pick hard things out of my teeth as I eat it
I cannot wait for Mexican Standoff to open it is the next restaurant that Peter is opening and from the sounds of it I will love it
I tried Nick's because I got a groupon and I love trying new restaurants this way
This is absolutely my new favorite restaurant and probably the only italian restaurant I would recommend to people as being as good as mine
On my first visit the restaurant was very slow and there was only 1 other table
There are a plethora of restaurants in Desert Ridge and you'd think that this place would have a bit of a pick up in business on Saturday night
Save for the prickly pear margarita this place is just like any other chain restaurant
Overall I like this place and the restaurant itself is nice clean with friendly service
If you don't have a lot of time to wait and just want a quick dinner it's also possible to phone in your order or walk in order visit the shops around the restaurant and return in ten minutes to a piping hot order
I understand the night time crowd is more lively and that the place becomes more of a bar/restaurant
Went to the restaurant on Saturday at 800 PM to try this new place
We ordered the following for breakfastBan Xeo Pan-fried flour crepe with shrimp pork and bamboo shootsBanh Mi Trung Rang French bread sandwich with fried egg omeletteChao Thap Cam Rice porridge with shrimp pork squid fish ball and imitation crabThe Good NewsThis is one of my favorite places to eat I have become a regular here and it is the best Vietnamese restaurant I have been to thus far in southern Arizona
This restaurant wouldn't be out of place in Little Italy in NYC the North End of Boston or Federal Hill in Providence
If you ever feel like a drive or are in the area this place is great if it were in Scottsdale it would rival any Fox Concept Restaurant and is just generally awesome
If there was one restaurant I'd recommend in the entire Phoenix metro for a great meal/experience this would be at the top of the list
The price is now the same as a sit down Mexican restaurant with real plates and the food is microwaved and served like a fast food place
If there's a better restaurant serving fresh sometimes creative breakfast fare in Phoenix I'd love to know about it
I love this hotel and its accompanying restaurant Gallo Blanco so much that I spent my wedding night here
Notes Some reviews say this is close to the light rail and other restaurants but I'd say it's set pretty far back from Central Ave almost a mile where most of those nicer places and the LR station is
She also helped up each pick a desert Just an odd little place Japanese and Italian noodles in a restaurant with plenty an Eiffel Tower decoration and a bright red British phone booth
We don't like to repeat restaurants on vacation but we visited this restaurant on our spring training vacation this year and last year
We will definitely be back to try more of their dishes and would definitely recommend it to anybody looking for a new restaurant to try
It is considered fine dining but its not anything you can't get at other restaurants but what I like about this place is that it actually feels less corporate
Before heading over to the restaurant that night I'd consulted Yelp just to see if there was something redeeming that I'd missed on my previous visit to Los Olivos
I withheld the fifth star only because this place was the noisiest restaurant I can remember being trapped in
My visit on Saturday afternoon was probably my third or fourth time to have eaten at this restaurant
A friend and former co-worker introduced me to this place saying it reminded her of her mother's restaurant food
A common theme between this restaurant and their Peoria location is slow drink service and I cannot understand how that can be when the place is 70% empty at the start of lunch service 11am
I love a restaurant that has hardy dinner dishes for lunch
I would definitely recommend this restaurant - great atmosphere and even better food
I wasn't expecting much from this place as we went there as plan B when our first choice restaurant had an hour long wait
Plus it would suck to name a restaurant Campus Vista or Scary Place Where Carolina's Is
for arizona this place is probably one of the best authentic vietnamese restaurants in town
We love Thai food and have pretty high standards when it comes to Asian cuisine and this restaurant definitely exceeded our expectations
The a/c was not working correctly so it was unpleasant inside my group considered going to a different restaurant in Tempe Market Place but stayed since none of us had eaten there before and when the appetizer guac arrived we thought we felt some cool air but it only last for the next 20 minutes
I highly recommend this restaurant STILL and I am delighted to say they are still open and doing a brisk business every time we go in
The service was fast all the servers were Chinese goes without saying in general but after visiting a few Scottsdale 'Chinese' restaurants it's no longer a given
Before I had visited this restaurant ramen to me was the small packages at the grocery store which aren't that great
I would recommend this place to anybody who would like to try restaurant-style ramen
I have eaten really great Greek food in so cal and this place rivals the both street vendors and five star restaurants alike
The decor of the place is unique in the entry of the restaurant has a fish tank in the floor
I love that there are restaurants pushing healthy food
I love that this restaurant has an endless menu of vegetarian options which is an odd in a good way feeling while trying to decide what to order when eating out
I highly recommend this restaurant and we will definitely be back especially for special occasions
If you're dying to try Ninfa's in Glendale In the old North restaurant building next to AJ's - and *not* recommended btw - then I'd say go visit soon - I can't see any way how they can remain in business with the price points they desire and the portion sizes they serve
we got to the restaurant at 840pm and were told that we'd have to come back in 3 hours at 1140pm keep in mind the place closes at 10 i guess they just stop taking names at 10
Overall I would visit this restaurant if you live close by and order from the happy hour menu
I found the restaurant to be much cleaner than on my initial visit and the service was so attentive and so quick
The place is very well lit and bright and it gives an extra umph to the restaurant
There is nothing special about this place except I found their service in both their retail space and restaurant superb
This place is different from the other Bianco restaurants and is my favorite
After visits on three different occasions I can honestly say that for independent restaurants destinations here in the Valley Tuck Shop is at the top of my list
I loved the idea of going to a restaurant where you could feel good about everything on the menu in terms of its healthfulness
I loved the vibe and decor of the restaurant
Finally a neighborhood restaurant that is just a great place to get a simple meal that is good and gives good value
Chopsticks were the the cheapest wooden kind--it has no place in this type of restaurant where the food is premium
I've been gone a year now and have a long list of restaurants I MUST eat at the next time I come home for a visit
I guess for me the joy of visiting an ethnic place is sampling a bit of the culture gastronomically and through the restaurant's atmosphere - and there doesnt seem to be much joy here
I usually don't write reviews on chain restaurants but I had to because I eat here frequently and love their tuna salad
Even better; It turns out this place is one of those great family owned strip mall restaurants that valley residents should be more aware of
Nonetheless I can't walk away from a restaurant feeling like I just destroyed my body and recommend it
This place easily makes the top ten restaurants to visit while we're in Tempe
I highly recommend this restaurant just know it is expensive but the quality of the food and service are worth paying for
The place looked like your usual seafood and grill restaurant
My recommendations try the green chile plate aka chile verde at any other Mexican restaurant
I read up on it and was really intrigued by the history behind the place and how this might be one of the oldest restaurants in Phoenix they must be doing something right yeah
Too bad I can't think of another Jamaican restaurant in Phoenix I'd love to try it next time
I'm a bit of a germ-a-fob so you wont usually find me at buffets very often but I had to try this place after our waitress while dinning at a fine dinning sea food restaurant recommended we try Pacific Seafood Buffet
Again a family owned restaurant that I absolutely love
There was artwork all around the restaurant and the closeness made me feel like I was in a very unique environment that you could only find at a place like Fate
You know what I love most about dining out at restaurants
Service was great - since we told them it was our first time coming to the restaurant & we were locals they gave us a 20% card for our next visit
As has been the case for most FOX restaurants I have visited the food is consistently interesting and good
Marlene was a wonderful tour guide and Jessica added all of her food knowledge of the restaurants we were visiting
Ate each establishment we had someone from the restaurant explain what were eating and a little about their place
For an appetizer I have never encountered Siam Wraps at any other Thai restaurant but the minced chicken wrapped in lettuce is reason enough to visit
The prices here are LOW here for a BBQ restaurant & for this first visit I ordered one of their Lunch Specials which for me was their Moist Brisket with a Potato Salad side & a big cup of help-yourself lemonade
A definite restaurant not only to return to but to recommend to friends
We love to be able to go out to dinner but its gotten to the point where most restaurants are family friendly which usually entails jerk kids and parents that have learned to tune them out
I am not normally a fan of more upscale restaurants but I think i might be giving more of those types of places a try after eating at Red Lobster
I had searched for this place on the Internet because I had been here years ago and it was a themed restaurant
The place also serves their fountain drinks in recycled cups and offers a recycling station in the restaurant
The staff is friendly and informative at both places but Supremo has more of a feel of a roach coach that just happens to be inside of a building while Sabroso embraces the general restaurant and service concept better
The restaurant is very nicely decorated and the family that runs the place is super nice and friendly
The ambiance is beautiful the outside tables are lit how you wish every restaurant you visit would be
I love when a restaurant leaves me excited to come back and try some more and sadly Havana Cafe has not done that for me
Love this restaurant - their dim sum is delicioussss
I live in Northern Virginia and whenever I visit the Phoenix/Scottsdale area I make visiting this restaurant a priority
Only negative is that their website doesn't offer a view of their menu but this place made me feel like I wasn't actually in some standard restaurant in Phoenix and is a great addition to the Phoenix scene
I love sushi but try to avoid the RA sushi restaurants
This place is perfect for tourists although we did meet a couple of friendly locals keen to hear about our road trip so far and at least you know you're getting the real-deal in an original diner rather than a tacky imitation or chain restaurant
with only one or two exceptions a menu the size of my novel and a fun atmosphere makes this place a fun restaurant to come to
This place is great from the restaurant to the to-go service to the grocery store
Many Mexican places have moved more towards making you pay for the chips and salsa so I appreciate them keeping with my all-time favorite Mexican restaurant tradition I have had a few of their entrees as well and the food is superbly made and beautifully presented
I love reading others reviews about my favorite restaurants
I love it when I go into any ethnic restaurant and see more people of that particular ethnicity than your run of the mill American
We typically have little faith in hotel restaurants but this place was fantastic
As for the restaurant itself  it's a nice looking place but the food just doesn't live up to it
If you want the awesome authentic taste of a real hole-in-the-wall mexican restaurant but with the speed of a XXX-ertos minus the Hepatitis this is the place to go
It's on the list of restaurants that get a repeat visit from me
I fell in love with this place after the guy who was going to stain my floors sent me down town to view his work at a new restaurant
This place isn't really a restaurant its more like a fast food joint with tables
My problem with this place is the same problem I have with a lot of Thai food restaurants in the area
The restaurant was very clean and the booths made the place very comfortable
As much as we love this restaurant there are two things I should also mention
This restaurant is fit for those that think Taco Bell is a great place for Mexican food
Scottsdale is a ridiculous town full of places that take themselves too seriously and people that think their chain restaurants are 'quirky' and interesting
I love the Green restaurant in Scottsdale but it's so far from where I live
The restaurant is very rustic in decor but has big screen tvs all over the place so people can watch the games
Penciled in at number 22 was this place - a charming restaurant in a charming town that I'd often taken out of town guests over the years
I freakin' loved this place now I know why my very good friend Holly basically LIVES at this restaurant
That being said I've never been to this restaurant on a weekend and probably wouldn't recommend it unless you are already hard-of-hearing
This place is the most authentic Chinese restaurant I've seen outside of L
I waited three weeks to write this because I wanted to make sure I was not overreacting to the experience but I feel more strongly than ever that having eaten in some of the finest restaurants in New York and overseas this place is absolutely appalling
I visited this restaurant a couple of weeks ago for breakfast on a Monday and was impressed not by the food all breakfast buffets are basically the same but by my waitress named Stephanie
**Try 'A Different Pointe of View' --the restaurant at the top of the hill GREAT views of the city and an all around beautiful place for a couple or a group of people who want a classy place to eat or have a few drinks
The family is always so friendly and they always remember us it's just a nice local family-owned and run restaurant we and love supporting them
All in all a charming place and nice find of a new restaurant and gracious hosts
I'd recommend the restaurant to anyone - even though the resort it was in didn't look like it was doing too well
We love French food and always go to a French restaurant for our anniversary and 3
I would also love to have a nice ethnic restaurant in the neighborhood that I can go to on occasion for  a little variety
I definitely didn't love this restaurant like other yelpers
This place is in for a short run in No Scottsdale we have too many fabulous restaurant choices
The outdoor patio area has a big fire pit along with the fireplaces from the previous Earl's restaurant
I highly recommend this restaurant that is so much more than a restaurant
This restaurant has the concept of restaurant and marketplace nailed
The restaurant I am referring to was a little place called Silver Dragon south of Dunlap on 19th Ave
OK so I don't normally go to restaurants that are in strip malls in industrial areas but I heard my assistant raving about this place and off we went
I ate at a place similar to this in San Francisco in a tiny little shop over 15 years ago and have wondered why somebody hasn't done a restaurant like this nationwide
Everybody in the restaurant went out of their way to  make your visit a very pleasant one and they did succeed in doing that
Unassuming from the exterior in a strip mall with such high end boutiques as Enterprise Rent-A-Car and sharing a zip code with a cowboy tourist targeted bar that features bull riding of the non-mechanical variety Binkley's is a tiny destination restaurant that seems slightly uncomfortable with its surroundings and we were equally slightly out of place with our sinusoidal experience not for control freaks- Greeted by name due to party size and expected arrival time being unique resulted in feeling like VIPs confused by their own fame- Sending away the sommelier a bit dejected when we unanimously declined wine- Realizing our head waitress was a bizarro version of a friend from back home- Opting for the highest end 5-6 course tasting menus $82 - $89 wine pairing $40-50 extra like non-confused VIPs but skipping the foie gras surcharge +$14- Being thankful of no collective food restrictions or allergies to impede chef creativity- Impressed by a nearly endless train of experimental amuse-bouches- Processing that we were 3-4 courses in without seeing anything we ordered- Recalling that some of us were no stranger to this dining style when it's called omakase except then there's no illusion of input into the majority of the meal- Hitting our stride with the hot appetizer including a superb soft shell crab course- Enjoying the best black cod I've ever eaten in a sea of unusual but not quite as enjoyable candidates- Starting to feel full around the penultimate course an amuse of chocolate souffle - Understanding without bitterness that soda refills were not free $2
While I was visiting she told me she finally found a great Japanese restaurant
I am a visitor to AZ for business and have grown so tired of restaurant food
Now this is not a cheap place to eat but I've rarely found a good French restaurant that's easy on the wallet
I would highly recommend this restaurant if you are in the area
I love it when a restaurant gives me a big glass of ice water with my meal
As a frequent to Japanese restaurants for a few years now this is the 2nd place in the valley that I've had such fresh sashimi
So while visiting in-laws in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area I was ecstatic to see that I had a few locations while browsing through restaurant options out here
I appreciated the variety of vegetables and the fact that they had veggie tacos in the first place many more standard Mexican restaurants do not
Having heard about this combined market/restaurant and seen it on Howard Seftel's list of top Middle Eastern restaurants in Phoenix I decided to check this place out
But if I feel like splurging a hundred bucks on a romantic meal with someone I just don't understand why anyone would do so at this national chain wannabe-slash-poser restaurant instead of a truly nice unique authentic place elsewhere in the Valley
But that was a good experience for me so now I want to order one of those every time I visit a pho restaurant from now on
I have been waiting for this restaurant to open as I am a huge Andrew Weil fan and love the Sam Fox restaurants in Scottsdale
Hole in the wall type restaurants usually scare me because the quality and cleanliness is questionable but after several visits to this place I am wary no longer
What's this place know for is their blue wasabi just like the name of the restaurant
Meaning its somewhat hard to find - you could easily walk past this place and not even know it was a restaurant or that 30+ people are inside dinning and drinking away
-- oooh they were both delicious however I recommend the later one more just cause it's very unique to this restaurant
I also love that they have iced mint tea which I've only ever been offered in one other valley restaurant
I decided to go for a new Italian place and this small restaurant caught my eye
This restaurant is typically a first come first serve place
This place strikes one as a little small but it actually is a mid-large size restaurant
The interior of Viet Kitchen make it seem like a 4 star restaurant although I think the massive TV on the wall needs to be replaced by a painting
I love non-chain restaurants to begin with and this place exemplifies the attention to detail and wholly pulled-together ambiance that a great one-off place could be
I love salsa and bachata music and they often play this in the restaurant
This place is far from being the restaurant I want to come back to
There are so many great restaurants of similar pricing in Scottsdale - I recommend you head to one of those and pass by the White Chocolate Grill
There's just something in a restaurant's name that will lure me for a visit
i've been to a fair share of mexi restaurants living in az and cali for the past 10 years and this place is by far THE BEST
I just love that I can go to a mexican restaurant and feel like I am getting something somewhat healthy
Yard house is the best restaurant in the place due to its food and outdoor seating atmosphere
Not a place you would expect when going into a strip mall but we are finding more and more restaurants that have great food in these strip mall locations
I'd discovered CPC through our fair site looking for new restaurants to try while visiting Arizona over Thanksgiving break
I would definitely not recommend this restaurant to anyone
The restaurants need major makeover so plain and duck tape all over the places unless they are planning to do so
I've loved the restaurants and the grocery is cool also
and am a regular sushi eater at some of the best sushi restaurants in a city that is known for and loves its food
I wouldn't expect that sort of risk at a chain restaurant in Phoenix of all places but it's good to know that such options are available
By the way there were no screaming kids in the place--maybe because it's a bar/restaurant  Thank goodness
My husband and I were out and about in Glendale and after looking this place up on Yelp and seeing some of the first reviews saying things like Best Indian food on he west side and our favorite Indian restaurant we decided to give this a try since we both love Indian food
So my friend and I have been looking for a Thai restaurant that makes Thai boat noodles in AZ and seeing that this place was recommended by alot of people we decided to try it out
My boyfriend and I love Valle Luna not sure if its because we both grew up on the restaurant or what but they always satisfy
Love the salsa which is always a good indicator about whether or not the food will be worth the calories at a Mexican food restaurant
Staff was entirely unlike most Mexican places - vast majority of people were caucasian or gringo if you prefer and that raises an eyebrow in an ethnic restaurant
It's a huge turnoff for me when restaurants serve water that tastes like metal but this place had water that tasted like SmartWater
I never thought that a chain restaurant would become our go-to place but we've been to Hillstone about once a week for the past few years--we reluctantly followed it from the Esplanade location but I have to say that the new space really won us over--and it's just so consistently excellent
This place defines a hole in the wall restaurant and produces the best food and experience it can offer with out selling out
I have made three visits to this restaurant in the Central Corridor
For a restaurant that is first and foremost a place to get food and also serves alcohol to be serving their foodstuff on paper plates is disastrous
It's been 4 days since my visit to Over Easy and I'm still trying to figure out why only half of this restaurant is indoors w/ A/C
I love the FOX restaurants so my boyfriend made reservations for valentine's day
Overall I wouldn't recommend the restaurant
The restaurant itself looked very clean -- pretty basic looking place -- not a place to go for ambience
I guess what it comes down to is that I can't knock the place for being bad because it certainly wasn't but there are at least three other Asian restaurants and an Oregano's in the same tiny strip mall and I kind of wish I chose any of them instead
An enjoyable place to get out and wander- nice restaurants surrounding it and a pleasant place to spend time
I had sushi in the sushi restaurant within the hotel I'll be honest I found some other higher-rated sushi places on Yelp that were relatively close and I was planning on stepping out for dinner but the music and general atmosphere was so cool I decided to hang out and try the place inside
The service was prompt the restaurant is so small that it is hard to be forgotten teas were refilled and even though the place was full we received our food in 15 minutes
Not that my reviews are the end all be all but I do like to give props to places that really are top to bottom great restaurants
So good I almost have to go back and lower the ratings of 5 star restaurants just to emphasize that this place isn't playing around
my only recommendation would be that if you're a party of two don't sit at the last table in the restaurant because the mister leaks
The inside was nice and basic tables and chairs a older phoenix home converted to a restaurant a nice cozy place
We probably won't go back to this place with all the strange issues we had and the prices are just a little too high especially considering the huge number of competing Mexican restaurants
If you are vegan or vegetarian and want a NICE meal I would highly recommend this restaurant
I know that children in the equation is not the restaurant's fault I blame the parents who think it's ok to bring small children to a public place then not supervise them but it adds to the overall rating of my experience so I'm being honest
I do give the place props on decor as the paintings statues and lighting throughout the restaurant are impressive and reminiscent of the culture of Mexico
I know people think I don't go to OG because it is a chain restaurant  But I love this place
To say the least Pizzeria Bianco is a well-reviewed well-loved and die-hard restaurant
I love how the fountain coke always tastes really good here and better than it does at other quick restaurants
The grounds are beautiful the restaurants on the property had good food and I feel in love with the Salvatore Ferragamo Tuscan Soul scent of products they use
It's not too often that I give a restaurant five stars but there was something about this place
This is still a good restaurant but it is not the stellar place it once was
You gotta love a restaurant that cares about quality of food taste and presentation
The place itself is a typical chain restaurant so you're going to get that casual relaxed vibe
While I thought it was kind of strange to describe this place in terms of nearby restaurants it really is an accurate description
I highly recommend this restaurant if you're in the area and hungry for some delicious Thai food full of mouth-watering flavors
That was my first time to the Elements and I was totally in love with the restaurant's location and surrounding
Also it's important to note that this restaurant's title in Yelp is confusing -- they started as a catering company and the food was so amazing that they opened a little takeout marketplace
After much pondering and a couple of meals at mediocre Mexican places here in Phoenix I remembered that I have never written a review of what is considered by most to be the premiere Mexican restaurant in the valley Barrio Cafe
I do want to say that as spacious and grandeur this restaurant is i completely agree with the statement this place is a collection of intimate spaces made by the owner
Again strange that such a perceived top notch hotel/restaurant would not be up on this standard given the place was empty thought they could/would focus soley on us
I bring all of my out-of-town visitors to this restaurant pushing the sangria and combinations to all who dine with me
YES the bar is often the place restaurants make the most profit
I do love the fireplace area and we do eat at some of these restaurants pretty often because it's so close to our house
Brio is a loud restaurant - not a good place for conversation but even with all the bustle and noise we still ended up having a great time
For this place being an asian restaurant service was actually not bad
I'm so very disappointed with how this situation was handled and that the owner clearly does not care about keeping costumers that have been frequenting his restaurant since it opened -   I know this is not a food review but although I love the food here I will not be returning to Stax since I have been treated so poorly
The owner Wally and his son's run the 2 restaurants and treat everyone that walks in the door like an old friend--which I love
This place is most definitely not your typical fast food restaurant
First off loved the inside of the restaurant
I feel it necessary to write a review about this place as I am a huge fan and had a very disappointing experience at another take-out restaurant in the city
This restaurant is located inside Scottsdale's upscale mall but it oozes that hampton / beachy vibe which def helps earn brownie points with me  They also have a decent steak selection for the heavy carnivores so I think it's a must visit if you are in town
The friendly family that owns this place are from southern Italy and they def know how to cook and run a great restaurant
I really liked the place and god knows it fills a very vacant niche in the Phoenix restaurant market but
Two years after visiting this restaurant I still remember what we ordered and how we enjoyed the food and atmosphere
The place was small inside and lacked much ambiance but made for a great delivery/ to-go restaurant
Once you consider the price $65/person with uncorking tax and tip I have to say that although I loved the atmosphere and the idea of this restaurant I am not likely to go back
At this point I feel like I've visited my fair share of -ertos restaurants in Phoenix and I should have known better to get chicken + tortilla + sauce + sour cream + token cabbage instead of something more complex and interesting
I do not want to compare it to elsewhere as even I would say other places I have lived in the USA including Chicago have South Indian restaurants that can perhaps compete with this place and win
The last time I had great South american food was a place called Inferno in La Jolla CA but they are now a new restaurant
While I love tapas style dining if this were the only tapas restaurant that there was I would gladly forego the experience
He always complains about Mexican restaurants in Phoenix not being good enough but with Mi Patio he was in love
Brio is the perfect restaurant to visit after a long day of shopping
To my delight this place had stevia which was actually very impressive because most restaurants in my opinion or sorta cheap and rarely supply anything other than cancer causing equal sweet-n-low or belly bloating sugar
While on a business trip to Florence and friend recommended 2 Mexican food restaurants in Florence
In summary this restaurant has a lot of potential with the food being reasonably good in a nice place
I was in town to visit relatives last Saturday and we wanted to find a great Mexican restaurant within a 4 mile radius
You can never have too many restaurants by the LRT and having this one so close to the Vet/College stop will be great for football lovers ASU students and LRT riders like myself
Not only will I never visit this restaurant again but I will try to disuade everyone I can from going
I've been to a few others of these kind of restaurant/theatre places in Alaska and Washington and Studio Movie Grill is doing just fine with this concept
I think that just like the Olive Garden and other mediocre chain restaurants people who frequent places like this prefer quantity over quality
We love how beautiful the restaurant is both inside and on the patio
I have been very dissapointed lately in the quality of the Meixican food restaurants we have visited
We REALLY love Vietnamese food and I particularly love finding a hidden gem of a restaurant
Entering the restaurant I sensed a jubilant aroma--that's one of the first things I do when I enter a place of eating I try to catch a whiff of the place
One thing I love about the corporate restaurant model is that service is often reliably better than the local places
I love love love did I mention LOVE fox concept restaurants
This place is one of my of top Thai restaurant choices in the valley specially the locations is the most convenient to me
With so many other locally-focused and inspired restaurants all over the valley I would certainly recommend against dinner at Lon's
for the record parking and traffic sucks real bad at this restaurant location in the tempe market place
This is yet another place that imposes a mandatory tip for large parties - that tip of course is your penalty for bringing more clientele into the establishment and forcing the restaurant to make just that much more money
I wish the owners would open up a  place in South Phoenix -- we are hungry for  non-chain restaurants
As to why anyone who lives in Phoenix would want to spend their money at this place when there are literally hundreds of quaint authentic family owned Mexican restaurants in every part of the city is beyond me
But for everyone else who actually possesses an ounce of dignity when it comes to where you eat please do yourself and the local ma-pa Mexican restaurants a favor and visit one of them instead
That lobby is still there with the same stand-up video games and circa 20s sofas reupholstered of course and the restaurant still seems to be a place for an adventurous child to find hidden secrets and exotic places
So by June-ish there will be~ A bar/nightclub~ 3 restaurants I hear that one of them will be a sushi place~ A 24 hour newsstand unheard of for DT that something will be open 24 hrs~ A grocery another much-needed commodity~ A mini skatepark bringing the 'urban' element to RRThey already hold concerts here and withing the next few months they will hold one with 15 bands
Anything on the meu is good but two of my favorites are their fried zucchini and fried mushrooms not the healthiest restaurant out there but well worth it for anyone visiting Tempe and ASU
Coming into this restaurant reminds me of going to some of my favorite places back home
I love the food but I wish you would stop hiring rude entitled hipsters at all of your restaurants
I do love the open concept of the restaurant
Right above the place is school of rock and the bass from the speakers at that venue were enough to be clearly heard inside of this restaurant and even vibrate the walls
The Tapas restaurant in little old Fountain Hills puts this place to shame
This is probably the best ME food that I've had at a local restaurant and the place would definately warrant the coveted 5-stars on the food alone but the afore mentioned atmosphere knocks it down one
I would visit this restaurant everytime I'm in phoenix
As a slow food restaurant Quiessence places a strong emphasis on enjoying each and every part of the a la carte menu
As good as this place is and it is very good I prefer to go to another Thai restaurant for dinner
rrWe got there as the restaurant seemed to be near closing but they still accomodated us which is more than I can say for a lot of other places
The waitresses with eye make-up and other thematic elements of the restaurant didn't do enough to disguise the fact that this place is nothing short of mediocre
The atmosphere may not be as nice as some other That restaurants but the place is still clean and in the end it's all about the food right
She stated that the steam tables were kept at the required by Maricopa county temperature and that the circulating air in the restaurant cooled the food down AFTER it was placed upon our plates
I'd love to learn of it if Anthony opens another restaurant in Scottsdale
Meanwhile does anyone have any recommendations for alternative restaurants for healthy food
I will spare you the rest of the details but I have eaten at more than a few high end restaurants in my day and this one take first place at the worst
Hillstone saved our girls night out and cemented our love of the restaurant
Ample parking but better yet it's just a few blocks' walk southeast of the Roosevelt and Central light rail station so leave the car at home altogether and make an adventure of it perhaps by visiting the Public Market or one of the excellent bars and restaurants nearby
For Arizona this is a step up in experience and i'm happy to see restaurants of such caliber really offering alternatives to places such as Binkley's
Granted it was about 113u00b0 on the day of our visit but if there was air conditioning on in the restaurant I couldn't feel it
We recently visited the Charleston's Restaurant in Chandler/Ahwatukee and had a nice time
This place is great if you just wanna hang out and grab a drink at a place that has more energy than a restaurant bar

We love Fusion their other restaurant so we figured to try it
and I wanted to try one of the fancy restaurants in Scottsdale and I picked Arcadia Farms because it seemed like the perfect place for a quaint little Sunday lunch
I'm not trying to say the place is dirty because I'm sure every restaurant has had a bug come in
If you're more interest in the look and feel of the restaurant then pass on this place
It was very disappointing and my mom was crushed that the only evening we had to visit a Mexican restaurant during my visit to Arizona was such crap

Its hard to find decent Chinese in Arizona in the first place but this restaurant is actually pretty good
First off the place is located in a shitty plaza of decaying shops home to the Yucca Tap Lounge if that's any indication and it's right next door to a Mexican food restaurant that I've never seen anyone enter or leave so it looks like a front for some shady 'business' dealings
I love Thai food and couldn't be happier to try a new restaurant
I would have no problem paying that at a sit-down restaurant but at a place where you order at a counter and bus your own table it seems like too much
Definitely this was a very amiable and delicious restaurant where I am sure we will visit again
I've been to other Pita Jungle the restaurant not the legendary place where few have dared to enter and fewer still made it out alive and this one is really posh and designed for a more comfy feel than the other one I went to

I have seen their amazing Happy Hour and would love to go then because at the end of the day Restaurant Week pricing and all I just feel it's a tad overpriced for the sizes of the portions

I have been to this restaurant at least 10 times and with the exception of the last visit OUTSTANDING food and service

I came here with my girlfriend while visiting her at institute and this was one of the highest reviewed restaurants in the area so we thought it would be a good idea to give it a try
Upon entering the restaurant we couldn't help but notice how outdated the signs are on the wall the decor looks beat up and the place was dead
We picked this place through Yelp and though we cook Indian food I'm Indian at least 3 days a week sometimes we crave for restaurant Indian food
It's a really cute looking restaurant and we were excited to finally try this place out
The place only got a second star because the tangerine chicken was good but I would be hesitant to go here again because apparently my business means nothing to this restaurant
The restaurant is moderately lit with lovely dark wood walls the tables are covered with white tableclothes
Quite an impressive job with the decor - turned what was a former fastfood restaurant into a classy and relaxing place to dine
This was my second trip to this place but will probably be my last because there are just too many good restaurants in the area to waste time eating at run-of-the-mill places like Elephant Bar
This place is one of those old school restaurants tables and feel
All in all I'd say that's as close to Ethiopia as I hope to ever come and the next time someone recommends this restaurant or type of food it will serve as grounds to immediately never speak to them again and put a horrible curse on their sad existence

Places such as Filiberto's or any other restaurant in Phoenix ending in Berto's are usually the restaurants I avoid because of how my stomach feels after eating one of their burritos
Again I go back to my rule about ethnic restaurants - the less people of that ethnicity you see patronizing the place the less likely you are to get a great meal

At lunchtime you walk into the restaurant past the waiter stand to the counter in front of the kitchen to place your order I was standing at the waiter stand for a solid minute like an idiot so you're welcome
It's actually a seasonal restaurant for me unless I have hired a place holder
It may seem like a small thing and it was more of a lobby detail than restaurant detail but the place smells AMAZING
I would highly recommend this restaurant to those who are looking for a vegan or lactose free or gluten free dining experience
The entire place bar and restaurant stood and applauded for several minutes several people went over to shake the two very senior men's hands
Visited this restaurant again November 21 or 22 Thanksgiving ate my sense of time for that week
If you see this place don't walk -- RUN to a different restaurant
Personally in this situation I usually cancel my reservation and go to another restaurant but when you have 20 people with you it is difficult to migrate to other places and feel obligated to wait
The little muffin basket served pre-meal like bread at an Italian restaurant is why I give this place 4 stars instead of just 3
My friend and I were extremely excited about the opening of a brand new restaurant and gave this place a try two days in a row
Place was mostly cleared out I'd say that about 60% of the restaurant was completely open
Saint Francis of Assisi may be the patron saint of animals and the environment but after a recent visit I wonder if St Francis neighborhood restaurant in Central Phoenix can live up to it's namesake
I've been to numerous Thai restaurants and this place mid pack at best
The irony is I happened to eat sushi earlier today at a different restaurant and Sushi Roku's same dish just blew the other place's right out of the water
I love the vibe in North and how unique of a restaurant it is
= This was my first time visiting the restaurant after discussing where to eat our fiend finally suggested this one and so we went
I went here with a couple of friends during Restaurant Week and I have to say that I didn't LOVE it
Not sure if this place wants to be a nice restaurant a club or a sports bar
For a restaurant with a higher price tag than other local Thai places and a very nice address smack in the middle of Old Scottsdale I would have expected more
I can't wait to visit Phoenix again to stop at this gem of a restaurant
The restaurant was almost empty and it's a huge place so you can imagine why I rolled my eyes and requested a bigger booth when we were seated at the tiny two seater booth
But I am a card-carrying carnivore and this place is quickly becoming one of my favorite restaurants
First I love that little strip of restaurants
While the restaurant probably seems out of the way for most people I would definitely recommend going there
I'd been wanting to go to Talavera ever since I fell in love with a scallop they served at West of Western pre-Devoured and finally seized the opportunity with Restaurant Week
Our most recent visit in August turned out to be the only bad experience at the restaurant
Even the kids were happy and we're all pretty spoiled with a great Thai restaurant just down the way if you're ever in Southern Marin I recommend Thep Lela
We arrived at 9pm and every damn restaurant in the place was closed so I had to settle for a crappy bag of peanuts for dinner
This place belongs on my recommended list for authentic LaoThai restaurant in Phoenix
I absolutely LOVE Autumn Court it is my go-to chinese take-out/delivery restaurant
The wait staff is usually quite good although one thing I don't like about the restaurant is that it is very loud although I guess that is to be expected for a place like this
Too bad for both you and I because North used to be one of my favorite places in the valley and now I am a little tainted in my view of Fox restaurants
At my most recent visit they had 32 trays of food out & it wasn't bad except for the low quality fried chicken legs & the awful hockey puck things that you see at some Chinese restaurants that are supposed to pass for Egg Foo Young
Service was good everyone was nice and I loved the du00e9cor of the restaurant
I say this because Phoenix seems like a place where people in restaurants pretend they're eating in their homes
So if you want to be waited on hand in foot and have a restaurant that looks like a million dollars then this is not the place for you
Not sure what restaurant the other Yelpers ate in but it sounds like a different place
I know visiting a restaurant on Monday or Tuesday is a gamble but you'd figure a international organization like Trader Vic's would get it right - right
I had been anticipating the opening of this place since I had been inside this location's previous restaurant Claim Jumper before and knew that it would be a large buffet that is close to my workplace
I can say with confidence that this place is one of the better Chinese food restaurants out there
It's a chain restaurant but EVERY ONE of these places has good food great service and an extensive menu good for big parties/bad for indecisive people
Some fad places here in phoenix charge double  some triple for a meal that doesn't stand up to this restaurant
I decided to give this place a try for Restaurant Week and I am so happy that I did
The decor of the restaurant is modern and upscale but both times I've picked up takeout the place was almost completely empty
I was a waiter in a Chinese owned and operated restaurant in college and I lived in Asia for a year AND visited both China & Hong Kong so I KNOW authentic Chinese food
Yup Sam Fox the guy who is building a national empire of restaurants brought downtown Phoenix a place that gives a nice sense of community
So no this restaurant is not a locally owned mom and pop style place but rather it is a restaurant with a formula that is crowd pleasing set in a location that could really use something of it's type with the power to draw people in by the numbers
This is the place to eat breakfast food if you're looking for a hip trendy restaurant in the Arcadia area
I highly recommend this restaurant for meat eaters and veggies alike
I don't usually wax on about restaurants but I love everything about this place
This sort of place churrascarias actually used to be one of my favorite kinds of restaurants to enjoy
This veggie selection is a little larger than you usually see at a no extra charge Mongolian BBQ within a Chinese buffet restaurant but you pay a lot here & yet miss out on the 50 to 100 other items you would have had available at the Chinese place
I decided on The Melting Point as my choice and phoned the restaurant to place the reservation
I've been real disappointed so far with alot of the restaurants we've visited
baked green mussels and sushi rolls the regulars plus othersIt is funny even though I could pass for a Mexican Terrorist they were initially suspicious of me like I was scoping the place out to open a competitive restaurant in the area
It was brought to my attention that this restaurant made the 10 best new places to eat in Phoenix by Phoenix Magazine and I really take issue with their judgement
I find Phoenix Magazine calling this place one of the 10 new best of places to be offensive to the efforts of other area restaurants much more deserving of that designation
I remembered other Good Egg restaurants drawing big crowds especially on the weekend so I was surprised to see this place pretty dead for a Sunday morning
Don Carson knows his business well no question and when you go there he is usually wandering around the restaurant visiting with guests and keeping an eye on the place
You may be overwhelmed with all the different Spanish restaurants in Mesa Arizona because they all claim to be the best of the best; but Frutilandia is the restaurant I continue to visit and enjoy; because Frutilandia is the best Spanish restaurant on the block
Still it's sad to see a great if somewhat quirky restaurant replaced by a more modern and generic one
it's a cool place with lots plasmas around the restaurant and bar
One thing about their open-kitchen layout is for sure when you leave this place you -smell- like Fajitas no matter what you've ordered or where you sat in the restaurant
I'm always shocked by how slow service can be even when the place is empty but other times I've noticed that it's just poorly organized why is my server working tables half way across the restaurant
On the whole this place is something special and definitely should be on anyone's Phoenix restaurant bucket list
Overall I think it's a great place to eat and an especially good place to take out of town guests who are wanting to try a more upscale Mexican restaurant
I entered the restaurant as greeted and seated right away I was the only one in the place
A perfect place to go if you're a single woman looking for a Tommy Bahama shirt wearing older North Scottsdale man who hangs around expensive restaurants
The spot has a pretty patio with twinkly lights and a fireplace and the inside restaurant is dimly lit warm and cozy
Well how many chances can you give a restaurant because you love the location or that it is own locally
Cafe Rumba simply outflavors any other southwest/mexican restaurant I have tried out here and believe me Burrito Tuesday every week adds up to a lot of places
I must say that I really like this place - oh and there is LOTS of off-street parking in the lot behind the restaurant
Say to yourself we'll try that crazy strange looking place just for the hell of it like I did a few months ago and revel in the goodness of a straight and simple ace of a Thai restaurant
Let's face it a chain style sports bar/restaurant like Gallagher's is going to be out of place amongst the dive bar gems and hidden drinking dens that this space will normally pimp
We had a long relaxing lunch and nobody made us feel like we were taking valuable restaurant real estate like some places do when you linger after you eat
I am starting to think that the people who think this place is 5-star worthy just don't venture outside big restaurant chains that often
Whatever I appreciate small local restaurants but this place is all wrong
Too be honest when I see people liking new restaurants on FB it grabs my attention & I usually add it to my list of places to try
The restaurant is pretty new and you can still tell - at a new place the staff is abundant there appeared to be two hostesses for this small 35-50 seater and everything is hyper clean
I love the shopping center it's in too lots of great stores and restaurants near by
The chinese restaurant here is decent and the Mongolian place is delish
I don't see it on the on-line menu but there is this dessert listed on the menu in the restaurant that has me all excited and dying to try it but they have not had it available for 3 visits now
After having asked several friends what this place was all about and gathering random bits of information about this mysterious restaurant that has no menu is really expensive' and my personal favorite I have no freaking idea I added it to my list of places I wanted to try out
If you are looking for a restaurant to have happy hour with friends this place is a great pick
Since moving to Arizona almost three years ago I have been searching and searching for a place to get even near my favorite Thai restaurant ever
I visited this dainty little restaurant on what looks to be a not-so-nice area of Phoenix built into a house with an adorable front seating area while visiting family in AZ
Inside looks very familiar - typical dark restaurant/bar that reminds you of Houstons or a dozen other places in a 10 mile radius
I don't know if you want tacos then go to a Mexican place if you want American go to an American restaurant
There is a place for restaurants like this
I always appreciate a healthy restaurant and I am a foodie to boot but this place had the tiniest portions for the price you pay and the food really isn't that great
This review goes out to all of the Yelpers out there who bash a restaurant after one bad visit AND to all the restaurants who don't try to make up for their mistakes--you know who you are
I have to admit this small establishment was just about on of the fanciest  of the Jamaican restaurants I have visited in north america
We had a great time and are definitely going to keep this on our short list of restaurants to visit
If you visit this area make sure to visit Tarbells Restaurant too
It's the little things that make a restaurant great and this place has them all
For a special occasion there is no better place to go than this great Lebanese restaurant
I love the fact that it is one of the only vegan restaurant in Phoenix other than Green
I have recommended Salsa B to many Sun City Residents - most are picky food critics all LOVED Salsa B - they felt the food was good prices GREAT  some thought the prices should be raised all will be going back - all will pass the word to their friends and family - all wish these Great New Entrepreneurs  the BEST OF LUCK w/this One of a Kind Mexican Food Restaurant --- Chili R's and Beef Taco's ARE  TO DIE FOR - I am SOOOOO Hooked
The place mats are cute pink plastic doilies and add to the really cute flair the restaurant has going for it
For being a French restaurant during the middle of a HOT HOT Phoenix day on a weekday this place was really busy
Plus since this is not a restaurant you visit for a random Tuesday night and the dollar signs exceed $$$ I will be dreaming for awhile but it's a good memory to have
This restaurant would fit right in with some of the hottest places in Hollywood
The place is very small it reminds me of a very casual good home-cooking restaurant - not fancy but just good food
I love this place and am so thankful to have a true NM restaurant here in the valley
In spite of the Princess Hotel total lack of interest in the success of this restaurant The Grill continues to be a great place to get an if somewhat expensive excellent dinner
In fairness in terms of cost it's no worse than Mastros Ocean or any other high end restaurant and certainly less expensive than Bourbon Steak but the setting is much more intimate the service much better and the food every bit as good if not better than those other must do places
Love how it was an upscale restaurant but families were casually dressed so it gives you a relaxing feeling
I had seen a review of this place as one of the 10 best restaurants to hit on an airline magazine
Below are a few of the delectable delights that graced my tastebuds on a recent visit and it may shed light on why more than 100 of Arizona's top restaurants have featured Honeymoon's desserts on their menus
I loved the modern look of the restaurant and was very happy with the service throughout the night
So glad places like this help us to fight the chain gang restaurants
The place was empty not a busy hour for any restaurant I realize and even though we were hesitant to stay because it almost didn't seem like the right place we ordered tacos a carne asada burrito and some guacamole
We came here last week for restaurant week and sad to say it was my least favorite of the places we went to
This place has to be one of the most overrated restaurants
Reminds me of a sophisticated restaurant in a place like NY city
It seemed like the bar patrons were front center and the restaurant took a back seat but I usually don't go to Thai places to get my drink on
This place has a nightclub feel to it despite professedly being a restaurant/bar
I also love that this restaurant is right in my neighborhood
Overall we had a pleasant time & definitely recommend CB when you're in the mood for comfort food in a family style restaurant
I would definitely recommend this place to someone if they are interested in trying a new Chinese restaurant
We make a point to visit this restaurant at least once a week
It's too bad that a lot of their prices have gone up as have other restaurants but I'll still patronize this place
Secondly I'm in love with southern cooking so any restaurant with really good sweet tea is a winner
If you love the safe cookie cutter restaurant scene that often seems to dominate Phoenix this isn't for you
I love going to a restaurant where a good chunk of the food is vegetarian because that is so rare
Food so I was extra excited to eat here since I usually love the restaurants Adam has showcased
Along the lines of south Phoenix Mexican restaurants Comedor Guadalajara is one of the more authentic places out there
The ice cream is made with love and craftsmanship that surpasses that of most of the restaurants in the Greater Phoenix area
Every time I have eaten here I have eaten in the restaurant but I went to the Marketplace hoping to grab a quick lunch to take home
If you're used to sit-down 'classy' restaurants and waiter service well you might find this place 'lacking' but honestly these sorts of places focus on what matters - what's on your plate rather than what's on the wall
Stopped into this cute little Iraqi restaurant for lunch today & ordered a Lamb & Beef Gyro for this first visit
I visited this restaurant four times last week
My wife loves this restaurant and the food
In fact it is strikingly similar to Rum Fire the trendy restaurant in the Sheraton Waikiki where I stayed for a few days this summer before my family arrived and we stayed moved to the family place
I get the impression that they are trying to market themselves as a downtown restaurant more than the place in the Sheraton
I understand that pho restaurants are usually not fancy but this place is pretty ghetto
We went to this place last night for AZ restaurant week
You wouldn't expect much out of this place being shoved into a tiny strip mall but the restaurant is of fair size and has a very moody/laid back atmosphere
I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area looking for a romantic spot to take a loved one to
The place is pretty cozy and the pizza ovens are open to the restaurant
This place actually reminds me of a restaurant in Milan that I visited once
The size of the restaurant is ample so this would make a great place to host a dinner party
This was my first visit the place was fairly busy for a new restaurant
This place is by no means fancy or upscale it's just a mom and pop restaurant with great breakfast
Not particularly a fan of Fieri but having found some of his recommendations to at least be interesting and in the case of Rino's Place occasionally outstanding the restaurant fit my time frame as well as location and as such I decided to give it a go
The place from outside is not all that spectacular but once you go inside you do feel as I've seen other people comment like your in a Rocky Point restaurant
There is no doubt in my mind that Noca is almost universally loved because owner Eliot Wexler opened the place with the intent on making every single diner happy when they left this restaurant
The food at this place really only deserves two stars but it's a decent enough restaurant to grab Mexican food with a large group while out in Scottsdale so three stars it is
I love The Clarendon Hotel and the restaurant was great
I'll always have a very special place in my hear for this hotel but that won't change my opinion on the restaurant
To parapphrase the newspaper review that proudly stands on the counter of this quaint restaurant Don't come here because if you to start coming regularly this place is small enough where there won't be enough room for me
I love going to restaurants where I find myself planning my next visit before I'm even halfway through the meal
Pretty good but seemed out of place at a Thai restaurant
New management came in and really changed the feel of this place trying to make it more of a restaurant then fast food Mexican
The shop is located in the same parking lot as Lee Lee Oriental Supermarket which also houses a Vietnamese restaurant and a Chinese restaurant so Gelato 64 is a convenient place to drop in for dessert after dining at one of those restaurants
I would have loved for the black pepper reduction to be a bit thicker and for there to have been a bit more as it paired so well with the pork and I would have really loved for there to have been room for dessert though I'm pretty sure Chef Beckett had little control of that detailIn all Beckett's table will take it's rightful place among the most well regarded restaurants in Greater Phoenix and become a must visit destination for fooderati
This place is our family outing restaurant
The little restaurant area to the right of the lobby as you walk in was a good place to relax and chat after a long day
I love a restaurant that stays open all day and just has a single menu not lunch and dinner
If you want to start further south then there are plenty of churches where you can prob park but this restaurant is not open in the early part of the day so even on weekends this is a nice place to park
I'm not sure what they are known for at this place but that's how a lot of Vietnamese restaurants are they make a few things that are great and they specialize in those and just have the other stuff just cause
Bottom line  I wouldnt recommend this restaurant and I wont be going back
I saw this place on the Food Network show Diners Drive-ins and Dives I had been going to the Chinese restaurant a few doors down and never stopped in until yesterday and I'm glad I did
As for the restaurant itself its a pretty small place
The waitress was great-the restaurant still never got busy and we ended up closing the place down that would be 10pm
Pretty fancy place they have here nestled in a strip mall near a Boba shop Lee Lee Market and a Chinese restaurant
BTW it wasn't our waiter who brought over the manager it was someone else he was nowhere to be found  Now my other recent visit the service was stellar at the PV Mall restaurant
At lunchtime the Tariq Restaurant is a working East African Arab man's lunch place
I do recommend to restaurant to others
A little loud for my liking but that is to be expected when a place is as busy as this restaurant always seems to be
oh and i have no problem staying in this 110 degree weather mom the nicely-decored restaurant sprinkled tiny rain drops along the wall to cool down my lovelorn heart
The rooms are beautiful the bathrooms are unreal/nice the lighting in the rooms is pretty the decor is incredible the pool is perfect the restaurants have great happy hour the parking is free if you find street parking and it's a quiet place because not that many people have discovered this gem
As usual we ate family style and shared with our daughter who just loves to watch people moving throughout the restaurant
There is a restaurant that charges fair prices and provides exceptional service ambiance and delicious food all in one visit
I love the style and ambience of the restaurant
The wings were suggested to me on my first visit which seemed a bit daring for a vegan restaurant but
The pizza was nothing special and I wouldn't have even tried to visit the restaurant a second time and try it again if other reviews hadn't pointed to the opposite
A big bummer because this place is right next to our house and we were counting on it to be our get out and relax restaurant
and more upscale restaurants it could be a really nice place to visit as a whole
The restaurant is small and the outdoor seating is placed in the middle of a fairly busy Scottsdale sidewalk
For a restaurant to have won accolades as Best Chinese Restaurant from the Phoenix New Times I expected way more from this place than what it offered
The resort is gorgeous and I'd love to stop by for drinks especially during sunset where the views of the golf course are spectacular but I think Scottsdale's plethora of fine dining restaurants have more to offer than Deseo
I was in Phoenix last week for a shoot and my photographer recommended House of Tricks to me describing it as the only really upscale restaurant in the Tempe Mill Avenue District
When my friend mentioned this spot as a place to have dinner at  I imagined a chocolate fondue place with a chocolate waterfall to greet me at the entrance to the restaurant don't ask me why about the waterfall
Lord knows anyone who dares open a restaurant these days has a lot of challenges but I can't recommend this new Vietnamese spot simply based on the food
Scale of 1-10 multiple visitsn/a Food10 **Drinks**10 Service9 Atmosphere7 ValueThis new bar spot was just opened by the owners of the next-door Breadfruit restaurant Jamaican food
As you can imagine especially with my tolerance for obnoxious drunks I was not looking forward to going to a Mexican restaurant on this holiday where I was certain I'd want to punch every patron in the place
After visiting my third or fourth Mexican restaurant in Chandler I have come to the conclusion that I have to drive to an actual neighborhood where people of Mexican descent actually live to get good Mexican
The restaurant had a wonderful atmosphere whereas it was dimly lit and had a ton of strategically placed candles
This place is by no means a hole in the wall southwest US Mexican food restaurant and it knows it
The lady at the register = super cute and I kinda like the stab joint classic chinese restaurant looks of this place
9  I wouldn't say their food isn't authentic Chinese but it was definitely adjusted to make this place unique from all other chinese restaurants I've been to--which gives it a plus in my opinion
Bottom line is this place is very different from any Chinese restaurant I have ever eaten at
This restaurant is located in an oh-so-charming part of town with even lovelier people
I still love this restaurant and it is still my absolute favorite place to eat in Scottsdale
This place was suprisingly OK for Arizona restaurants
Think of this place more as a cool bar that has food than a restaurant with a cool bar
Anyway as a foodie I'm sure you know you only really love one or two dishes at a particular restaurant all else just doesn't make the cut
I truly love this place from the moment you walk in the door you know your not in a typical restaurant and the E61Bar just demands your attention
There are bad restaurants too so there are places to avoid Cadillac Ranch Darcy McGee's
I'm not sure if it is possible to describe accurately how much i love this restaurant; and for the life of me i dont understand why the rating isnt a complete 5 *****
So whether you are looking for a new taste or an authentic one and want to do it while saving money come and visit La Tolteca Restaurant
My husband introduced me to this mom and pop joint and I even make sure that any visitors that we have from out of state experience this restaurant
As with many places in Scottsdale especially in old town Scottsdale which is very much a survival of the fittest sort of place for restaurants there was at least one prior culinary resident of the location in which you will now find this establishment
So back to the review 3 starts because well at this experience the wait service just wasn't all that great and it may be my only experience since a restaurant I do love the herb box is within walking distance but I think that over time as long as management is self-reflective this place may continue to improve
Well if they don't get the service situation down especially in the highly competitive market in which this place is located in a year or two we might all be reviewing whatever new eating establishment has taken the place of this one such is the life of restaurants in old town Scottsdale and boy will I miss those little fresh made corn tortillas
Oh yeah their prices are soooo much more reasonable than the other caribbean restaurants I have visited
After last night I now know that I will never visit this abysmal excuse of a fast food restaurant ever again
If we're out at a restaurant anywhere near this place he always chooses to skip dessert at the restaurant just so we can have Angel Sweet instead

It's walking distance from ASU Stadium and there is an abundance of restaurants shops and places to drink along Mill Street
It's good when a restaurant takes you to another place and AB did that for me
However overall I would return and would recommend this restaurant
I thought the restaurant overall was a fun place for a group with decent enough food but probably wouldn't go out of my way to return
All in all we loved the decor the coziness of the restaurant the service was exceptional and the food and drinks were spectacular
Second visit I felt like I was in a 5 star restaurant with the service we received
It was a little intimidating to roll up and see the hoard of people waiting outside the restaurant on a Tuesday morning but we put our name on the list and took our place amongst the throng
If I'm at your restaurant I had better love it
When I walked to the front door I immediately thought the place looked like a miniature golf course replica but maybe that is because I live in New England and our restaurants aren't as creative except when there is a lobsta' on the roof
Generally I don't tend to order beef at any restaurant except for the occasional Wendy's hamburger I just love those square patties
I love the modern decor innovative menus and overall aesthetic qualities of their restaurants
I try not to revisit restaurants with eh service but since this is very conveniently located with my hotel the Firesky I didn't have much of a choice
This place can get quite loud at times over the weekend especially if you are seated in the side of the restaurant where the bar is
I've actually gone back TWICE within a week which I rarely do with a restaurant I've just visited
The placehotel and restaurant is addictive and so pleasant because all the staff make you feel so welcome

I've had papusas all my life and I've been to a few great Salvadorean restaurants on the West Side but this Mesa place was not all that
I definitely recommend it - can't wait to try the breakfast and dinner restaurants
This place hit the home run of bad restaurants
Service here is great but the deal breaker for me is that the most recent time I've visited this restaurant the meat I ordered was drastically undercooked

This place looks like 80 percent of the Restaurant Pubs I visit in Ireland
now before you start thinking this a is five star restaurant or some fancy place hear me out
Beer wine and liquor prices are beyond reasonable  Basically this is the neighborhood restaurant you have been waiting for the place where everything is affordable and delicious and the menu is diverse and balanced enough to keep you coming back a couple times a week
Although I'm not a vegetarian I prefer to eat healthy and I'm always on the lookout for restaurants that cater to my love of fresh veggies and fruit
A really nice Chinese restaurant in Arizona  It was recommended by people in my Chinese church and it makes me feel like home Hong Kong every time I go there the food the music the people
It was in a delicious peanut sauce that I wanted to pour all over my body and use in the lovemaking process OVERALL A+ AMAZING RESTAURANT
One draw back is that it is smaller than expected so if you come from a place like SoCal where Japanese markets were like large grocery stores with mini stores and restaurants located inside you might not be too happy
I absolutely LOVE great Thai food however this was not much better than what you would be served at a Chinese restaurant
I had heard from another friend that My Big Fat Greek Restaurant had an express restaurant up the street from work and thought that was the place I am going to try
Starting with the views first we sat inside the restaurant right by the fireplace/window that separated us from the expansive patio that overlooks the city

I love it when a restaurant heats up the chips - this place does not

The restaurant was recommended by the Hotel concierge at Wyndham where a friend was staying while she visiting in PHX
My family visited here and my brother stumbled upon this Yelp review as we were looking for nice restaurants to try out
The place is indeed petite - you'd think you were at a restaurant/inn in the countryside of France what with the vines snaking up the outside of the restaurant low arch you pass under to get to the outdoor patio area/front door of the place and the small but extremely cozy yet luxurious inside
Setting lovely South Mountain farm with pecan trees which includes Maya's Farm produce are sold at the Downtown Public Market on Saturdays and a brunch and lunch restaurant all 3 are in separate areas/buildings
I was a bit puzzled by the entire place to be honest I do not know if it was a Middle Eastern owned restaurant run by a non-Middle Eastern staff or if it was a non-Middle Eastern owned restaurant attempting to prepare this type of food
I walked into Ticoz with the same perception as everyone else; 'This place is popular because it looks like a cool place to be seen  And like many places in Phoenix/Scottsdale the trendy swank restaurants are more hype than substance
We're big fans of brewery-type restaurants especially non chains and are frequenters of Four Peaks usually but we unwisely tried to venture out of our usual places tonight

I found this place by looking up vegetarian restaurant for my girl friend
I rarely write reviews but I have now eaten at Italian Restaurant a few times and after reviewing some of the other Yelpers opinions I felt like I had to write this because this place is great and deserves kudos
I'd been there around normal bar hours before but totally forgot about the whole restaurant aspect of the place

First off I'm a big believer that you can judge an Indian restaurant by their chicken tikka masala so since this was my first visit to Tandoori I had to try it
In the end I go to BBQ restaurants for the meat not the sides which means I might not be back to this place
The pigs in the blanket were just your basic preparation but how many places can you order these at a restaurant and who doesn't dig pork and puff pastry
Consistency in the restaurant business means everything and this place doesn't seem to have it
On my first and only visit to this restaurant I experienced a rare level of genuinely kind and friendly service
This place is a good model for any restaurant owner/manager who is struggling with getting their troops to provide more than sub-par service
We have this proclivity to visit restaurants at off hours
