there was a blueberry-filled donut a chocolate and blueberry shooter topped off with a balsamic cream some kind of blueberry cake but the real highlight that had everyone in the restaurant looking our way was when our server added the freezing soup around the edge of the plate a combo of blueberry consomme and liquid nitrogen
We dined sort of late on a Sunday evening the restaurant is open until midnight - how convenient

Tip was already included in our billI've never been to a family run pizzeria that can't do a half and half pizza and the only restaurants I've ever been to that charge to split a plate of food are ones where you'd feel more comfortable wearing  a dress - definitely not one in a strip mall like this one
The restaurant inside is very classy and the bathrooms spotless

We being Chicagoans and calling the Elmhurst location our local go-to restaurant we're elated that Mia's was open in AZ; so we made a beeline there as soon as our schedule opened up
Other pluses open a bit later than many Phoenix restaurants seating ends at 930 pm; very fast with takeout orders; there's lots of parking; the 16 North bus stop is nearby; silverware glasses white cotton tablecloths and napkins are always spotlessly clean
Another star would have been given if there weren't such unfortunate and not corrected by the restaurant nothing comped or made clear until too late billing issues

I have never ever had a cold wet towel handed to me in a Japanese restaurant and Kat said every other time she's been here they've been warm
The restaurant is instantly one of my favorites from the list of $20 bottles of wine to the awesome food to the neat-o restrooms and the spot on service
thought that our table wasn't great with kitchen noise we got there about 615 and TV or radio in kitchen was too loud but as the restaurant filled we realized that our corner table was the most isolated from other diners

I normally try to stray away from barren restaurants but we were already spotted by the owner
Which Japanese restaurant doesn't have a version of this dish popularised by Nobu

I thought I wrote a review on this place but we will try this again this place sits in a half empty mall but it is a great down home breakfast spot but they also do lunch and dinner Service is good wends day and Friday are fish fry night  which we gave a whirl as well it was good but being from Seattle we have a tough time finding good seafood except at sushi restaurants we frequent this place is well worth a try

Whenever I crave Japanese style food that isn't sushi this restaurant has satiated me each and every time
Overall though I love this restaurant and I hope that my experience this past week is an isolated incident

I made a reservation for Saturday night which was very busy and even though I was going to be 15 minutes late I called the restaurant and they were very nice to hold the table for me without any attitude from the hostess at all

The decor was very nice and the entire restaurant was spotless making it a comfortable situation to really sit and enjoy conversation with our meal
The prices are higher than most other Japanese restaurants by about 15-20% due to its location and ambiance
In addition there are little mechanic related items scattered around the restaurant which pay homage to the building's former life
For some reason when I first moved here there was music pumping out of a PA system outside or near the restaurant late at night but I never saw anyone coming in or out

On my first visit of what will likely be many to come a group of us orderedKung Pao Beef and ChickenMongollion BeefSpicy ChickenYui Shan ChickenCrab PuffsEgg RollsAll of them were spot on the best I've had in the valley and I've been frequenting valley Chinese restaurants for 30 years
Durant's is again our favorite special-occasion restaurant
The tempura'd veggies another one of those American Asian favorites are proportioned tempuraveggie = 51 because vegetables should never be good for you at a Japanese-ish restaurant right
This restaurant has an opportunity to be a really lovely breakfast and lunch spot but someone needs to pay attention to these glaringly obvious shortcomings in basic restaurant hospitality
Spotted this familiar chain across the street from the Cardinal's stadium in the restaurant-filled outdoor Westgate mall
Wait a restaurant with a seasonally changing menu and your entire plate comes in under 475 calories and it's not some weird little hippy place in a strip mall
It's kind of like a relic of a bygone era when it was one of the only Indian restaurants in the Valley and therefore could get away with its prices and somewhat discombobulated service

I dont know why my expectations were so high I guess it's because my string of luck w/ restaurants in Phx has been really great lately

While the dine in experience is somewhat spartan it is a perfect spot to sit and enjoy a nice lunch without the usual jammed packed scene that many University area restaurants enjoy
As someone else mentioned even though I was inside the smoke from those on the patio did tend to drift in but that was the price I paid for a beautiful view of the ASU stadium with the occasional light rail train sliding by feels very euro so thumbs up on one of the best sunset patio views of any patio restaurant near ASU
Looking around we noticed this was part of the restaurant's decor which seemed odd considering the price of the dishes averaged $20/plate
I find it odd that this restaurant serves both italian and japanese food Maybe if they focused on one type of food the flavor and presentation would improve
Usually I take a while to go back and contemplate a few days over an experience at a restaurant but today's meal was so delicious I am writing a review right away

DOZO Japanese Restaurant is a Good Restaurant Marred by FlawsDozo is a good restaurant with flaws that lower the experience making me feel I endured Dozo rather than enjoyed it

if i could have it my way i'd choose roy's restaurant for every special occasion we celebrate because the people that work for roy always go above and beyond to make sure everything is perfect

The restaurant's locale is dusty and isolated at the end of a semi-deserted strip mall near a busy intersection
We enjoyed laying in the sun with a pina colada by the immaculate pool each afternoon gambling at the casino next door a delicious New York steak dinner in the Anahla restaurant and late night jacuzzi-ing
This new spot is located right between two existing kick-butt restaurants -- Delux and Zen 32
Yeah sure some Japanese restaurants have ramen on their menu
It is exceedingly LOUD like the restaurants in New York City that want to turn tables quickly
If you own a food spot it's either a coffee shop a bar or restaurant
But more than that the sushi is simply amazing my unagi plate presentation was crazy served on a sizzling plate it defiantly had the whole restaurant staring
All in all a good place to go during lunch if you are over in this area and you want to avoid all of the restaurant chans that populate this area
I happen to like the old school signage / decor it adds character to a restaurant that has been in the same spot for 60+ years
We've been to this Fleming's on several occasions and tonight seemed to be a continuation of the progression downhill for this restaurant in my opinion
The best part about this restaurant was neither the food nor the drinks but the fact that it's downtown and open late with reasonable pricing
It's a fast easy meal if it's too late to go to a restaurant and it keeps well in the motel fridge too
One more thing when i was enquiring a few Korean friends about the name of the restaurant they told me it was Chuhgajib and i really thought that they said Cho-co-late-chip
Caramelized Black Mission Figs- Spicy Sopressata Preserved Lemon Ricotta  Rather horrified by the liver I was heartened by the first choice from the restaurant week menu; a sort of composed cheese plate featuring the intense fructose of fresh figs matched up against the bite of sopressata and lightly fragranced ricotta
Thirty minutes later I had no food and no word from the waiter who was only serving the 6 other people in the restaurant at the time
If the staff spoke the lingo of New York-style pizza restaurants she would have ordered a white pizza with sliced tomatoes
I think it's hard to really judge a restaurant during restaurant week just because it's difficult to tell how things like portions translate to the regular menu like the one scallop
I feel like I am on a hunt throughout Phoenix to find The Mexican Restaurant which lead me to pop into The Spotted Donkey
The entree prices were reasonable for a brunch of that quality this isn't The Good Egg after all and it is a restaurant we plan on returning to even if it is not a special occasion
The restaurant is located in a wonderful spot
I mean the restaurant is about as beautiful and immaculate as any establishment I have EVER visited
I didn't eat there and while I've heard the spot's Sasquatch Burger $16 is a giant sight to behold like owner Aaron May's other restaurant Mabel's on Main The Lodge is more a drinking destination than a dining one at least at nighttime
What makes this restaurant to be my number one spot of Japanese restaurant in the valley was the sushi chef service is superb
I can tell from the first service to the first and all the way through the last bite that this restaurant has great folks in the kitchen great folks out front and is determined to be a favorite local spot
it's upscale Japanese restaurant with great service and great food
Ok I can't back that up because I haven't been to every Sushi restaurant but I have had the pleasure of dining at fantastic spots around the country coastal cities and this one is solid stuff
I never really understood why Sushi restaurants existed in places like Arizona Utah or any other state that is not California or New York
Hey I really enjoyed this Japanese restaurant

As my girlfriend explained to me on one of our several trips to this place it is common in Japan for restaurants to server typical japanese food and the cuisine of another country
With a little bit of refinement I think they will be a sure bet 5 star restaurant sooner or later
We were running late the restaurant was 20 minutes to close when we got there and it was practically empty
Most of their plates fit the Phoenix Mexican restaurant MO rice and refried beans with an entree that is fried and/or covered in cheese and chilli sauce
And honestly my first impression of the restaurant and the food I saw on other diners plates had me expecting it would be a 5 star review
So Saturday night we pull up to this little spot in Scottsdale to meet up with the rest of the crew and sit and have a drink - I ask the bartender give me your best 2 tacos - so I get the carne asada and the mahi mahi- The carne asada was delicious it was tender spicy and just melted in your mouth- i instantly gobbled that one up right away- The girl sitting next to me advised me that the mahi mahi was the best she has ever tried at the restaurant
We stopped by this restaurant late on a Saturday evening on our way to an event
Nobuo as I am sure you can tell from the previous reviews is a tapas-like Japanese restaurant featuring hot and cold small plates

We went to this restaurant last night and noticed that the prices have gone way up so I had settled for expensive plate of simple chicken when my husband and I noticed that a small roach-like bug was crawling up the wall behind us
I enjoyed the food but the surly slow service coupled with the expensive menu items make this spot a poor value in spite of the lovely old house and charming patio in which the restaurant is situated
Besides being a sucker for restaurants in old houses the menu was spot on
the only time i seen any of the female servers was when an assumingly wealthy man was spotted that was when most of the servers would approach and hug them much to close by restaurant standards very tightly
The wraps fill you up and never disappoint me when I have it late because their to big for me to finish at the restaurant
Certainly has a spot on my list of all-time favorite restaurants
When you walk into Roka Akor you know you're in a trendy upscale Japanese restaurant

It was one of the Top 50 restaurants featured in the Arizona Foothills Magazine and made the spot light not once - but twice on Food Network
At these prices and in some cases LOWER than these prices you can get more personalized service and better flavor in all of your plates in actual famous restaurants in Los Angeles and New York
There is a grip of people who work at the restaurant who actually bring out the plates of food you ordered and clean them up when you are finished and I doubt they are getting an equal split of the tips from the main servers
not many restaurants are beyond the strip center/mall in AZ but you have to go inside to see if the spot is for you
what i order- the beet salad note not just beets there is lettuce in there too- the standard burger either a lettuce wrap or the normal way really if you're trying to cut down on bread the lettuce wrap is pretty damn good- mix of fries although compared to my fav restaurant in chicago Rockit's sweet potato fries Delux's are a little soggy and limp like that guy from 'revenge of the nerds' trying to throw a footballit's a cool spot and is open LATE NIGHT
i love the restaurants atmosphere it's a small family owned joint surrounded by brick walls making it a comfortable kick back spot to get your grub on
Being from Los Angeles I haven't run into too many reasonably priced little Japanese restaurants as opposed to the high priced fancy fusion places that serve yaki soba and udon so I'm very happy to have found this place
You would think that they could've made a compromise for the fact that we were in the restaurant from 6 - 9pm watching other patrons effortlessly flow in and out waiting patiently for each course to come plates to be cleared out and bills corrected
It comes out just like the broiled mackerel you get in Japanese restaurants at a fraction of the price
Situated along Apache Blvd in Tempe this spot is half restaurant and half Middle Eastern market and bakery talk about a one stop shop
For the record these guys bought a closed Japanese fast food restaurant Formerly a Shogun Express peeled off all the surfaces and then painted bricks red as they broke the lights making it incredibly dim to give it that east coast this place is condemned but eat here anyway sort of look and feel
After visiting approximately 15 or so sushi restaurants in the valley on several occasions I've put Sakana located  in East Mesa on the top of my list
My wife had the Carne Asada plate and we both agree that this was the best Carne Asada we can remember in a restaurant
a bad luck spot formerly housing Lenny's Burgers and several other restaurants Tiny's Country Cafe should turn that bad luck around
This only grew upon hearing other restaurant servers whose palates I trust rave about Digestif
First of all the spot has completely rewritten the history of this anchor space at the SEC of 48th Street and Indian School after many lackluster restaurants died miserable deaths prior
I tend to feel less and less compelled toward that area as it pops up with more commercial crappy generic restaurants shopping centers and social hot not spots
So from our point of view this restaurant is pretty much on the same level as Kabuki in Old Town Pasadena CA with an authentic Japanese sushi restaurant feel b/c of the presence of Japanese staff and the decor
This dimly lit restaurant and bar has cool tables with drawings beneath resin and cool art on the walls currently various animals and such in a somewhat pixelated style
This is certainly a special occasion restaurant - so my advice is to FIND that special occasion and visit Mastro's Ocean Club

I cannot go to this restaurant and not order the southwest fried chicken which is one of the best plates I have ever had anywhere
Yes the outside of the restaurant looks like it used to be a Dunkin donuts shop but don't let that put you off of the five star Japanese food you'll find inside

Whenever I review someone's wedding registry and see things like insulated cookie sheets at $10 a pop I want to take the couple to Standard Restaurant Supply to show them what a real cookie sheet for half the price looks like
Ruth Chris why does your food have to be so average and underwhelmingThe restaurant is very nice inside and they have a great outdoor patio for drinks when it is nice outIf you go ask for Bruce he is the best server that I can remember having for any restaurant - was exceptional and I dine out at many high end placesHaving not been to a Ruth Chris in 4 or 5 years it was time to give it another shot i remembered the food being very average and being underwhelmed by the steak which was the case again - The steaks were cooked correctly I feel their steaks are bland especially compared to other chains like MasterosThe desserts were very good and the highlight for us both the sin cake very dark chocolatey and the bread pudding with raisensWon't be going back however the location and the service are fantastic so if you do enjoy Ruth Chris steaks you will be happy here - go see Bruce and he will make sure you have a fantasic time as we did even though the food wasn't up to our level of expectation
I saw quite a few younger people out on dates probably not ones that would have the palate to appreciate even restaurants at half this cost

I was missing Richardson's - specifically the garlic plate - so I finally checked out Dick's Hideaway which is in the Richardson's family of restaurants
Other restaurants in Tutti Santi's price range aren't  in a run down strip mall where you don't want to park the nice car you usually take for speical occasions
This restaurant is good for first dates to celebrate a special occasion or if your looking to have a good time
I think the food is spot on for a German restaurant
The hostess didn't immediately recognize us as customers as she was playing with her cell phone so J tried to get her attention with a joke about native New Yorkers the people not the restaurant

Since Yasu Sushi Bistro stop servicing Long Island Ice Tea I started to look for another Japanese restaurant as my regular place to eat

I had heard of Richardson's and for my friend's going away/belated birthday dinner he requested that we go to Richardson's other restaurant

Think everyone at the restaurant was jealous of my heaping plate
Now after living in Arizona for the last year trying some restaurants and take away spots
The food was unique but there are other Japanese restaurants in the area that I like better check out Roka Akor and RA
This restaurant had dirty menus dirty plates/glasses slow waiters the food was unedible and the kitchen was slow
From the restaurant I recommend shawarma plate gyros and any of the kabobs
Were this restaurant transported to New York New Jersey or Connecticut it would barely survive a weekend
The only strange part is that I'm from San Francisco where people making food in Japanese restaurants are actually Japanese
I calcuated the approximate number of calories based on nutritional information from another fast food Hawaiiian restaurant with a nearly identicial menu for a Chicken Katsu plate lunch to be a whopping 1800 calories 1200 for the chicken and 600 for two scoops of macaroni salad and one scoop of rice
So I went along on a lunch trip and walked into a very busy restaurant walk up to the counter and ordered the Luau Pork Plate Slow roasted pulled Kalua pork topped with teriyaki sauce
This spot is definitely a regular in my restaurant rotation
-not related to the restaurant but in a great area Old Town Scottsdale nice place to walk around in the evening
This used to be what I considered a spot-on authentic Thai restaurant
This idea translates to a restaurant with its elements of food service and decor
I also spotted Maine lobster bisque on the online menu and had asked Matt if roux or * was used as a thickener if * then I couldn't have it but like most quality restaurants Wildfish uses only roux
I can overlook the BYOB which honestly I find annoying in a sushi/Japanese restaurant since I love an ice cold martini with raw fish and the sometimes attitudey service and even the ho-hum rolls offered nothing special really
People line up around the restaurant to order/pay at the counter and then scour the place to find an empty table or patiently wait until someone leaves to get a free spot
In summary Il Terrazzo serves beautiful plate presentations befitting this beautiful restaurant in a beautiful resort
Sofrita is a great little restaurant with a very unique Boricua/Nueva York sort of ambiance
After scarfing down six plates of bread six entrees three desserts many pitchers of water and $300 later we were talking about the next restaurant to go to so we'd be full  the dollar menu at McDonald's was thrown out a couple of times due to our wallets being empty after this meal
My guy and I wanted to eat at a Japanese restaurant but was closed on Sundays
I'm not from Phoenix and I've been on a mission to find my new go-to Japanese restaurant
The gentleman that rang us up tonight also told us about a great restaurant to check out in the area that definitely hit the spot
It's a traditional japanese restaurant and from what I remember the food was decently priced maybe a little more expensive for dinner than other places
It is the only place that can make better breakfast than me I make some mean fluffy scrambled eggs and french toast and the occasional breakfast burrito when I feel like going all outSeriously the best breakfast restaurant I've ever been to it tops a place in Austin I thought could never be toppedPortions are large and everything is fresh
It isn't very common to find a Japanese restaurant that is actually Japanese owned and doesn't have a sushi menu
It sang to us its beautiful lullaby before we spotted it- a lovely waterfall at the restaurant's entrance
if you spot a barely visable restaurant with minimal signage and BMWs parked in front
My husband and I have made this restaurant one of our frequent dining spots
i know this is kinda inconsequential but  i still think it is worth mentioning i absolutely hate it when restaurants print the calculated 10% 15% and 20% gratuity amounts on the receipt
I was pretty excited because apparently they produce something edible here on occasion which is good because restaurants usually do that
20 minutes later after everyone else in the restaurant except us was served that includes people that arrived well after us with similarly sized orders to boot the waitress hands out the appetizer chicken wings
Unless the restaurant is packed and the drafty table in front of the door is the last spot available I do not want to sit in a place where incoming guests will constantly bump into my chair
The lot behind the restaurant is ALWAYS full and good luck finding a close spot on the street
On at least four or five occasions we've tried to go to The Parlor a former beauty salon turned upscale pizza restaurant but there has always been a long wait to get seated
Ive heard great things about Wally's and have been to its sister restaurant quite a few times Grassroots which is fantastic and decided on such a momentous occasion why not give it a shot
Service was very good and plates came up fast so no complaints there but it just didn't make up for the mediocre taste and restaurant feel
Not looking like a Pure or ultra trendy/gimmicky Japanese restaurant it caught my interest
Well This particular restaurant happens to be Hana Japanese eatery my favorite place for sushi in Arizona
Stop by Hana Japanese Eatery in Central Phoenix for simple quality ingredients prepared lovingly and skillfully by a knowledgeable staff and remember something else important while they will tempt your palate with a plethora of flavors and gladly fill your belly the restaurant is strictly BYOB so if you like beer sake or wine with your meal you'd better bring your own
When we first got seated our waiter Steve asked if we had been to the restaurant before and when I said that I hadn't been he still prodded me for an order less than 5 minutes later
The late night aspect is a huge plus for this restaurant
Sens is a really excellent restaurant but keep in mind that the plates are small
It's a restaurant you plan on going to--a special occasion worthy place
Had an awsome late lunch at this bbq restaurant this afternoon
I don't know what it is with local bar/restaurants and their overwhelming lack of desire to serve my companions and I but this place has made me feel guilty for being there on several occasions
Then we spotted a little Thai restaurant across the lot and headed over
Totties is just about one of the best restaurants  I have been to lately
Located on a corner with more than one restaurant to choose from made parking difficult but we finally found a spot
I tend to get into ruts with restaurants and LGO has been my go to spot for all meals for some time so I was happy to remember I wanted to try this little gem the other day when my friend and I wanted to get breakfast
Oh by the way found t his place because it was listed as one of the best new 25 restaurants in Phoenix in Phoenix magazine and they were spot on
the free desert chocolate cookie dough is the freakin' greatest treat any restaurant has ever given me
First Asian restaurant I've seen in Scottsdale that I've seen alot of Japanese go to AWESOME cause I know it must be fresh and good
Stumbled into Little Rangoon while looking for a parking spot for another restaurant and decided as we had never experienced Burmese cuisine before that we would try this place mind you we love Gujarati South Indian Korean Thai Szechuan and Hunan cooking
I was born and raised in Japan and this is so far the only Japanese restaurant that I've been to which serves essentially the same dishes as in Japan
Basically it's the only Japanese restaurant that I go to because I know I can get good satisfying food for a good price
I have never dined in the restaurant but I have had late night wine munchies at the bar on my drive home from work
Parking was a challenge - at first I was excited to see available spots in front of the restaurant
Being a busy game night all of the remaining spots were filled in the back the sides and even around the defunct restaurant next door
Just like all the other mom and pop restaurants we have been visiting lately the staff was extremely friendly and really went above and beyond
I've eaten at many Japanese restaurants in the past but this was the first time i have seen it on the menu
This is the kind of Italian restaurant I would go to if it was in my neighborhood and I could walk to it on occasions when I didn't want to put much thought on where to eat
So after your palate has been readied for the culinary splendour that is about to meet your lips try one of the lounge's appetizers or wait until you are seated in the restaurant to be impressed
My bf and I arrive 5 minutes later and walk into the restaurant hoping the host would be there to take us to our friends
It does not open on Sundays and if you plan on grabbing a late night snack after the club the restaurant will be closed
It shares a name with one of the newest restaurants on Park Avenue in New York but is completely unrelated
In the past two months I've eaten at 7 different sushi restaurants including two in New York and Toyama remains a slice above the rest
Again it pains me to have to say it but this restaurant is another that does not know what Japanese food is
But this alone does not make a Japanese restaurant
I would definitely recommend this place to those of you wanting to try something new and the price point makes it a great special occasion restaurant
Moving next to my dessert selection one of the frequently noted best dishes in Phoenix and denoted as an Award Winning Favorite on the restaurant menu the Chocolate and Butter Fry Bread would prove to be every bit the Fair Food extravagance I expected with the same airy dough this time served openfaced and drizzled - nay - ladled first with butter and then with melted dark chocolate tinged with what I believe was adobe spice and cinnamon
I feel we were  treated rudely and our bill was deliberately inflated as no one else was in the restaurant
Now while there has seemingly been a lot of complaints lately about restaurants treating their Groupon customers poorly we experienced no such negativity
This is also a type of food that you can find restaurants galore in Miami New york City and L
if these two restaurants are indeed related
From the moment I walked in the restaurant all of my senses were stimulated-from the delicious smells to the wonderful decor to the terrific music playing it was perfect
- there was a deconstructed taxi cab suspended from the ceiling which surprisingly I didn't notice until I had sat down and was surveying the restaurant - it's not as overhwhelming a piece of art as you might assume and the wall behind the bar is entirely populated with license plate numbers of NY cabs which was unusual but like I said - intriguing
So yes this is a kid-friendly restaurant which unfortunately translates to mediocre food at best
To be fair service was top-notch and the restaurant was spotlessly clean
Customer Appreciation rolls are the full size rolls at most Japanese restaurants in California and tastes just as good if not better
I have to be honest and say that I haven't tried anything else but I can tell you that SO MANY Chinese/Japanese restaurants of Maxim's caliber are really owned and run by Vietnamese
The point here is that not everyone is discerning regardless of whether they are eating their native fare and I find it difficult to believe that this would be considered a quality sushi restaurant among discerning Japanese diners given how much better quality sushi is available in the Valley
Many claim to be sushi spots but they lack the culture that we look for in a sushi restaurant
I later visited their restaurant bar and had a margarita and it tasted more like sweet & sour than the liquor
Let us also say that we've ate at very posh Scandinavian restaurants in New York City and this is by far the most authentic Swedish food we've tried
in the past three years the spot they are in has housed no less than five restaurants
I have visited 4 chain restaurants lately for an early Saturday morning breakfast
$19 later very disappointed since this was the highest rated thai restaurant in the area
Why is it that a $10/plate restaurant offers them complimentary yet this restaurant charges when their meals are nearly $20
My bf & I went to this restaurant unplanned for a late lunch super early dinner
I do not understand why there are only 15 parking spots here for a restaurant that easily seats over 100
This is not your family-style restaurant it's high end with amazing homemade pastas fresh salads spotless service truly a wonderful experience
I am more used to Japanese restaurants that cut the sea bass in thin slices then cover it with miso rather than having faint miso accents on the fish
I went into the restaurant to ask for plates and some salt&pepper
RA Sushi is a great Japanese restaurant with a lot of unique dishes that are often not found in most Japanese restaurant
Sima Marcellino and the entire staff make this restaurant our favorite location for special occasions
I went there for Mother's Day and the waiter gave us Italy Connoli the crispy crust pastry filled with cream and chocolate drip cause we waited for our food due to the very crowded restaurant
PHX seems to be populated with several of these former houses turned restaurants/bars
There's a variety of restaurants and bars to please most anyone's palate
This is never something I have encountered at any sushi restaurant; while some sushi chefs will combine rolls onto the same plate they are usually smart enough to separate rolls that indicate obvious dietary restrictions vegetarian for example
I wasn't expecting great Japanese food in Phoenix but I thought Sushi Roku would be a good bet since it's part of a group that has restaurants in SoCal and Vegas
really casual date or family nights not really a romantic or special occasion restaurant
This is now our favorite sushi/Japanese restaurant
I'm an  Italian girl from New York and I can honestly say Marcellino is one of the BEST Italian restaurants in the Valley
Now this is not the most ideal date spot because ambiance isn't important to this family owned restaurant
I like that they stay open a little later than some restaurants in the area
You shouldn't leave disappointed unless you're expecting something other than great food friendly staff and lo and behold a restaurant where you actually hear Japanese spoken by the staff
I've been to the restaurant several times and the food/service/price have been spot on
Joe originally from Philadelphia opened the restaurant thirty-three years ago in this exact spot in a strip mall on Granite Reef just south of McDonald in Scottsdale
Come early or stay late to enjoy food/drink at one of the great restaurants located around the stadium
According to the menu the restaurant was created to showcase the family's collection of antique blue plates
I know it is a Mexican restaurant IE 8-10 top sat down next to us and waiter stood at kids end yelling specials to the adults at the other end which our waiter never told us about empty plates left for long times ect
Our server saw I couldn't decide on wine so he recommended the Novy nebbiolo which was really great - one of the best wines I've ordered at a restaurant lately and affordable too
The staff was friendly especially the lovely lady who blessed us with free guacamole from the restaurant during the FREE snack time after 10pm which includes everything chocolate chips sodas and more our room which was considered a Jr
I am half Japanese and have had tried many Japanese restaurants and this one is one of the best in the Phoenix area
We are long time patrons of the previous Richardson's restaurants and on occasion were hitting Dick's Hideaway for Happy Hour and always enjoy it
Took my girl to @localbreeze for her birthday last night not that it's a celebration-type restaurant more that it's a quaint downtown spot without a wait and decent outdoor seating
This restaurant/nightspot has been a subject of lore
I love AZ88 and when I found out they were bringing a restaurant downtown I couldn't wait to make it my new favorite lunch spot
Well I have this soft spot for the FOX restaurant group because they totally nail it when it comes to atmosphere decor and a great staff
Several restaurants exist here pass the lunch spot that is closest to the main road and go to Morning Glory
Fish Tacos 1 Star; Restaurant 4 StarsWe decided to check out some shops in Cave Creek Sunday afternoon and thought this place looked like a nice spot for lunch
The atmosphere is the offspring of a restaurant coffee spot and bar after a drunken night of debauchery and no one knows who the parents are
Yes this would be expensive for a weekly sushi dinner but for a special occasion it was actually cheaper than other nice restaurants that we have been to
I recommend this restaurant for a special occasion for any sushi lover and for any occasion for the diner who can both appreciate and afford fine sushi
The host later told us that as he had walked the Mexican out of the restaurant he told him that we had supposedly invited him to have lunch with us
Driving into the parking lot the restaurant is easy enough to spot
While I realized that he was a native to the Phoenix Metro Area and had probably never even had the real thing I trusted his palate and restaurant sense
This is the perfect restaurant savory food spot-on service cozy atmosphere
I'm really surprised how reviewers have not picked up on this great little sushi bar inside a Japanese restaurant
This is my new favorite Japanese restaurant in N
This isn't a fancy restaurant but you wouldn't know it by the attentive service and spotless tables
Where the restaurant lost huge points with me was the inflated over-priced menu
I seldom go South and West from work but last week I was headed that way for lunch and spotted this place Yelp has made me much better at seeing restaurants and thought strip mall Mexican need to check this out
Not a restaurant I would frequent but may visit occasionally if I'm in the area
If you are visiting or celebrating a special occasion this restaurant is the place
Even compared to restaurants in the china towns of Washington D C or New York City
the portions were a lot bigger than any Japanese restaurant I've been  and they were on hh
Now I know that I have higher expectations of many places especially restaurants that charge an average of $26 a plate and while I understand we were there at eight pm on a Saturday night I felt really unappreciated and unwelcome
We have been told that this is authentic to Japan so I was impressed to see this in the valley having been to many Japanese restaurants
However this place has the most extensive menu I've seen at a Japanese restaurant that is known as a sushi bar
Eden's is a small family-owned restaurant where we have received good service and good food on multiple occasions
Yes F n B is a tiny restaurant perched among many trendier spots in Old Town but this was some of the best food and LOCAL wine that I have ever experienced
I can name a dozen Japanese restaurants around the country including mom and pop robata dives neighborhood sushi restaurants and high end places like Nobu that do seafood and robata better than this place
The food is really quite good for a fast casual Japanese restaurant
So to the restaurant it's your typical fast casual restaurant you order pick up your food with a number get your own drinks salsa but a waitress comes around to refill your drinks or clear away empty plates
Review for the Scottsdale Road locationThe Spotted Donkey is a semi-upscale Mexican restaurant with absolutely delicious food and great-tasting drinks especially the signature margaritas
I was looking for a restaurant to host a very special occasion for 7 guests
Dessert was also top notched and to make the experience even sweeter Mark Tarbell came by to congratulate us and thanked us for choosing his restaurant to host our special event
The bad I called in my take out order from home and got to the restaurant about 15 mins later
But Phoenix though I stand by the hard working and talented chefs and restauranteurs in my home town for their food has a draught of truly posh sophisticated dining spots
The restaurant/bakery has an array of amazing and tasty items like hummus flat bread pies shawarma falafel amazing pitas small pies all fresh made on the spot for ridiculously low prices
in fact everyone in the restaurant should have one too in case her bag slips off writes in a late-night probably drunken message to me;You couldn't be a meaner person
I will say this about the artery-clogging heart attack on a plate restaurant
It is a house-turned-restaurant so it's not a spot you will just stumble upon
The restaurant itself is huge and it is beautifully decorated and immaculate
The service is spectacular friendly and its in a great spot by like every good old town restaurant so save room for dessert even though cowboy ciao makes that difficult and try out Lee's
The folks who run True Food and a handful of other non-related concept restaurants are the kind of people I have a hard time taking seriously
The price is now the same as a sit down Mexican restaurant with real plates and the food is microwaved and served like a fast food place
She also helped up each pick a desert Just an odd little place Japanese and Italian noodles in a restaurant with plenty an Eiffel Tower decoration and a bright red British phone booth
An elder Japanese couple runs this restaurant apparently since 1983
I've been trying to make my way through the list of Devour Phoenix restaurants and Switch was my latest dig
The family-owned restaurant which is decorated with a mix of Native American and Mexican kitschy art originated in Arizona and now has four locations in the state as well as one in New York
I highly recommend this restaurant and we will definitely be back especially for special occasions
After visits on three different occasions I can honestly say that for independent restaurants destinations here in the Valley Tuck Shop is at the top of my list
Ultimately it allows you to really get into how this restaurant works but it kind of backfires  I know enough to cook Japanese-style now for about 1/10th the price
I'm guessing that the 8$ I paid for the sandwich is more for covering the hip little piece of chocolate the napkin and the overall look of the restaurant than it is for the sandwich
I've always liked the atmosphere at the other Los Dos better I mean come on the red chili plate is aka chile colorado at any other Mexican restaurant but at least the food used to be good
My recommendations try the green chile plate aka chile verde at any other Mexican restaurant
When was the last time that you went to a restaurant and were still bragging about your experience two weeks later
turn into the lane for the complex and then go into the garage there are spots for the restaurant in the back past the residential spots
It along with most of the restaurants I've seen lately has been nicely renovated
The pasta part was just ok- Beignets really good crispy small balls but more sweet than savory cheesy- Peanut butter chocolate pie my fave dessert combo which I liked a lotMidlights- Key lime pie I'm a big fan of key lime but in this version the flavors weren't distinct enough so I'd call in just okLowlights- Menu on website doesn't match menu at the restaurant so hub was disappointed on no prime ribFood was fine and hear it's fun for drinks so might try going there sometime when I'm in the area
On the few occasions that I have been there I have found the servers to be polite and obliging the food to be hot & tasty and the restaurant to be clean
RESTAURANTS I've been to Shula's Ling and Louie's Cafe 24/7 and the food court on multiple occasions
-Ling and Louie's is an Asian fusion restaurant with ok sushi but a nice atmosphere good for a late-night dinner or lunch
This is the first restaurant I've ever been to that didn't do SOMETHING to acknowledge a birthday - whether it be a candle special plate decoration or at least free dessert
I waited three weeks to write this because I wanted to make sure I was not overreacting to the experience but I feel more strongly than ever that having eaten in some of the finest restaurants in New York and overseas this place is absolutely appalling
I passed up on the Japanese side of the restaurant since whats a vegetarian to do with sushi and sake bombs anyways
I would also love to have a nice ethnic restaurant in the neighborhood that I can go to on occasion for  a little variety
The restaurant and bar is decorated with bright decor and the dance floor is a hot spot on the weekends
The owners are really so pleasant the restaurant is spotless as well
It felt very NYC as I learned later it has a sister restaurant in NYC
Unassuming from the exterior in a strip mall with such high end boutiques as Enterprise Rent-A-Car and sharing a zip code with a cowboy tourist targeted bar that features bull riding of the non-mechanical variety Binkley's is a tiny destination restaurant that seems slightly uncomfortable with its surroundings and we were equally slightly out of place with our sinusoidal experience not for control freaks- Greeted by name due to party size and expected arrival time being unique resulted in feeling like VIPs confused by their own fame- Sending away the sommelier a bit dejected when we unanimously declined wine- Realizing our head waitress was a bizarro version of a friend from back home- Opting for the highest end 5-6 course tasting menus $82 - $89 wine pairing $40-50 extra like non-confused VIPs but skipping the foie gras surcharge +$14- Being thankful of no collective food restrictions or allergies to impede chef creativity- Impressed by a nearly endless train of experimental amuse-bouches- Processing that we were 3-4 courses in without seeing anything we ordered- Recalling that some of us were no stranger to this dining style when it's called omakase except then there's no illusion of input into the majority of the meal- Hitting our stride with the hot appetizer including a superb soft shell crab course- Enjoying the best black cod I've ever eaten in a sea of unusual but not quite as enjoyable candidates- Starting to feel full around the penultimate course an amuse of chocolate souffle - Understanding without bitterness that soda refills were not free $2
It was at the time when chocolate souffles were at every French restaurant
I get to the restaurant and go in briefly if at all taking note of the decor the attitude of the staff I encounter along the way the crowd the music playing occasionally the lighting
While I was visiting she told me she finally found a great Japanese restaurant
The restaurant choices are quality and the service is spot on
As a frequent to Japanese restaurants for a few years now this is the 2nd place in the valley that I've had such fresh sashimi
99% of Japanese restaurant in the valley uses powder wasabi
-- oooh they were both delicious however I recommend the later one more just cause it's very unique to this restaurant
Arriving to the restaurant there were only 2 parking spots open and they were behind the beer truck that was blocking them next to a foul smelling dumpster and gas tanks sitting out in the open
TK's owner later told me that the couple being honored-- as well as their children-- had been coming to the restaurant for years
Also they are always consistent here which is a huge factor in Japanese restaurants
While I loathe to rave about a restaurant on Yelp and thereby abet in the massing of the hordes at my fav spots I can't restrain myself when I come across a gem that deserves it
if u don't know most sushi restaurants and japanese restaurants are actually owned by koreans lols
There are so many great restaurants of similar pricing in Scottsdale - I recommend you head to one of those and pass by the White Chocolate Grill
I like trying new things and I have some kind of inchoate desire that I haven't really articulated even to myself to try every restaurant in a 10 mile radius of our apartment
Their choices for restaurants are usually spot on though I must say The HERB BOX was a huge disappointment
For a restaurant that is first and foremost a place to get food and also serves alcohol to be serving their foodstuff on paper plates is disastrous
It's a dress up and splurge restaurant if you want but it can also be a shockingly cheap happy hour spot
restaurants without windowsRokerij is fast becoming a new favorite spot of mine
As you walk out of the restaurant you can grab a salty chocolate chip cookie
The restaurants on site were excellent Palo Verde for breakfast Bogies The Grill and the Spotted Donkey for dinner
The spot is comprised of several stories with the main restaurant and bar on the middle floors
You will have the legit Japanese style sushi restaurant experience
It was late and we were hungry and this was the first restaurant we saw right across from the public parking off Mill Ave
This is an authentic Japanese sushi restaurant not your typical Scottsdale sushi spot
I feel like if your restaurant is charging more than 20$/plate you should have more professional wait staff
This is also a perfect restaurant for a date night on the patio or when you have friends in town or need a nice dinner spot for one with the parents
It would be like someone complaining about a New York strip steak being served in a French restaurant
I have been very dissapointed lately in the quality of the Meixican food restaurants we have visited
However being late to find Ajo Al's on Shea just past Scottsdale Rd im happy to say i have found one of the best mexican restaurants around
From the second you enter the door it's pretty obvious that Cherryblossom isn't exactly your usual Japanese restaurant
Since we had a later reservation 845 pm the restaurant was pretty full when we arrived but as the night progressed it emptied out
If they can get the restaurant operations to run more smoothly I will be giving this breakfast spot more stars in the future
I'd never been to Native New Yorker before at any location so the entire restaurant is new to me
It's intimate and I'm glad they're open later than most restaurants
Side dishes are not a meal with the level of chefs they have working in this restaurant they should be able to put a composed dish on the plate
One thing I noticed quickly is that they had the color of the plates and the prices very well broadcast in the restaurant
She stated that the steam tables were kept at the required by Maricopa county temperature and that the circulating air in the restaurant cooled the food down AFTER it was placed upon our plates
I know that was the least healthiest thing I could have ordered but no other restaurant offers M&Ms or chocolate chips in pancakes
She even owned her own Mexican restaurant in upstate New York
It's a great date spot as it doesn't get as crazy and loud as Sapporo and it looks more stylish than the other tastier sushi restaurants
the restaurants are good but most of your day you will spend by the pool sipping on great frozen drinks while occasionally finding a small pool somewhere you didn't know existed
When I met some friends for dinner at this restaurant at the end of October I liked it so much that I made a mental note to write something later
When cars are pulling into the spots right in front of the restaurant some diners were blinded by the headlights
At this location there are a couple of nearby restaurant only - 15 minutes parking spots
The decor has already been described by other reviewers--it's someone's idea of what a Texas themed restaurant should look like with all sorts of license plates and other crap hung up on the walls
True Food Kitchen the latest to come from Fox Restaurant Concepts and Dr
This wasn't just having a bad night which I let go all the time when I occasionally encounter it in restaurants
Excellent Japanese restaurant serving entrees that are comparable if not sometimes better than food you can find in San Francisco's Japantown
Mesa is not exactly an ethnic restaurant hot spot
I'm not normally a picky person when it comes to service but when you're paying 30-50 for a plate of food I expect the restaurant to get the service right and make it an experience for the guest
said there isn't a full service Japanese restaurant downtown so this is basically your only choice
The north Scottsdale spot is pretty from the outside with twinkly lights adorning the exterior of the restaurant
The restaurant is immaculately clean the wait staff is top notch and takes great pride in their establishment
I must confess I am a Gaijin Japanese term for non-Japanese but I have been to Japan more than 30 times during my life and had the opportunity to eat at many of the best restaurants throughout Japan so I can assure you that if you are looking for truly authentic Japanese food you will be thrilled with Shimogamo
The only downside is you will never be able to eat at those cheap American versions of Japanese restaurants again
The food has been consistently good for decades but lately I hear and see a waiter who talks disparagingly about the owners and their other restaurants in Vegas
so I get a text to meet at this spot and I put the name and address together and im like wtfmakes no senseim inso im thinking some wannabe swank mockery of a white trash bar/grillWrongI was shocked and overly impressed by this restaurant/bistro 70 decor spotthe food is orgasmicly infused to take you way back to comfortable times and drinks that will blow your mindthe lemonchella blew me out of the waterone its just like my grandpa made and twoBig in az
EDIT to add I don't want to speculate about something that would harm a restaurant without solid proof
This kitchen on both occasions seems to lack the professionalism of a quality restaurant
You know a restaurant has earned a spot in the rotation when halfway through the meal the discussion involves what will be ordered on the next visit
They charge as much as a full Italian restaurant does - I've never seen a diner drive thru or a dive that charges so much per plate
Restored into a restaurant and bar from an old department store Hanny's has the feel straight of of New York City
Since I was a newcomer Erica behind the bar shared some background info on the restaurant including the coal oven and the filtration process used so that the water for the dough is as close to New York water as you can get in AZ
I got a prime parking spot in the small lot next to the restaurant there is a larger lot across the street
This cute little neighborhood breakfast/lunch spot just opened up and is the sister restaurant to Tuck Shop
I later realized that this is a chain restaurant
Spotted Donkey Cantina looked so promising from the excellent reviews to the stunning and modern restaurant
I recently went back for old times sake at this location and to my horrible dismay they had replaced the style of that pizza with one that emulates how other restaurants had done it
This is bad because you don't feel isolated from the hotel at some tables in the restaurant which hampers the ambiance
If you arrive during peak hours the restaurant can be a bit loud or crowded but it's a nice spot for a solo meal
I grew up in with a Sicilian family and spent years on the East Coast eating literally hundreds of meals in restaurants all throughout New York Pennsylvania and New Jersey
It's my boyfriend's favorite brewery/restaurant/hang out spot and if he had the choice we'd go every night even though it's a 30 minute drive away
This restaurant/bar is casual cool and nothing like many of the sceney spots that surround it in Old Town
I've seen far too many tapas restaurants that charge $8 a plate and lose sight of the entire purpose of sharing food and mingling with friends
We scored a spot in front of the restaurant just as someone else was leaving
Wtf that was the first time anyone in a restaurant said later to me
The restaurant is larger than it appears from the outside in fact you can and I have on many occasions drive right past with nary a glance
After eating at some great Middle Eastern-Mediterranean restaurants lately my thoughts turn to the mediocre experience I had at The Pita Jungle here in Phoenix
The colors inside the restaurant were predominately chocolate brown and a yellowish green
The restaurant had an almost desolate quality to it due to the quiet emptiness surrounding us
Expect bars head shops overpriced clothing stores Urban Outfitters etc chain restaurants the occasional hole-in-the-wall off beat eateries and hordes of drunk 20 somethings shouting and vomiting on each other
My search for the perfect plate of General Tso's chicken has taken me to dozens of Chinese food restaurants large and small all over the country
I was not familiar with New York style Chinese food before but apparently it means dingy restaurant ugly chairs and tables the same generic menu that you've seen dozens of times before flimsy plastic eating utensils and damn good food
I cleared the plate and ever since I left the restaurant I have this yearning to return
This is the only Japanese restaurants in this neck of the valley
When I received my plate of bean spouts mints lime and slice jalapenos the portion was the smallest ever for a Pho restaurant
It's certainly telling that the restaurant is busy even when we go for a late lunch at 2pm
Yasu has quickly become my favorite Japanese restaurant in town
The spot has a pretty patio with twinkly lights and a fireplace and the inside restaurant is dimly lit warm and cozy
Sunnyslope's latest addition is an upscale steak and seafood restaurant complete with white tablecloths and live jazz music some evenings
But looking around at the mostly 45+ out-of-town diners and knowing that most Phoenix restaurants aspire to haute cuisine but don't execute it very well the menu of mostly grilled protein and easily identifiable sides potatoes leeks green peas etc was spot on
Chilaquiles if a restaurant has chilaquiles on the menu- I try it eggs benedict blueberry muffin and chocolate chip muffin
This corner spot has run through so many restaurants and finally they have one that is going to stick
This doesn't usually bode well with me because from my personal experience the fancier the restaurant the more they stray from the authenticity of the cuisine by trying to please the american palate
The staff was friendly and helpful the restaurant and facilities were spotless and the manager even came over and chatted with us personally
For a special occasion there is no better place to go than this great Lebanese restaurant
The fish tacos were very tasty the salsa was good and fresh and I was impressed with the $2 happy hour mini caesar salad that was served on a large plate and bigger than some lunch portion salads at other restaurants
As soon as I saw the chunky dark chocolate floor mirror I knew the food would be good I went by myself for lunch one weekday afternoon and although the restaurant was fairly empty it felt like it was alive
I realize that they're not a real Japanese restaurant but nevertheless
Now that I am officially full for the weekend I will never forget my great birthday experience at BLT and I definitely think this is a restaurant you should consider for a special occasion
I am on a Thai kick lately- tried 5 thai restaurants recently and am trying another next week
I was impressed with the food presentation taste and the unique change from the common sashimi and other Japanese fare from other restaurants
The sushi is average at best but I come back because they have a good happy hour and the ambiance is way better than at your average Japanese restaurant
If you're used to sit-down 'classy' restaurants and waiter service well you might find this place 'lacking' but honestly these sorts of places focus on what matters - what's on your plate rather than what's on the wall
BEWARE******Used my Credit Card on 5/14/12 Lady walked away with my card to the back of the Restaurant while I stood at the counter and 2 days later the FRAUD team from my bank called to confirm hundreds of dollars of purchases at Rite Aid location in California******someone copied my card and purchased Gift Cards
I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area looking for a romantic spot to take a loved one to
They stayed open late for us and were gracious and attentive when we were the last party in the restaurant
Not particularly a fan of Fieri but having found some of his recommendations to at least be interesting and in the case of Rino's Place occasionally outstanding the restaurant fit my time frame as well as location and as such I decided to give it a go
My husband and I spent 3 years looking for a New York style Chinese restaurant
I will add that we were the only Asians in the restaurant so no Japanese employees
- extremely busy- incredible amount of caucasian customers for a Vietnamese restaurant- if you expect clean don't go here pretty much true for every Vietnamese restaurant in the valley with the exception of Saigon Nights in Scottsdale- parking can be challenging- the crepe appetizer is very tasty- pho banh mi are up to par- the broken rice combo plates are quite good
This location has been many different restaurants over the years - this is a tough spot
Instead our waitress walked around the restaurant puzzedly WITH the uni shots like a nomad until she returned 5 minutes later to say there was no more uni
This restaurant is a great spot for just about anything
25 minutes later one of the managers comes to tell us he's sorry but I ordered the last lobster tail in the restaurant and the chef burned it on the grill
Their pool party rocked the service was near perfect the rooms were nice they have an in-house spa Japanese restaurant Sushi Roku and a lounge The living room
yes that's what I was told at the to-go register when I parked a few feet from the door at a metered parking spot by the restaurant and merely asked to break a dollar so our party could eat here
When my friend mentioned this spot as a place to have dinner at  I imagined a chocolate fondue place with a chocolate waterfall to greet me at the entrance to the restaurant don't ask me why about the waterfall
In a nutshell our server was efficient  the food was good   the decor was nice  but there wasn't any cascading chocolate waterfall at the entrance to the restaurant
And we used to go for special occasions to Bobby MaGees which is where BobbyQ's is now located says something about the quality of my restaurant experiences as a young fella
I'm usually the kind of person who doesn't speak up when I'm unhappy with something at a restaurant but as we were waiting for our food we noticed the small plates and the wine glasses were super dirty
Lord knows anyone who dares open a restaurant these days has a lot of challenges but I can't recommend this new Vietnamese spot simply based on the food
Thinking it would be busy up til the late hours we went at 945 and it was empty leaving us to be that awkward couple left in the restaurant
Scale of 1-10 multiple visitsn/a Food10 **Drinks**10 Service9 Atmosphere7 ValueThis new bar spot was just opened by the owners of the next-door Breadfruit restaurant Jamaican food
It's that special occasion and you need a special restaurant
Bottom line nice spot with good people watching and the only restaurant on the Scottsdale Mall that had any customers at all on the night we were there
Last night FnB Restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale hosted the Tiny Fab Kidney Fund late night dinner service to benefit Amy Donohue & The Dwivedi family
The owners other restaurant Sam's Cafe got the primo spot with the patio
While I was eating my lunch the waiter happily sprayed Windex on the table across from me half of the spray ended up in my plate   Guess they are trying to give you the  authentic Indian Restaurant experience what is an Indian Curry without the whiff of Windex on it
Generally I don't tend to order beef at any restaurant except for the occasional Wendy's hamburger I just love those square patties
Pedregal is home to great restaurants like the Spotted Donkey and frozen treats like Haagen Daz
If you like Japanese food this is the best restaurant in Scottsdale
It's right next to the aisle with all the plates and bowls that you see at all the other Chinese and Japanese restaurants you've ever been to
OK here I thought I was going into a Japanese restaurant and they've got a dish called Viva Caliente
One draw back is that it is smaller than expected so if you come from a place like SoCal where Japanese markets were like large grocery stores with mini stores and restaurants located inside you might not be too happy
Bathrooms were also spotless nobody ever mentions this in restaurant reviews but I always find this information useful
In spite of the poor dessert choices this time around I'm convinced that people who think their food is overpriced or overrated have poor palates and probably rarely venture outside of chain restaurants where the food is laden with corn syrup MSG and other fake flavors
It's Pei-Wei style restaurant where you get your own silverware and such and the owner and even staff would walk around and take your plate if you were done and even refill my drink
The rest of us who know that you go to a Chris Bianco restaurant to enjoy the food will be happy to fill your empty spots
BLT Steak truly is a special occasion restaurant as my boyfriend and I learned firsthand on Valentine's Day
Of all the Japanese/Sushi restaurants in Phoenix Yasu Sushi Bistro is at the top of my list
