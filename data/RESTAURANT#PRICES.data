I never mind the food prices and accept that wine is pricy but like any other restaurant the prices creep closer to retail as you go up in quality and price
For that kind of price in this type of restaurant I would expect fresh fish
the unchain chain it's a Fox Restaurant Concepts venue does a nice job of good food at reasonable price and with pretty good speed
To the food As I said above the food is good not great but like all Sam Fox restaurants its overpriced
We've been pretty disappointed with most of the Korean food around town which has ranged from mediocre and expensive Hodori to awful and expensive Red Kimchi/Korean Restaurant to just generally mediocre Takematsu
And I wasn't thrilled with the cheap wooden chopsticks - they changed the flavors of the subtle foods a little bit so I used the silverware - seemed a weird oversight for a restaurant that seems so focused on flavor precision but no biggie
If you want a good burger that's NOT frozen or from a fast food restaurant but also is a GREAT price for college students
Yes the prices are a bit high compared to serving size but I felt it was worth it given the complexity of the recipes and the fact that this ice cream parlor needs a liquor license Desserts in sit-down restaurants cost considerably more and are not usually as good as this ice cream
So if you are looking for some delicious inexpensive Mexican food served really fast and in a clean restaurant Moreno is your grill
Prices are pretty cheap $5ish for the various happy hour sushi rolls service is pretty fast and it's great that it's locally owned and not a chain restaurant
I don't have TOO much to complain about regarding the size of the rolls they were decent or the taste it was ok considering this is tempe arizona but I think I was most turned off by the service and prices of the restaurant
The restaurant is definitely on the small side and pretty bare - just a few booths and tables and the Mexican channel is always on in the corner but nonetheless pretty good food for the price you pay
I was hesitant about the restaurants located inside the hotel but the Sushi restaurant near the lobby is really good and not that expensive and the SWB bistro is also pretty good
Slightly less expensive than Swaddee Thai but both restaurants offer such a unique interpretation of their signature dishes that it is worth it to frequent both
The prices are low for some items and so maybe this should be forgiven but it has the ambiance and attitude of a special outing restaurant and the food needs to live up to that
Outside of the fact that the food was a bit overpriced for how un-innovative and bland it was on the whole I was also incredibly turned off by the way the restaurant dealt with our lunch reservation
The wait staff in the restaurant was very attentive and the food was very good although a little pricey
In most traditional Chinese restaurants low price = small portions and/or very poor quality food
Looking at the menu I thought the prices were a bit high for a restaurant of this caliber but I feel that any sub-par food is over priced
Also why can't a restaurant that carries a limited and expensive menu specializing in burgers Zin Delux serve higher quality beef
This place is way too expensive for the quality of food you get when compared to any of the Greek restaurants around Phoenix

The prices in this restaurant were middle of the road but the staff and the fish made it a good value
The food is around but below drive through Filberto's quality at near restaurant prices
The food at El Bravo just tastes better than the food at any other Mexican restaurant I have been to in Phoenix regardless of price
Pros -   Reasonable prices Kid friendlyCons -      * Food is nothing to write home about * Not vegetarian friendly * Gift shop on premisesDescription    * There's a quite large playground in front of the restaurant and a small arcade on the inside
I like this place but I have had better pizza in restaurants with nicer atmosphere and better prices
Great service delicious food and the price is really not as expensive as the restaurant appears
I remember walking into the restaurant thinking this will be a pricey dinner but to my pleasant surprise the prices they were charging for the quality and amount of food was a steal
Staff is extremely friendly and the restaurant offers great food at a reasonable price
Prices are in line with other restaurants at Desert Ridge but given that the food isn't spectacular I'll just go elsewhere for my falafel fix
The food was not worth the price it seems like this restaurant thinks they can get away with murder because they are all over organic ingredients and gluten-free crusts
Pro'sSuperb serviceMouth watering steaks and foodAttention to detailConsPrice - but typical for a gourmet steak houseThey really lay-on the wine suggestions even after you declineIf you haven't gone I think it is one of the BEST places on the list for Restaurant Week
I am Vietnamese and this restaurant has my stamp of approval for authenic cheap good food
The selection isn't as large as some other sushi restaurants that's why I didn't put five stars but you can't beat the price
Probably because the prices aren't bad the menu looks like it should be excellent and the quality of the food isn't that bad considering the restaurant is quick service
I think it is a bit above the average restaurant price but with its quality in food and service we will definitely check back
Now this is not a cheap sea food restaurant
This restaurant is a lot of fun has reasonable prices and very good food
great food + great price = great restaurant
cheap wine ok food and the odd assortment of individuals in the bar area providing entertainment give this restaurant a weird charm
The food is slightly pricey but wonderful for the restaurant
Only negative is the Graze restaurant not a very good selection of items to choose from especially when you are catering to families staying here I tried only two items and was not overly impressed with food or prices but I'm sure there will be those that disagree with me
Below is the menu choices that we had on offeringFirst CourseSmoked Paprika Braised Pork Shoulder Queso Cotija Guacamole Shaved Baby Radishes Korabuta Pork Belly Butternut Squash Hash Tamarind Peach Glaze Hand Rolled Porcini Gnocchi Maitakes Ginger Cabbage Black Bean Miso CreamSecond CourseGrilled Romaine Fried Rainbow Valley Egg Spanish Anchovies Capers Raisins Roasted Striped Beets Gala Apples Horseradish Cream Prairie Breeze Amish Cheddar Applewood Smoked Duck Breast Peaches Sweet Corn Cranberries Almonds Arugula Frisee *Add $5Third CourseGrilled Pork Porterhouse Spaetzle Spaghetti Squash Bacon Brussel Slaw Amish Asian Pear Butter Niman Ranch Tri-Tip Steak Roasted Fingerlings Baby Rainbow Carrots Black Mesa Ranch Feta Caper Aioli Wild Caught Market Fish White Beans Cherry Tomatoes Fennel Baby Spinach Green Goddess SwordfishNow on top of this there were a couple items on top of the normal menu there were Sweetbreads for the First Course +5 supp and there was another option for the second course but I do not recall what it wasCourse 1 - I had the Sweetbreads which were had a sauce that was delicious i cannot remembe what kind the good kind with a plum apple slices to freshen it up for some acidity and they had a cornmealish fried texture to them -- I had been to Blackbird 1 star Michelin Chicago who also served up a sweetbread 1st course and this preperation blew it out of the water and that was our favorite app we had there -- Also they gave a very good portion size as well this was not a Restaurant Week portion to make tons of money this was their normal portion just at a discounted price - one thing that always drove me crazy about RW is that many places don't put their best foot forward and try to make a quick buck instead of trying to gain return clientsThe Mrs had the Pork Belly which I have to say was one of the best pork belly's i have had in a very very long time
This restaurant isn't much to look at on the outside but it's got everything it needs on the inside including friendly staff cheap prices and delicious dishes
I was excited to eat at a lunch counter restaurant with lunch counter prices where the food was cooked up in the imagination of someone who normally catered to a different crowd
The food overall was really good and at a very good value on Restaurant Week prices
The restaurant wasn't crowded at all which is beyond me because I think this place was exceptional and very fairly priced for the caliber of food and service we received
Because the quality of the dishes didn't live up to the hype or price I felt like this was simply a novelty restaurant hiding behind a gimmick rather than great food
Imagine this a swanky new Scottsdale restaurant that has down to earth prices fantastic food and attentive top-notch service
The restaurant is a cut above -- considerably above -- the standard hotel restaurant in this country with reasonable prices for quite good food
Let's just say for the actual price of the food that this restaurant isn't worthy of a revisit
This is perfect way to skip the dessert at whatever restaurant you are at and get one much more flavorful and worth the price
If you are looking for this option then try it but otherwise I would find a restaurant that offers a smaller selection of these dishes at a lower price
I've looked at the food menu and it seemed expensive and because I don't have a bajillion dollars I can't go here frequently but when I'm feeling frisky I put on a nice shirt and go to the Compass Restaurant
So all in all NoRTH to me is like every other fox restaurant it's cool good consistent maybe a little overpriced for food that is slightly casual but it's good enough that they get away with it and you realize you are paying for the ambiance and experience too
Price  We order almost the same thing at most dim sum restaurants as we have our favorite dishes
I used to go to the Pita Jungle or the way more expensive My Big Fat Greek restaurant three miles west but for the food and prices this place hits the spot

No it's good for fast food but honestly for the $25 my husband son and I could have had a nice lunch at a sit down restaurant for the same price
When I don't feel like cooking or waiting in line at another fast food restaurant or sitting down to order an expensive meal Jimmy John's is my go-to meal
This is a well run kitchen serving great food at an affordable price - in fact after eating here and tasting the freshness for yourself you'll start to feel conned by so many other restaurants that charge more and for little nutritional value in their dishes
The Desert Oasis is a modern fine dining restaurant well prepared food without the extensive use of expensive ingredients run by the Culinary Arts school at Scottsdale Community College

The food was really good although I can't rave about it because we have so many other great restaurants that I believe are much better for the price
Restaurant was a '4' good food and not as overpriced as I would have expected
The prices are way too high for the level of food that was served and apart from that if  I am going to shell out $50+ for a 2 person dinner than it is expected that the ambiance of the restaurant be at least at the level of PF Changs e
Good prices cozy friendly restaurant and good food
The food was of decent restaurant quality and definitely a good place to get steaks but it was no where near the quality you would get from Texas Roadhouse or Outback and neither is the price
- the waitress was friendly bland and close to useless- the food was bland and way beyond expensive- the restaurant is in a great location close to the freeway- the bill was stunning for what the 6 people in our party received
Although the restaurant is rather expensive I have to say the service and food is exceptional
The restaurant usually serves two to three dishes labeled as such at discounted prices
The pizza was horrible and for the same price or a couple bucks more get a gourmet pizza at a real Italian restaurant or get 2 to 3 frozen pizzas that would be better tasting
I've had the fajitas which were good and the chicken enchiladas which were amazingly average - at least for the prices which are dangerously similar to a certain competing restaurant 1
We skipped the restaurant due to checking out the menu on line before we left and the prices were pretty outrageous and after reading other reviews about the food on here I am glad we did
We had been occasionally ordering pizzas from Hungry Howie's or Papa John's but after John Schnatter made some ridiculous comments about having to raise prices a whopping 14-30 cents because of the Affordable Care Act we decided we should be ordering from local restaurants preferably those that take care of the employees that helped build their businesses
If you look at other notable pizza restaurants in Phoenix- Humble Pie La Grande Orange Cibo and even Pizzeria Bianco all of the prices for pizza at these restaurants are less money

This is an excellent family run restaurant with lovely food + service that will provide you with a completely satisfying meal at a good price and Yelpers should congregate to this location and partake in a  feverish frenzy of foodie bliss
The TeePee is a great old-time Phoenix restaurant where the food is hearty fresh and well prepared the staff is always friendly and prices are very reasonable
But the service was lacking - for this level of restaurant you expect exceptional service - and frankly this caliber of food can be found elsewhere with good service and more reasonable prices
But we have concluded 1 Rokerij does offer good food - but they are slightly over priced for the quality 2 the professionalism was seriously lacking in service presentation of the wine list focused on the price and not the taste pallets and 3 they should get their ego in check - I get that you have a long list of people waiting for tables at your restaurant - but the next time I have a special event I will be going to one of the dozens of restaurants in the valley and receive the level of service that should come with the ambiance and food
It's a beautiful restaurant and having a place that serves healthy albeit somewhat pricey food is important in our fast food nation
I went to the best pizza restaurant in phoenix and this place blew it away in taste atmosphere service and price
If you accept the fact that this restaurant is extremely high end for steak houses price-wise then you can just sit back and enjoy the experience because the food here is fantastic
The food is great too at the restaurant on the grounds and not unreasonably priced
So the mixture of very pushy service combined with tacos that were memorable in all the wrong ways make me hesitant to try this restaurant again when I can get really tasty Mexican food for way cheaper at other places in the East Valley
This place is a small family owned Mexican restaurant common in CA if you're from there Maria is such as nice lady and the food is quite good and cheap
We have been to a number of other restaurants in the East Valley for sushi and this by far is the best from both quality AND price perspective
Favorite little restaurant in Scottsdale ; Delicious French cuisine very cool decor and environment and reasonably priced for the quality of food
I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good cheap food
--- the food is a little overpriced and not worthy of 5 stars but the concept of this restaurant / movie theater makes up for it many times over
Prices were what you would expect given the restaurant's reputation and the dishes offered
Price wise it was a little higher than other restaurants Seems to be $18-25 per person we had been to however the quality of the food is well worth it
It only took me one visit to this restaurant to know that this is the real thing--the food was amazing the waitress close-lipped the prices perfect
Some of those restaurants may even include a lean protein on the salad like chicken or salmon for that price
The food is good between quality fast-food and a trendy restaurant the prices are more than reasonable and the service was great
Cool atmosphere in a nice area of town - prices are pretty even with nicer sushi restaurants I've visited in any major city in other words a little higher than you'd typically see in a smaller town or in a place with less attention to decor

The restaurant I went to with family before our flight wasn't badly priced and served our food quickly
With friendly service good food and reasonable prices I would recommend this restaurant to anybody
While this place has a great ambiance and I love the patio there's nothing more annoying than a restaurant that serves a plate of food that doesn't come close to satisfying a normal person's appetite and it's a high price
The bill total for 4 people actually came to the same price we payed at Fine Italian Restaurant Tutti Santi that included Dessert
Prices are high it's a sea food restaurant but the food is worth it
I like the layout the space the decor and the vibe was good up until about 845pm and then the restaurant was DEAD but for the price the food was just okay and the burgers were WAY too salty
The music was loud maybe too loud for some but overall I am grateful that I can have a great pizza and sandwich at a reasonable price since my former favorite neighborhood restaurant took a slight dive in taste and subsequent ratings
The quality of service and food were reflective of a five-star restaurant without mirroring the small portions and high prices
The chili was very common and could have come from a can doubt it was 'homemade'  the Reuben was good as was the turkey sandwich but all in all will not go back too many restaurants with better food and better prices
The quality of food at this restaurant warrants much higher prices than what they charge
The menu was expensive which made me think that it was a fancy place but it turns out that the food was expensive because it was a restaurant inside a hotel
Over time the restaurant went downhill the quality of the fish was lowered and overall it seemed too overpriced for what you got
Looking around we noticed this was part of the restaurant's decor which seemed odd considering the price of the dishes averaged $20/plate
The food was overpriced but the restaurant smelled good and lets face it
A family owned restaurant that has great prices great food and a great atmosphere
Inexpensive delicious Italian food in a small and personable restaurant
The food at Someburros is on par with any good Mexican restaurant in the Valley but it is fast and inexpensive
However the food being underprepared for the second time in a row is unforgivable especially for as expensive a restaurant as Fleming's is
The wording on the groupon certainly made it seem like you got both the wines and food for the groupon price but they assured me at the restaurant that I needed to purchase the wine
We'd only paid about $40 for the food and after our experience it's clear that the low prices are driven by the purchase of bargain basement ingredients that are not up to the standards of even moderately selective restaurants
I gave this restaurant 5 stars for the quality of the food the fast and friendly service as well as price
The type of atmosphere they are aiming for the prices and selections of food remind me a lot of a BJ's Restaurant
For the quality of the food I would say that it was a little expensive but it beats going to McDonalds or other fast food restaurants
I didn't find it too pricey either - I mean compared to sushi restaurants
Value  The food a little pricey end of the spectrum but I have come accustomed to that when going to hipster-like restaurants
This is definitely a delicious restaurant and I really appreciate their consideration for local and sustainable food products but it is a bit out of my price range
The first time I ate here I didn't have a memorable experience because the food was not bad but there are so many good taco shops and Mexican food restaurants in central Phoenix that are less expensive
Excellent authentic Chinese food quick and friendly service and just about as cheap as it is possible for a restaurant to be
We went to this restaurant last night and noticed that the prices have gone way up so I had settled for expensive plate of simple chicken when my husband and I noticed that a small roach-like bug was crawling up the wall behind us
I enjoyed the food but the surly slow service coupled with the expensive menu items make this spot a poor value in spite of the lovely old house and charming patio in which the restaurant is situated
While the appetizers and desserts are yummy I've can easily have similar items as delicious at much cheaper restaurants
Food prices are similar to any outside restaurant
I usually eat at fast/cheap Mexican places because I am not a fan of places like Garcias macayos Arriba etc but I have been looking for a good/authentic sit down Mexican food restaurant for a while
We love the fact that this is not a large chain restaurant and has excellent food at a price that will keep us returning
Fast service tasty food good prices - all in this relatively modest restaurant in a  quiet strip mall across the street from ASU West

Prices are what you'd expect from a high-end resort restaurant with great food excellent service and wonderful atmosphere
The prices are roughly on par with the vastly superior RA Sushi restaurant but because they're both pretentious and puerile they will arbitrarily decide to tack on gratuity at a whim as well as various taxes to punish customers
The one exception was the poolside restaurant - In addition to being overpriced the food there was disgusting
Just another overpriced Scottsdale restaurant where more money was spent on decor than food creation and beauty in the servers is clearly more important than the service itself
I loved everything about our dining experience from the service to the meal except compared to the many restaurants I've eaten at I thought it was over-priced even for the high-quality of their food
There isn't a food court or cheap eats as is usually a staple of malls but rather upscale restaurants
The food was reasonably priced for a sit down restaurant
a hole in the wall restaurant with good food and service would get 5 stars to me but a pricey steakhouse with amazing ambiance but ok food and good service would get 4
For the price this is one of the finest seafood restaurants in the city
There were two reasons I did not rate it a 5 star;  1  the restaurant is clean and nice looking but a bit crammed with tables - in addition to the conversation I had with my family I got to enjoy the conversations of the people on the tables to the right and the left of me and  2  Although the prices are not bad - the place is not cheap $10 to $14 not including tip and tax or so for a meal including a glass of kool-aid and it sort of seems like the sort of food you should be bragging about how much food you got for the money
Back to the restaurant at hand  the problem with Aiello's is not the food which is remarkably good for the price and it's not the service which is fine
But if you're looking for a clean decent VERY inexpensive Chinese restaurant with good food and friendly service this is the place
I can go to a fancy sushi restaurant for that kind of price
I want to start saying that I'm new to Phoenix and I searched online and I decide to visit this place and my remarks about this place as the following Restaurant I have tried both beef and chicken shawarma; i didn't like the taste of their chicken shawarma so I wanted to try their beef shawarma; this is what I have to tell about their beef shawarma; They use the cheapest quality
I can see that this place would be a good family restaurant but I also didn't think the prices were all that great in relation to the quality of the food
I might have given four stars if I tried a dinner because the dinners at their sister restaurant Saigon Kitchen are pretty good and I know they use sushi grade salmon in their reasonably priced dinner
Located in the old town area I thought that a small family-owned french breakfast place would be the perfect refreshing break from the trendy Read untsss unttsss untss music mimosa-brunch places and overly-priced-food restaurants
Overall The prices food and restaurant was average Phoenix sushi fair
There's a ton of busy Camelback restaurants but it seems the choice is often between fast food pizza or pricey event dining in the Biltmore or Esplanade
the movie ticke prices are very affordable and prices for food are comparable to any other restaurant
It's a traditional japanese restaurant and from what I remember the food was decently priced maybe a little more expensive for dinner than other places
The negativesOver-priced average food noisy and the layout of the restaurant is ridiculous
Julio's Too is very reasonably priced and offers the same quality of food as the main restaurant
The food at Someburros is on par with any good Mexican restaurant in the Valley but it is fast and inexpensive
But if you are a trendy chic diner you should pass and try something fresher in ambiance and food but equally expensive think Scottsdale's overblown newer mega-restaurants which are the new Durant's except with Sushi or Asian Fusion or oversized Southwest flavored creations with names taken from Cactus varieties
I have always wanted to try a revolving sushi restaurant but I feared they were expensive
As far as the restaurant istelf well it is run by these grumpy stubborn non-customer-service oriented folks apparently so I'm never setting foot in the place nor ever eating their overpriced underwhelming food ever again
Basically it's the only Japanese restaurant that I go to because I know I can get good satisfying food for a good price

Some of the cheaper steak chain restaurants have better food
My ten point scale ratingFood - 5 averageAmbience - 1 poorService - 1Price - 5The January issue of Phoenix Magazine lists Mi Comida as one of the 85 best restaurants in Phoenix and I think this may have overwhelmed the kitchen and waitstaff
Bottom line this restaurant serves good Mexican food the portions are huge and is inexpensive
The menu is pretty standard like most of Thai restaurants the price is definitely good for the amount of the food they offer
The problem with average is in how much this place charges--I'm not going to give three stars to an expensive restaurant that serves three star food
Prices are ok but there are so many good independent restaurants in the area that there is just no good excuse for bad food
For me no cheese and sub black beans instead of potatoesAlso they give A LOT of food I usually can't quite finish the whole burrito by myself so you get a bang for your buck um FINALLY an airport restaurant that doesn't follow the code of shitty and overpricedAlso the coffee has a nice flavor not the normal burnt black that I actually LOVE and it comes in one of those taller glass mugs I would prefer a regular mug but I guess it makes it look nicer
Food is cheap and the restaurant is near ASU
] If you're going to open a small non chain restaurant you need to either somehow REALLY set yourself apart from other restaurants selling similar foods or the price needs to be roughly the same
The food seemed fairly priced for an airport restaurant
We left our email addresses for an invitation to a Grand Opening party and the food was good but a little pricey as expected for a restaurant in this area

Quite simply I am a fat American bastard as such I expect a restaurant to roll out a veritable pig trough full of gourmet food european/french serving sizes do nothing to win my favor especially when I am paying premium prices in Scottsdale for flat iron steaks and house salads
Well we thought we should never have such high expectations for a family restaurant but we were really extremely disappointed and regretted about our visit and we both thought our lunch was over-priced ended up paying almost $30 including tax and tips for such standard of food
I've been to the restaurant several times and the food/service/price have been spot on
I expected something better from Yasu which positions itself as a high end sushi restaurant in decor ambiance price and menu selection
The prices are unbelievably reasonable as inexpensive as a fast food restaurant

Pricey yes but the food is excelelnt and that IS the first reason we eat at a restaurant right
i know i know gift horses but serving mediocre food at a pricey restaurant actually detracts from the experience
Yes this would be expensive for a weekly sushi dinner but for a special occasion it was actually cheaper than other nice restaurants that we have been to

95 which at any other restaurant I would tucked my tail and hide but the food here is well worth the price

Overall it's pricey compared to other sushi places however the ambiance of the restaurant and upscale choices on the menu make it worth it
Upscale Chinese restaurant excellent food not-Chinese-food-cheap but worth your money 4/5We were glad when we found out and tried out this restaurant in our neighborhood
I applaud this restaurant for keeping the calorie count down but I thought the food was kind of boring for the price
You can eat cheap at fast food restaurants and we all know all to well what can happen in a paltry 30 days thanks to Mr
Ridiculous price markup for a 2 diamond fine dining restaurant let alone a chicken and waffle joint
I know this is a fast food diy concept restaurant but for the prices and the fact that there are employees doing nothing a little attention would have done well by this place
The price is now the same as a sit down Mexican restaurant with real plates and the food is microwaved and served like a fast food place
Food in the restaurants is always good as it should be again for the prices they charge
He says the sushi is amazing- comparable to some of his favorite and way more expensive sushi restaurants
Aside from the typical fast food stuff which I'm not a fan of they have some random restaurants that boast high prices small menus and ridiculously slow service
Chopsticks were the the cheapest wooden kind--it has no place in this type of restaurant where the food is premium
I highly recommend this restaurant just know it is expensive but the quality of the food and service are worth paying for
It'll never beat the better neopolitan/rustica kind of pizza at a real restaurant but it's quick cheap and sometimes you just want fast food pizza right
It's not the cheapest in town and there are some full service restaurants around that may do the chicken better I would still choose LoLo's or Tuck Shop for chicken and waffle over LFC's chicken and waffle - but as far as fast food fried chicken goes - LFC is worlds better than KFC Popeye's or Church's
Portion and Price- I know America does not need another restaurant that serves huge portions but Osha Thai's portions are rather small and lacking in the meat department
I'd have rated it 4/5 if the prices had been more in line with other sushi restaurants
A tad more expensive than other Sushi restaurants in town but you're paying for the location and the vibe
I go to a lot of sushi restaurants and for the amount of fish provided I would have expected it to be cheaper
Basically we paid full service restaurant prices for take out food
but lots for the price-basil chicken was great-kimchi was fantastic and again lots of it 4 the priceAssociating the word 'Confusion' with a restaurant is somewhat rare for me
Typically when a restaurant has that much hype you would expect to pay a ton of money to eat there but I knew the pizza here is not crazy expensive so I have no idea what held me back for so long
Far and away the restaurant I have frequented most often 5th Avenue is superlative for service and food quality for the price
So because I'm new to this I guess I should provide a disclaimer of how I will rate a restaurant food service layout prices
So nice to eat in a civilized restaurant that offers tasty well-prepared food at reasonable prices
On a positive note they do offer half priced bottles of wine on Mondays but overall this is just an average pizza restaurant
This restaurant is a fine addition to the emerging downtown Phoenix foodie scene and with prices extremely reasonable you get a lot
donut hole desserts in upscale restaurants are now somewhat cliched and these were far from the best I've had; they also seemed a bit pricey at $8 for four donut holesWhile Noca isn't as innovative as other Valley restaurants like Binkley's and Kai it has deservedly earned much critical acclaim and local buzz with their gourmet basics
But the 3 most important things to me in a restaurant are the quality of the food the value for the price and the service
The restaurant at the hotel had very good food overall we had the vegetarian Pasta Provencal twice and was decently priced

The food is typical for a small mexican restaurant but the quality and taste is top notch for the price
The yummy Enchiladas Suizas Chicken Enchiladas in Tomatillo-Cream Sauce that  was my favorite item on the old menu are no longer on the new menu -- and most  of what is on the new menu are unoriginal and uninspiring dishes that are easy to find  at better prices at many nearby restaurants
They're way over priced for the presentation of the food and look of the restaurant

Typically pork belly is a cheaper meat at Korean restaurants so I usually try and avoid ordering it
There are many fine Greek restaurants out in the valley that push out amazing dishes this is not a fine dining establishment like others filled with waiters and high priced side dishes
Like any other Sushi restaurant the prices are pretty high for the amount of sushi you get meaning you would have to buy more sushi to fulfill your stomach
Long story short this restaurant is overpriced and the food is not good
The food here is not eally cheap perse but it is a cheap restaurant if that says anything
Our food was definitely tasty - the lamb shank and steak tenderloin bruschetta were very flavorful - but the prices felt a little high and perhaps more fitting for a hotel restaurant
This restaurant gives you a lot of food for the price
Despite the name the Chinese food is the better half of the restaurant but it is a bit expensive
I don't like greasy saucy chinese food at all so when this restaurant moved to my neighborhood I was so delighted by the fresh and nicely presented food and the prices are very fair here
As for price - any good sushi restaurant is going to be expensive but we've spent as much or more at lesser quality restaurants like Sakana
I will spare you the environmental lecture & just leave you with this restaurants especially in areas not close to the source buy fish as cheaply as possible which usually means fish that are dwindling in population Chilean sea bass etc or collected in the wrong ways that kill other marine life or damage ecosystems many kinds of tunaetc
In fact many of the dishes are the same as I remember but everything at this restaurant is substantially higher in price over-priced in my opinion
It is an expensive restaurant and I do not like that they charge a high corking fee for alcohol but the food impressed me and it had a nice romantic feel
The restaurant decor is average nothing fancy but we've learned that the less expensive decor = way better food typically
Portion smallQuality cheap fishTaste too fishy I'm surprise that many sushi restaurants are trying to make profit by cutting corner
Windsor is a fun lively bar/restaurant with a great vibe and good food all at a reasonable price

Ya know just when I thought I couldn't fit one more restaurant into my casual Mexican food rotation Rubio's comes along with its damn delicious tacos and its friendly employees and its integration of Coke Zero in its fountain drink machine and the next thing you know I'm up to FOUR very viable options for my frequent inexpensive taco/burrito cravings
I always appreciate a healthy restaurant and I am a foodie to boot but this place had the tiniest portions for the price you pay and the food really isn't that great
I have recommended Salsa B to many Sun City Residents - most are picky food critics all LOVED Salsa B - they felt the food was good prices GREAT  some thought the prices should be raised all will be going back - all will pass the word to their friends and family - all wish these Great New Entrepreneurs  the BEST OF LUCK w/this One of a Kind Mexican Food Restaurant --- Chili R's and Beef Taco's ARE  TO DIE FOR - I am SOOOOO Hooked
In fairness in terms of cost it's no worse than Mastros Ocean or any other high end restaurant and certainly less expensive than Bourbon Steak but the setting is much more intimate the service much better and the food every bit as good if not better than those other must do places
A small restaurant on the corner with very low prices for the amount of food given but also at the cost of cleanliness/neatness
The reason this restaurant gets 5 stars is because of the good food to price ratio
On top of that  the pizzas aren't too expensive and the rustic atmosphere of the restaurant adds to the experience
By looking at the menu online I thought this was going to be a stuffy overpriced quiet boring Upscale Mexican restaurant OR a Mexican restaurant in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale with great decor and awful food- wrong
The menu was a little confusing and little pricey yet the quality of the food is there and considering the location of the restaurant pricing isn't an issue
There is a restaurant that charges fair prices and provides exceptional service ambiance and delicious food all in one visit

If you're looking for a pub-like restaurant that has good prices pretty tasty food with a good variety of items on the menu and excellent cocktails Keegan's is your place
In spite of the poor dessert choices this time around I'm convinced that people who think their food is overpriced or overrated have poor palates and probably rarely venture outside of chain restaurants where the food is laden with corn syrup MSG and other fake flavors
One waiter as we paid our bill inexpensive by the way- $30 for drinks appetizer 2 entrees and dessert said that this is the only restaurant he's ever worked in that he still wants to eat the food at the end of the night
Though this restaurant isn't quite as good as Green I'm biased toward American-style food anyway its food is unique tasty and inexpensive
The only thing I really didn't like was that this restaurant was so expensive but you get what you pay for so I am sure that their prices were fair and reasonable because both the food and service were outstanding
