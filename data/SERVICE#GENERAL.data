Tip You can order reduced portions of their omelets and a half order of the breakfast salad

I also ordered the Good Korma curry dish to take home to the husband after conferring with the waitress about good gluten-free options
The husband ordered chilequiles and thought they were good but not nearly as great as Gallo Blanco's version
Hopefully the service loses the slightly I'm-better-than-you attitude and adopts a truly friendly vibe

Most of the time I take service into thought when rating a  place and while the service could be better I still give this place 5 stars b/c I've never had a bad meal there

*** Edited to add Last night I went back to Lost Leaf and the staff was really nice/cool/non-hipster-ish
What Panne Bianco gets right is -quick polite but personalized service-a great short menu with no surprises-great to go options-big portions when a sandwich and a drink cost $12 it better be good-close to my work wishing they would move into my work's cafe space-its right by lux-its food that any single person could make at home with a sandwich press but doesn't b/c high quality bread and the like go bad too soonthe somewhat bad-wierd hours and parkingkinda high pricesno place to sit and wait
I would not come here again for mediocre service and 1/3 dishes being good

Our waitress Erica was very fast with every request
The burger is great the chimayo chicken in all reality you can order anything on the menu and it will be great
The bartender service was really friendly no not just because he maybe perhaps gave us free pita bread
The noodles were so overcooked that they pretty much congealed together and it was near impossible to pick them up let alone distinguish noodle to noodle when it came to eating the pasteAlso their service is somewhat snooty and rude and doesn't pay much attention to you or your questions
The staff was confused and slow to visit our table the pizza might be the most boring bland pizza I have ever had
Service was good overall and attentive
The staff was very attentive and I was constantly having my water refilled without even gesturing that I needed it
Wait staff was slow and not very attentive - thought about giving it another try but it looks like this is all pretty common according to other reviews

The food came quick the staff was friendly
I used to go here when the staff were knowledgeable nice and the prices were just
We all ordered burritos which were also very good I love a place that isn't afraid to use dark meat chicken
Although the food is pretty good though on the pricey side for  a specialty pizza ~$26 the service level experienced is beyond atrocious
Like I said the pizza and other food we had is pretty good but the service level makes sure you don't enjoy the food or the experience
On the other hand the service tonight was great
I heard through Facebook of the excellent food and great selection of beers gotta tell you we were not disappointed the food was soooo good that several members of our party requested to meet the chef our waiter went to the kitchen and soon we were speaking with chef Diego what a true professional who took the time to explain the dishes and their origins
The service is outstanding and they do a great job accommodating and helping you make your way around the menu etc
The service is decent and not great because they are usually very crowded
During HH we ordered the pizza bread very good
The staff and owner are all friendly the place is charming and has dine-in seating indoors or on the patio and they make it fast and fresh
After they had emptied their wallets they did get their drinks but the waitress having been shown up was rude to the girls after that
The staff was super friendly and still got us what we needed knowing full well that she would be getting any tips from our table
The service is consistently friendly attentive and happy to offer menu suggestions
PROS The patio is dog-friendly it's a happening spot they have a unique menu and you can get your order in right away
They had lots of friendly staff on hand to check everyone in
The waiter says he thought we had said green chile but is very nice and takes it back to the kitchen to have them change it
He was very nice and we offered to pay our bill for our drinks and my dish but the manager told us to not worry about it and that he hoped we would return
All that being said;PROS great chips and salsa              usually great servers               managers have been very pleasant and accomodatingCONS  decline in food quality               hostesses are not very friendly               menus always feel very oilyI think that we will probably try a different Arriba's location in the future
Service was great considering our friend was so dehydrated from being overserved the previous evening he must have had a dozen ice tea refills
The atmosphere is charming and understated from the way you order to the friendly service you wouldn't expect from a counter service kind of place
Since I am friends with someone who works here she doesn't serve us company policy so service is usually by the manager and once we even got the chef which was a nice surprise because I was able to ask her details on the sandwiches
We were seated promptly and our friendly waitress highly recommended both the Eggs Benedict for me and a slight variation the California Benedict including bacon and avocado for her
The restaurant was bright and inviting and the service was quick and friendly
The service is iffy--we've had good and we've had God-awful
The guy in charge was very friendly but it was annoying how inattentive the original waiter was especially considering how small the place is
It's old fashioned the service was great - just nice and polite
She was really nice and wanted to make sure everything was to our liking - great service
Our waitress was very knowledgeable and helpful in our selections and the ambiance was nice

As the side I ordered the fried plantains which were also quite good
The food is good I really enjoy their Santa Fe spring rolls as an appetizer the pizzas are always up to par and lets not forget their skookie they have for dessert yumm
The staff at the front desk and at the restaurant were very nice and helpful
okay so maybe that's not a high compliment for a mexican grill in the heart of the southwest but after a very long day of walking around I stopped in lone woman too was quickly seated and served so fast i actually told the waitress don't worry there's no rush
For one drink 2 refills good service with Fajitas I escaped for around $18
The only negative I have is that one of the counter girls is a bit rude and there is a military service recruitment center right next door so at times you may be bothered a little by them but come on they're serving our country so it can be forgiven
The service and decor are quite good though
I let our waitress know and she was very quick to fix the issue and brought me out a whole new plate and it was amazing nice flaky and moist it had great flavor
It was made fresh to order and served with homemade coconut ice creamwhich I could of ate a whole bowl of alone lol Overall I had a great experience here and while there was a little mishap with the mahi mahi at first they were quick to fix it and the manager even came by and apologized and took care of our dessert for us
Great music and excellent service make this a place worth checking out for a few of their cheap drinks
Venus is one of the nicest bartenders in the valley and she will pour you an honest drink as will all the staff behind this bar
It was a tad on the pricey side and it felt a little creepy being the lone couple in a room that seats 200 people but the trade-off was some extra-good service
Once we got seated the waiter came over and was extremely friendly and attentive
The food and service are consistently good and the atmosphere is always fun
The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating and the restaurant was very clean
It does its job to feed you and overstimulate you with decor and witty though nice staff and good live music
They're just so damn good I can rarely bring myself to order anything else
It was scenic and beautiful when we sat outside for being the only 4 people there the service was probably on the slow side
The burger was really good I ordered a Kobe Bacon hamburger which is 8oz of yummy goodness
The store manager got back with me via Yelp which I greatly appreciate
The service was good and they were able to have my car ready when they said they would
Wait staff attentive personable and efficient
There was TONS of teenage help but the service was SLOW for as many staff as they had
Someone ordered the flash fried lobster that was good
Someone else ordered the fillet - he said it was good
Waitress was new and not entirely familiar with the menu but helpful and friendly
Despite that we were treated to excellent service great food and awesome experience
The food was so so and the service was a bit slow
All of the essentials and then some reasonably priced friendly staff easy to navigate and get in/out
The hotel itself offered a nice continental breakfast and the staff was very helpful
The staff--everyone I met there-- were all great and so was the service
My pad thai wasn't bad but it wasn't spicy in the least [I guess I should have ordered it more spicy my fault] and I prefer a thicker sauce personally
The staff was friendly welcoming and my room was amazing
Our waitress was perfectly attentive -- not too bothersome with just the right amount of popping-in time to make sure we were happy and content
I give hundreds of kudos to good service and this was definitely one of those cases
Fresh fish good portions and great service
Our waitress was fast friendly and helpful
I usually tap things out with an order of their great crab/cheese puffs
Service and atmosphere were both very nice as well
The service was great and we will be going back
Slightly pricey hot dog special is a good economic choice but the atmosphere is relaxing always clean consistent quality and they have free self-service water so you don't have to bother with getting back into line if you're still thirsty
Great selection offset by their terrible customer service
There is lots to love about this place and I want to start with the service attentive friendly and gracious
The desserts are great and when I do get it I like the Mango Sticky Rice or the Creme Brulee
After selecting several books another more friendly customer service person processed my purchases and even offered me some hard candy from a small dish
I give the place 3 stars because once at the table the service was really good and the place is very nice
we had a wonderful waitress who took very good care of us
Room service is fast and the food is actually pretty decent
The staff were very friendly though and it's nice that they offer credit card for you to pay No minimum order and will send you your receipt through your e-mail
Service is great and all around a good clean Starbucks
My compliments to the wait staff who gave us such great service
The service is okay not rude but not A+
The service at this location has always been fast and friendly
The entire staff here is really nice and know what they are doing
And while it's nearly a 10-minute process to get your sandwich you order pay and then they call you when they're ready to pile on the fixings the food is pretty good even when you're not high
The Chefs are really friendly and service is great for the most part
We also appreciated the good service by our waiter & bartender who were both prompt and attentive
So when I told my waiter I was having a bad toast experience and he blew me off you can imagine the impact
There were only like 2 servers so the service was a bit slow but very friendly
* Great selection of stores * No Nordstrom here but there is Macy's Sears and JC Penny * Security staff are highly visible * Clean mall Westcor operated * Tons of parking no valet parking and that would be a nice addition * Expansive food court* Movie theater on site If you live on the west side of Phoenix this is probably where you shop or will be shopping
Owner was attentive and very helpful and helpd us order
Small place nothing special inside which really does not bother me but good service
I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone it has proven that good customer service does still exist
One of the best Pad Thai dishes I've ever had and most of the curries have had have also been quite good save the Green Curry of which I've had betterLike most good Asian restaurants you should come here for the food and not the decor/ambiance/service/whatever
I've never had a problem with the service -- they're very friendly and efficient but they don't fall all over themselves for you either which is fine with me
If you're looking to pick up a pie or grab some dessert this spot can be a good option
I've thought about this before writing this because of being a small business owners and understanding that maybe the owners and staff just had a bad day
I know that Pho places really aren't known for service but this place is just rude
Try Unphogettable in Mesa so you can see what good food and service is about and you will know what I mean about rude here
There was live music great lighting did I mention the hot waiter
and an overall nice atmosphere ie hot waiter
Even the half-order at $5 was too generous a helping but sooo very good
Between the delicious meals and very attentive waitstaff I'll be taking the hubs here to try out for himself in the very near future
If great food could marry great service then have a child called great location- this would be it
The front staff is friendly and efficient the grounds are nicely maintained and the location is great
We were waiting on two more coming from the airport so the server nicely came over to tell us that we needed to make sure we had the order in by 10
Not only did they not fulfill the order as I placed it for a 50th birthday gift for a lifelong friend when I called them they were condescending rude & bashed the FTD company itself
We felt the selection was very good--canned goods dried beans fresh fruits and vegetables frozen meats and of course olives and feta and desserts
On another note the woman agent helping me at STL was the most rude customer service agent I've ever dealt with anywhere
We never would recommend this place to anyone sad since it does have good food most of the time when they can get the orders straight and make things as described on the menu
The staff is wonderful and the food is great
Cute kid friendly environment- but the staff needs to match the decor
Their horrible service deffinately makes them unphogettable but in a bad way
Plus there are free towels pool toys beach balls and a very convenient poolside bar or friendly waiter on slower weekends
On slow weekends they'll give you a great deal and the staff there is very accommodating
Add mine to the list of 'damn the food is good here' [as long as you order the right thing] and the guacamole is delish
So instead I am warning fellow Yelp-ers who order any baked goods    Check when it was made
They have a good system in place to get your order out in a reasonable amount of time
While our waiter was very friendly he never came back to check on us once
The sushi was good we got a Vegas roll a Philli roll and a California roll pretty standard and then a order of chicken yakitori
The service was pretty good both times i have been
cheap but great food and really nice staff
The entire staff is always attentive they typically have appointments available when you call and your child is sick and their physicals have always been very thorough
The doctors and staff are always friendly they truly do like what they do and they do a great job
The service was fast and not bad  waitresses were very attentive and thoughtful
We ordered the following-AppsChips and Guac-- YUM good chipsSweet Potato Fries-- good but not greatSpinach Dip- v
The owners have done a great job of decorating the interior and the touches are modern cucumber slices in the water service bar etc
The service staff was two Asian ladies that were very friendly
Good service cute decor great spot for a work lunch
that would have been good information when we ordered the Turtle fondue
I really appreciated the great service and the great food and for that I say Thank You Melting Pot
Service was excellent and staff really friendly
My first time here was amazing our waitress was very attentive and humorous
The second time wasn't so awesome but I'll cut the waiter that we got some slack because it got really busy really fast compared to the quiet lunch I had the first time
Overall service was good especially for a busy night and food was decent
I'm glad that great customer service can still be experienced at a Nordstrom
The customer service was great and when my helper had to transfer to a another customer that arrived before me he made sure that I was covered by someone else
When I go to Nordstrom I don't expect great prices but do expect good quality and great customer service
When you walk in the atmosphere is great what with the snazzy furniture friendly staff and the plenty of customers in line eager for the fresh food they serve up
Drinks were good and the service prompt and friendly
Service from Rocky was really fast  effiecient without that fake cloying attitude
Funny how things like fast drink refills quick service and welltime plate removal can do that
Service at this resort is excruciatingly slow
Service was slow and with noticeable disdain from the staff there
For a buffett they have a really nice staff
We were seated promptly and the service from start to finish was very attentive
Service was friendly and knowledgeable - owner Joe stopped by to check in- was visible in the dining room throughout our visit - nice wine list - my medium red was smooth and fruity - entrees plentiful and prepared as you order them
We had the crab gnocchi which was great but a little too rich for me -- not the restaurant's fault - bad ordering on our part
Overall though the experience was good and you can't dock them for the service because the food shines
There's no hype just some odd decor good seating mostly booths  good food and friendly service
Our waiter Julio brought us our menus and ice water right away which was great because it was super hot out even for Arizona
service and quality are unreliablei went after having given up on paying for haircuts and doing my own hair for several years and found an amazing guy who was very focused friendly very good at figuring out what i wanted and what would look good and i left with a great experience and an amazing haircut
The service was a bit slow but everyone was very nice
Ty the server at the counter was helpful and very interested in making sure the dining experience was met with great service
The drink menu which you can only order from is nice but really doesn't cater to those that don't like sweet drinks
Our cocktail waitress was very nice and friendly and the mixologist definitely knows what he's doing
it's one thing if they're understaffed but when the waitress avoids making eye contact as we're waving our arms yes we were being rude it had been over an hour with no service it is ruder
The Staff at the bar and the trailer-kitchen More about that in a min were very friendly
Well not my mom but the mom of the great waitress that served my table today So sorry I didn't catch her name
The one star is only for the fast and friendly service
It's nice and clean inside you walk in to read a big menu and place your order at the counter
It SO good - BUT last time I ordered it I got a nice surprise a bacon inside of it
Last few times I ordered food through the drive-thru it took about 10-15 mins for a drink and breakfast sandwich
I ordered their traditional breakfast burrito and it was very D'lish not soggy but very hearty and filling eggs were perfectly seasoned and loved the flavor of the salsa
rrI ordered a pastrami and swiss from the less-than-friendly counter person and after discussing the appropriate change I should have received back for my $20 bill I traveled down the smeared glass to pick up my to-go sandwich
It wasn't even barely spicy but I didn't mind because it was such a good burger perfectly grilled to order
prompt professional knows his bikes and provides fast convenient and complete mobile service
The menu did that kitschy-kootchy faux old-time newspaper sort of look which wasn't necessarily entirely user-friendly but was serviceable and the indoor water feature wasn't necessarily all that great either but the waiter was charming and the selections on the menu seemed interesting
At first I was disappointed with the service it was a little slow but it turns out that we got there right before the next shift started
He was very friendly like his staff and I can't wait for the next visit when I am in the area again
One that a customer will want to come back for over and over againFor me this place set the bar so high most of the other chain places will never be able to compare with the quality of not only the food but the great customer service that I received from this place
Small portions high prices and frankly weak food with poor service are a bad combo
In 45 minutes I had the best selection customer service friendly help and I never once felt like I could have found better styles or prices
There's always 4-5 parking spaces reserved for pick-up orders which is good because that parking lot gets SUPER full with Pita Jungle in the same area
My husband and I went here on a Saturday for lunch; we were seated immediately and our waitress was very attentive
We ordered the pineapple cream cheese wontons for an appetizer and they were good but nothing to rave about so I'm glad we got them for free with a coupon
The prices are very reasonable the staff is always offering me coupons same day to use the car wash itself is great the staff is extremely friendly and I don't feel they are overly pushy for sales like some other car washes
I was looking up papa johns to order some pizza and I saw some really bad reviews on google so I was second guessing ordering from here but my friend from to Tucson and says they have really good pizza so I order the pizza anyway and it was the best pizza I've ever had
The staff is super nice and very helpful with letting you know about what they offer and any specials without being pushy in any way
I was with a group of about 10 people and we had a great time conversing our service was spot on and water glasses continuously filled
We came here on a whim while in town and were amazed at how great the food was and service
Friendly staff and very cool atmosphere and maybe with a few more places like this we can make Phoenix a little more like San Francisco with eclectic fun hip places to eat
In my experience staff at some of the other trendier restaurants around town tend to be a bit cool toward patrons with kids but everyone at the Grind was accommodating and friendly to my son
We also shared an order of the herbed fries which were a nice compliment to the burger
Waiters/Waitresses are always great and I love their style
It has a good selection of dvds and music in stock and if it's not in it generally can be special ordered
I don't recall ever having bad service there
I normally order a two taco combo plate the shredded beef is what I opt for and they're pretty good
Sadly this isn't the five-star experience it should be - reservations appear to be meaningless if the forty-five minute wait we had is any indication service is abrupt and bordering on rude and prices are considerably higher than they should be for what you get
Josh our waiter was there when we needed him and he gave great suggestions and took care of all the people at my table
The dining room was clean & comfortable the service friendly & the sizes of the items right for the money
the staff is friendly helpful and young
We decided that we were going to order an appetizer and then a meal to split and I love a good artichoke-anything so I ordered the artichoke dip
Service was very slow considering we were the only ones there and I would never ever eat here again
The only reason I gave 4 stars though is because sometimes when it's busy the waiters/waitress aren't all that friendly and it takes them a while to get to our table which is understandable because I know how it is in the food business
The staff was very nice the hostess and waiter were extremely polite and both were attentive and very helpful but nothing seemed extraordinary
I feel that good service should be rewarded with a good review
The filet mignon was good but although ordered rare it was more on the medium rare side for me
The staff were friendly and attentive and the majority of whom were females wearing somewhat provocative white shirts bearing slogans such as legalize marinara and tastes like garlic
No complaints about the food or price and the staff was friendly
My friend ordered the escargot which since i'm very meh on escargot I can't tell you if they were good or not even though I had two of them at my friend's prompting
The bottom line is the price is right It's amazing how cheap we got outta there really the service is fantastic the atmosphere is cute and cozy and the food is pretty great
Service was above normal as most of the staff was friendly and in good spirits singing along to the songs and enjoying the atmosphere
*  I have been waited on by Crystal both times that I've been here & received extra friendly just right service
SERVICE - everyone is extremely friendly and helpful down to the super friendly valet
But is it necessary to provide such rude counter service
Guess it's a good thing I didn't try to order soup for the party
The service was great I always had something to drink and the food has always been tasty
In the end it'll save the restaurant money AND will make the staff shine even more brightly in their clientele's minds for such great service for after all what is The Cheesecake Factory and its affiliates known for but their excellent customer service right

I am disappointed  because this vet is close to the home but I much rather drive twice as far to have a on time appointment with a nicer more personable staff
The service was slow both times and during our second experience it took two and a half hours from the time we sat down until we left -- and  they neglected to give us their complementary signature cotton candy which we decided against mentioning for fear that would add thirty minutes to our detainment
Wait staff took a bit to get to us but was great throughout
Yes the menu does say small plates but I still think adding how many pieces come with the order would be nice

We ordered 2 appetizers 1 Fried Tofu and 2 Thai Corn Cakes surprisingly they were both good the tofu came with a sweet & sour sauce which tasted good and the corn cakes that also came with the same sauce

There were two servers and on a busy Fri night service was slow
The service is 97% awesome very seldom do I get slow service there & it has never been slow enough to irritate me

For dessert I had a great medley of custard caramel chocolate and pecans

The service is always great and I'm never disappointed with what I get
The staff at MIM are very knowledgeable and super friendly
We arrive aroung 530 on a Thursday night and again the place is empty so you'd think we'd have no trouble getting good service
The staff is super friendly but that may be due to other substances besides the sandwiches
I always resort to the Chicken Parmesan and have always loved that dish but if you want something unique to Tagliani's and you like spicy order the Chicken Dynamante has a sauce made out of pepperoncini's soo good or the Spicy Rigatoni both are awesome and must try

There always appears to be an attentive manager present and I almost always witness employees cleaning and organizing sections while I shop unheard of at other locations
Almost every single time I have been here the thought has crossed my mind the service is so bad here

Service  The Fuego Bistro staff is attentive friendly and genuine
Our server was nice and attentive but our order for a pizza slice salad and a beer was incorrect the first time out
the wines were reasonable waitstaff attentive food was good
And I have to say even if they did deliver on time I don't think I would be ordering from them anytime soon it just wasn't all that great everything was pretty bland
so for $9 you get a pretty weak meal compared with other good/cheap Mexican places or decent sit down joints with service
This is my first time to Tuscany so was looking forward to great service great food and a relaxing experience
The food was just good and when you have to drive 20 minutes or so and you are expecting 4 diamond food and service good is not good enough
The desserts were good but very expensive- 1 coffee $2
I ordered the baked tortellini with a white and red cream sauce it was missing any king of flavor one of my friend ordered spaghetti carbonara although it was not made in a traditional way and although the pasta was way over cooked  it had a pretty good flavor
The place looked kinda nice and I'm sure we just had an isolated experience - but until I actually try again and get some food and service this will have to be my review - one star
You give the friendly waitress your name and wait
Your waitress is super friendly and you love the quick service after you figure out that the girl in the VS sweatpants really does work there and will be serving your food
However if you get a good waiter / waitress you'll have a great experience

What I look for in a good dessertIf it's a rich dessert it should be thick and moist or indulgently creamy
The staff is friendly which is always a plus
Mike the manager of this location is great
The service and ambiance were great for a Chandler restaurant - it's hard to find such a nice spot out here

In summary the food was bland the food was cold the service wasn't that great and the salsa and the guacamole were just plain WEIRD
Service was a tick slow but there were only the two guys working the tables
The shop is always clean stocks fresh ingredients and the staff is nice
The staff is super friendly prices are great
Oh also told our waiter about my fortune-less fortune cookie on my last visit and he apologized profusely said they got a bad batch last month in which one out of every three cookies was empty
The only knock on this experience is that the service was kind of slow
But if you have made the mistake in good conscience of taking the phone to a service center first and waiting an hour to see if your phone can be fixed and then decide to upgrade while there that's an $18 fee for trying to get it fixed in person rather than just putting in your ticket online and waiting 3-5 days
Great choice but next time I'm having what my friend ordered - the cochinita pibil
I'm not happy about dealing with that party foul at all or the rude inefficient service
We also split an order of fries and they were well done to perfect tubes of goodness
The service is excellent and friendly to boot and the atmosphere is hip but relaxed and not pretentious
The staff was very friendly and totally accommodating
Extremely affordable very tasty great service
They offer great deals online and the order taker often times will negotiate on price
We have always been amazed this place is still in business as the staff and owner always seem grumpy and unfriendly

After hunting down our waitress and asking to have our order taken our food finally arrived cold an hour after it was ordered it was so dark we couldn't see what we were eating and we couldn't eat fast enough to get out of there and get away from the whole scene
The waitress counts on you for her tips so she will be attentive and she has pull with the bartender so you can get your drinks way quicker
Paul our accommodating waiter did a nice job of taking us through a delicious dinner
I see good things for a second visit to District so I'll most likely update my review as it has all the right ingredients but without stellar or even moderately ok service the experience is kind of shot
Also the service has never been bad but hasn't been awesome either
If there is a manager or supervisor reading this I would greatly appreciate you to contact me
Pros - the food was very good except for a ho hum dessert which was extra I believe and presentation was beautiful
Breakfast was only slightly above average but taking the service and the price into consideration earns the cafe four starts
-Spring rolls = I never had it with such a nice aroma-Korean bbq = I don't know why my bf ordered this at a Pho place but it was good
I likemy hashbrowns well done and unlike most places the waitress listened and they were great
The staff was great the restaurant was clean everything was top notch

I think the staff here is very nice the food is reasonably priced  and the establishment is clean
I had to make it clear I wasn't driving and I knew I was drunk they explained they offered this as a service so people would understand that they may leave a bar thinking there good to drive but if they were to be pulled over what their alcohol content would actually read
The staff was plenty friendly and it was nice and clean
They've been open for 4 years according to the very nice lady who took our order and only 4 people have reviewed them
Prices are reasonable atmosphere is great service is always wonderful and the food is awesome
great place for men their is a small TV for you to watch while having your haircut and a big one to watch while waiting the service is great wait times and price not so much but for all the old men who are always in their that just want to be mauled by younger women i guess its OK
Warning though its a family owned business so the service is slow
So between the fabulous bar staff and me meeting some new bar patrons it was a great night
Its a fast moving joint during the lunch hour so grab a menu while you wait in line and be ready to give your order
Each time I have been back the service and food quality was just as good as I remember it being on my first visit
The food was very good and I actually had to ask the waiter what some of the ingredients were which makes it more adventurous
We sat on the patio perfect night outside the waiter was very nice
It needs to be about the customer and great service not just the novelty of the views
They are decent for Vegas or Southern California cities but aren't a great option for many large cities east of Arizona especially those with two or more commercial airports as they typically service the most inconvenient ones for vacations such as BWI Dallas Love Chicago Midway or MacArthur Islip on Long Island
Everything good nothing great and almost as expensive as a full service restaurant
The food was also great tried the calamari guacamole quesadilla and queso dip and the staff was friendly and helpful
Here's the quick and dirty keep in mind that I give some leeway when reviewing airport food versus normal foodPros-quick service-great place if you want to catch a game-really impressed with free wifi at PHX-For folks who need to charge their computer during their downtime there are outlets on some of the corner tablesCons-burger was mediocre and you'd expect them to have burgers nailed at least choice was b/w medium well and well which should have been a sign
The staff was friendly and we were in and out for our take out order within 3-5 minutes
Good location right in Old Town and the staff seemed friendly enough while I didn't like that there is no public or visitor parking

The staff was nice everything looked pretty
Our waitresses were super nice and kept us happy without bugging us too much
Another friend ordered the bruchetta and while she said it was good she also mentioned it didn't compare to Postino's bruchetta
The friendly and dare I say very striking server seemed a bit harried running around the dining room by herself but the service was good
It was clean and smelled amazing and the staff is super friendly
I also liked that the staff was very friendly and the food was ready in under 5 minutes
Great service and the atmosphere was inviting

The staff is wonderful and super friendly
Table service was friendly but inattentive if that makes sense
Service is great and our drinks are replenished rather quickly
The servers were all very attractive and their service very much fit the surroundings clean not rushed comfortable and friendly
Even the bus driver shuttling us to the rental car center which is like an airport in itself in terms of size and shops and restaurants and the Budget staff were all nice and to liking about anything and everything and of course helping us with our luggage and car
Service was very good especially considering the amount of people we had and that they were willing to do separate checks
For appetizers the table had the hummus but a few others ordered the green chile queso very unique and good the fried eggplant bites I was hesitant about the goat cheese as I'm not a big fan but there is not that much and it just enhance the flavors of the whole dish which was good and the bacon-wrapped shrimp YUM
Anyways I wanted to thank the staff here for a great birthday dinner
Everything tasted great the service was good and prompt I don't believe there was a single issue which is amazing considering they had 20 people all ordering something totally different without a set menu and we all had a great time
We ordered a nice bottle of Conn Creek
Fun unique selection of delicious food that you'll find nowhere else in town great selection of cold beers cozy dark atmosphere friendly staff
Although most people I assume have a cell phone nowService was great no complaints
Good excuse to indulge in my favorite dessert on the face of the earth
Everyone enjoyed their food and the service was great
Perhaps we came in at a bad day or did not order the right dishes
The food is amazing the service is great and the restaurant has some pretty cool decor
The excellent level of service may have had something to with the fact that I told her I yelp my tab seemed a bit smaller than it should have been as well but hey either way I had a great time
Food is very good though note that entru00e9es are served with nominal pairings and you have to order family style sides
Overall Great food; Not a great value; Good waitstaff experience; Nice decor; Would eat at again on special occasions
The food came quickly and the waitress and hostess were both very friendly
I went in there with a friend of mine and right off the bat the staff was friendly

Maybe we just ordered simple stuff and again there was nothing wrong with it-it was all great
My husband has ordered a breakfast meals with everything
The location is hard to reach the service is real slow and even though it is all set up for a drive-thru there is no drive-thru window
The service was great always had a full beer and was checked on frequently which was nice for how crowded it was
She was very rude and loud DO YOU HAVE A BORDER'S CARD
The drink was good but the service and quantity in the cup was a totally disappointment
Just beware the drive-thru is not super fast because all the food and drinks are made to order but if you plan for a 10-15 minute wait you'll be fine
Waiter was attentive and immediately brought us menus and took our drink order
Would have given a 1 star but the waiter was nice
Service is always friendly and prompt water glasses always refilled happy hour specials are a great deal large and tasty
Great products customer service and atmosphere
Great pizza but service was well below average
For the money $30 for a pizza three drinks and tip I could have had much better service and equally as good pizza at NYPD or Bell Italia
The green enchiladas were good but the menu is limited and all of the wait staff that I observed seemed to be bothered that they had to wait on customers
The location is very easy to get to and the service was both attentive and friendly
The service was no good but the food more than made up for it
The service is super friendly which is always appreciated
I hate how crazy busy you can be with so many others calling for your attention slowing down my service and forcing me to yell during conversation
Very nice cool almost chic atmosphere very casual and welcoming staff rocks
I told the waitress/hostess that brought me the menu's just bring me the breakfast burritto and a carraffe of bloody mary acting like a regular
long story shortWalked in with $20 tipped the awesome waiter $3 on a $10 tab and walked out with $6 in my pocket a nice buzz a fullllllll stomach and a very wishful attitude that all my travels could find a switch in town
The staff was friendly and asked me how I preferred my pizza crispy or otherwise
Prices are very reasonable and the service is very friendly
So we sat in the bar area and when the waiter came to take our order we were a group of 4 we placed several appetizer orders right off the bat and said that would be good to start and we'd add more to the order in a bit
The staff is friendly and will guide you to your particular items
You can make it happen the best part FRIENDLY service

The staff is friendly and the place is bustling with business at the lunch hour

Antoher ordered the Spinch Herb burger vegitarian and it cam on a bed of rice with a huge garden salad that was nicely seasoned with fresh herbs
I would have given Sal's four stars but the service was extremely slow when we went in at 1230pm on a Monday
I'm simple so give me good food beer service and music and I'm pretty happy
Service was good- wasn't exceptional but it wasn't bad
consistent friendly service with good food
Now I figured this however if your restaurant is proud to be gluten free and hangs a sign outside to encourage customers seeking gluten-free foods then a you should ask first before you bring out not counting desserts the main item of food that ISN'T gluten-free out to your customer and b don't be rude to your customer
The service is great the salsas are good and I still have not had anything that I did not like
The food is still great the service was very warm and the whole atmosphere is still inviting and cozy
Service was very friendly they even brought over an extra table as we had so much food on ours
The service was very slow one they took our order the lady didn't come back to check on us or fill our drinks until the food came
Even if occasionally slow the bar DOES get packed nearly nightly the service is always friendly and personable
The first time we went here the service was a bit slow
Just now there was one person in front of me ordering a breakfast sandwich
The service has always been great and they always get us in quickly no matter how busy they are
And the staff is always friendly and genuine
Overall I would give the service excellent the food pretty good ambience good and value above average
Service was excellent and our waitress was very nice and helpful

unless it's the setting itself and the fact that it is a celeb enclave but I have always been pretty numb to that sort of thing and the people at AdC all seemed to be nice from the hostess to waitstaff etc
Our waiter had a ton of tables which is understandable why service was slow
Food was okay but the service was great
I ordered the Cuban Sandwich and it was good
The spa itself was very clean the staff was very friendly and attentive and the massages were to die for
I ordered the Shrimp & Bacon Quesadilla off of the appetizer section which I though was a nice change from the standard chicken quesadilla which they do have for traditionalists
Once we were sat we were graced with a very handsome nice waiter
For dinner I ordered the Casablanca chicken sandwich because I had heard such great things about it
Scale of 1-10 single visit10 Food9 Service10 Atmosphere8 ValueThis food is great had/tried the hummus appetizer ricotta ravioli spaghetti squash casserole and flourless chocolate cake
Service was friendly and professional
For dessert we ordered a bottle of a white Spanish wine Fuente Milano and it had a nice grapefruity after taste that was very cleansing on the palate before we had the Chocolate Bouchon the Creme Brulee and the salted carmel sundae
We got a seat right away and the waitress was really prompt and nice
Pro  good food solid happy hour Con service is inconsistent but has been trending up of recent
5 stars but can't so I'm rounding down until the service is steadily great
I spoke with the service manager and he had the service department order the parts of concern and had them installed at no cost as a goodwill gesture
I really want to give this place a 5-star rating but quite honestly the service is pretty bad
But then we ordered drinks really good sangria and mojitos and I don't say that about very many places
I'm so grateful to have great customer service from a downtown bike shop
My wife's plate was also good but her Fillet was ordered medium-rare and it came out medium-well which is unfortunate
The need of the bartendresses to both retrieve and restock glassware while simultaneously serving customers definitely resulted in slow service
Service was friendly and attentive but slow like others have mentioned
I need someone to provide me some damn control because I have none -pQuick friendly service
And yes they do now except cards but are not card friendly if you only order 1 drink

The staff was great too bad the food is weak
overall atmosphere and location is nice; sizable space and clean friendly staff
Anyway to make myself all better after this not so great experience we went to Delux Burger for dessert and nightcaps otherwise I would have pouted all night
We were told five minutes prior to finishing the rest of our meal that the kitchen was working on a large catering order and wasn't good at multitasking
It's near my home open late and the staff is really friendly
Staffed seemed unfriendly prob bc they wanted to go home & celebrate 4th of July

The service at this location is very good and the food is delicious

The service was very slow and it seemed like it was a bunch of high school kids working in the front
Beautiful ground friendly staff and great golf course
I love breakfast and the omelette I ordered was not satisfying at all
My group had a lovely table at the window with a very nice Italian waiter
I ordered the Yellowtail Tuna Crudo - nice combination of citrus with each yellowtail bite but it didn't match anything else on the menu and Tagliatelle pasta - w/ truffle & duck egg etc
And for dessert I ordered the Toffee Bread Pudding - it was good  but again should've known better it just made me feel even more disgustingly full
Service was pretty good but not a lot of menu options
I will say the place had a nice family owned feel and the manager came up at the end to play a game with us
The service was great and the food was prepared to perfection
Friendly staff and it's a well-oiled machine
Wait staff was young friendly and energetic but not overbearing
It was there in the old 3 Roots but you had to trade it for slow service
We went at 2pm on a weekday and got seated right away - score  Friendly staff and I also like the oil paintings
*TVs to watch the games on husband loves that one*Waitress/Bartenders are always smiley and niceDislikes-  *Smells like stale beer and smoke very bad on the inside

I chose to call Good Guys because they obviously have impressed others with their service and have a great reputation on Yelp
We were too stuffed to try any of the desserts but they certainly sounded good

Great service charming atmosphere and excellent dishes
Great service and nice atmosphere made for a great evening
The service continued to be inattentive and slow

We ordered nothing outside of the basic chicken curry naan saag paneer rice pudding best I have ever had mango lassi not very cold or thick but good and the galub jamun which tasted like it had been frozen and thawed
Why anyone would order something healthy in a bar decorated with license plates crude signs and a beer pong table is silly anyway but I learned the hard way you should stick to the fattening stuff
I called the manager and she was nice enough and offered to let me try again
I ate with my parents both of whom ordered the Breakfast Torta and my brother who ordered the Sausage and Eggs
Once I figured out it was a sandwich and not just sausage and eggs I wished I had ordered that instead of the Breakfast Torta because it looked amazing
I thought the food was very good and warranted a 5 star rating at this price point however I can't give Bertha's 5-stars with the problems they had taking customers' orders that day
Ordered the eda mame and spring rolls for appetizers both were great
Overall experience was wonderful service was attentive straight to the point and not smothery

Service at the Princess was very friendly and welcoming
Atmosphere is great for dining but the Chipotle-Style line you go through to order your food while they prepare it in front of you is less than appealing
Waiter was good and a great atmosphere pretty people a good place to go on a date
Another star for great service and a nice clean European grocery
I am constantly surprised that the service is so good
The staff is friendly and flirty -- in fact my friend slipped the waiter my phone number after we noticed him admiring my shoes
This review and the 4 stars are not meant to excuse the poor service but I will tell you that I have never had a bad meal there
I would give 5 stars on food alone but conversely just can't justify lowering the rating to a 3 based on slow service as many others have done
thumbs up buffalo your staff is cool and friendly and your clothes are hip
It's fast casual - you go up to the front and order and then they give you a number and they bring you your food
CherryBlossom also always has a great assortment of desserts
I feel like a lot of small restaurants have slow service but that is not the case here

My boyfriend had a bad experience with the cocktails at Tanzy before we went to Salt so he just ordered a kilt lifter
They need to hire nice bartenders and servers who know how to provide good customer service and not bartenders who are rude and accuse guests of walking out on their tab
I'm very disappointed in this place service and bartenders are rude
Great selection and the service is decent
The bathroom was nice the staff was great the decor was simply all the Indian families were happy I was happy he was happy and I had about 100 vegan items to choose from
great friendly service and one free refill on your coffee
The service was absolutely great but I doubt that my experience could be considered a test case because we were there off-peak and there were more employees present than patrons
Service was actually very good on Mother's Day a day which could try even the best server's patience with large tables filled with children parents and grandparents
Although as some Yelpers have said the service is SLOW especially when it was 230 PM On Sunday
All in all the food was wonderful the service was a little slow but since we had nowhere to go on Sunday it didn't really matter but it might matter if you are going to this place for an hour luch as we were there for about 1

And don't expect to get good AT&T or Verizon service in the wait area

However the staff he hires can be very rude sometimes
when i took it back the staff was nice but the owner/manager was visibly dickish about it
If you call in your order they will have it ready for you when you get there and you can get in and out fast
Even though I was taking my order to go I'm not a big fan of someone walking around and yelling names way too fast food for me

There were lots of other staff that would bring out other dishes but they weren't very friendly and would often not actually interact

And though improved the service is a little slow after placing your order

It is so pleasant to have such nice service
The atmosphere & service was nice but when I asked the server the 'quality of their animal products' he wasn't sure
Waiter was nice but tried too hard and eventually came off as arrogant as he educated us about what the difference between cabernet and pinot noir was
I've never had good luck with the service at this location though
Once we were seated however the rest of the staff was great and it was easy to forgive the girl's lack of pleasant customer service and competency
The couple across from us were seated probably a  good 10 minutes after us had the same waiter and received their food a good 10 minutes before us
Service was good he refilled our drinks several times and asked if everything was ok
Nice people the manager made it a point to get me my meal hot-off-the-grill even though I came ahead of the call and again he met me while he was cleaning tables

I am always spreading the word of their bad service and when my friends suggest to go there I recommend some other place to go
If you just feel like standing around in a tight packed bar not hearing what anyone says and getting terrible service then I guess it's a good place for you
Not sure what to expect I was pleasantly surprised by the location the food and good service
Aside from the food this place has a very local atmosphere which I love and let me tell you that the service rocked and all the great looking female servers are another great plus
Plus the bartenders are nice and serve you in the order that you approach the bar meaning they didn't let giant tattooed tits dictate how long you must wait for your drink
Even though my food was not up to par the service was exceptionally good
The service was really fast & I was in and out in 2 minutes which was GREAT because I needed to hurry up and get to work

They have greatly improved on their service much appreciated
The service is very friendly and authentic
Customer service was good with friendly and courteous staff mostly from the valet and door guys although the front desk staff were pleasant and not directly rude
She said yes no problem without a fuss - I believe this was only because we had booked directly on their site not using Priceline or other such service which we use a lot ourselves and have had great service through
I ordered the eggplant Parmesan and it was good although maybe because I am pregnant I couldn't really get into it as much as Michelle was
The service is great and the friendly staff help make it a pleasant experience it just wasn't a place that I was head over heals for

Based on the apparent quality of ingredients artisanal attention to details unique offerings as wells as standby favorites attentive and friendly service and beer selection I heartily give 4 stars  upgrade the bun and I would cheerily upgrade to 5 stars
When I asked the bartender - he told rather rudely a waitress to get her a place setting
We started eating and the original waitress stopped by to see how our meal was and the food was pretty good so we both said good
Having been to many downtown restaurants where I have received great service I could not let this experience go by without saying something
service is ALWAYS good it's always clean it's always pleasant
Great atmosphere Not a hole-in-the-wall yet not so trendy that they blare the club jamz and that the waitresses are all augmented
So it was extremely dissapointing to say the least I will be calling the manager back to see what they have to say and if they make good on the mistake
The staff is always friendly the baked goods are as good as you'll find anywhere and the atmosphere is what a coffee house should have

Service and wait staff were slow and uninterested it's July and it must suck to work there with it mostly empty I know servers make crap so I left a fair tip but I'm done
So many new things to look at everytime you enter the store the staff is so friendly trade in prices are fair and I love their cafe
We arrived at 10 pm and the room service was delicious and FAST

The waitress was very friendly and attentive and did a great job
The Not-So-GoodThe service is pretty spotty
I had no complaints about service and the restaurant is nice
I cancelled because of the very rude attitude and customer service of the office staff
For what it's worth the service itself was pretty average the guys showed up and were nice enough however I never really noticed a change in the scorpions I was looking to get rid of
The only reason I did not give it five stars was the fact that the waiter who has served me at least 10 times for lunch didn't even begin to recognize me and asked if we had ever been there before he was also a little on the slow side for refills
Great food great staff and friendly owner
Waitress was nice and I only heard good things about the place
Kelly the owner is a fixture here while he has a full staff that helps him on a typically busy night like Friday & Saturday any other night he is the man serving up cold beer setting up the movies and sharing his passion for this great new venture
Hard to order chicken at a place that does such good burgers but it was quite tasty

Terminal 4 is the biggest nicest most full of restaurants and services
Since we weren't sure when we would be able to arrive at the restaurant due to playing and we needed a table for 20 the owner Richard was nice enough to offer up his restaurant and his staff after hours at 9pm for us
Richard and his staff were amazingly friendly and helpful especially considering they were staying after hours to serve a rowdy bunch of softball players

It was great to see how much the staff loved working their crafty magic with the supplies as we made our way around to the 3 different crafting tables
The fact that we were less than impressed with the atmosphere really dark decor kind of reminded me of Black Angus and staff our server was overly enthusiastic when presenting the specials but not around when you needed more water or the check isn't enough to make me take away a star or two because the food and drinks were delicious and well-prepared enough to make the experience a great one despite these drawbacks
While he was was putting new batteries in the watches great service I looked around and found a beautiful bracelet that I figured I couldn't afford
The other time we just got great consistent service

The service was friendly and solid although it took them a while to realize we were done with our appetizer and hadn't ordered dinner yet but the salads came out very quickly

We came here with a large group from work and had a great time great food and great customer service
The staff here are all incredibly friendly
Staff is always great and have never failed to grant a request whether it is more pool towels or coffee pods
Would have got a 4-stars / maybe 5 as the coffee is super tasty but the staff is slow and think they are too cool for school
you should let your staff know esp luke perry that it's not cool to be rude and that most people don't appreciate it nor will they tip or come back for that matter
Both restaurants are equally amazing the service is always great and the food is delicious
The service is great and food comes out fast
The staff is nice and quick and gets my order done correctly
Excellent experience great food great service
Even though it was a weekend evening and the place was absolutely packed the service was great
The service is friendly but if being a waitress is your job then ask me if  how my food is or if I need anything else
Our waiter i wish i could remember his name but he was an older gentleman with glasses and he was so great
The staff is super friendly and would love to help you choose the right beer
The service is fast and reasonably priced
The service is excellent and the wait staff are always good for a recommendation too
It doesn't get to much better than Fez great atmosphere great food reasonable prices good service
When I told him that the order was not complete he just rolled his eyes and rudely informed me their online ordering was messed up
I told the girl on the phone that the delivery guy and manager should not treat customers so rudely she apologetically agreed
There are lots of good pizza places in Phoenix save yourself the hassle and the headache order from somewhere that actually knows the meaning of customer service
-  For dessert I ordered a grilled polenta with cornbread icecream and a great rhubarb jam on top
I am disappointed in the way I have been treated by the newer female employee manning the cash register the last two times I have been in; she was rude dismissive and acted like I was inconveniencing her by placing an order
they give great customer service friendly and helpful and spent $50 or more you get your make up done
The portions are huge and the service was fast
My husband and I both ordered breakfast and my son shared off our plates
I ordered the chicken fried steak country potatoes and biscuits with gravy   When served I had two HUGE biscuits that were nice and fluffy
My husband ordered the breakfast steak medium well and eggs with hash browns
The service wasn't bad but they did forget to bring a few things that were ordered - - we were a large group though so I'll be a bit forgiving
Nice and relaxing sounds of running water abound and attentive service
They said they'll check it with the company they get it from & see if it was bad & the manager would call me back
The staff was incredibly helpful and friendly
I guess I'll start on the positives the staff was very nice and I used the restaurant
Both the manager Matt and the bartender Maureen were excellent and couldn't have been nicer
Overall great food even better service and extremely reasonable prices
It's way bigger in person than it looked in the photo and sooooo good note I normally HATE salads just ordered it for the seared tuna and ended up eating a good amount of the salad itself
They offer counter-service and everyone who's ever helped me has been friendly
the customer service is great the sexy dirty chai is great but the food i will not eat again
three stars is a little generious but 2 is harsh because the place i wanted to go nextdoor was closed i drifted in here they give you chips and salsa which was a little more like a bad marinara and half the chips were borderline stale the women working the bar was pleasant the menu seamed a bit pricey i ended up having a pattymelt which was decent and a few bluemoon in nice frosty mugs
The portions are perfect service is great staff is friendly and the kitchen coordinator was on top of his s*@t
The service was fast and friendly and the menu was decent
I realize it is in Scottsdale which is supposed to be nice and normally I don't mind spending more for better atmosphere and service but you will not find it at BS West
Maybe my hopes were built up b/c of all the other great reviews maybe we came at a bad time maybe he ordered the wrong item
I will definitely be back again because the coffee is really good no longer cartel but also a local brand expressions service is excellent and food is well prepared
I don't know what kind of service the other people here received but we had a very good server who kept coming back to refill our coffee
Service was prompt efficient and the quality was good
Oh yes and before I forget GRADESOverall   A- no other demerits taken other than mentioned belowService  A-  The only major demerit on service was that the English                        spoken by some of the cart pushers was not intelligible                       however this is excusable as this is a Chinese place -                        the specials board was completely in ChineseFood   A-  A good example of traditional Dim Sum
People were friendly and service was pretty quick
I on the other hand not a chicken fried steak for breakfast gal ordered that ha
The staff is really friendly and always strikes up a small conversation when I come in
I love the casual atmosphere has a rocky point feel to it and you usually get good service
Our waitress was really nice but I think she should have noticed how burnt the food was that she served us
The sweet shrimp is my personal favorite and anything else you order you will find the fish is sliced with great execution
This I regarded as a final insult as I have no desire to return to this place and in lieu of making up for the bad meal and poor service the only apparent apology is an invitation to come back and do it all over again
Our waiter was very friendly and had some great recommendations
They have a daily dinner special w/app entree and dessert - something like Wally's economic stimulus plan for a good price - clever
Good service great food OK prices hence the 4 stars
It's a good idea to remember your order number and meal name as the person bringing out the order probably won't be your server
The staff is always very friendly and they have some very informative clinics as well as an occasional weekend event
My roommate ordered the chicken parm and although he didn't say it was bad
The bartender who took our drink order was efficient and friendly and the drinks only $4 during happy hour were nice and strong
The staff is made up primarily of retired folks and they could not be nicer
It's nice when you get great service at a little fast food joint
The service is friendly but I haven't dine in so haven't had that experience yet
Great room service experience and decent desk service
The service was great and I would go back to this place
but the service is horribly slow and made me ask myself several times if I was on some sort of prank show because I just can't believe this is acceptable/normal
It's definitely not good for business when you have a sour look on your face while you point me to another cashier because you don't feel like taking my order
BEST THINGS our server did forewarn us of hollandaise so we got it ~thankfully~ on the side /  good service though busy and mostly with a smile
Not only was the food spectacular the staff at Tanzy were the the most personable and friendly staff I've seen in a long time
We also ordered the lentil patty appetizer which was good although not my favorite
Overall the food was a modern healthy version of my favorites with courteous and attentive customer service in a beautifully decorated space
Four stars because I want to try more of their menu make sure service and quality stay consistent and because they were inexplicably playing a Steve Miller Band greatest hits album during our visit
Went to eat with friends; waitress I found to be rude as she acknowledge my guy friends and barely made contact with me throughout the night
Staff are friendly and regular same Sushi chef has been there every time I've visited so you always get a consistent experience
a good tune up and some new tires were in order for my vintage gem of a road bike
I received excellent service and every staff member I encountered was unique and friendly; and really seemed to fit in with the mood of the place
the same waitress who was quick on the drinks and very friendly
They could use some updating but the grounds are what you really come here for and the great service
Even so the service is still friendly and their sushi is *always* tasty fresh and inventive I like to order the chef's creation
I have sat several times at the bar with a friend or just alone and I love that service - the sushi chefs are always friendly jovial and like to make light conversation
The service was so-so nothing bad but not spectacular
Service was good but did not match the priciness of the restaurant
But don't worry the coffee is hot the waitresses are friendly and the food is absolutely amazing
The staff was friendly and helpful and allowed me to sample several different types of soups before settling on one
The place was great the staff was running around with shirts that read LEGALIZE MARINARA on the back we sat on the outside patio the ambiance was great a very up beat and happy place to be
We ordered the El Picasso Chicago Style stuffed Pizza MAMA MIA this was the best Pizza I have ever had it was full of chicken and cheese and all kinds of great stuff let me tell you this was not dinner it was a life changing experience I had no room for desert as a matter of fact we boxed up 1/2 the pizza and took it to go and that was only an 8 inch
Service was great but I'm not a fan of their food the ambience is nice
Not a bad place for being in a strip mall buy don't expect service
All in all great place to order to go bone- in wings
Service is slow but I can't say that surprises me in a crowded bar
I don't know if we just had an awful server or if he thought we'd be bad tippers I've never gone under 20% for good service - bad never gets less then 15% but it will be a long time before any of us go there again
I also ordered a Boba tea which was so good
Great friendly staff office runs on time typically and they return all phone calls personally and in good time
The place was pretty busy so service wasn't exactly speedy gonzales but it was very good considering the crowd
Anyway I had fun and the entire crowd as well as the entire staff of the place was very friendly
The service was very good  the waitress kept the drinks full which is very important
I usually order a steak New York but yes the seafood is pretty good here too
She took our drink order but unfortunately it never came so we just had water which in the end was a good thing since the food did not have much flavor
My only bad comment - is that while the ice cream cookie sandwiches are good good ice cream + tasty cookies I wish they were made fresh to order
Everyone here has been friendly and when they say my order will be ready for pick up in 20-30 minutes it almost always is
This wasn't one employee giving bad customer service
The shepherds pie was good the beer was cold and the waitress was very attentive
I give this place 4 stars simply because the staff is so friendly and interactive
The staff is always very friendly and I have to say they even recognize my voice on the phone now before I say my name
This lunch was especially good and the service was excellent
We ordered- Thai-High Sweet & Zesty Chicken Salad - delicious- Wok Fired Sesame Ginger Chicken noodles - fabulous & a large portion- Side order of fries - seriously some of the best I had w/ both sea salt and pepper and perfectly friedOverall a great lunch
For example I ordered a gin and tonic got a nice stiff glass came back for another and got a dixie cup with too much ice
The short Tasty Thai very friendly service and a clean well-lit comfortable and quiet strip mall space
We were greeted by some very friendly young women and told to pick a table--plenty to choose from at 7 pm on a Saturday as there were just a couple of tables taken and a couple of people ordering takeout more came in as the night went on
We ordered the Rosemary Potato and Olive Pizza which was unique and quite good along with a side of Mac and Cheese which was not so good - I expected a little more flavor or pop in it
Our table also ordered a italian sausage combo pizza which was good and a corn chopped salad which was quite tasty
And the kung pao was also good but we order that just for some spice
We ordered the hummus for appetizers which was good and the pita bread was fantastic worth the 50 cents they charge you for extra
The service was pretty good a little unenthusiastic but I guess saying Opa a hundred times a day gets a little old
The service was also friendly and attentive and fair prices
The tiki marsala happens to be my favorite dish and I find the staff to be accomodating and attentive especially when ensuring I've got enough na'an to sop up my plate's delightful curries
The service was great however and we'd still consider coming back for a drink at the bar
Most all the holes have some good character to them the rates are very reasonable staff is friendly enough lots of trees to provide shade in the summer some of the best if not the best twilight specials in town and the course is always  in at least above-average condition
And I wanted so bad to ask the waitress to turn the channel to NFL football - but I did have enough sense that I was in a Mexican place surrounded by Mexican families that probably like watching their version of football
The service was stellar - friendly attentive
For dinner I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass Hong Kong style which was aromatic and had good flavors but the fish itself didn't seem as fresh as it could of been
Great food & great service when ordering as always -Now ask to use the restroom after 12midnight & their A+ customer service does a 180 & goes to down right rude
I was honestly surprised at how disrespectful their staff was when I asked why their restrooms were closed & when I inquired more about the policy 3 staff members were so down right rude I simply walked out
You get to be in a bar in the middle of the day which is great the place isn't crowded and service is prompt and there are a lot of healthy options on the menu
Otherwise the service was good and we weren't interrupted unnecessarily which seems to happen a lot in Arizona when I go to work lunches
The service can be on the scary tweaker side but it's a good simple breakfast that doesn't stress my dehydrated mind to find deliciousness
We were greeted by a friendly staff that was eager to assist us the place was dead
I took this as a bad sign either waitress on training wheels or has no clue what it is
I'm giving it a full 5 because my friend is a Karaoke host here and because the owner and staff are great
The service was prompt and friendly the prices were fair and the food was pretty good
I appreciate friendly cheerful service but not ill-thought conversation
Basically The Tavern is a good sports bar offering all of the bar food and beer a sports fan can love - I was impressed by how friendly and fast the service was despite being there on a Monday Night Football day
Service was nice so I would have to think very hard to return again
Chelsea's Kitchen has the perfect combination of ambience friendly service and delicious food
The wait staff was very attentive and took our orders promptly
My best advice is to sign up for the Pep Boys rewards program to get great discounts in the mail for your next service
I am not prone to giving bad reviews and because of the food they're getting a 3 instead of a 2 but the lack of personable service was very disconcerting and I don't think I'll go back for that reason
No dealership is great but the service dept is what keeps a customer a customer
This is real chinese food and the staff is not rude its just that they dont know much english
We also shared an order of the green chile stew again great and we shared the cinnamon sugar fry bread for dessert
Bottom line great selection good flavors good value mediocre service
How does one go wrong with the atmosphere/decor friendly staff and last but not least the best food
The soup he said was good but I found it slightly inexcusable that she kept walking past our table and looking at the untouched appetizer whilst she continued to service the table next to us to her fullest extent
Amazing breads and baked goods terrific sandwiches and European style service - which means brisk and impersonal
The sfogliatelle is the best in AZ far surpassing the frozen husks you'll find elsewhere and better that those on offer at Andreoli's where they don't seem to mind selling burnt goods and the service is equally 'European'
Make a visit savor the goods withstand the service
Also calling yourself a business owner during the same interaction where you get in my face try to block my way to my seat confront me in such a rude way and then don't even let me speak because you're too busy scolding me with your hands on your hips as if you're a mother yelling at a child- is laughable and makes me wonder if you are actually that clueless about customer service
You won't be disappointed with the varieties of ice cream that they offer & the great service behind the counter
staff was very friendly and let us sample as much as we wanted
Service was no suprise - it was attentive
One of my favorite places for lunch - super fast service and a lot of food for the money
anyway I'm not giving it four stars because it took some time for the staff to warm up and be friendly
Excellent service great atmosphere and really yummy food
Both of my dining companions ordered the filet au poivre special and the server also split a nicely sized lobster tail for them
The food was great the service was good and the AC was cold
The food was still good but the service left much to be desired
The prices are reasonable and as long as you're not a snob the food is good but be willing to roll the dice on the service
There looks to be a few complaints here regarding service time but there's always a wait for good food
White the food and service were both good - portions were miniscule
Like every other Trader Joe's this one also has a wide variety of products extremely nice and helpful staff and provides a great overall grocery shopping experience
Ultra-attentive service at fast food restaurants is hard to find but be that as it may I actually experienced it at the Scottsdale Whataburger during a recent visit
Not only was the cashier extremely friendly when I ordered she actually came out to ask me how my burgers were while I was eating
In any event the great service at the Scottsdale Whataburger was just one facet of what I loved about the place
Staff was very friendly and food was good
= It was pretty busy at 930ish service was fast and good
Popped in on a Saturday night to be treated to a ridiculously nice waitress and delicious Mexican food
The service was super friendly our food came out quickly and we ate every bite and a couple bowls of chips - fantastic salsa and a bit spicy
Overall we had great service yummy food and didn't spend a lot
Our waiter was friendly and provided good service most of the night
The service is great but the food sucks
We ordered some guac dip to go with the chips and salsa spicy but good spicy and left satisfied
The server we had was great and gave us top notch service even though we were only having a drink and chips although I did notice other servers weren't as attentive to their tables
We were exhausted and only in for the night but they had a nicely appointed gym although it is located just off the lobby with tons of windows so the whole world can see you working out lots of parking guest laundry on every floor and a restaurant where you can order room service
And honestly it's not bad and it probably depends on what you order
However when I called to make an appointment the call center staff was rude and impatient once I informed them I had a Groupon
I can't vouch for all of their drinks as I've only tried the green milk tea and avocado snow but every time I have ordered them they have been super good
Good energy in this space but too bad about how expensive all of the classes and services are
Food was delicious and the service was great
The customer service is great and the prices are cheap
Post script In response to the owner comment I should clarify that my hesitation in ordering ahi sashimi at this establishment is not at ALL in reference to grade or quality of product but more of a 'hindsight' situation meaning in retrospect it's doubtful that it would be a good representation of Hula's as a whole
Our waiter was friendly and came over right away to offer us drinks
While the staff was mostly great the room was not
Good people fun games great music and awsome service
Good customer service combines with talent at the craft
The hubs & I saddled up to the sushi bar & were welcomed by a nice wait staff
We'll be back for the DJ happy hour specials good service & ambiance
The atmosphere service drinks and food are great
The counter staff were pleasant and friendly
The burgers were good cooked to order and done perfectly like textbook medium well which is how we always order our burgers
Portions are HUGE and the service is great
I was of course looking for the lowest estimate but I was also looking for the one with great customer service too
When I had all 5 estimates I called the one that offered me the lowest quote had been professional on time and had a good service plan which was Accutemp
The staff is incredible sweet and attentive
The food is good the service is adequate and it's not that much more expensive than fast food
The service was fine the location is great the waiters were friendly
Decent pies nice selection of beers on tap served in frosty glasses great service
He wants good food better service and a comfortable atmosphere
We decided that this would be a nice place for our family to go after my Dad's memorial service
and we also decided to split an order of fish and chips also very good
The service was attentive but uninspired -- no real energy
We had very prompt and attentive service me and the wife splitting the order of pollo especial because one of my fellow yelpers recommended it and they were certainly correct
The service is awesome every time I go the bartenders remembers my name I love that shit the music is amazing one minute radiohead the next mgmt really great stuff
I'm in love with their marketing pink and brown color scheme but more importantly they do a great job on a variety of services
The service was quick and our waitress was really friendly
In the end all the service is amazing the atmosphere is wonderful and the staff is great
It's clean and the service is good but it's way over priced
If you come here expecting good service in the exact same fashion I'd laugh at a crappy comedian
in that time we laughed a lot got to know the extremely attentive staff ate our fair share of 7+ courses each and drank some of us drank a glass of wine to go with each course
Their staff is so gracious and nice they know us immediately when we walk in and most times don't even need to ask for our order as they already know what we like
The wait staff is very nice accommodating and welcoming
It's family owned and the staff are sooo nice
Food is on a fast food level all frozen fried/microwaved if it wasn't for the service I would have given it 2 maybe a 3
Long versionOur waitress was very friendly and pleasant we asked about HH drinks specially the wine
The ambiance is standard fast food restaurant the staff is very friendly & greets you when you walk in and answer any questions you may have
Of course the service was friendly and efficient as always
The staff was more attentive on where we sat than giving us a genuine greeting even though the place was empty except two other tables
I used to think the staff was short and slightly rude because of how busy it was and dealing with upset starving customers brings them down but now I know that is not the case
Bring a good attitude to the table and you will be rewarded with top flight food and service
The service is always great and the servers have that sort of cutesy yellow-orange-green tinge to them that says I juice a lot of carrots
If you order take out they pack things up nicely for you and have a comfortable bar seating area for your short wait
If you order a large Thai Ice Tea to go you get it in a ridiculously large cup - a great lunch time treat that will last you through the rest of your work afternoon
Bottom line a great experience both in terms of customer service and food but they could have done a bit better on the food e
The manager Tommy was slow/nearly impossible to reach and even harder to get info out of
Since the goal of the evening is relax & enjoy our time with our friends not to worry about bad service we took our covo with Tommy as a hint that the Merc Bar would not be a good fit
The handsome server was very attentive and knowledgeable and I loved the half-carafe option when ordering wine
Wanting this to be good we preserved and waited for our waiter  to have some free time for us
One minor complaint I do have is that the service is kind of slow and quite frankly
My experience here was very enjoyable and the staff were pleasant and friendly
The service in the restaraunt during breakfast was outstanding
I want to first start off by saying that the service was very good
We were very disappointed but because the wait staff was very nice I would have no problem giving them another chance
Both my mom and I who were visiting from out of town; me San Diego and her Baltimore have never ever experienced such friendly and helpful customer service at any department store anywhere EVER
They were friendly and very customer service oriented always have been for the most part
Yes their young this is probably their first job but some of them are borderline rude
For what it is - a nice clean modest sized nursery with helpful staff- this place is great
I can't say it's the best steak you will ever have but for what it is it's consistently good service/food and it's convenient
it is huge but so good that if you have more than 4 people at your table you should order two
I liked the space the bathroom was clean and cool the staff was friendly and both my hot beverages were great
It's so sad when there is great service like this that the food is not better
Menu greeted me at he doorway so you could a have a look at it proceeded forward to order and the wait staff was polite and nice
Ok now the bad I ordered the lunch special pizza which was an 8 inch pizza and a drink for like $6
Interestingly enough I think it's bigger if you order it for dinner than for breakfast but for either it's plenty big
it's pretty nice to breeze in and pay and grab your stuff when there's a gaggle of folks still waiting for their order to be called
The service was very good and is what gets it a passing grade
That time I ordered the item that Guy tried on triple D and it was really good
The staff was nice and took my order quickly and it was only a short while before my order of the hog and the chick was in front of me
Food was decent but wait staff was very good
We had bottle service so we did not have to wait in line and the host were very nice and attentive
once again i ventured out of my comfort zone and remembering that once upon a time someone had told me the toasted ravioli were good ordered those
The food was excellent and the service was mostly good
My husband and I had a long wait to get a table but the hosts and waiters were very apologetic and nice and they even comped us our appetizer because of it
Reasonable prices casual dining and friendly service
The service was great attentive and friendly although like I said the meal came slow
As wedding prices go it was definitely reasonable - no idea why the world thinks that in order to have a lovely wedding you need to drop oodles of loot - the Farm is a great option for nature lovers people missing trees grass etc great food amazing service and a memorable location for their wedding it was actually less expensive than 90% of the hotel/buffet options out thereFood there are three dining options at The Farm Quiescence fancy high end dining Morning Glory Cafe breakfast/brunch The Farm Kitchen - lunch I could write a novel here but overall the food is a little expensive lunch is usually $10-$15/person with drinks or if you want desert tack on an additional $3-5 bucks but it is very good plus you get the great ambiance of dining under trees on a picnic table or in their little courtyard area
If it's busy prepare to wait awhile to order  and get your food self serve you gotta pick it up at the window when they call your number For breakfast/brunch at Morning Glory expect similar pricing but this is located towards the back of the property in a cozy little brick patio area - simple waiter service
She got a really great dark beer and I tried to go outside of the box and ordered a melon martini
The only chance you'll get fast service is if you're the only one there
The staff was friendly and attentive and the dining area clean and comfortable
Not a bad dessert just no wow factor I hoped for
Alltel is the polar opposite of Arcadia the ice was wet the guards allow kids to skate against the flow of traffic there were candy wrappers on the ice extremely dangerous  throngs of people crammed on the rink with no order and the guards who could barely skate themselves busted my balls repeatedly for going too fast
Our server was perfect and all the staff were attentive
go to the places with great service and spend your money there
The environment was kinda noisy probably because we were a group of 14 and the wait staff was kinda slow once again because there were 14 of us but they had a TV playing the knicks game so I was happy being able to watch LINSANITY and the woodfire oven was blazing away for some good ambience
I changed my rating to four stars to reflect this manager's willingness to happily and nicely deal with this situation in a timely manner
The service is mostly horrible but the space is sorta nice and there's never a wait for a table
I ordered a great Mojito not made with that fake flavored rum and syrup
We ordered the crab fried rice which  was good with big chunks of crab but salty
Our waitress while nice was in lala land
right when you enter the eatery the environment is very friendly as well as the staff
The wait staff was good nothing that was absolutely amazing but they definitely did their job drinks food and ticket were all on time that's all that I wanted and expected
We've never had any issues with the wait staff they're attentive and generally on top of things
but to be honest even if the wait staff here was horrible I'd still give the place 5 stars because the pizza is that good
SO dangerously goodSo if you want a lively atmosphere with friendly waiters/hostesses and  really creative sushi and some drinks this is the place to go
The Eggs Benedict was perfect brioche french toast was like a dessert the dessert table had small portions of every bit of yummy sweet goodness you can imagine and everything in between was great I thought my husband was going to have to roll me out of there
The service was good and all else but man I couldn't drink enough fluid the rest of the night to
the staff was nice enough to let me know that the usual red sauce had meat init and they left that out
The staff are really friendly local business types who know a lot but won't cater to snippy customers
didn't see anything over $102 Food quality - a few notches above average and way above fast food chains3 Service - GREAT
They've got a pretty good selection of beers to choose from but the thing that kills this place for me is the service
But the service was my greatest complaint
Food was good too - mini tacos are tasty and come three to an order
The waitress was nice and even discussed the beers with us it was a decent trip
Service was friendly - big smiles - overall just a really lovely surprise
Every time I have come to enjoy a nice morning meal I am surprised with something on the menu I never thought to order
The service has always been superb and friendly
Service is always good and the coffee is great but the name is not Dunkin Coffee
Quality is awesome and the staff is great
The service is always good and it's a better place to drink than to eat even the desserts and appetizers are good just not an all-around contender for favorite bar and grill
The staff is very friendly & accommodating & they will ensure you enjoy your visit
Friendly & knowledgeable staff wide selection good location
When it's bad you have to make sure you get your waiter to bring you everything you need at once otherwise it may take a while to track him or her down
For the most part though the waiters know the menu can offer some good suggestions and come back often for refills
For the person complaining about slow oyster service they shuck their oysters when you order them
It's been a month or two since we ordered from Maharaja so I can't really remember what else we've gotten but I know that I've had no bad impressions of their fare
Our waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable
Another nice touch was the manager personally coming over to introduce herself and ask about our experience
Overall the service was great and the food while tasty wasn't spectacular or terribly distinguished
They were packed but the service was still great
It's the fastest course has the best staff and I didn't have to run almost two miles to the start looking at you Seattle
The wait staff in the restaurant was very attentive and the food was very good although a little pricey
Service is good and best of all the price is right - CHEAP
Three stars for decent products & nice staff
Staff was really nice attentive and the server we got knew her menu
From first glance you wouldn't think so but after having a great conversation with my waitress and reading the total line on my tab
The good-not-great reasonably priced brunch food was totally betrayed by the most inept service of all time
you order from a counter like you would from in-n-out or other fast food place they give you a number and in our case they brought it to our table in a plastic bag ready to go
He was great as usual but it still didn't  make up for the poor service we recieved that night
The food was very good we ordered all different kinds of rolls- california salmon rainbow crunchy
The staff was attentive and the ambience was also pleasing
It is good for drinks and service from the girl I mentioned all the rest of them seemed a little stand-offish
- crumbled sausage and melted mozzarella - pulled pork - pulled lamb If it is one of the above in that order drop whatever you're doing and get there as fast as you can
Everything is made to order and it's pretty busy because it's that good
My nephew ordered a Panini which was very small my sister ordered some crepes which she felt were not very good my brother in law and I ordered a Denver Omelette which I was going to split with my Mother
The staff is exceedingly friendly and always greet you when you enter
And while a great many people mention the obvious bits about the uniforms which certainly doesn't hurt I loved the food and the friendliness of the waitstaff
See KohinoorIf I'm feeling like spoiling myself I'll take the next jump up to the places with painted walls friendly waitstaff and a-la-carte style menus instead of specials
The waiters were attentive without  being overbearing and the complimentary appetizer - I always forget the name - the crispy slightly sweet cracker thingamajig with the green sauce
Indian Delhi Palace has good food good service and an atmosphere that will embrace you like a vampire who feeds off of stress instead of blood
I have always found employees to be very friendly and helpful with managers who jump in and ring up orders stock shelves or whatever else needs to be done
ConsThe place is dirty dont take my word read the other reviewsThe employees are always bullshitting until they rudely ask you what you want to order
Great customer service and pretty good food too
It tasted good it reminded me of the food on what I used to order from a Vietnamese restaurant from San Diego

Our waitress was really very friendly and came by the table often
I won't write Cibo off today just because a staff had a bad night or because I didn't know that double parking was expected in the lot
I now know that I should park on the street not the lot but if the slow service is consistant with either the bar or wait staff then sad faces I will have to abandon that delicious Bruschetta which is the only reason I gave 3 stars

The ice machine was out of order but a nice guy got us cups of ice for our drinks
I've been here for both within a two week span and have had a good experience with both but I felt service was a bit quicker even if getting a table might be hard to accomplish

Maybe slit my wrists and hop into a nice warm bath for dessert

I mean the employees are friendly the food is made to order so it's fresh you have the freedom to basically make your own burger and the egg bread that my burger came on was really good which is all great but for a college kid who's got to be financially responsible better overall value can be found someplace else
We were will a group of 8 and we had great service for our dinner
The veggie plate you can special order is a perfect entree and though it's basically just a combination of all the side veggie dishes I think the sum is definitely greater than the parts

historically the food has been great the service has been friendly and the beer has been cold
thanks to Leah and the hostess staff you guys are great
But besides the great food the best thing about this restaurant is how friendly the entire staff was from the waitress to cook to the person busing the tables
Sure there are things the management could do better it could be nicer inside the appetizers could be a tad more appealing and the wait staff could be a bit better at remembering things but that's not why you come here
On the bright side the place was packed the ingredients were fresh and the service was good
The other day my sister and I had a good time with our waiter
We didn't have to wait long for our food which is always nice and our waitress was very attentive and friendly
We definitely got the feeling that they train their wait staff very well the only close to negative thing I could say is that sometimes they might come off a little fake and disingenuous with how they always have a huge smile on their face; there's that feeling that they might be being nice to your face then complaining about you when they're not by your table
We really had a nice family dinner that night on our Scottsdale area vacation and we have Guy Fieri's show to thank for the idea and Haus Murphy's staff to thank for the experience

I can't say they are the nicest bar staff that I met
All of this great service amongst several patrons including one individual at a nearby table who was extremely demanding and indecisive
After already being irritable with the slow service having both worked in restaurants we are very understanding of how stressful it is to handle a lot of tables or drink orders but the restaurant was so empty that there was just no excuse the slow service was not the only bad part of our first experience at Sam's Cafe
Having worked in many restaurants I know that one of the main rules of good service is that someone should take food out as soon as it's ready so that it doesn't get cold and that as a server I was responsible for doing so even if the food wasn't for my table
I know not to expect too much from bar food especially when it was seriously discounted for happy hour but two of the things we ordered were just bad
The final kicker of our bad happy hour experience was when we asked the bartender for a check and he tried to pressure us to order more even though we said several times that we were finished
Maybe I'm crazy but I don't think you should order more to *make* your experience somewhere better; rather you should order more *because* you're having such a good time

I contacted Gabi to ask her what her expert opinion would be and she was kind enough to recommend Beckett's Table BT and put me in touch with the manager to get a good reservation Gabi-you rock
Our server Josh was great and explained the specials and got our drink orders
A good example is Durant's when you make a reservation they always ask if you're celebrating anything and if you are Durant's is kind enough to provide a comped dessert of their choosing
In summary it has a great atmosphere but don't expect service and don't take the wine book too seriously
The owners are very nice and funny don't be scared if they invite you to dance before you order ok
Both trips involved bad service or at least service that was understaffed for the crowd

I don't think the staff inside was as warm and friendly but overall the service was A-OK
The salad was fine though it would have been nice had the waitress had let me speak to say I wanted to remove the onions before she started tossing it
I had fun drinking some Sake and Cosmos During happy hour Saki is $1 and Cosmopolitans are $4 The service was a tad slow but that was definitely expected since the place was PACKED on a Friday night
Sara was our waitress and she was just the right amount of attentive; she gave us time to peruse the menu per our request but brought our iced teas out right away
thanks to the attentive rest of the staff
The staff did whatever I needed to make me happy and were very friendly
After the bottles were gone I went to the bar and Dave was not only fast at making my drinks but he really gave me great customer service and was nice to me even when I ordered complicated drinks lol
Place was OK the girls and service were great
Later we ordered a pepperoni pizza and thought it was just as good as Hazelwoods with the exception of the crust which I prefer to be as thin as possible
And on top of that the waiter was very nice plus he gave us comment on my dad's rocky shirt and said  this man still got it  and he made sure we were happy by coming by when we were served asking us to have a malt but we were fine and we loved it anyways without a malt
The food was okay tasting I had the Chorizo and Eggs but I can't help but wonder how many morning runs its going to take in order to lose the fat ass I surely got after that breakfast
Between 4 of us waving down the 2 waitresses working we managed to get both of their attention after about 5 minutes and only one bothered to come 5 min later to refill our drinks in the other's defense after she took our order she went on a morning break sat down and was eating breakfast -_-
stick to the chain breakfast eateries for now if your thing is standard service and digestible food
Was treated very rudely by staff member Michelle & manager Sara and upon getting home the food was made incorrectly
Thanks for the memories Someburros but your rude staff and inability to get the food right means it will be another 10 years before I give you my business

Service-Has always been friendly and attentive
I used the service button 4 times and found good responsiveness within approx
Service was good and seating was difficult but we opted to sit community style at a large table amongst other patrons
The host was friendly enough but our waitress was very distracted
On our previous visit we had found the service to be lacking but not nearly as bad as it was this time
I ordered the honey lemonade $3 which was the perfect balance between tart and sweet-- honey is a great sweetener
The boyfriend ordered the Organic Ravioli with Ricotta cheese and kale pesto ~$13 which was super good
Our server was extremely attentive to us did not pressure us into ordering anything extra and was prompt in refilling water glasses answering questions and bringing the check
The staff is very nice and fairly quick to respond I don't think my water glass was empty for too long
My husband had the chicken & dumplings and said his could have been a little hotter but honestly that is the only small issue we had and it wasn't enough for us to ask the waitress who was very attentive to heat it up or get something hotter
The place is super cute and the service has been good the couple of times I have been there
More often than not it's below average service slow drink refills and the like
This is why I hate when restaurants job-share tables it puts you in a position to have to punish a good server for a crappy drink service that was someone else's fault
Stayed a night for a quick trip to PhoenixPROS- close to airport with my rental took about 10 mins at most- big rooms with couch and fridge flat screen tv large bathroom- business center where you could print stuff or use their computers but the computers were awfully slow and old- free parking- free internet- friendly staffCONS- no room service- area is not really near anything exciting but at least its close to airport- toilet was a little dirty I thought
Again I think the hostesses did the most the original server was great - but in a party of 10 we shouldn't have to raise our hands to see who ordered what each time the drinks arrived

Our waitress and the whole staff really was amazingly friendly
The food is great the service is great and the beer is wonderful as well
I love this place its great to curve pizza cravings without having to order a whole pizza and its great when you are with a group and they can't agree on what type of pizza to order here they can get whatever they want
they make all the pies in advance then when you order they throw a slice back into the oven to reheat which isn't bad
Two stars for bad service and damn I have to the tell the truth a lousy appetizer
- no wireless internet in rooms- no t-mobile service in rooms- no ability to put bills under door so you have to check out in the morning- Chances are you have a long walk to your room- Health Club/Gym is actually pretty nice a good number of machines and a free weights section as well
Hard to beat for a breakfast that lasts all day when you can't decide to go sweet or savory and friendly efficient service
When there is staff around they are always friendly and helpful
Plenty of wait staff fluent in both English and Spanish so be patient and they'll take great care of you

The only time service has been 'fast' is during breakfast
Apparently quite the draw for most patrons as our server informed us that  EVERYONE ordered it and that she and the rest of the servers all really hated making it that made us feel GREAT

The service was great food was excellent and while it may have been a bit on the pricey side I felt as though it was a great value
I would give this 5 stars but most of the time it seems like the staff is slow and doesn't care a whole about giving good service
- great neighborhood vibe - small and intimate with a modern Asian vibe than isn't overly 'faux-Japanese' or 'trendy'- quick friendly serviceThe Not so Good- the tuna sashimi tuna had the telltale mushy flavorless that comes from being previously frozen - the 'chef's choice' sashimi A white fish but we didn't get a chance to ask what it was was flavorless although not mushy
I may come back when the sushi urge hits and order off the daily special menu but it won't be a priority otherwise especially with all the great other restaurants popping up in uptown Phoenix

+1 star for a nice server and overall fast & attentive service
Yes the service isn't the greatest but some advice to diners going out expecting a thorough smiley staff Don't go to a Chinese restaurant
Considering we arrived with the after game crowd I think we got really good service and I would say at it's peak the restaurant inside was about 2/3 full and dwindling as we were thereOverall it is not a bad place and I would go again if invited but I want to try some other places in the area too on my infrequent trips downtown
but after we sat down our waiter explained that the bar next door which plays GREAT dance music is associated to Fate
The service was good and we had a great time
An experience is only as good as the staff and the atmosphere of the store you're in and Paris Envy has both mastered

The serving staff isn't dripping with warmth but they're attentive and pretty quick
After a manager got us to sample some of their fresh chicken however we ended up staying out of good faith
All of the employees were friendly and nice the only downside would be the parking/services fee they charge but hey it includes free valet and they give you free wifi and most hotels seem to charge this now anyway
The waitress was nice and very apologetic about the wait so at least this restaurant knows to be courteous to it's customers unlike a different restaurant I recently went to *cough*postino*cough* There were four of us and we ordered two appetizers and two pizzas
Good service good food awesome beer and the company that goes along with all of the above certainly doesn't suck
The staff is nice and the atmosphere is comfortable and inviting
Kinda strange to first walk in but the friendly staff makes all doubts disappear
Things I liked about this hotel- reasonable price between $90 and $130 during the off-peak dates I stayed-  extremely friendly bar staff and restaurant staff;  front desk staff was also very helpful although the person staffing the guest services desk struck me as a bit of a curmudgeon or perhaps he was only having a bad day-  clean rooms with wireless access included- Location
Nordstrom customer service goes far deeper than having nice sales staff with great policy
The waitress was also very attentive & the atmosphere was fun
The service is typical family-owned friendly
Although I would have no problem with that if the service was good and the food was above average
They did a great job with the design but need to work out the flaws in service and improve the food or lower the prices
The meat was perfectly cooked not chewy like the last sandwich I ordered at another place the coleslaw was so good and flavorful juicy without dripping all over the place
Yes the waitstaff can be slow at times but they are young kids and I feel they generally fit more in the atmosphere category than staff meaning they are all young and cool and hip and thus contribute to the whole vibe of the place
The kindest smartest nicest wait staff in the morning and the food is just so creative and different yet so tasty
The Ocatilla concierge folks are extremely nice as can be but their niceness doesn't walk the hallways and pick up trash or room service trays that sit out in the hallways all day long without being picked up
The staff was extremely friendly the rooms were well designed and super clean and the property is beautiful
That aside service was attentive after you've waited 5-10 minutes
The service was good - not crazy speedy or anything but that seemed to go with the laid back vibe
The staff is SUPER friendly and make me feel right back at home
The average waitress there is at retirement age which is fine and that can be really nice what would ya like sweetie

I ordered the demi-breakfast - eggs biscuit and bacon and the boyfriend ordered the breakfast quesadilla with chorizo
Although I will say the staff was very nice and I liked the atmosphere
Also the staff at this museum is very friendly and helpful which you do not find at every art museum
I found the waitress to be a little rude and the pulled pork sandwich I ordered for 10 bucks was small not worth the price
The staff is nice enough but hopelessly inept
Because there were so many of us we were able to order quite a few dishes and trade around-- a practice that the waiter had greatly encouraged when we ordered by saying the dishes were served 'family-style' and meant for sharing
The service is great but the servers try to duck down and run in front of you to serve people in your row and rows ahead of you
The service was great I was a little nervous when we walked in and no one Else was there I had the sweet and Sour chicken and my boyfriend had the Duck My chicken was very tasty as far as the duck the skin was good and crispy but to greasy for the actual meat and would not really recommend that but the egg rolls and sweet and sour sauce were out of this world I can't wait to go back again
Our waitress was very nice and attentive the whole meal
Husband had the Del Ray of course and it kinda grossed me out a bit but he enjoyed it I had a bite and that was enough it was huge so he took half home and enjoyed the rest for breakfast the next day he also ordered a side of beans and they were really good and not your  typical refried beans  they were a white bean with a little cheese on top Yummy
Atmosphere was good greeting from hostess was fair and the waitress was very friendly
Two stars instead of one because the bedding was a clean white duvet cover with matching linens and because the morning front desk staff especially Patricia were friendly and helpful when I had to race back from the rental car center to pick up an important document I'd accidentally left behind in my room
Service aside I would've given the place 5 stars but the food is too good
The service was friendly and attentive and it was so much fun to watch the noodles being made in the kitchen
While he was friendly he was not very prompt in bringing out our drinks and taking our orders
Most of us at the table ordered their eggs benedict which was very good
Everyone was friendly and conversed freely both in the ordering area and at the tables
1/22/08 Update - I went back with friends two weeks ago to find the menu and service greatly improved so I'm upgrading to 4 stars
I was a little iffy ordering sausage as I'm pretty picky about it but it was great
The service has been great even during the lunch rush

I have been here twice so far and the service the first time was attentive
Overall we highly recommend this spa for it's beauty attentiveness by staff services provided and relaxing atmosphere
First we order a appetizer and when it came out it was just cheese melted in a pan now it was good cheese but still just cheese  before we ordered this we asked our waiter what it was and since he barely spoke english and I mean not really at all he could explain what it was
The service - Nice and fun peopleThe chicken - Bigger and juicierThe waffles - Bigger and tastierThe mac & cheese - tastier and cheesierThe stupid fries - Stupid Good and Roscoe's doesn't have it
The place is always busy and the staff is always very friendly but not in an overly friendly obnoxious way
The service is great the prices are very reasonable and the food is awesome
The service has been really good both times I've been the people that bring the food to you have a real smile and when they ask if there is anything else they can get you- they actually stand still long enough to listen to your answer
The beer is excellent the service has always been attentive and the food is above normal bar standardsThe fish and battered fries was very good the tartar sauce is good but ask for the cocktail sauce
The waitress was friendly and attentive
The ambiance is nice clean modern with an ipad on the table to order and a huge projector screen
Service is friendly and waters will constantly be refilled and if it wasn't for the food taking forever each and every time I'd give the service a really high rating
The restaurant was super slow so the service was good
Every time I heard the name Duck & Decanter  I would picture a nice sit-down joint with waiters and pictures of hunting stuff on hunter green walls
My wife ordered the chicken salad and it was very very good
The service was very friendly but I took a long while to get our sandwiches
no relation but it was that and the great service that kept me from giving this place two stars
the MUD PIE my wife and i ordered for desert looked awfully good
Super friendly staff serves a good breakfast at this North Scottsdale deli/bagelry
It's too bad they ended up highly frustrated by the so-called customer service that they were forced to deal with TMobile's over seas telephone technicians
I hadn't been to FEZ for over a year because I had a horrible encounter with the wait staff on a particularly slow Thurdsay night in December
Overall the food was pretty good and the service was as good as the food
We arrived separately after taking incorrect turns in downtown Chandler ordered on three different checks complained about how customer service in this country is lacking on so many levels and then we had breakfast at Yoli's
Friendly and personable service with smiles and helpful can-do attitudes
This place could be 5 stars if the staff wasn't so lax and a little more attentive
Service was good if not abrupt and to the point
Nice enough service but the food is mediocre processed crap served at atrociously exorbitant prices
Not necessarily a very big con but it would be nice if they had some days of early morning staffing
I order a breakfast egg sandwich which was delicious
I ordered the teriyaki chicken didn't think it would be bad I mean who can mess up teriyaki
I prefer to order carry out - sometimes the delivery takes too long when they get busy and you end up with cold pizza which still tastes great and not rubbery like those places that use cheap imitation cheese blends but when you order fresh pizza eating it hot is just sort of an expectation
The service was excellent with a very friendly staff
Atmosphere Very friendly from the staff to clientele
Service is fast and we were in and out in about 40 minutes
Ticoz is very affordable has great food and good customer service
The staff is friendly & I think for the portions quality & freshness the prices are fair
The first time we went was for breakfast but after seeing a corned beef sandwich go by I changed my order

All in all I would say it is a great restaurnant for Scottsdale gringos who have no idea what real southwestern food tastes like and don't care or about freindly service so long as the building is fancy and they can tell their friends they went to the latest trendy spot
They are very attentive and service is quick
ah yes the waiter was a very nice looking man and was super flirty with all of us

The staff was rude and a little condescending to her when she was asking to split a sandwich between her and her son

prices change across similar products by 2-3$ sometimes so feel free to shop around for water bottles and other food staples; the staff running the rides were decent people not creepy which can be the status quo; the ambiance is good not OVERLY ghetto but caution that after 7pm it gets more crowded with high school kids
I then ordered the pesto caprese pasta which was soooo good
Lots of other yummy dishes are served at Wally's such as burgers other pasta dishes salads that looked so good soups and they have daily specials like pork chops which that night came with a salad some sides and dessert

The Manager answered several questions for us on when they show boxing and--since it starts at the top--he exemplified the great service polite and kind servers he has I have to say we initially sat at a high table which--since I'm a Baby Boomer--wasn't my favorite seat and the waitress helped me move my food to a booth when one opened up
Main Course - I ordered the Shrimp Tagliatelle which had a little too much grated Parmesan I know who would have thought you could have too much cheese but other than that the shrimp was cooked perfectly and the portion size was great

As being a a person that deal with customer services on a regular basis with the people health in Goodyear Az I wouldn't think that u would have working at Shell due to your reputation of being one of the best company according to the BBB cashiers that would treat a loyal customer for many years so badly and rudely
The food was great the service was friendly but they forgot to make my food
The manager gave me a business card good for a free meal
I like the atmosphere inside the staff is friendly and helpful and the bathrooms are clean
I mean the whole damn complex looks like it was just built and the DSW is one of the nicer ones I've been in very orderly spacious and filled with brand names like the Florsheim cap-toes with non-torture features they're some kind of sub-brand within Florsheim with all kinds of bouncy cushioning and support to keep your feet from turning into hooves but I'm too lazy to go see what the sub-brand is
Shouldn't they be building more DSW's further out into the desert in order to achieve their goal of growing Greater Phoenix out to the Arizona state line in every direction by 2012

The time before that we had a fairly rude waiter

Even after trying a decent number of other Thai places in Phoenix we like Wild Thaiger for the full bar consistently good flavors great service and fun atmosphere and we will definitely continue to come here often
Boy-o have I've put in some good hours here at The Half Moon particularly because many of my friends-slash-footie-teammates are servers bartenders and managers and insist that we drink their booze whilst we watch them work i suppose
The staff here is friendly enough to put it on any channel you'd like too -- I've had to specially request the Titans game on a few occasions why the fuck doesn't anyone like to watch Tennessee anyway

The food was good and the service issues can be worked out but the concept seems confused
Friendly staff and the restaurant is always clean

Like any other fast food eatery you walk in and order/pay at the counter get your empty cups and a plastic order number sign to place on your table
On the patio for happy hour the service was a little slow but we got everything eventually
To me this says that he knows he gave bad service and still wants a good tip
The service is the real reason this place got a bad review
If the service had been good it would probably have gotten 3 or 4 stars
It was not a roll I would have ever ordered but my dinner guest thought it sounded good and to my surprise it was and at $4
I also had to exchange some stuff at a later date at the customer service counter and this was a fast flawless task
Go with someone that isn't a cadaverous lay and has great taste in dessert delights
They got my order wrong and said that they would try to get it out to me as quickly as possible but waiting another hour wasn't a good option
The poor service has definitely left a bad taste  since I didn't get to eat anything except to drink a plastic glass of water
The bus staff was so good - ours took personal pride in what he did and seemed to sweep by as a shadow to clear empty plates and fill glasses

And we didn't get the great little orange for dessert that we always received before
The service was very good and there are some good specialty drinks that were well made
The staff has been attentive the three times I've been here so I have nothing to complain about
The sound system is usually bumping classic rock and the employees are pierced and tattooed well beyond your typical wait staff but everyone is friendly and service is typically good
Whether the food is good or bad one has to appreciate a place where the owner all-too-conspicuously wanders about the dining area during peak times visiting with the guests monitoring the staff and demonstrating her full control over the operation
Bar service was attentive yet uneventful not energetic and I realize what it's like not to fee like a regular
The restaurant while said to be one of the best provided a meal that I wasn't overly impressed with but again the wait staff were so wonderfully friendly and accommodating the food didn't really matter so much
Either way very good food and I've ordered many times since
The waitstaff is really friendly and knowledgeable
Service was great and plenty of wing flavors to choose from
You get great food great atmosphere good service parking a little bit of a challenge but I live right across the street so I just walk
For dessert a roulade ginger cake with pumpkin mousse was a fitting finale to a great meal
It would have been nice if the waitress had advised us on the portion size and told us ahead of time that there was a $1 charge for splitting a meal
That dipping sauce is so perfect and the cinnamon sugar on the fries makes you feel like you're eating dessert in a good way
I'm giving this place 2 stars because the atmosphere is romantic service was great and the wine was delish

The new location will be bigger in all aspects from the kitchen to the dining room with a nice outdoor patio and will be full-service with a bar
You will receive more charming and personalized service if you go when it is slow morning time after 100 PM but I have never seen him be curt or unfriendly
Part of me was expecting the camera crew to emerge but alas Candid Camera has long since gone away and instead we were having a great moment in Phoenix restaurant service history
The service was slow and the server misheard our friend ordering a half glass even though she repeated it twice and brought out a full glass and charged for it
The wait staff is always nice and quick to bring back the drinks
I've been back there for a second visit and got the same great service again
Service was pretty much on par with any breakfast/diner place
When you order these you also get your choice of breakfast meat including bacon ham or sausage

I may not be a great judge of donuts as generally donuts is one of my least favorite desserts but these were some very good ones
Two For such a busy place I think they do a great job with customer service
Thats like if i went to a fast food resturant ordered fries asked for ketchup and the guy behind the counter just handed me a tomato
The owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous
Their lunch specials are great and there really isn't a whole lot of waiting when you order your food
When I first got my Maxima I would have given them 5 stars as Eric the service guy was great at getting my car in and giving me a loaner if I needed it
No refills on any beverages were offered but other than that the service was good
Between the service the smoke and the drunkenness which is not always a bad thing but in excess too many hammered people around each other in a small bar is not good I wasn't crazy about it
The service given that there was no one else in the restaurant was really slow
Nice waiter not negligent but we waited a long time for everything
The staff at Binkley's was totally on it; paying attention to detail with a personalized Happy Birthday Gabi on our menus and ridiculous in a good way service from Rebecca our waitress and a handful of supporting cast members
-nantucket bay scallops served with gnocchi chorizo corn avocado and confit tomato great choice-amuse bouche #10 - bubblegum and lemon passion fruit lollipops-amuse bouche #11 - strawberry souffle served with a banana creme anglaise-amuse bouche #12 - vanilla whipped cream with a candied mint leaf - oooh; one of our favorites-brown sugar polenta - amazing dessert

From atmosphere to food and service it was a great dining experience
I want to start off by writing that the service was very good and everyone was extremely attentive even with a packed restaurant
More so for their very friendly staff and owner/chef
While I concur with many fellow reviewers that the place did not bowl me over and was a bit pricey I did have great service and good food overall
The specificsSERVICE Prompt friendly suggestive and accomodating
The staff also did a good job of not cross contaminating my bowl with someone elses I've been to places like this before where once your stir fry hits the grill it gets passed around like a lady of the night and you usually don't get back quite what you handed them
okay that last one I made up I ordered the lunch special of Pad C U chicken and it was decent I would have appreciated a little more basil but overall not too bad
There was nothing that could be custom ordered for one and second what they did have wasn't that great
Desserts were pretty limited and  not very good
While the food is good and the service is quick if not a tad over-bearing I think this place needs some tweaks
Gorgeous hardwood floors and wood work through out with a friendly staff that immediately helps you to feel welcome and relaxed
service was fine not exceptional but the staff was friendly enough
I'm looking forward to sitting down being greeted by fresh-faced wait-staff and given a chance to peruse the breakfast offering while sipping my piping hot cup of joe
Needless to say I was noticed so the service was great
I've always come in a large group and they accomodate us cheerfully and the service is always fast and they never forget anyones meal
I went and sat at the bar and ordered the food came out fast was good but service was ok not the best
ProsThe staff was friendly and accommodating
We left no room for dessert but we can vouch for the bar  fantastic cocktails Bitter Bees was a really good one and if you're a white wine drinker either of the albarinos are great but the Licia was a perfect pair with the rich salmon
It is loud - though slightly less so outdoors than in - and the service was pretty good for how crowded it was
Most likely it's due to the staff being very friendly and speedy
However my husband and I were pleasantly pleased with the friendly and very efficient service
The advice I can give most is make sure your car is in GOOD WORKING ORDER
super personable apparently I'm not because I don't recall his name and was really good at explaining the specials happy hour and tempting us with dessert
They had weekly lawn and garden service which was great although it came on Monday mornings and started around 7am so it was hard to sleep in
Our server was friendly polite and right on top of taking and bringing us our drink orders
well besides their~ -the most awesome location you can do dinner and a movie at Norterra -the young and uber friendly and accommodating staff -the fresh with healthy options and delicious food is their Happy Hours from 3pm to 6pm and then again at 9pm till close
The service was great and a majority of the meal was perfect
This is an order at the counter style restaurant so it's nothing fancy but they have a great patio and solid food
Yes I know the staff is eccentric grungy and not super friendly but the prices are good and there is plenty of places to sit and chill kind of like a coffee shop equivalent to a dive/neighborhood bar
But we had great service in Tempe and Sunday happy hour lasts all day
The service was good for a party of 30 and the pizza great
But more importantly for me is that the entire staff was extremely friendly and helpful
Service at the bar is usually prompt but if you are at a table good luck
I had already ordered a tea and breakfast sandwich nothing special there so I had to stick around to finish those up
This is what I would term a fast food made to order restaurant
Service is usally fast and the cost is reasonable
A great counter manager Miguel helped us get on the flight but it was all downhill form there
Friendly staff especially Hostess Judith and the young man with the red hair
The service is sometimes great sometimes average
The service is actually very friendly and frankly the reason I like it is because it's not overbearing
The staff was especially courteous friendly and professional too
Friendly little outdoor/indoor dive with generous and tasty adult beverages Fun staff and yummy Mexican menu
But when I need a bit of South of the Border and can't afford the time nor the $$ a trip to Dos can be a great afternoon away
We already know the burgers are good greasy and cooked to order
We love just ordering Tapas-style easy with all of the yummy appetizers and hanging out for the evening - especially on Wednesdays when Joseph is there to read Taro Cards $20 for 10 minutes and he's REALLY good
The staff was super nice and very knowledgeable about the area
Their service is great and they don't make you feel dumb if you're a beginner or not great at golf
While the food is good the service leaves a lot to be desired
I like lettuce with my bulgogi none to be seen Service was bad missed orders etc
Service is good and the food awesome time to get food not so much
I have to give it to these guys the service was very attentive
The staff consisted of snotty teenage girls who were extremely rude to my mother when she simply asked them to pack the tomatoes for her sandwich separately and they didn't understand
Service was great drinks were fast the food was very flavorful with a nice presentation
I ordered the French Dip and it was really good for $5
Food and service were great but based on the rating scale 3
The owners here are nice and friendly and go out of their way to give great customer service
I've been to the Tempe and Phoenix locations Glendale Ave and both are clean organized with friendly staff
This location was pretty busy during lunch time but the line moved fast and there was still staff walking around making sure everyone's experience was proper
The staff's also very nice and knowledgeable about their products -- my friend bought a bag made from a recycled grain sack and the salesgirl was able to tell her about the history of the product
Service was rather disorganized & the staff was not to attentive
The bartender who served me was good she offered up her personal favorites and recommended other beers based upon the IPA that I ordered and even gave samples without me having to ask for one
You really can't beat the friendly baristas and great customer service at this location
And the staff I cannot say enough good things about them
The customer service is good but the managers there are a little unprofessional
The pizza crust was good but we order sausage and sundried tomatoes and there was hardly any sausage on it and the tomatoes were quite dry
Since we were six ladies enjoying a book club meeting he might not have been too far off but several members of the staff came up later and told us it was nice to see people enjoying themselves and to not worry about it
Our waiter was very good though so I liked the level of service
and I only ordered 1/2 which was a nice option for only $5
I left off one star for the customer service-- they were friendly enough just slooow
I order a salad every time I go and they are great about remembering my order  and the tweaks I make to their salads
They always seem willing to fix any mistakes that I've seen and I think the staff is great
Anyone of these incidents alone is not a big deal but in concert along with a server that kept referring to me as brother and a greeter that calls my wife and I guys I am not stuffy however unearned familiarity along with poor service is a bad combination made for an overall poor experience on a rare night out without the kids
The curry chicken my girlfriend ordered is thinly cut and good quality meat
Apparently what happened was we showed up at the same time that everyone else decided to eat breakfast and the kitchen was slammed with orders
I ordered a cup of pozole to start because it was a little cold outside and a spicy cup of soup sounded good and it did not disappoint
All components of my meal were great and so was the service
The decor is still outdated the service was excellent the food was great
We prefer Bobby in most cases-super nice guy working his way towards medical school-loves to gab and gives EXCELLENT service
When I went here they really loaded up my burrito so I got a lot for my money and everyone was very friendly and provided great service
An amazing restaurant has three basics covered1 customer service 2 great food offerings 3 an overall great experience
Maybe due to the high temperature of the restaurant however with poor customer service and lack of a face in the entrance greeting me with a smile and a friendly greeting it leaves me feeling like you don't want my money and you don't care enough about your customers standing around
There were some problems with the service we had a dirty glass and a bad glass of wine
Great taste decent sized portion - order one if not two
They were good-but after having to wait basically an hour between the appetizer entree and dessert I was just looking forward to getting out of there
Also a cup of broccoli and cheese soup is good sometimes this location seems to water-down the soup and some of the staff seem like tokers
Service Our server was OK pretty and all but she only got nice with a glimmer of any discernible personality until about check time
Our service was fine- nothing friendly he just got us what we needed when we needed it in a very abrupt awkward way
The staff is friendly and just as helpful as I remember during my past visits
Waiter was nice but never really checked back in once we had our food
The service was very sweet and friendly if a bit slow
The service was professional and attentive and the atmosphere calm and welcoming

You can't beat the price the staff is always friendly even if there may be a slight language barrier once in a while it's a clean and well kept establishment and what's even better is that over two years I still see the same faces time and again which lets me know I'll always get the same quality service

Additionally while speaking of my waitress considering the fact that I was obviously interested in the food it would have been nice if she acted more interested in me as a diner - instead she did not inquire even once as to how I enjoyed a dish and asking questions felt more like attempting to drag forth information while she instead spent time describing the menu at length to a needy woman who wanted all her dressing on the side and modifications to myriad dishes

NIce lady that takes our order and keeps things running
The staff was super friendly and uber polite
until they had a family party of 16 to prioritize and service slowed to a crawl

Watery sambar and rasam hard idlis dosas with a miserly amount of potato stuffing gulab jamuns that tasted nothing like gulab jamuns inattentive and too few waiters and disgustingly dirty bathrooms---in my opinion Udupi Cafe missed the mark completely
Overall Great service Comp valet A bit hard to find if your flying down Camelback Quality food
Another general rule is that a waiter starting with a terse o will lead to a bad evening
Lastly the manager not acknowledging an issue and even trying to deflect it indicates that no good will ever come from the dinning experience
I normally don't complain about service unless it's noticeably bad
It took forever just to get a drink order then food order we never got bread even after our server asked and then the food even came out slow

For the luxurious decor and good service I expected grand prices as well but I would say the prices are reasonable
Omelets were good spanish corned beef and spinach/feta were among our orders and filling so we took our bagels smeared with cream cheese to go for eating on the road
Friendly service and a decent deli when you're in Scottsdale
I decided to call the online store only to be treated pretty rudely by the woman on the other line who told me that my order didn't exist and that I was wrong in saying that my credit card had been charged

The service was actually really good and the employees were very friendly

The staff is great there was this young fella that made us feel welcomed and there was this female that was great too in serving us new drinks and asking if anything was alright

the service was nice - gave me a refill on my drink before I even finished my first one
We usually order take out the 2 times I ate at the restaurant service was poor and food was not as good

Suffice to say that the food was great the service was great and we'll be back - often

The service was great too -- our waitress checked up on us several times as did the other wait staff
The staff were attentive and friendly and we started out with the wrapped shrimp appetizers
They also have a pretty good cocktail list-i almost always order a 'one a day' -refreshing cucumber cocktail

Besides that issue the service was slow we watched to employees talk for several minutes before they acknowledged us and when we got our burgers we had to remind them that we needed drinks
Great service and a nice patio to eat topped it off
And because Sonic has sort of a screwy way of ordering I think it slowed down things because people were confused

The desserts are actually listed at the top of the menu so they stand-out - for good reason

Service 5/5 The best I have ever had each person is lightning quick they are super friendly and the food comes out so fast it will make your head spin sometimes
3/5 bbq chicken2/5 fried combination some veggies are good some aren't2/5 thai toast2/5 eggplant2/5 pad thai personal preference though as I dont care peanut sauce2/5 anything with duckThis review is specific to the Camelback location as the Tempe location started out great but lost a cook and multiple employees most likely due to a ego maniacal manager
That local does have an excellent building and decor and for a time identical food just in smaller portions but having two waitress/waiters for lunch rush lead to bad service and the cook change threw off the taste
Maybe it took a while for Chez Vous to find its rhythm but during a busy morning the food came out in a reasonable amount of time and our waitress was very good

The iced tea was good service was acceptable not exceptional but we were not ignored
Lastly they have a good selection of Boba tapioca flavors I personally prefer mango and desserts
Friendly friendly service everytime we go we are greeted by the owner who couldn't get any cuter

Love the setting super friendly staff and great drinks
The produce is great I have never had a problem with the quality or selection; the staff is consistently friendly and I recognize a lot of the same employees working the hours I shop week after week

Doesn't a waitress with 41 years experience have any clout with the management to be empowered to offer compensation to a customer in order to promote great customer service and ensure that the customer comes back as a repeat customer
Before my outbound flight I arrived at the lot early because I really didn't want to suffer from slow service
The service was friendly and the food came quickly so I have to be fair and give them praise for that

affected but welcome to central Phoenix I have never had bad service just a few young men with a tad too much interest in their own coolness
The waiter who had up till this point been very nice and chatty helpful about menu items and generally a pretty cool guy handed me his phone number and told us to call him any time we wanted to go partying

Staff I have always had good experiences
Most of the staff have been college students and while maybe not the most experienced they are friendly and helpful
The owner greeted me took my order and was very friendly to my family
I reserved via OpenTable and wrote a note in the reservation that it was her birthday and specifically requested for there to be a nice dessert to celebrate the occasion; nothing special-made off the menu necessarily just whatever kind of cake they would have that night
Quite frankly our server was great when it came to actual interaction but we were waiting sometimes around 10-15 minutes between courses and the entire dinner service took about 2 hours for appetizer entree and a quick dessert
Moreover I noticed the same table as mentioned before had ordered just before we did and they were getting much faster service and a special request made on the spot while eating their entrees of frites was put in and expedited to them before we actually got served our main meals
The ambiance food and direct interaction with the staff was all really good and we still wound up having a great time helped along by a few glasses of wine but I really can't let it go that two direct requests were essentially ignored along with the feeling that we were not being treated equally to some of the other guests
Particularly I was looking for a place that could provide me with the convenience of ordering a custom good for a very special occasion
For desert we ordered apple chimichangas which were very good but how could you mess up deep fried apples and tortillas dipped in cinammon and sugar
The only  thing good I have to say about this place is that every time I ordered a beer the waitress brought me one immediately and then about 20 minutes later the busboy would bring another out to me thinking I never received the first either way no matter how drunk I got the food never tasted good
The staff was really nice and cheery unlike the zombies at Walmart
the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful and they are not stingy with their samples in fact they encourage you to try it all

Food is nice and all but service is most important
Was the service bad because of the USA/Canada gold medal hockey game
The salon was nice and small and the staff was very friendly
Rude service little to no options for vegetarians overpriced for portion size
You have to order your food up at the front instead of being waited on and even though it was quite busy I still found the staff to be aloof and inattentive
just good service and a good experience all around
I feel terrible having to write this but several of my friends have noted the service here has been rude dismissive I would be exaggerating if I stated that was every experience-I have had nice exchanges but when I start to dread going into a place b/c of an attitude that is bad

I have tried dining in and take out both dinner only and the only reason I don't go 5 stars is the very slow but friendly service
Sometimes like this morning they are on top of it friendly and provide great service
I have never been to a fast food burger place that brings your order to your table along with condiments and asks if you need anything else
Nothing was wilted there was great attentive service and we were tucked around the corner out of their view
Each order of a sandwich comes with a nice sized cookie so if the sandwich doesn't fill you up the cookie will
We all enjoyed our food and the truffle Mac & cheese was super good but the service was ridiculously slow considering the place was almost empty and spending $75 for lunch for 4 was a little more than I like to spend for lunch
Finally service is great another hard find in Phoenix
So in short this place is great for lunch and can't speak about how the service is any other time
The staff is good at explaining portion sizes and the menu if you just don't get the concept
I explained to him that I was in the food service industry and I had had Cambodian food and Vietnamese food in NYC a million times and this spring roll had gone bad

When I came to pick it up on Saturday the manager was also friendly and said that everything just got out of the oven
My office building is close to downtown Tempe so Hanny's is a bit out of the way and if you drive instead of take the light rail the parking and driving in downtown Phoenix is an adventure unto itself but if you get there before noon and walk in you are greeted by a world of dark leather tones gently playing classical music and a lack of artificial lighting so prevalent in our modern workplace and waitstaff that know how to be efficient and helpful and not overly intrusive I distinctly remember that the waiter did not feel the need to come over every five minutes and ask how things were going but instead quietly came around and refilled drinks which I greatly appreciated
I cannot say enough how friendly the staff  is and how amazing it is that they are dog-friendly

You usually have little to no warning when the mix goes bad but it took about 10 minutes for the waitress to get me a new drink
Our waitress was nice even though she was completely overwhelmed but a couple of the other servers looked downright pissed off and mean
But save room for dessert in fact- this is so good you might just want to start with it They have in house made beignets with three kinds of dipping sauce

The service was friendly attentive and fast
They were really nice to us and the service was excellent but that may be due to the fact that there were no other customers
They have a nice selection of tasty looking pastries as well but you will be so full you'll want to get your dessert to go
Here's the thing either you need to have excellent customer service or excellent food because that way people can rationalize well their service is bad but they have amazing food  or vice versa
The waitress was attentive when it came to ordering our food but after the fod came out she never stopped by to refill my water
Nothing makes me more grumpy than bad food that doesn't even have the mustard/mayo you ordered on it

I was greeted by a nice young lady behind the counter who too my order
Excellent service beautiful presentation and a menu you just can't decide on because there are so many great choices
Treating employees poorly results in poor service it's probably why some of them were in such bad moods

The service was slow to get to us but once it did it was good
The cheesesteak was ordered with mushrooms and was full of cheesy-oniony-peppery goodness but I think I preferred the veg turkey sandwich for its simplicity
The Verdict  Bearing in mind my obvious predilection to breakfast sweets over breakfast savories and the fact that I'd been told all the Bay Area's recipes had been ported over faithfully I had no doubts that walking into Dottie's Scottsdale that I would like the food; what surprised me most was how much I enjoyed the scene and the service - both equally well carried over from San Francisco
I would have expected this service at Taco Bell and quite honestly I wish I had gone to Taco Bell as what I ordered wasn't as good as what I could get at the fast food restaurant
The waiter comes out overly friendly with phoney smile as others on the staff
I like that this location has plenty of parking enough space to hang out and do some work and fast service
The service was attentive and judging from the amount of take out orders this place has a growing and well deserved following in the neighborhood
I'm glad that I donated it to a place where she can't get her hands on my things---The owner most likely sends her staff to Goodwill to stock her store
Down the hill is Elements bar and restaurant with great views and exceptional service
My husband ordered the borrachita tacos which were wrapped in a crispy tortilla and were also incredible and nice and spicy
Maybe a bad day or service I don't really think so just trying to make a buck with some leftovers likely

They have all sorts of cool new services like the Benefit bar where they do great eyebrow shaping for a very reasonable price

griddle cakes were a bit underdone and waffle was soft and tasteless  treue belgin waffle should be crispy and light inside the place was packed with trendys service was hap hazzard at best   eggs came a good 5 min before the waffle i believe there are much better breakfast options in town and less expensive
Despite the fact the service was extremely slow and our server didn't put in half of our food in till 20 minutes later of asking us what we wanted

Some recommendations  Moma's Pancake Breakfast ~ You get three buttermilk pancakes two eggs cooked to order with your choice of any fruit topping or syrup
Another recommendation is their Grandpa's Country Fried Breakfast ~ You get two Eggs cooked to order with grits gravy and buttermilk biscuits oh ya and get their  Apple Butter to go with the biscuits
They are consistent  with their execution in preparing their breakfast dishes and their services is very good
It was nice to see staff from the other locations making the move out here
Our waiter was really nice but the poor guy seemed completely overworked -- I think they only had one waiter for the entire restaurant and patio

I have been a frequent goer to this restaurant while living in the city and while the food and drinks are great the service is absolutely terrible
What is a huge turn off of all is knowing that after scrolling through these reviews 1 out 5 customers are very unhappy with the service provided and almost all have the same context servers and waitstaff are rude
I am pleading out to the owner of Hanny's For the sake of you're great restaurant please hire new management and waitstaff they are making you look horrible

She then came back for our drink order and seemed greatly put-out by our request for water with our coffees
I've dined here a few times before for dinner and experienced very good food and excellent service and this first time lunch experience was no different
The dressing could have had a bit more bite to it  like a good blast of fresh anchovies but overall a caesar I would order again
The food is quite good but what really stands out in my mind is the excellent but not overbearing service
Ran by nice people with decent service when it's not slow you're sure to get a taste of the classic New York deli right here in Tempe

The best part about Fresheezy is the friendly and helpful staff
The staff was friendly and very helpful
- While several of the waitstaff/barstaff have been extremely friendly professional and courteous others still exuded the typical AZ88 holier-than-thou attitude
I don't think any place can afford to lose business over bad service these days so they better figure out what to do with those bad apples
Service here was good and John C had a bloody mary and some quesadias
The staff is young and doesn't  seem to know how sit-down breakfast works
A quick fix would be to take the owners and waitstaff across the street to I-HOP for breakfast so they could see what they should be doing
All the staff has the Alice Eyes which I though was kinda cool our waiter was very nice and friendly when we got to Copperstown I checked in on Facebook and got 10% off our bill which I thought was pretty cool too
I ordered the Gonzo's BBQ Beef which is beef brisket that had been slow smoked all day then shredded & tossed with bbq sauce and the sides were the nightmare chili and fries
But the beef tasted so dang good; I just asked the waiter for more bbq sauce and got messy
Over all my experience at Cooperstown was enjoyable was watching the NBA playoffs on all the screens except 2 screens had the Diamondback game on the staff was friendly and fun and that right their makes a place Great
We ate inside that first time and there was only one person on duty so the service was slow but as we were not in a hurry it didn't matter
Most of the staff here have good customer service skills and I even see the manager busting his butt busing tables refilling glasses seating people and expediting food leadership by example
Ok food was actually good but one star for one of the worst customer service experiences I have ever had
The atmosphere was really nice and the service was great
Our waiter was attentive and did a great job of recommending certain dishes and describing what was in them

Thank you Little Sicily for providing good service and a great pizza at a fair price
I like good service as much as the next person but sometimes you need a do not disturb sign at the table--so you can have a little time to enjoy the meal
Everyone from the guy who answered the phone to take the reservation to the hostess to the server were very friendly and offered excellent customer service

I was looking for great food service and a cool vibe
Great location great atmosphere service was fantastic from the moment we stepped in the door

But the manager and helper we chatted with at the end were so nice it balanced off the negative
The service is very friendly but my menu was wet and smelled like someone had tossed their cookies right on it
This experience is not the first from Tomo just the culmination of a few years of bad service
Lukewarm is also a good adjective for the service we were a very easy going group but our presence seemed to annoy our waitress
That gave me a good excuse to order another one
Service was very good the girl was very nice and kept my glass full of some delicious ice tea
The service here was exceptional and our waiter was soooo nice

The service we received was friendly and the iced tea that they were brewing today I forgot to see what it was was really good
All the food they were bringing out looked really good and I'm sure that next semester I'll be ordering quite a lot of it
I highly recommend this company from the service to the professional appearance it was a great experience
My waitress Brit was outgoing and very prompt with my orders If you want great sushi at an awesome price you should give it a try
Cute place great service excellent food and local
That is one of my favorite desserts and turning that into drinkable goodness I was very happy
The service was on point and the food was great as well
I showed up today at 3pm after lunch rush and before dinner rush and there was no wait at all service was good and food was as awesome as expected
Had it not been for the nice service I'd probably give 2 stars but as the saying goes - kill em with kindness
2  Service  Everyone we met was attentive and receptive
first we got seated and then didn't see a waiter for a good 10 minutes--she then asks if we would like a drink--I ask her a question about a wine--she says she doesn't know--that she knows more about the reds than the whites--I had to ask her to go ask my question to the bartender--instead of coming back to our table--and answering my question--she goes off to another table and takes their order--so we got off to a pretty rocky start
As i said to my friend who I was dining with--the problem is in Phoenix with all the great restaurants with wonderful service--it is hard to spend that dining dollar on anything except great food and great service
Service is okay not as fast as Subway or Jimmy John's
The front staff and assistants are very nice and very awesome and all the reviews here complimenting Dr
The service was good quick and friendly
In a world of burgers are burgers this place sets itself apart from the rest with quality ingredients very good service and a friendly atmosphere
When we ordered our meals the waitress advised us to give her a heads up early if we wanted the chocolate souffle like any good souflle it takes a half hour to bake
Another complaint is how snobby and rude the staff are
I'm still not wowed by the food - baked brie and the chips w/Killarney Sauce are the only two items I will order because they are both really good
I've always had fast service and even though it does get crowded at night I never feel super cramped
Bar service inside is fast for me but that's probably because some of the bartenders recognize me from how much I frequent Rula Bula
Setting  Nice place feels very much like south of the border
Service  Very nice waiter very helpful
There was some appetizers all are good for sharing or small plates if you want to order a few for dinner for yourself
We had a friends birthday party there and they did a great job accommodating everyone and our orders
Every time I've gone in the bartenders remember my drink food order or what I really liked from last time and always are so warm and welcoming along with great service
The food was pretty good but the service left a lot of room for improvement
The wine was 40 bucks for a carafe  maybe if we would have got a 100 dollar bottle we would have gotten better service  The Dessert was good it was a rich chocolate cake with nuts and chocolate sauce
Hyatt Gainey staff is also rude for the most part
In fact the service ranks so far down on the bad scale it can't be measured
Service was good it was way too loud and way too dark
Perhaps because the staff were so great - the owner would always greet us on Wednesday nights and participate in karaoke with a pretty solid rendition of Walking in Memphis
The mngr was rude when I informed him I got the wrong order and wouldn't fix it because I had left the drive thru
It's not stuffy or pretentious at all; the waiter was friendly and outgoing as was the executive chef who served us our bread and checked in a couple times throughout the meal
I think because we ordered so little the waitress considered us a waste as far as her tips were concerned and therefore seemed not so friendly
Clean and bright area fast and friendly service comfortable and spacious seating
- Service was goodThe main street itself was dead that night but this place was hopping
The staff is not only friendly but also very passionate about the food they prepare and serve
Slow service mediocore food and I wish we had gone to Dennys
When we tried to express our concerns about the poor fit of the bras they were giving her to try on the 2 staff that were present were unresponsive to our concerns and rude

Has service staff who are nice but unable/unwilling to do much
Love the food but the last few times the service has been pretty slow
when we left the clueless manager was sitting on her butt at the barsmiling and waving goodbyelike she thought everything was a o
One bartender-slash-waiter in partcular can be a bit grumpy and extremely slow but somehow even that's just becomes a part of the laid back vibe of the experience
The staff was very attentive and courteous
The service was great and there salsa was amazing
The staff is beyond friendly even remembering me on just my second trip there
Only negative our waitress was slow on refills
Points for amazing food battered fries staff friendly and brew
The service was VERY friendly and efficient
I recommend being patient ordering a cheese plate and sitting at the bar and asking advice on their wine - they have a great selection
Service was good not great pacing of the courses was a bit irregular
Our waitress didn't come by very often and the service was pretty slow
Great food and the service is even better
You know your salon you know your techs and how long it will take them to do a service as well as how many people are in front of me so it would have been nice to have gotten a expected wait time before I wasted an hour my time
And the service was friendly and efficient
Lunch was busy the first time I was here so the service was much slower but that was OK
Made to order sandwiches on fresh breads with a crunchy pickle slice and small candy; nice wine selection with helpful wine staff
No major complaints about food but service was just ok food portions were tiny which isn't all bad because that's why most of us are fat but $300 for two people
Every single visit is a great experience; the staff is fast and friendly the sushi chefs are artists of their craft and the food is amazing
The food is good but uninspired the service is awful as others have mentioned  the kid behind the bar was too busy talking to the other servers rather than attending to customers
The service and follow up was great we changed the time and the number of people a few times but Kelly always handled it very well
The service was great and so was the food - everyone seemed very pleased with the selection some vegetarians and timing of the meals - sometimes in a large group the food doesn't come out together but this wasn't an issue
Regarding pizza I have tried the Sausage pizza excellent - with a great spicey sausage - very simple but delicious the Ricotta/Arugula pizza I forget their name for it - but it is really good - I've ordered it twice
You have about a 50/50 chance of having a good service experience
My brother and I went there and had a horrible server - my brother even wrote the manager to complain which meant it was pretty bad
The guy was good at the actual service part - refilling our drinks etc
But I've gone there twice and got excellent friendly service
I ordered a sushi sampler with a spicy tuna roll and it was very good
My wife had ordered the Goodyear roll and it was amazing
Cute little restaurant in Bicycle Plaza clean service is ok- pretty good for an Asian restaurant
The cake had 6 or 8 1/2 oreos on a large rectangle cake and big block letters with the message with one of letters visibly corrected so it looked like a brown lump with sparse cookies and ugly lettering- no nice borders around edges like in the pictures online
The manager was not on site and took it 2 days for me to call to reach her; the staff is nice and the kids on staff redecorated a little better and manager was apologetic
They offer excellent service fast and friendly waiters and waitresses can you still say that or are they really just waitpeople now
The service was good and we don't really have any complaints
Food is pretty good but the staff is absolutely awful
Great food fast efficient and friendly service and an air of romance
Service is fair enough drinks are good but still not exceptional
Quickly I will give a recommended first trip order and then give details about what I love about this placeDrink Any Arizona Stronghold wine I really like their reds - Dala specificlyApp Meatball trio in Vodka Sauce - it didn't sound good to me either and then I tasted it WOW
Dessert - I know Italian resturants should have a good cannoli and this place does I am usually so stuffed from my dinner we never order it
Delicious food friendly service and a comforting atmosphere
They were super quick phone in to ready for pick up in 20 minutes and the service was friendly
Although the staff is very friendly seemed to be on a first name basis with most of the people who came in and of course makes great food
Service is friendly and hey they hand you a chocolate chip cookie when you check in - so what's not to love about that
The only thing keeping me from a 5 star review is the service during lunch can be a bit slow
We ordered the Anitpaso Italiano to start which was very good but a really tiny plate for the price
The service was painfully slow for everything even after the bigger parties had cleared out
Good thing too because we were not offered dessert
We got up to leave not a fast moving group and there was not any staff waitress hostess bartender who said goodbye thank you have a good night
The staff was all very friendly and our service was prompt and pretty efficient
We did not order any alcoholic beverages so I cannot comment on those but from the looks of the drink menu and all of the people around us ordering drinks they seem to be pretty good
The waitress' were very nice to us and made our experiences enjoyable
The rooms were very clean staff was great breakfast was always awesome I only had dinner once or twice and it wasn't too bad
I have never had to wait for a table at this location and the service is always great
I really can't say enough great things about the bartenders and their excellent service
The staff attentive staff enough to know when you need something and when to leave you alone to watch the game
In the middle is the hostess desk who probably took the road less traveled by so I meandered into the dining room where I was I greeted by a friendly female waitress who helped me find my way to a table and later brought the menus
Everyone else loved their dishes and the service was quick but attentive
Too bad fried foods can also trigger inflammation in blood vessels among other symptoms of chronic inflammatory disorders/diseases
The service is great and consistent as well something that is a hard find these days
The yogurts good the topping selection is better and more consistent and the staff is as friendly as can be
The service was great and everyone is very friendly
The ingredients were good the dressing above average and the staff was friendly however one of the main ingredients of a good sub is the roll itself
Ordered me a plate of bruschetta and call it good
Service was good since our server seemed like she had an eye out for our glasses - more wine more water- Bam
Bar service can be slow on any busy night and they dont often visit the tables so you stand at tthe bar behind the regulars trying to squeeze in
The first time I ever went to this restaurant our waitress knew EVERY SINGLE INGREDIENT to that burrito and was extremely friendly
Well the service to start with was OK not great not bad just OK the salads were ehh way to much vinegar in the dressing then we got our entrees I got Gnocchi which was a childhood favorite of mine Grandpa amazing cook and my wife got the Lasagna my first bite of mine all I could taste was salt just heavy salt in the sauce and my wife could not stand her dish either she couldn't put a finger on why just did not enjoy and only ate half
The service was great our server was really cool and helpful
Since the potato's were like eating a badly seasoned douche bag the waitress took them back and we ordered a dessert instead
I ordered a gyro and it was very good
The food is average in my opinion the service slow & rude
The staff is ultra-friendly and courteous the food is great and the atmosphere is awesome
Service was uber slow and our blond waitress was a little ditzy
I haven't purchased services from the salon at Ulta but I know that there are often good deals
They also have good service and a cute little patio
When the waiter who was friendly took our order and our food arrived about 20 minutes later
My waitress was very friendly and thoughtful
the service was down-home and friendly and it was filled with regulars
It's very no fuss it's set up like a fast food place you look at the menu on the wall then order from the person behind the window
Service is normally quite good and they also feature great local musicians on the weekends like Walt Richardson
Some girl then told me that I had to say it when I ordered then rudely banged around some things by the sink and acted as if she was doing me a favor
Nothing strikingly good or bad about this Tex-Mex placeService is very slow - took us 1
I've never had service this good at a restaurant other than at Cafe Poca Cosa in Tucson
While the food was pretty good better than average it was the small town feel the friendliness of the staff and the old-time decor that drew us in
The service started off great from our waitress and then it just went down hill
I have never stayed anywhere else that had customer service that was timely helpful positive and friendly
Oh and the service on the patio bar was too slow
I ordered the 10oz filet which really was melt in your mouth goodness
The service was tremendous and friendly and we got right in and the food service was quick
I think his conversation and service was one of the reasons we had such a great time
Also the service was very attentive when my dad went to the bathroom the server came over and refolded his napkin
When the person taking your order is grumpy maybe a little bitchy even no matter how good the food is it may never live up to it's full potential
I ordered the Mongolian Beef with brown rice-- my very favorite and it didn't taste very good
The service can be slow and at times lackadaisical - on other nights the waiters are attentive and blazingly fast
The service has been very friendly and efficient and the food just keeps getting better
You will receive UNMATCHED service here - I was so impressed with how empathetic and attentive my server was
She wished me Happy Bday after our service in the *parking lot* and stayed a little later to make sure my party was satisfied half way through the dinner she said she had to leave and the server they switched us with was a young girl with attitude but she ended up staying to make sure we were content once we told her the new server had a firey disposition Five Stars Amy - thank you for adding to such a great day
The atmosphere is pretty cozy and the staff was very friendly
I've had so many bad experiences with chicken at Mexican dives that I've pretty much stopped ordering it but El Bravo will be my exception
The front desk staff and assistants are AMAZING very friendly and helpful
Then the faux tribute for all the great service
The staff really friendly and helpful I ordered a beer off a list of beer I have never had before I went with a Karlovacko it's the house lager I really enjoyed it had to order another
I ordered a pecan pie for dessert and it was okay but not super great but it was warmed and had plenty of pecans
I've never experienced good service while I was there either
I failed to mention  that the staff is also very attentive and knows my name
We had sake bombers which were great as always and a what we thought was complimentary four square check in edamame appetizer and then ordered the calamari
In general the food wasn't bad but it wasn't great and ditto for the service
I would give this place 5 stars because I love the chorizo breakfast so much but the service here is not always 5 stars
I have come to expect bad service and I somehow always come out very pleased sorry if that sounds bad but I love the chorizo at this place
Tom Ka Gai is a warming communal ritual and helps smooth over slow Fri & Sat nite service
Service is fast there's not that much variety but some worth mentioned Squid Salad and Shrimp Tempura Roll
It sure was nice to see the assistant manager out on the floor
We didn't try food here but found others ordering small pizzas that looked pretty good
We ordered the grilled asparagus for starters and it was very nice
One more thing I though the service was great
It's the waitresses with tight shirts serving old white construction workers and good ol boys who ogle the girls who are not that pretty considering this is a college town
Also the building it is located in is a shoddy trailer park looking place that is sort of vintage but not in that good vintage kind of way like diners I have been to in Flagstaff and out in the California desert
The food is pretty good; service is awful
The staff was friendly and the service was good and quick
'12 and have lost 50 lbs its not a miracle program though you have to do the work and its not always easy They also have a ton of other goods and services available
He was very nice and apologetic about his service
Food - 4/5Papaya salad was fresh but the fish sauce was a little too strongFried rice was good with pineapple bits Pad see ew was good not too oily They ran out of thai iced coffee 0/5Thai iced tea was greatCleanliness 5/5I will be coming back for the great service and food
The service was not notably friendly but it was fast and efficient and there was almost always a server within earshot if we needed something
My wife contacted the manager who showed genuine concern and was nice enough to issue us a gift certificate of a surprisingly significant denomination sufficient for a few trips back to the drive through
My fiance and I ordered a lot of food without realizing how much food we actually order so I was great for left overs the next day
The portions are great and not claim jumper large the quality is great and the service was awesome as well
5 stars as although the food and the company were great the service was a little off
As to what other people saying that the service being slow I would tend to agree but of all the several times that I have been there the place has been understaffed and the staff I felt as though did extremely well with what they had to work with so I will not knock them for that
The atmosphere is definitely what makes this place so great and the staff is always friendly and accommodating
The service was friendly and the prices were quite reasonable especially the $3 mimosas
The staff was friendly they actually SMILED
Great place for families and friends to sit down enjoy food and have a complementary cookie for dessert
The ambiance service and food are as good as ever
Our waitress was super friendly and seem very knowledgable
and that on a busy evening service isn't necessarily a good thing
Customer service was awful unhelpful rude and uncaring
I just have to add that the owners here really know the definition of good customer service
Their is a waitress Sarah who just left who is unbelievably delightful and friendly
Also the boy who took my order at the  20th and Camelback store was quite rude
BTW  Pei Wei if you want customers to feel welcomed you might want to great them  and take their orders instead of sitting  and talking
The service was horrible and slow we had to chase down our server for our check and had to wait about 45 minutes for 1 burger and 3 salads I'm guessing they had to butcher the cow in back or had to wait for the lettuce to grow
Staff is friendly and welcoming both in the shop and out on the course
The staff are super friendly overall it was a great expierence
There are some cute typos on the menu I think that is mark of authenticity as is the waitress' not-so-great English
The service was a bit on the slow side for my taste but our waiter Oscarito is what they call him was way cool and very helpful
It was different and interesting but sometimes you just want to enjoy a good dessert and this wasn't it
All in all I might go back and try a regular pepperoni pizza and a different dessert IF I had a good coupon or they were having a special deal of some kind
To me great staff=repeat business period
their food is actually pretty good which is why I let the horrible service slide a few times
Very friendly staff that's always willing to assist
Psst-- Wait staff is attentive as well as handsome
The selection is wonderful the prices are incredible and the staff is confident and friendly
I won't be back as the service was beyond slow and they were NOT that busy to justify it
The wait staff was very attentive to us and while the food took a while to put together our server still kept coming by our table while we waited to see if we wanted anything in the meantime
I've been 3 times in the last 6 months with out of town business visitors and co-workers and each time it's just okay but the service is usually slow even when it's not busy
The waitress was great - as soon as I ordered cheese on my grits she segued into asking if we wanted cheese in our eggs - smart cookie that one
Also I have always found the service to be friendly and attentive
3 stars for good food quality and fair prices but with poor game selection and service
The bartender and waitress were both really friendly and I liked my wine
We decided there were too many items on the menu that sounded good so we ordered 3 more items all to share
With service as sweet as can be and hefty portions of what I call down home goodness it doesn't get much better than this
Our waitress was friendly and attentive
The service is great everyone is friendly
Oh yeah - the staff were so friendly and funny
They're the only location with consistently good flavors portions and service
We ordered the Sashimi plate for dinner and it was a great size 16 pieces with good quality fish
When the weather gets nicer we will have to make one tough decision--enjoy the patio or the company of the lovely staff inside
extra friendly staff my waitress did a rhyme and dance when i ordered the wolfpack breakfast
Bader and her staff provide outstanding service and professionalism
The staff are always friendly and genuinely helpful
The service was also great everyone was so friendly
In fact this place would probably get four stars for the food beer selection & tvs except that the service is just so rediculously bad it ruins everything
I hate people that tell isolated stories about their one experience with shitty service at a restaurant and make it all one sided like they are not ass holes but I have this great story I gotta tell about this place and yes I hate myself for it so fuck off
The bartender acknowledges my beer order and at that moment a waitress comes in from outside and tells the bartender that she just doesn't have time for table #xx outside and if he could go get their order that would be great
As we're about finished the waitress actually has the gonads to come up to our table all sweet and nice and ask us if we'd like anything else
Service is usually greatalot of the servers have been there at least 5 yrs & managementtoo
This is a good thing because you can be pretty sure it's authentic no matter what you order
Location-wise it's not in a great area but serviceable
Our waitress was super perky and friendly
Serves was friendly but not quite the waitress type service you get from Eliana's
We ordered off their happy hour menu - it's nice to find a happy hour that lasts until 7pm
Overall good happy hour prices friendly and attentive service despite being crowded nice atmosphere and I like that they have live music
Excruciatingly slow service even for a Sunday morning
But best carne asada this side of the border is a stretch though it is certainly very good considering the price
I almost dropped my review to 4 stars because service was a little slow but then something occurred to me
The service might have been a little slow one person waiting on 5 or 6 tables and taking care of the take out orders but our server was extremely courteous
the staff is super personable and always chatty and friendly
The staff and venue were good thoughso I'll give it an extra star as drunk jackasses shouldn't bring down the reviewespecially since they did look out for me being a solo flier that evening
Tea Infusion combines good service a pleasant atmosphere the BIGGEST selection of tea falvors I've ever been offered delectable desserts and an overall happy feeling
foods is good but not good enough to put up with attitude from staff
Caserta and his staff have ALWAYS been nice and polite
waiter was great we did a similar tasting menu just with bigger portions of those items just an FYI
Every single visit all food all drinks service always good
The BAD part of the dinner was dessert
We ordered a large slice of chocolate cake that was bad enough that we should have complained
I love the relaxed atmosphere and the friendly staff
Service is fast and good and I have never had to wait for a table
The staff is so incredibly kind and friendly
Wait staff was very nice and explained that the fish flys in fresh daily and went into detail of the dishes we were going to order
I've never had bad service and I always love the food
The staff is very attentive no matter how busy they are and the Owners Myra and Joe take the time to talk to every table and or bar patron
The bar had good service friendly bartenders moderate drinks and prices
The staff greeted us in a friendly manner and the premises were very clean
I thought the service was a little slow but that's only because we were in a rush
I went to this Quizno's today and for the second time in a row I went there a couple of weeks ago the service was just bad
Clean rooms with comfortable bedsFree breakfast each morningPool and hot tubExercise roomFree wifi in all roomsBusiness office to use for freeFree use of a terrific local health clubFree cookies and candy in the lobbyOn site guest laundryNew LG flat screen tv in roomNice bathrooms with super hot waterVery friendly and helpful staffConveniently located and not too far from Phoenix Scottsdale and Gilbert
After getting our drinks we ordered our food and  that's where the good feelings quickly changed
While the pizza itself was good the service was by far the worst I have ever experienced
The manager/owner was nice enough to follow up with me after my last review and let me know they had addressed some of my concerns so my son and I gave it another go
Good fries good view of several TVs with all the NFL games good service and very good prices for an NFL Sunday afternoon
The service at Vincent's is professional and friendly if not always the most prompt while the dining room is Old World elegant think French Cottage dishes and a player piano
Andreoli's has a nice selection of meats desserts and other tasty looking treats for sale in their store and a variety filled menu full of Italian dishes
Above average food friendly service and a great ambience gives Andreoli's a well deserved five stars
But it's cheap and service is good and worth a stop just to experience the Man v Food tour
I guess bistro is like code for snotty bartender overpriced drinks slow service and B at best mexican food
Imagine this a swanky new Scottsdale restaurant that has down to earth prices fantastic food and attentive top-notch service
Service was prompt the outside patio area was great and the vibe is awesome
Everything tastes the same from one location to another no one item on the menu stands out as good OR bad the help is trained in standard service techniques which bar the display of any real personality and so on
The staff is always great and they are so knowledgeable
Service is slow and it seems to be a bit disorganized
The food is worth the wait and the service staff albeit a bit harried is so friendly especially if you're friendly to serve
It is usually when it is a small party that I have had slower service
Not only a wonderful studio with great equipment but truly amazing staff
It was so good that I forgot that I had ordered the healthy option
My party received immediate and friendly service even though we oscillated between sitting outside at a table or at the bar we opted for the bar because it was the quietest place inside
I've been taking my toddler here for the past year and think that the office staff and nurses are great
The service was great friendly and attentive and the food delicious
The woman who took my order was very charming and friendly
Their food is very good and reasonably priced and always cooked fresh upon your order
Also if you haven't had this type of food before this is a great intro to it and unless it is very busy the staff will offer you a sample
well maybe they ripped some random pages from a book and started writing - it make sense no  Service was great our waiter was kicking butt and kung paoing along the way -- whatever that means - Enjoy
I ordered pankcakes my fiance ordered breakfast tacos we both got cappuccinos
The staff are friendly and helpful and make excellent suggestions thanks for the zinfandel tip
After it was all said and done it was sent via email that they will not budge on their pricing and basically that they are too good at what they do for our services/budget
Great fresh burgers cooked when you order it
Wouldn't give this place a second chance but the staff was friendly to say the least
Staff is often quite nice though cleanliness can be an issue at times
Our waitress was nice but not attentive
A few minutes later an extremely rude waitress not ours passed our table threw the receipt book across the table and gave us a dirty look
Service is good and the environment and decor can't be beat
The staff during the day is friendly and your food order is called out within 10 minutes or less after you order
They have a lot of beer on tap but it is almost not worth it just for the slow service  I know other reviewers had no problem with service but our server messed up our beer orders twice and was not quick about it maybe she was having an off night and the Snottsdale crowd
If you are looking for an impressive selection of beer show up to the Yard House  for happy hour order a good beer or two and then head on over to Papago Brewing for the rest of the night
The waitress seemed happy to have people ordering more than just coffee and was pretty attentive especially for a diner
The atmosphere is wonderfully festive much nicer than you'd expect from the outside and the service is prompt and friendly
There were just a couple of tables but the service was very slow
Really yummy food extremely friendly and cool staff and great portions for the price
My friend does not drink but I ordered the Rasperry Fruit Punch a very good drink made from Raspberry Wine with Fruit Punch
Their staff is friendly clean and if there is a line inside the cashier has the ability to assist multiple people at once
Overall good pricing atmosphere was ok service wasn't too bad
After a couple more hiccups with the paperwork and another issue with my turned in leased car I called to complain to the head manager Johnny Lemke- what a jerk very rude to me and basically said it wasnt his problem and if I didnt get anything in writing they won't honor it
Good thing we didn't stick around for dessert
All of the staff was extremely attentive and helpful
The Oriental Noodle Salad their version of cold sesame noodles was also good; I managed to finish it even after I had consumed the large sandwich I had ordered
Good setup with the tvs but factoring in the below average food and the some of the most horrendous service I have ever experienced make Fox Sports Grill a place I wouldnt recommend to my own worst enemy
A friend of mine ordered a nice looseleaf white tea which was okay I guess
Service is always quick and friendly and Sauce is not to hard on the wallet either
Every time I've been here and it's only ever been for lunch service is slow servers seem confused and too busy even though there are dozens of them on staff there have been poor explanations of the dishes food was served barely warm and of mediocre taste
I've actually been to some restaurants where service wasn't that most likely because of the notoriety of Asians as being bad tippers
Our server came and took our orders promptly was kind about waiting for my mother and aunt to decide what they wanted to drink water which again doesn't scream of good tips and eat
cherry limeade was tasty and dessert was tastyservice great
The vibe was kind of like a Boston dive in Central Square but with the indie-hippster Phoenix flare and the service was great
This is a fun causal place with good food and friendly service
Good place for lunch large fast service good prices and good food
It was just okay -- the food was good but I've had better service at soup kitchens
I'm not the sort of person that minds waiting for good food but I at least appreciate status updates and attention from the wait staff in the mean time
The service food and atmosphere were great
My tip for fellow yelpers east of the Mississippi river where good masa is hard to find go ahead and order a dozen tamales packed cold for your carry on bag--even a five hour flight gets them into the freezer to stay great tasting for months
They have bar snacks which are actually tapas smaller sized portions of some of their main dishes so it was great to be able to order several of these and share them - and they were really reasonably priced too
Extremely friendly and helpful staff comfortable clean environment in which to peruse your books to your heart's content
Mom's tried and liked the meatballs here they're OK and the fettucine alfredos I'd ordered were good  when I craved for the dish a couple of times- I needed something quick and didn't have a way to check out other options
Service began slow which my wife and I don't mind because we actually enjoy a less rushed meal
Well organized amazing hours well lit friendly staff
Staff was very friendly and that bumped it up from 3 stars to 4
Waiter was initally friendly and accessible and helped us out w/ deciding how  many small plates to order between the two of us
Combined with the bad service and poor quality of food I will not be returning to this restaurant and will make sure to inform all of my friends family and coworkers not to bother wasting their time
Our entire check with iced tea that was never empty was around $22--an excellent bargain for a good vegan meal in a nice atmosphere with great service
The food took a while to come out and there were no seats left inside so we had to sit outside but the owner/manager was super nice offering to re-seat us inside when tables became available and to bring us our food when it was ready
Plus it's affordable and has a super-friendly staff
Service has always been great and food is very good and reasonably priced
First let me compliment the friendly and helpful staff they were very welcoming
Service at lunch was very fast although our service was a little underwhelming
Luckily our waitress was very nice once we got seated and was more than accommodating when we paid to run seven credit cards
We did however have one of the nicest waitresses ever; I believe her name was Stephanie
The waiter was friendly and gave his opinions on what we should get
So dear waitress we are good tippers even for unspecial service but never never for complete disregard for any customer service
The service was attentive throughout and I appreciated them bringing an ice bucket for our Sonoma Cutrer wine without having to ask
An experience I wanted to share a service that is right to the point attentive but not intrusive not stuffy at all relax and professional
The hostess or manager not sure who she was but nonetheless lending a hand was very gracious in accommodating a prompt removal of these sushi abortions and supplying additional tuna and spicy tuna rolls which were both VERY good
I am hard-pressed to believe that a better ravioli cannot be found in Phoenix - there are just way too many good culinary adventures in the area to consider these bland oversauced pillows of flavorless ricotta worth ordering
If you want to buy some good wine - there are several good wine stores like AZ Wine for example around the valley with knowlegable staff to help you out
GOOD RECOMMENDATION from our waiter Capn Jack Sparrow thanks
Good Food - Good Service - Good Ambiance
The service and prices here were both great
Our waiter was super friendly and attentive
Location is prime parking is a tad tight but ok ambiance is adorable and staff is friendly and attentive
Initially we had a very bad experience with a fire alarm that continually went off the staff didn't apologize and did not comp us anything
I have eaten at this location once and the food was great I wasn't a huge fan of the bar area for after dinner drinks however the crowd skewed much older than my preference and I am no spring chicken the service was very good and extremely  friendly though so no complaints there great wine list despite the fact that the mark up for booze there is nothing short of highway robbery
If you're looking for fast friendly service with scrumptious Sonoran Mexican cuisine
The service is good and the prices are very reasonable
The service is good as my lemonade was never empty
I was greeted by a very nice staff member who helped me get acquainted with the office by taking me around for a tour
The service was friendly and we both really enjoyed our selections; me the mint chocolate chip/dark chocolate friend the mango
A good amount of seating inside a nice place to hang out for your after dinner dessert or on a hot Phoenix day
Gets insanely crowded restrictions on where kids can and can't go rude staff
Where you can actually walk in and smell fresh air the place is super clean the staff is nice and there are no age restrictions
This place has a great vibe and one part of me hopes these positive reviews don't result in oppressive crowds but on the other hand something tells me they'd handle it with a smile and 5 star service
4 stars because of a great ethnic culinary experience its  tasty food and kind staff
The alcoholic drinks are very good and the button to call the waiter is fantastic but the food is lacking
I mean some of the stuff is good mostly on the dessert menu but I warn you about the Milkshake
While ordering the guy working the corner had a stupid smirk on his face the whole time and was rude to my mom and was way too pushy with trying to get her to decide what she wanted
But the rest of the staff are pretty damn good too though
We got a great price excellent customer service from Richard and a ton of compliments from all of our guests
I come here all the time and I've never had bad service like this before
Our bartender was top-notch with incessantly-fast service without hovering
If you have numerous pizzas for a large party the friendly staff will assist you with no hesitation
-cute fun ambiance-nice big menu that can satisfy anyone-very nice friendly staff-great looking happy hour-and there is a Groupon Now for more than 50% off - winning
-lousy service not horrid but slow and waitress couldn't be found sometimes-a tinny bit on the expensive side - happy hour is the time to go
Staff is Friendly makes good suggestions and allows you to order as you go unlike a lot of Sushi places
The food has always been great as well as the service
Service is pretty good; especially the sisters who work the floor and have been there since Day 1
good food good service if you're Hispanic
My friend and I had a exceptional time with great service Mario was our sever spot on menu items and overall were both very impressed
The staff was not overly nice but neither were they unfriendly pretty much just doing their job
Just a beautiful beautiful restaurant with exceptional service and a great overall vibe
They  were nice enough to bring us some super delicious complimentary dessert shots of a creamy cinnamony drink along with mini churros
another friend ordered the crispy shrimp - and although it was good the portion was scarce
I'm totally not blaming him because we wanted to order it before we even asked him but he told us each time that it was a good selection
It's new so it has up-to-date facilities and the staff are friendly and competent
Our reservations were delayed for 45 minutes but the staff was courteous kept in communication with us gave us a great table for eight plus some green pork chile stew appetizer
I'm partial to the Western Scramble but everything I've had has been very good with large portions and served by attentive staff
The staff was friendly and they had Mr Pibb which is an instant extra star from me I only ate the orange flavored chicken nuggets but I tasted his orange chicken dinner and it was just okay
I think what made these oysters so great was the creamy spinach used- I think it is the same as the 'Creamy Spinach' side you can order off the menu
warranties are great here excellent customer service and all the sales people are friendly & courteous
Let me tell you it can be hard to find good service anymore but she was great
Our waiter was attentive and brought us what we needed
Consistent food quick service friendly the place is clean it's local to me and every member of my family likes it
Let me say this once - customer service means a lot to me and this store has been very good to me
Parson's is a great little family owned place where the owner still works with the staff on a daily basis
The staff is super nice and the food flys out of the kitchen
They didn't use pressure tactics to up-sell me services I wasn't badgered into getting a flower etc which was refreshing
Service is friendly though it can be a little slow when they are really busy lunch happy hour and weekends
There's one waitress that's very rude and somehow I seem to get her
The wait staff is generally pretty attentive although I have been in there where the wait time is excessive and it is hard to get service in a timely manner
I'm willing to admit that I *may* not have ordered the greatest dish but
Old no food choices bad beer selection poor service they could not handle the crowd the Giants brought you could not buy food and they actually ran out of food
Their kitchen stuff has great prices on the order of
Not the case here you always enjoy a good down-home no-nonsense meal with great service and all at a VERY reasonable cost
Now I must say the service was 5 stars great server and charming Mr
Personally I thought that the ambiance was great and we couldn't have asked for a better waitress
Just a note the waiters/waitresses all speak Thai and are traditionally dressed; they are also friendly helpful and always looking to impress their guests
The staff at this location was very friendly as other reviewers have stated and I also have to agree with them on the quality of the units
I ordered one of the current breakfast specials which was an 8 oz
Well in closing the food was pretty good but the service was horrible
Service was good drinks were refilled and dirty plates were removed as needed
they've been around since 1987; they have fabulous service thanks to Angela who was my waitress the last two visits they are kid friendly ad they make a good bagel with lox and omelette
Quite possibly the greatest thing about this store is that if they don't have a game you want the owner will look it up and order it for you on the spot
Also the restaurant is spotless the staff after 8+ visits - friendly and efficient
mr h ordered the carne adovada slow roasted pork burrito for his entree
The decor is great and the service did not let us down
In short--the service was great the grilled/fried food is wonderful the atmosphere is comfortable and inviting
The salon is a good size it's one open area with a room or two for more private salon services
The bartenders can be nice and somewhat attentive if you tip well but it's hard for them to hear your drink order so don't be surprised if you get the wrong thing
Although this was exciting for us the restaurant was definitely not ready to accomodate this many people on a random weeknight so the service was pretty slow
Linda ordered the calamari to munch on and that was also very good
Yet the transposed orders of the baked potato  barely serviceableWrong kids meal  chicken strips instead of cheeseburger combined with a slowish service wasn't selling us future visits  they are under 5 mins from the house  They did take care of us by making up some soda to the kid's specs not bad for a 3
Service was slow and again my water was never refilled
There are a fair amount of vegetarian options and the taste and price is good this makes up for the bad service

The place was clean and the service was fast and friendly
's great review that said they have free car service to pick you up and drop you off I thought I had found my place
I love everything about this place; how its decorated the delicious food and the friendly staff
The Staff always greets you with a smile and very friendly Hello and greet you by name
The food is slowly prepared and I think we waited an hour or so for the dinners from the time we ordered
WE DIDN'T ORDER or ask for bread OR THEY SHOULD just add $4 to the cheese $12 plate and just make it $16 on the menu so nobody is mad but I do note the bread was very good
The staff is always super friendly and the service is always quick
Finally after about 10 minutes I asked him if we could get some service and he RUDELY told me that he had orders of tamale dozens to get out and he didn't HAVE TIME
Maybe your tamale's are good but to offer this kind of non-service with a DON'T CARE attitude
I've only been there twice both times we had the same server both times all my comrads ordered the amazingly reasonable and genius idea of a three dollar breakfast until 2 p
I didn't order breakfast because I am not a breakfast food person
In addition to the totally acceptable food pleasant service and good prices you get the added bonus of checking out an old school cigarette vending machine on your way out
I know if i was the manager I would have tried to compensate for the whole situation i would have credited the customer with the bad experience
Not only bad meal experience expensive but also poor managerial decision
Gabi K and I were setting up for a big pARTy and decided to order some grub for all the nice peeps helping us
The staff was really great aside from the very unfriendly older receptionist I called and check in on him at 11 pm and then again at 7am
It is grossly unfortunately that the food and location are considerably offset by a staff so rude that it might actually make you entertain the idea of an encounter with flesh eating zombies
The service was fun and fast the house was virtually untouched from the 1920s down to the extent of the old TV sets and the creaky wood floors and they had absolutely the BEST SOUPS in town
What makes this place great are the creative offerings and the super friendly service
Like clockwork the super friendly owners and employees know our order
I started a slow recovery to discover that the contract that they negotiated with our trainee Assistant t manager for approximately 18000

The band was great and the staff warm and friendly
easier daysA step back in time to the days when you could sit at the lunch counter at Woolworth's and have an open face turkey sandwich at the counter brought to you by a nice lady in sky blue waitress uniformHere the uniforms are white and the ladies behind the counter aren't bringing turkey sandwiches
The ambiance is nice inside and the service has always been good whether in the dining room or at the bar
The service wasn't very friendly and it's way to loud to have a conversation with anyone
They come in good portions but honestly they are not as filling as other salad places I've ordered from

We had the dumpling soup base was blah- soysauce based with little flavor and adding spicy sauce didn't help soup dumplings however looked home made and were nice fried dumplings pan fried not fried only 2 sides were fried beef chow fun good beef was a bit saucy which is not how I normally have it Mongolian beef best thing we ordered beef & Broccoli just OK short rib now my friend said it was like Korean BBQ-- I was laughing inside
The waiters weren't very friendly and they can be hard to find at times
The staffers are friendly and attentive but not overbearing
For a great dessert place I highly recommend the Sugar Bowl
We had a very attentive waiter - Luis - who treated us with colorful and informative descriptions of the menu
We ordered the guacamole and chips and while it wasn't bad there was definitely something missing

I have found the service at the bar to be fast but table service during lunch to be pretty slow and non-attentive
We headed over and while it wasn't 11 am yet they said we could order off of the breakfast or lunch menu
Service was a wee bit slow at times but I am betting the management wasn't paying attention to the events and didn't think they'd get a post 5k rush - listen up management when Mandi wants a mimosa she wants it NOW
Both desserts were a great finish to a very satisfying meal and it seems my family will return in the future
We ordered the Seafood pizza and it was not good
The wait staff was a bit overattentive but better that than under attentive yes

The service was on point good and seating was more than adequate
The pool area is nice and the room service is very quick
I think the service has always been good too especially considering how busy they get
We had a bad traveling experience partially due to the crappy airport car service arranged by the W with ExecuCars or something but as soon as we got here they made it better
This is clearly the jump off for the area so worth staying here to avoid lines and get great service
I found the service to be very prompt and friendly
We don't go back because it's where we've always gone but because of the good food and great service
I had heard the enchiladas were good but I opted for a heathier option and ordered the chicken tacos with corn tortillas
Most of their food is worthy of four stars they have a decent beer selection and know how to pour and the service is good
The service wasn't the greatest which is why I'm only giving it 4
I got the chipped beef gravy good I think next time I will order the sausage but the gravy itself was so good it didn't need any meat at all
Two stars for good shakes nice atmosphere friendly staff and cool location
We had to choke down almost every one of them the exception was their seasonal amber which wasn't too bad but not worth ordering more than 4 oz of
The waitstaff was not very friendly at all and seemed miffed that we didn't want food or more beer
However the service and stinky bathrooms were bad enough that had their beer been phenomenal I still would have just given this place 3 stars
Order the peanut sauce on the side for a $1 extra and this was true peanut flavor and almost everything that got dunked in this sauce tasted way better not that it even needed it but a way sexier dip than good ole soy sauce
Very friendly staff too and a dish called Thaiitalian spaghetti sounds like a great fusion try for next time
I questioned the waiter about this and he rather rudely told me it was always served like that
Their baked goods from breakfast to desserts all looked delicious and unique
The staff are super friendly and know how to mix a drink

When our first waiter arrived he seemed friendly at first but when I asked him if the flirtini drink was any good he proceeded to say  If it wasn't good it wouldn't be on the menu We were like that is not necessarily true but hmm ok
Needless to say it was good though I ordered the plate of sliders which came with miniatures of the WCG Cheeseburger BBQ Bacon Burger and Maytag Burger and french fries
I must say that the service wasn't AS bad and it was REALLY bad the first time but it was not great and our bartender/server as we sat at a booth in the bar was definitely absent minded
The prices are perfect the service is great and the food is really delicious
I always get great service when I go to Drybar

The wait was 20 minutes for a table inside so we opted to sit outside immediately thinking the misters would help with the heat and that we could avoid the wait order and eat fast
Also the waiter was so scarce and service so slow that sending it back was not an option
Service was nice and the people were nice but the food was a bit

+++The service was great and we were able to have a good lunch meeting that left us both satisfied
They are open for less than nine hours a day service can be slow lacks a vibe but their macarons are to die for
the drinks were not as strong as they should be for $14I had 3 of them and was not even buzzing- usually 2 and I ready to rumble the sushi is great but again you end up with $20 of it perperson just to have a decent sized dinner and the waitress totally but things on our bill that we didn't order AND the 5 piece tempura order originally came w 3 pieces
Other than that it is a great place for a delicious and healthy dessert
I arrived a bit early note 1 and waited for the very friendly waitress to exit the kitchen
Service is always very friendly and quicker than other nearby places

I had my name badge on and I liked how he called me by name the whole time I was ordering
Service was excellent and highly attentive
In addition to bad food we were crammed into a small room where we were nuts to butts with 6 other tables listening to conversations ranging from someone's recent bout with pinkeye and another couple who elected to speak entirely in French until the waiter showed up then it was like they turned off the French switch and suddenly began speaking English
Even so the service was friendly and the food came out fast
The staff was very friendly although they hovered a bit too much for my liking
Price $13 - basic which is great for me since i bring my own shampoo $15; and $17 premium treatment very affordableCustomer Service  This place rocks

The food is generally good albeit a bit overpriced -but you expect that to some degree when you walk through the door given the top level service you expect to receive
The wine good as well the previous time they were out of the first three wines I ordered
Dinner for 2 and dessert with tip about $500 I don't take things out on the wait staff - but somehow the whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth particularly with that tab
When we walked in we were immediately faced with the manager Shana I believe who very rudely said we are closed
We explained our intention of ordering togo and having one drink and she again very rudely  said the bar was absolutely off limits they did last call 20 minutes ago and if we HAD to order food it we would be waiting for awhile because she would have to refire up the kitchen and get everything back out since its all been cleaned up already
We will NEVER go back to this location if you are craving BWW stop in to the McQueen & Elliot location where all of the staff are super friendly accommodating and professional

Our waitress was very friendly but man was she wrong about the jambalaya it was just terrible
Would I come back um probably it was OK the service was good though
The first thing I warn people about is the slow service
Service was great and the food was very good
Being a waitress myself it is really easy for me to spot servers that are fake and the servers at Switch all seem to be genuinely nice people who enjoy their jobs

And the next time I won't be so good -- I'm getting a dessert with my meal no matter what
The service staff is really friendly and remember me by name

The friendly staff let us sample a few different wines even though we were in a hurry and I was very pleased with the bottle we opened we brought a white and a red but only opened the white
The service was good parking was not a problem and the price was not bad considering the location
The waitress isn't bad the cook seems to refresh the food often and some of the dishes aren't disgusting
Our waitress was quite a character but very friendly in her own unique way
It was nice but the folks at the bar don't take your order only the wait staff does
The service is pretty good for how busy they can get
When I first moved to Phoenix I was so excited for great Mexican food coming from New England that shouldn't be too tall of an order
The waitress was actually very friendly and well rehearsed if nothing else can't complain there
He proceeded to very slowly make the drinks I ordered
the rest of the staff was also very friendly and greeted each costumer
On top of that service is always speedy and friendly
I also got a side order of tabbouleh which was good - lemon slices on top to allow you to determine how tart you want it to be
Friendly service and a clean restaurant
The staff is very friendly knowledgeable and are great about making suggestions of brews similar to my favorites
So other than getting a good price on my cleaning supplies I don't come here for the service
Service at this location was friendly and it was kept immaculately clean

It's a big very nicely styled place & I ordered from the Mex & Match special menu that's available on weekdays
We split a light salad to start and the waiter had them split it onto two plates for us which was really nice
Service was really friendly and I wavered between getting a hot or iced soy latte
Since I heard Grinders made great coffee I'll give the barrista the benefit of the doubt and order a hot one next time just so I can make a sound judgment

You would think that would give us a pretty good chance of getting good service but no the service was terrible

The order seemed to have been brought to us fairly quickly and the portion was fairly large; thus a good amount for the price of $7
we've always had good service and great food here
when i put up a stink with the manager she absolutely rude
Although this is a very generous portion if you have any dedicated chocoholics or coffee addicts in your party you may need to order one per person it's really that good
This being the case you would think we would have got prompt attention and great service but it seemed to be the opposite
We ordered our mains and while the food was good the wait was almost unbearable
While I will give 3 stars for the freshness and quality of the  food there are too many other great restaurants in Phoenix to go have to endure the mediocre service at Christopher's
after the waitress Amanda the rudest waitress ever brought back a new one the explanation i got was  Oh
we ordered the Prickly pear and strawberry colada's very good she looked up and said nothing but continued making the ofter peoples drinks
I usually order differnt Tacos & they are good
Machaca Chilaquiles y Huevos Combo - AStaff - AI enjoyed my meal it was so good
I started out extremely hopeful because the basket of chips placed on the table were so good that I probably would have been satisfied not ordering an actual entree
The coffee was left at the table; the syrup was in a small pitcher; the waitress was very good;  the bacon was cooked perfectly; and the service was fast and efficient
When we got there it was quite busy and they told us there would be a wait but we chose to stay so we thought it was really nice when we were comped dessert for the inconvenience and we didn't even feel inconvenienced
The staff at the doors and the people behind the bar were all friendly and the crowd was pleasant
Service has always been great they are really quick with getting drink orders in and served to you
the resort is nice enough but overcrowded understaffed and you will over pay for everything
Staff They had one girl working when I arrived and she was really nice and professional
Its just that we were made to feel unwelcome the service was very slow and the people at the bar seemed to have quite an attitude when our people tried to order anything but alcohol
The service is fantastic the beer is great and the food well that has become really hit or miss
Sometimes the service is a little slow on the first contact but once you order the food comes pretty quickly--and it's good
In addition the staff is super friendly and they offer little things that make their service stand out
The wait staff were very nice and friendly
The staff is exceedingly welcoming and the service professional but friendly
The burgers are made to order with tons of great toppings to choose from
Albertsons staff is very friendly but it doesn't really help when most of the time they end what they're saying with I'm sorry
in recognition of the speedy and friendly service
Service was quick and attentive glasses quickly refilled and what a value
We ordered Take out not knowing that they will deliver when slow
I enjoy being able to get a small portion because it is good enough that you don't have to eat barrels of it to feel like you've had a good dessert
The new Scottsdale Quarter location has great ambience and service going for it but I was sorely disappointed by the quality of the pizza
Good thing we knew ahead of time that the folks wanted the 'little' burgers otherwise we would have ordered them a regular
Sat on the patio sunday night and had one of their chewy salty vegan pretzels made unvegan by ordering cheese sauce with it a great pork schnitzel that was topped with an incredible lemon/parsley relish and a huge pile of German dumplings spaetzle
Top it off with a neighborhood feel they do and will remember your name along with the rest of the regulars which is a mix of ages a very decent selection of wines and beers no hard liquor- FYI and a couple of great bartender-server staff who make you feel welcome
The staff was extremely nice and I loved the fresh squeezed orange juice
Super fast and friendly service from room service and housekeeping
I can only imagine how much training must go into this- how do you get everyone from the bellman to the front desk staff to the coffee cart lady to the groundspeople to housekeeping to room service to ALL be friendly and professional
Hotel offers a shuttle that runs every hour on the hour to designated local Scottsdale destinations but if you're really nice the oh so cool bellman/shuttle driver will drop you where you want to go in Scottsdale be sure to tip him well for that extra service
I have been here twice and the service has been great and the staff very friendly
Manuel's isn't fancy but their food and friendly service keeps my family coming back again and again
I sit at the bar and there is usually a sports game on a good looking bartender pouring me coffee and a guy with a hangover wearing sunglasses wishing he'd ordered the breakfast burrito sitting next me
The cashiers were nice but a little confused about how to take orders communicate them to the kitchen and how to work the cash register
I have since ordered a breakfast burrito through the drive-through on my way to work and it was just ok
I expected a dump based on what it looks like out front but the manager was very nice and they only played 2 mins of previews which was awesome
The staff is super friendly and make you feel welcomed and appreciated for your business
The staff in this particular location is super friendly but not overly so
You can order tortilla chips a burrito your choice of meat beans salsas opt for lettuce sour cream shredded cheese and for an extra fee guacamole a fajita burrito which substitutes the beans for grilled sliced peppers and onions a burrito or fajita burrito 'bol' which are the same ingredients sans tortilla in an Atkins low carb-friendly cardboard dish or tacos
Rude staff slower than molasses service DIRTY sloppy unappealing food that is expensive margaritas that taste like some tangy sour tasting kool-aid-- and if you are unlucky enough to be seated in what I call the after thought corridor you will nearly suffocate from the lack of circulation and heat the narrow little seating area off the main dining area
Service is a tiny bit slow but it is Tempe
I hate seeing miserable restaurant staff that move slowly and look like they hate their job
Nice waitress takes our drink order and comes back with yummy chips and salsa
Not wanting a carbo load I order a breakfast burro with chorizio [menu says egg cheese chorizo]
Clean fresh ingredients and very friendly and attentive service
Overall review Clean great service great food great ambience
Another small problem was that when i ordered salmon roe sushi i got just salmon sushi which i ate anyway since it looked great and when i tried to reorder it later I got Smelt roe which is far smaller and obviously different
The conveyor belt is almost hypnotic the food is quite good the price is awesome maybe just train the waitresses a tad better but since the food mostly comes to you who cares
Inside decorations are nice and service is consistent
Portions are big the Iced tea was fresh and service was good
It was nice that a manager came around to check on us after we got our meal
He was friendly and had great product and customer service
The service is friendly and they do what they do perfectly
The store is clean open aisles to walk through great prices on the games and the customer service from Gary and Rich is phenomenal
I'd say in the last year it has made a real turn around the people are nice but just like others have said you wait and wait for service and when it does come its not very good
The atmosphere gets five stars and the staff was friendly and service excellent but the food is overpriced and the food was satisfactory
On the positive side the Continental counter staff is first class the Red Carpet club is small but nice and well staffed by professionals
First the service is always very good- they are extra friendly here
Service was attentive and the food was pretty good
Don't forget dessert big enough  to share but good enough not to want to
Service is usually excellent barring misadventure and is usually friendly
On the positive +- a great space especially the patio dining area- friendly serviceRoom for improvement-  - I would say that everything we had was ok
Fries were yummy and the sliders were very good- believe I got two orders of the sliders
Overall I like it here easy in easy out and the staff is always friendly and helpful
Service was very prompt and friendly one star for food one star for ambience four stars for service -- server took time to explain a number of items to my wife
The service was a bit slow actually pretty slow
Being from San Diego I am spoiled when it comes to great Mexican food and service
Please hire a waitress that has a brain and isn't slow
We have always had really great service and the food
The staff was attentive maybe too much so since they just opened but that can't be a ding against them
I ordered their breakfast smoothie mmm and an egg white omelette served with tomatoes and avocado
The bad The waiter didn't understand English one order of Paella was really 3 separate orders for 3 times the money
In the end we were overcharged for the paella and sangria we didn't want Calamari in the Paella the service was awful food moderately good Sangria average
The service was attentive and helpful but forgetful
Many people that I know with Celiac/GI try to avoid going during peak hours to avoid contamination so I've always had great service and limited to no wait time and my food has been fantastic every time I've been there
Their muddy waters sweet tea and lemonade and their strawberry lemonade is good and their desserts are good as well
But the entru00e9e of kung-pao shrimp was actually pretty tasty; the hot tea was good; our waitress was attentive; and it was a very cheap lunch
I ordered off the lunch menu and added a side salad for 99 cents which I thought was great but I do not like olives or onions and asked to NOT have them on my salad
The service is very friendly and efficient
The waiters kinda annoy me with their buddy-buddy schtick Hey good job bra you finished that huge pie
The wait-staff is very friendly professional and helpful
The service is always great and I haven't really had any disappointing visits can't wait to come back
I feel funny writing a great review for a chain restaurant but it was very good and the waitress Heather was great and we were seated quickly even though it was right at lunch on a Wednesday
Service and food were both great yeah I know it is a chain restaurant and the 'foodies' will probably turn their nose up with this review but what the heck I liked it a lot and we will be back
Lastly the dessert was reasonably sized for two people to share and indulge in the great flavors but without over doing it
Staff are very friendly and accommodating
We have had great waiters and then some real duds who forget to validate our parking after we gave them the token
I ordered the reuben pasty and it was good
As much as I would love to try the other dishes the delux burger and fries are too good not to order time and again
We had good service there was a ton of people there - all who were raving about the place
While the service on my old 2002 Civic was slow the workmanship was great
Also it's worth noting that this is a good place to come over for coffee and/or dessert after lunch next door at Pita Jungle
The waiters have always been really knowledgeable and educated about the flavor profiles of their fish and are usually really good about letting you know what is going to be best that day and what is the freshest
The staff is really nice the burgers are fantastic he portions are enough to satisfy even the biggest appetite and this all comes at an excellent price point
I definitely recommend this place if you live in the area the bartendar's and waitresses or waiters will get to know you fast and your experience will get better every time
Another reviewer mentioned bad service but we did not experience that at all
I do agree with some of the reviewers that the service is very slow
Our waitress was nice but she wasn't attentive and she was quite sloppy
We noticed the waitress across from us was very good to their party constantly rounding and making sure everybody had their refills and checking in on the food and if they wanted more entrees
I wasnt going to say anything to the waitress who wasnt overly friendly to begin with
The staff at Bunkhouse was really friendly in that genuinely swishy way
I have been here many times and always had great service
The hot dog was on a toasted bun which was good the all beef hot dog had great flavor and they pilled the cheese and bacon on the top of it I ordered the bacon cheese and tomato hot dog
The staff is still great here unfortunately some changes to their teas and coffee extracts forces me to lower they're rating
Sad to say if it wasn't for the great staff here - I'd probably just go to Starbucks for my quick fix coffee
In fact I have ordered them together so many times that the nice guy named Brian at the counter knows when I call because im apparently the only one that puts these two things together
Service bounced between really good and where did she go
3 roots wouldn't be so terrible if A the employees had the first clue about what constitutes good service and B if everything wasn't so wildly inconsistent
3 Roots baristas wouldn't know good customer service if it was fucking them in the ass
The service was great though and I wouldn't object to going back if I had pizza on the brain and was back in Scottsdale
The bathrooms were nice clean and serviced the theatre was fairly big and super comfy
Service was also excellent and Pam was a friendly server I would recommended to anyone
The woman who went behind the counter rudely explained they don't open un 9 AM we could order breakfast but potatoes wouldn't accompany our meal as they weren't prepared yet
We ordered the mill's version of Eggs Benedict which was okay but not great
We ate our breakfast on the outdoor patio which is a lovely setting but had to listen to a staff member's loud cell phone conversation while he was washing to front door windows
Great service nice environment  wonderfully prepared food
*Ambiance = cool hip fun*Gelato = I still prefer flavors of Gelato 64 but it's definitely similar enough*Service = very good
Awesome food very friendly service and reasonable prices gives Aiello's five stars
I was worried they wouldn't be able to fill my order because I needed it in the next 2 hours but a very friendly man answered the phone and told me he could indeed have my order ready in time
My go-to breakfast would be a half order of protein pancakes a full order is two pancakes and they're HUGE with bananas and blueberries and a side order of scrambled eggs
From the owner who answers the phone when you call to the guy who drives you home while they work on your car- you can count on friendly professional and HONEST service
Between the slow service indifferent servers botched orders and flavorless creations you'll marvel at how IHOP has remained in business for this long
I go with my son Justin's cute girlfriend and I could very well pass for her older sister ~ Needless to say we get a bunch of attention from these already attentive waiters busmen and hosts
Service is good and they have those great glass bottle sodas like San Pellegrino Aranciata I prefer the bottle over the can
The service was pretty slow first off which was kind of annoying
We had an order of onion rings to start out and they were great
Though the service wasn't quite as stellar it was still very nice
So if you are in the East Valley and want great ice cream and other desserts along with great service from people who love what they are doing you need to stop in
Then the waiter rudely says you didn't ask for it to come out first
If that wasn't bad enough my mother was walking to the bathroom and the waiter walked into her with his tray purposely
The rooms were clean and quiet the staff was very nice
The service was extremely slow and unorganized
On Friday April 16 2010 The management at this Arena allowed a drunk misogynist with really bad hair to abuse and assault me refusing to remove the person even when I went to the trouble of hunting down the manager/team leader
The girl who took my order was very friendly and made my fat ass feel welcome there which is pretty rare these days
It took about 10 minutes for my order to come out which is probably a good sign that they were at least spending some time cooking something back there
The office staff were extremely friendly when I called and in person
As mentioned in most of the other reviews their produce is gorgeous their food fresh and delicious and their staff friendly and helpful for the most part
Other times it's not crowded at all but the deli staff is not so attentive
overall a great stay for a great price staffed with great employees
I don't see what her point was though cause she was rude and pushy when we did finally place an order
The drinks were well priced I personally had good service so no complaints from me
I would think in the current economic environment his staff would have the good sense to bend over backwards to accommodate their guests but we were left with the impression that they felt they were doing us a favor by being open
Yea the food is good - but the service is just so ridiculously bad
Good service nothing out of this world but by no means bad
With it being early and uncrowded on a hot and humid evening the wait staff was friendly and very attentive
The service and staff are very nice and down to Earth
I've never had service issues like some other reviews and I've been there when it's been busy and slow
The waitresses are usually very friendly and offer great service
I ordered the breakfast sandwich with bacon sourdough bun
Service was great he even packed us up some salsa and chips to go
Customer service is always nice even if there is a language barrier with some but have the patience because you can communicate through other methods and they lead you to the right direction
Super friendly staff and reasonable ticket prices by movie theater standards
The bad thing was service is still lacking
Service is perfect feels like family food is dead on I ordered the shaking beef which was Cubes of Filet Mignon sauteed in this super  I could die for this sauce with a nice plate of steamed rice with a  side with grilled zucchini
The staff is inattentive the food greatly over priced and poorer than fast food quality
If this is true I will do my best to be a good girl the rest of my life - I am afraid this place with it's stink restrooms tasteless meat and strange mordern salad dressings strange for an old fashioned cowboy steakshouse anyway may very well be the hell I'd be sent to if my  good deeds didn't add up at final judgement
We come here and it is always good service is always the same the place is clean and there is never a wait or a long wait  I love the creations they have and my kids love em too
They can however work on their service which was unattentive and unorganized during my visit
They offer hot sandwiches fresh baked goods desserts and a small variety of cheeses and meats
Overall a pleasant experience good service nice atmosphere and a great wine selection
Great variety of food and friendly service
The food is great but this location's customer service is poor
Oh service wasn't great but it hardly is at asian places - I'm not trying to be an asshole by saying that but I have experience with a few chinese/filipino grammas know what I'm sayin
Service was friendly professional and attentive
For a more wholesome meal a side of mushy peas seasoned with salt and pepper is a good order
Our waitress was nice but forgetful and absent minded
At this point our movie is abruptly cut and we are directed to the manager to whom I am already planning to pay a friendly visit
Attractive interior design attentive but flawed service very good food
Especially in AZ restaurant cooking and service is too sloppy and inattentive and there's often no concern over mistakes
The key is to order your pieces WAY AHEAD OF TIME -  Patience is required but you'll save $$$ and get nice results
The staff was very friendly and assisted us with our selection

We told them to go to Mable's on Main where you can go have an amazing cocktail in 'speak-easy-ish atmosphere' with great service and no wait for half the price
We found great drinks for half the price and better service at another joint
The service was prompt thorough and friendly but maybe a little too friendly
We ordered the crispy rock shrimp off the Happy Hour menu not bad but nothing special
The few couples times I had gone in there the staff was a little unfriendly and sort of snobbish
My salmon dish was blandThe service was terribly slow
The waitress was also attentive making sure our glasses were full yet not overbearing
The manager informed us that they were trying to make the restaurant faster and easier which makes a little sense
The nice thing was the manager offered to change the mac and cheese after seeing the bowl still full
The office staff was friendly on the phone and made the process easy and painless
The short Solid contemporary American fare at a fair price fast and efficient service clean contemporary surroundings
No complaints though--every component was good and the dessert came together well
Free wi-fi good coffee and sincerely friendly customer service make this coffee shop a winner that I wouldn't mind visiting again
Having arranged our large group in advance we were given 1/2 the space we needed the restaurant itself was uncomfortably warm and the service was awful - to put it nicely
The atmosphere and service are still pretty good and the raspberry iced tea wasn't bad either
The food here is delicious the staff is friendly the prices reasonable & they even have BOOTHS  -  back in their almost secret rear dining room
The staff was very friendly and personable including Chef Michael very warm and sat with us for a few minutes which made us both feel quite giddy I have such a hard on for chefs must be the jacket
Here's the deal -- nothing wrecks a restaurant quicker for me than rude staff
Something so simple as hiring friendly waitstaff can make or break a restaurant
But it was an OK experience and the service was friendly so we decided to go back for lunch
The staff is great and very knowledgeable
Service is great and you won't notice the wait
Like I said above C&C is as good as it gets for food service and ambiance
The waitress Jenny seemed to be attentive and didn't let our drinks go
Overall we had a great experience but it was weird that we were not offered any dessert
Oh and the service was pretty good a little lackluster at their busiest time but it was really really packed that night
We truly liked the atmosphere the staff was super nice and they have a good variety of drinks to choose from
Go for the atmosphere and nice service if you find yourself in that neck of the woods but don't expect  greatness
The service was good though a really sassy boy that made us laugh but overall I wouldn't go back here again
It's a nice place to eat if you like so-so food and a unknowledgable wait staff
The crowd is always friendly and the service is usually top notch
Starters dont exceed $10 and entrees range anywhere from $5-$15 If Im correct there is only one item on the menu costing $15 We started off with three appetizers thinking it would be the only dishes ordered little did we know- Grilled Spicy Chicken Wings Some a little burnt but it tasted great
It looked so good she decided to order it herself
Just my kind of place--good food good service and good prices
Staff is friendly and the music is kind of loungy
That aside I must say thisGREAT SERVICE

It is very clean and the staff is very nice
75 not including tip BTW the service was very good at the bar and I tipped generously
good for themAll in all The Lodge is really pretty average in terms of food and service
Again the ice cream was very good but the service was terrible
The office feels more like a spa good for pre doc jitters the staff was wonderful and Dr
I will say that I think the manager was very attentive and handled the situation well but I couldn't bring myself to come back for a few months
It was the same situation the manager was nice and apologetic but I was seriously grossed out
The dining room is small but always clean and the service is friendly but casual and not in-your-face
Great food nice family eatery and great service
However I'm glad it was as we had great service never guaranteed no matter how busy or not busy and a great meal
I inhaled it so fast I don't think I can even describe it but it was the perfect lunch portion to prevent an afternoon food coma AKA I could have eaten two orders

The staffer on the phone was extremely polite and friendly when I talked to them
Everything we ordered below was really good
ALthough service was great and the food was good all in all too overpriced for what you got
Okay since my latest review I was contacted by the manager who expressed concern on my bad experience
I do want to say that even if the food sometimes needs a little sumptin sumptin the customer service is Great and always has been
The service also varies a lot so I'm not surprised to find some people got some bad service
Proximity to the movie theater at Tempe Marketplace and speed of service are what brought us in great food and a nice counter girl keeps us coming back
ProsFree ParkingGood ServiceAmazing AtmosphereRespectable Price Especially for a french place in the middle of scottsdaleConsGive us more Foie Gras
There are other good Thai places in town where friendly service and delicious food are standard
The waitress was rude and I could have whipped up a tastier sesame chicken in my own kitchen without a hefty price tag
What was great though is when we walked in for the dinner he recognized me     and remembered my name true customer service
Really nice to see a locally owned shop give such awesome service at an even better price
The service is average so is the food and the patrons because they all seem to know each other already lack that friendly enthusiasm-more like watching TV at your uncles
We ordered the breakfast buffet and feasted on shrimp crab legs home-made prosciutto grilled vegetables an omelette and a variety of other dishes and desserts and each was better than the last

When I found a shoe I wanted but was out of stock a very friendly associate patiently called 3 other stores their computer service needs to be updated as many stores listed they had the shoe but when calledthey didn't have it
The staff AKA husband and wife are super nice and fun to talk with don't forget to try one of there cooking classes too
I LOVE that they are taking the initiative to offer great services by placing either cucumber lemon etc
I say this because the only people who appeared to be working were the manager and 1 server and with 4 other tables I can understand a little slowness   We sat down around 1230 pm and quickly ordered drinks and an order of the artichoke dip
They have some of the nicest and most knowledgeable staff out there and the selection of beers is hands down the best in the entire state
It can get a bit crowded at times which will make the service slower so I recommend ordering another beer when you're about 3/4 done
The service wasn't that good and they didn't bring the beer in cold glasses which was disappointing
A few other good factors that Delux offers Good service fantastic beer selection which are primarily microbrews from across the country and reasonable prices

5 but I'm rounding down because of the phone service which seems inexcusable in the 21st century with all the tech solutions out there to allow customers to make a reservation online Open Table or forward calls to a booking service or at least a friendly sorry we're not open please call back at such-and-such time
Good service food is out very fast and servers are very much on top of the game
For dessert we got the Creme Brulee which was great

The waterpark is smaller than the other one I've been to in northern Phoenix and has less water slides and all but two of the large slides are tube slides which I don't like as much as the open slides but the lifeguards and other staff are very friendly and make you feel right at home and there are enough slides that you can cruise around and don't get bored
Every once in a while there will be a semi-friendly face at the register but not very often in fact it is rare- I once made the mistake of ordering a small drink and they snarled at me that they only pull double shots which I had read only moments earlier on the menu but had already forgotten mommy brain but they definitely could have handled that a little more nicely
Service was good with frequent refills and they left us plenty of time to get to business before taking our orders

Goldie's is owned by Zipp'sI'd just like to reiterate how bad the service and management is here
They were both friendly kept our drinks full and didn't try to participate in our conversation or interject themselves into our lives beyond providing us with great service

I dunno why I ordered the wings or why I thought that'd be a good idea at a Mexican restaurant

Being that the place was pretty much empty the staff was super accommodating and nice

I walked up to the counter to order and was told by the man behind the counter that o we wait on you but he nicely took my order sandwich and coke and let me pay BTW I included a 20% tip up front when I paid with my card so I was trying to be proactive about getting good service
I suppose the sandwich which was good on good bread well made and tasty is the reason to give Scratch the benefit of the doubt and give them 2 stars the service was below 1 star
I will give them that the service was friendly and we had our food in about 10-15 minutes
Yes it is run by two ladies that work hard so if you arrive and it is full the service might seem a bit slow but when your turn comes it is well worth the wait

Good customer service - if you're unable to take a simple breakfast burrito order at least apologize when we have to send it back and wait longer
Both times I've been here and ordered food and drinks I've been pretty frustrated with how inattentive the servers are
I have had most of the desserts and you really can't go wrong they are all really good
I saw the manager come out so I mentioned to him that the girl at the register needs some personality and that she is rude when you first walk in
Service was good despite having a large lunch crowd to contend with
My husband ordered the Zuni burrito which he found to be good
*** The food was good but I think what keeps us wanting to come here is the wonderful customer service they have been AWESOME to us  we were greeted with an honest smile and we were well taken care of during our entire dining experience there
Service was good at the beginning but waitress disappeared when we wanted the check
The servers are super friendly and there's never any pressure to order anything
Service from the female bartenders was not ideal ~ but the male bartender was very attentive to us
The waitress was pleasant and friendly but utterly unknowledgeable about Indian food
The manager was friendly and accommodating but once something like this happens the cat is out of the bag and I know the kitchen staff doesn't understand the GF diet and they've probably thrown flour and bread crumbs everywhere and taken no precautions against cross contamination of bread-ish things into the other food
Immediately after getting our drinks a very friendly server got our orders
The inside is cool with color and the normal smell of a salon and the other staff is friendly
The great service continued once we sat down for dinner
They have a great costumer service is family friendly and of course delicious
They take a great deal of pride in their food and service and you can tell
FINALLY after waiting at the counter for a good ten minutes I just grabbed our order form and went to the check out
99 an item AND friendly excellent customer service/ they've never lost or ruined anything/they let me know upfront if they can't clean a specific item
My mom loves to talk to people and our waitress was extremely nice and took the time to chat with her
We were there last night and we ordered the garlic cheese crostini as an appetizer so good
The service was definitely good and the atmosphere was good too
We were seated immediately and the service was great and friendly which isn't always the case when you show up to a restaurant at shift change
There was also the one waiter who asked if the food was alright without slowing down or looking in our direction
In the past I noticed a very friendly waitress with dark hair
Thank goodness they haven't moved on to the ultra-hip French dessert egg-bread read brioche for their burger
The staff there was very friendly and outgoing and there's seating inside and out
They offer free water to help wash down dessert which is nice
We had great service - very helpful and attentive but not up in your face and of course I love the food
It was all tasty as usual the service was really excellent and the atmosphere at this location is nice and quiet
For the quality+quantity of food you get I can't say that the price is that great I've had way better food for way cheaper with just about the same level and speed of service elsewhere
By the way their cannoli's are the BEST not filled until ordered so the shell is nice and crunchy
Service was good but they were slow at the time we were there
The service was very friendly and the food was delicious
The waitress was very nice service was good
The furniture themselves were so exquisite that I could see the place having a totally different atmosphere if the walls were painted a muted light color with minimal decoration and the furniture themselves were highlighted  It would def enhance the dining experience and draw more people in because really the food and service was good
The food the service the atmosphere - all great
don't worry whatever you order will be great
I ordered the wcg cheeseburger and it was great
What this place lacks in food is made up in quick fairly friendly service and an area that is convenient to downtown Scottsdale and the Giants Spring training stadium
So you end up feeling like you are playing Hangman with the friendly waitress Um
While I will admit we never even got to the dinner I simply made a judgment call that with all that we had seen up to ordering the food would not have been that good to over come all the cons
They have been good every time I've been there and the service is friendlier than your typical fast food burger joints as well
In the end it gets 4 stars for good service decent food convenient location and consistently feeding me when I'm hungry on the cheap
But when our waitress brought out the drink with the shaker $18 didn't seem so bad anymore
On top of the great food we had a fantastic waitress
A good waitress can add so much to the experience and she really helped make our evening special
The staff is friendly and knowledgeable of the products available in the shop and I have often been stuck in many nerd conversations while visiting
I don't wistfully pine for San Francisco or Chicago with service as engaged and attentive as our bartender and servers food as creatively designed and excellently executed as our tasting menu and decor as exquisite as the interior space
I dined at Fleming's recently on the insistence of a friend and while the service was good I thought the food was shockingly high priced for what it was
Our waiter the first night was a super friendly dude who was recently married and I'm sure our tab there was big enough to pay for a second honeymoon
This whole experience with the unprofessional office staff left me with a bad first impression
To summarize I know I get a little long winded if you want to eat light have some great sangria and want to be served by the Law and Order chick this is a really good place to do that
Prices were reasonable and service was obviously fast
Also I would like to tell you that I really enjoy your produce prices and your friendly staff especially the cashiers they are always so pleasant and helpful
I will say that if you are willing to deal with slow service then this is the place for you
Our waitress Kelly did a great job and keeping up with a large group and the owner was courteous at stopping by to say hello and thanking us for our business- always a great thing to see
I've been to RA's Ahwatukee location several times and while RA's sushi in general is not stellar the service is at least good
I think it may have just been the owner who was taking orders but he was slow and very unfriendly
I get it it's Sunday morning and the waitress had a lot of balls or waffles in the air but under no circumstance should a breakfast customer wait 15 minutes for coffee
BUT once the coffee pot landed and we got our orders in the food came out very fast and it was amazing
We don't have to deal with bad customer service when spending hundreds or thousands of dollars
the quality and preparation were good but it took so long that I probably won't come back unless I call in a carryout order
The food was just decent but words cannot describe how friendly and accommodating the staff went out of its way to be
But the service is fast and the food comes out quickly
I ordered a few drinks all of which were very good although pricey
But worst of all it appeared undercooked so we told the very nice lady and she assured us that it is cooked twice once before customer orders and once after and again I say WTF
The office staff is all very friendly and competent
The order always comes with so many plump flavorful shrimp and the sauce is lip-smacking good
Friendly serviceRestaurant OptionsYou can take a shuttle to the Rustlers Roost and anywhere else for that matter
But besides that the place is a mess there's a certain woman upfront who doesn't speak good English so it's hard to place an order
The hubs ordered the Pastrami Grilled Sandwich & it was good
So kudos to the hubs on this order & Carly's for rocking out the best grilled sandwich I've ever had & a great bartender to boot
The service was really quick I ordered my wrap to go and I had barely sat down and someone from the back had brought it out to me all packed to go with a nice little That's A Wrap sticker and I was out the door
That said the service was fast even as the staff was clearly closing down for the night seems like it closes right around 10pm with some slight leeway
The staff is nice there is a loyalty card
I didn't think our waitress was too friendly and it seemed like we were trying to cheer her up somehow
The service was great waitress was awareI look like a hobo she avoided my stareI usually go commando undies I don't wearThis place was good and the food was fair
Regardless they have a nice menu variety reasonable wines and the desserts look terrific did not try
Despite the place being packed and our server being the only one in the bar area service was very good and very friendly
Our waitress was nice but didn't offer my little brother any pizza dough and didn't do a very good job of keeping our drinks full
In summary pizza is great but service is shaky
Bad dessert brought to you by creepy self-defeatist fundies
Service is typically pretty good you'll be able to keep drinks coming and food comes out quickly
Go for happy hour order some cheese curds and a $3 Miller Lite and you're bound to have a good time
The atmosphere was nice The service was just ok took them awhile to take our order and come back for refills but over all it was a good meal
Did get a cheese course for dessert which was good but all the fruit around went into the trash low carb usually means no fruit
The atmosphere is lovely the service is always excellent and the variety and quality of the sushi is as good as anything we've had
The waiter was very attentive to us and our main courses were excellent
Who can argue with the great first class service in first class and when you have had 3 jack and cokes and you ask the stewardess for another one and her question is Are you driving
The service was good with prompt water refills and cleaning up extra plates
Staff was friendly--everything else was alright--just watch their pricing and look over the details of your bill
The ambiance is great service is superb parking is convenient and the overall vibe is inviting
Even though it  was packed the staff was friendly and efficient
The service wasn't great but I am sure it was due to how busy it was
If you're looking for a standard breakfast served hot this is a good place; but if you are looking for quicker service and something different I would go somewhere else
Upon arriving at C&T a security guard opened the door for me as I approached and greeted me I thought two things  Wow this place must really have some nice pieces here and they've already started off on the right foot service wise
I ordered breakfast and my friend had a sandwich

This place is a lunch machine- They take your order fast and accurate have your food up and let you loose into the dining area
The prices are reasonable the service is always friendly and the food is really good
We met with Food & Beverage Manager Brian Gillmore who was extremely nice and easygoing
In terms of service our server was attentive and showed up when needed and not much more which we didn't mind since we were in no rush and were enjoying our time there
They also have nice spa services and a pretty well equipped gym with a nice locker room steam room and therapeutic hot tub
The waitress was nice enough to bring out some fried wontons with dip for us when we explained what we were looking for - all complimentary - and they were yummy
The food is great I always order water everywhere i go so can't comment on drinks
The food and the friendly service are the highlights although I hear they have entertainment and karaoke on Friday nights
The staff is always smiling friendly and working hard
It was overall a great time but I have to go with 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 because I was forced to order things that I was not intending on having
I would go back because it was a great location nice staff cool place and really good steak
The waiter was on point and the drinks were good
Refrain from telling a large party that ordering food and drinks at the same time 'will slow down the kitchen'2
it's just the voices in my head demanding attentionI stopped for some lunch at the old Orange TableThey always have savory foodIt was crowded as hell even in summerSo the service was not very good;The wait staff is hip and they sort of act coolBy their looks I could tell I was notI was wearing a golf shirt and old cargo shortsThey just didn't think I was hot;They chatted with friends and hung out in the kitchenBut they did bring my soup hot and tastyAnd a good turkey sandwich with lettuce and mayoThe bread was just right thick and crustySo would I return to the tables of Orange
Alright the pizza was good the dough was tastey would order a little extra done to get it like some of the Naples pizza i've had perfect salt and consistancy
Thank you for you quick professional friendly service
Never had bad service there they have a ton of options and their happy hour is fantastic
Clifford awesome but his entire office staff is great as well
Matthew the bartender was great he provided good suggestions on the wine and great service
We had great service at RnR and the atmosphere was awesome
Travis waited on us and I thought he did a pretty good job considering there were 7 of us partaking in the 5 wine tasting and most of the time we all ordered a different wine
We ordered takeout and I was very impressed with how nicely it was all packaged and how quickly it was ready
But I will definitely be back here for takeout because of the friendly speedy service and convenient location
I personally think that the manager can even count because it came with 5 pieces and I returned 4 they fall a parts on my cloth ruining my shirt and causing a bad experience
The customer service here is great and the staff is alway friendly and helpful when I may need it
Otherwise then that the place has great hours friendly staff and most everything you would need for eating at home
I ordered the cabage starter salad which was really quite good
Seriously Butterfield's offers quick friendly service SOLID food and a big bang for your buck
Dirty towels everywhere jam-packed jacuzzis messy grounds slow food/bev service

The service was also very pleasant with the waitress both attentive and friendly
The food is usually pretty good and the service OK too
Honestly the only good thing here is the Apple Store I love the design and the customer service is friendly whenever I've been there
The food is always fresh and hot and tasty and the service has always been friendly and efficient I've even been offered a free beer on a number of occasions because of frequent visits
Boswell Hospital is in Sun City - major geriatric center so you know the staff is used to working with hard of hearing and slow moving patients
I have to say that the staff across all disciplines/professions that we interacted with were exceptionally friendly and professional
The complimentary breakfast tasted like leftovers from last nights dinner service
I have never had a bad order of hummus from PJ and there have been A LOT of orders and the sirloin was really good
While sitting there got to hear the servers complain about how slow the bartender is and that they too have been waiting or over 10 mins for the beers they ordered
Service was courteous and food was pretty fast as well
Most of the staff is super cool and awesome but the last couple of times I've gone this slightly slow/blah guy with no people skills and it has been lame
The waitstaff was nice - nothing out of the ordinary to add there
The service was great I wish they had vegetarian Pho but no chance on that one
Service is friendly but a little slow on refilling drinks to the point where you need to walk up to the counter to ask for more water
The staff is used to working with a lot of traffic so I've never had bad service there -- these guys really know their stuff
The service was a bit slow at first but once the waitress came over it was good from there
The staff was nice overall and service was prompt because every server pretty much helps out each table
Not only was the sushi fantastic  but the service was great as well
Fries were very good but because of the poor service it's hard to say how good our cold burgers were
Too bad we probably won't go back because of the service
To me Starbucks is always crowded noisy and has slow and rude service
On this trip I ordered a breakfast sandwich whichever one was featured in all the pictures on the menus
Good ambiance great service comfortable enough and the prickly pear margarita was delicious
We also ordered a few bottles of wine and for the life of me I cannot remember what they were but they were good bottles of red
The place was empty and still we got bad service
I thought the staff was friendly and helpful

Our waitress was Nadine she was awesome she made sure we had everything we needed and was very attentive
The bartender was really nice and generous ;-  The wait staff seemed in a hurry to clean everything up
the service was very good as well so i was a very happy person at the end

Two of us ordered the quesadilla and one ordered the breakfast burrito
Score   SCOrdered  Fish sliders excellent sturdy delicious all because of the toasted bunzzzzzzzzzz this small important detail seems to almost always go overlooked at so many placesnot hereits the very foundation of almost anything Damn Good not becoming soggy messy fast food crappy
The service was great and I love the decor
As far as the service goes one of the blond servers was fantastic- very attentive my water glass was always full which is a huge plus in a Phoenix summer
The only bad thing was they should of had more help in serving we do bring a large group 20-30 so that many orders at one time can take time to distribute
The staff and servers are very nice folks
Even though ramen is supposed to have a lot of toppings only order toppings if you want to spend over 10 dollars for a bowl of noodles because each one is about $1 and they're not very good and in small portions
Their staff is pretty rude in general so I probably won't go back because I seriously value an overall experience
This place has a great little patio with a super friendly staff and great margaritas
It's clean cheery comfortable the service is friendly & warm
The cashier guy who looked suspiciously like Ray Liotta was very friendly and working like crazy so I'm pretty sure he was the manager if not the owner
I ordered the Grilled Salmon which was so GOOD that I cleaned the plate
We told the hostess we were just here for dessert and she sat us at a great cozy table for 2 in one of the corners of the restaurant which was pretty busy
Our server was really friendly and immediately got our drinks and put in our order for the OMG
These were damn yummy - I love carbs though they make me fat - frankly I wasn't sure how good these were going to be and I can tell you after ordering them that they were the best of the 3 things we ordered
I loved it the service was excellent food was great etc
for this place to survive against the many awesome breakfast places in Gilbert they need to rise to the occasion and step up there food service pricing and the decor is sparse and needs some improvement
I remember the service being a slight bit slow if your trying to get in and out and back to your office on your hour lunch
I will say that the girl who took my order today was nice enough and at least smiled and asked how I was doing
Most of the time I am picking up food to go but when I have eaten here the service has been very quick and attentive
The soups appetizers and main dishes are all consistent each time I order them which is what I look for in a good eatery
It's a nice newer gym with a good amount of amenities and a relatively friendly staff
The service was also pretty good/friendly for a Friday night but clearly overworked
Overall the staff was friendly and I had a great shopping experience
All in all we are going to help promote this business because of friendly mgr and staff
The service was slow as hell and they brought us 2 loaves of bread bc we had a party of 7 with only 1 knife
Service was very good and friendly place was clean and inviting
The service was friendly even if our waitress forgot to bring pitas
Service was good however I thought this restaurant was too pricey
The entertainment -- Southern Drawl -- was fantastic and the wait staff super friendly
Shotty service from the jump and a knockout of bleach to the nose wasn't a very good start for me
The service wasn't great forgot drinks no refill offered the price was ok 13
I gave this place 5 stars because it had the best margarita on the block delicious food excellent staff and outdoor dog friendly seating and yes that's my little Yorkie in the pictures
Very friendly staff and they had no problem making things the way you want it
Our waitress was really great about the whole thing
My drinks were very good and the staff was awesome very attentive and polite The DJ was ok nothing to write home about and the clientele were mediocre at most
Service ~ was very good not exceptional but good
The service was good the first couple of times we went and the food was hot and tasty
I have never had bad service here and its nothing special either the inside is pretty clean and the chicken serves its purpose when I get a craving
The pizza is definitely decent as well service is prompt and fast especially given the fact that it seems like the entire city of Scottsdale descends upon the place like vultures between 12 and 1p
The early morning staff is great and free WiFi is an added bonus
He did the ordering all I remember is the clams w/black bean sauce was great
The staff was also very friendly and expedient and they have a huge selection of beers on tap
I ordered the tortilla soup tonight and it was really good
There are too many good dessert options out there
We stopped in here with some friends on a whim shortly before closing time but they still had all the flavors out and the staff was very nice despite it being a few minutes before close
They were very nice about letting us try a few different flavors before ordering
Love the other food btw and the service has always been good everytime I go
ok finally went back to roka last night and im speechless im not sure if it was the amazing service by the GM Joy or one of the greatest servers ive ever had Casey
The service only suffers a little during the lunch rush but both times I had bad service on the phone the manager personally delivered my order with his appologies and a coupon/discount off my next order
And the people are great waitress was really friendly they had a cooler outside for when we were waiting and came around with drinks and free pizza samples
I ordered the gyro burger and it was such a great idea and delicious
Joe the manager is a character - so friendly to all of us
A great crowd on this night the staff was very helpful and friendly and ther service was great
Service is just the right amount of attentiveness and they are able to answer questions which is something not often seen nowadays
You know this place was actually not bad but one thing i will never stand is when the staff take themselves for granted and act like we have nothing better to do
The restaurant staff that I encountered was non-friendly non-welcomy and probably non-existent
I also saw something not very nice; a waiter recycling butter from a table
The staff was attentive yet not overbearing and more than knowledgable about their product--an obvious result of strong management training
The first time I ordered it I thought it was absolutely perfect  Nice and spicy pasta done al dente some crunchy corn strips for texture
Other times I've ordered it seemed less spicy but still good
Great product I'd order from them again if I needed a second door for my house
I always have an issue with slow service especially when considering that the dining room is half empty
We ordered a pizza last night because I am a bad wife and haven't gone grocery shopping
It was a bit slow being later on a Sunday night and all but it was perfect not to loud so we could talk and lots of attention from the wait staff
The service was great it probably helped that my friend was somewhat of a regular there once upon a time
After dinner we moved to the patio they sent out some lemonchello and a strawberries and creme dessert very nice and very yummy
Breakfast can also be ordered from a menu of hot items for an additional cost
This location is never too busy clean staff is friendly and quick
The service was a little over-attentive but the guy was sweet and obviously trying his best
One of my coworkers also ordered the spaghetti which she said was great as well
Somehow I have the feeling that anything we could have ordered would have been great
The guy that picked up the phone has poor customer service and rude
Granted I have only been legal for a few months Always having a casual close spot has been a haven for everything from quick meals to special events just had a fabulous birthday dinner there with fantastic fried food and a friendly wait staff
If you want my recommendation order the pollo con queso its just some nice little chicken burros covered in melted cheese and for the grand finale globed with spicy cream cheese
That plus a hugeormous selection of beer and amazing service equals a great meal
Sometimes the service is great sometimes just good depends on the day
Had I not been in a hurry I would have brought this to the manager's attention instead of throwing away food which may have been very good under other circumstances
The fish dinner is good and Brittany the waitress even better I'm a big fan
Awesome service great menu quiet dining room with low music playing in background  and patio seating available but no great view
Her friendly smile greets you as you come and her fab customer service is much appreciated
Now some friends have had some bad experiences with service
They were so nice they came to the door let us in and got us drinks until they were ready to open what service
Since she was waitressing we enjoyed a nice leisurely 3 hours or so eating and drinking at this brand new spot
For dessert we had some decadent chocolate/espresso thing that was soooooo good
This location is usually pretty busy but good thing is that the service is pretty fast and the food quality is still good
There was about 5 customers and the service was quick and friendly
The waitress was friendly but didn't seem to appreciate or acknowledge much of the friendly conversation my fiance sparked up during the ordering process
There's often a semi-long wait for a table here but that's generally always a good sign - The staff are always personable and attentive even when the place is packed
almost all the staff was nice but found the nighttime front desk people a bit rude but the daytime people and valets are super nice
My waiter was very good although was FAR more attentive to the tables with four people than he was even to the tables with two people
While I am only 36 years old I had a great deal of difficulty seeing the details of my meal while I was eating it and the waiter actually used a flashlight to illuminate it as it was being served to me so that I could see what I paid for
I ordered their breakfast-y enchilada and it was pretty amazing
Willie is probably the best breakfast waiter we've ever had
Now we specifically ask for his section because I think as diners it's our responsibility to reward good wait staff
Alas the prices had climbed too high the food wasn't as good as we remembered and the service sucked they got my husband's order wrong and the rest is history
The restaurant is more of a order at the counter fast food looking atmosphere
The staff was really friendly and I can't get enough of the bollywood music videos
Sushi Ken is a bright cheery place with good service and great food
The service is meh although I must say the woman tending the bar was quite quick and capable and even a bit friendly they're out of most of the things they offer and the food
Service is always very prompt and they're very nice as well
The staff was very friendly and the owner even through in a small container for me to sample their hummus
If you like more City style chinese food I do suggest Nee House although their  service sucks Prime on Camelback Jade Palace is pretty good Hong Kong House on Mcdowell and for a nostalgic kick in the ass with relatively good ChinaTown dishes try Dragon Palace
The gift shop staff while friendly could certainly speed up the service a bit
The length of time of the meal should be dictated by the customer not by bad service
The food is good but I can always get the same thing down the street at Las Compadres with better service
The service is also slow but the workers are always friendly
The service at Lux is always friendly and often funny
The Roaring Fork is a beautiful restaurant with great service
I don't really bother rating fast food joints but this place won me with the customer service
The staff is hit and miss sometimes friendly sometimes not
The staff were all super friendly although also a bit hovering and constantly asking if I needed a dressing room better than no staff and having to wait for a room though
So there's not much more I can say besides that this service is friendly fast and correct
Next time we go back I think I want to order nothing but the bruschetta it was that good
food was good  staff was upbeat and we appreciated that they didn't hurry us even though we arrived at the closing bell
You can tell the staff goes above and beyond to make their patrons happy and they are very friendly
Their prices on frames and lenses are so reasonable and their staff does not care if you spend hours and literally I have probably put on and tried over 50% of their frames to see if I'd like it and if it would be good for me AKA my lenses would fit in it without it being too obvious that I'm Mrs
I was disappointed when I had ordered some chicken nuggets during breakfast hours for my kids and their manager refused to make them
Very good plate meals but don't go in expecting great service
Despite the service it's worth it for the great selection of dishes and sides
The waitress was very nice and attentive to our needs for several hours
The manager stepped in to help the server during a slight rush of people he was attentive and funny
Great food + great service = excellent dining experience
They get your order in quickly and get the food to you fast
Honest great selection great service while never feeling pressured and good prices
Inside you enter a 50's diner theme and the staff is amazing friendly
For it a slow night prompter service could've been given
I gave 2 stars because the only good thing about this place were the bloody Marys and the staff
I will definitely be going back for the great service and BBQ
I came here with my co-workers on a night that wasn't very busy and we had very good service but it was just slow enough that it was on the verge of being not-so-great service
We came there on November 5 2011 and the service was very bad
The chicken was great but the customer service was so bad we will never return again
-Hollywood glam posters on the wall -you push a button on your coaster it lights up then over pops the waiter with your refill -you can have a drink at the lounge while you wait for your film -there's an email listserv and you can get hooked up with deals 5 Cons -the food isn't great IT'S AWFUL tastes mass produced and bland -too expensive -slow service in the theater rude service upfront -you get graced with smoooooth jazz before the film starts yeah no really
They have tons of specialty martinis on their menu for you to choose from and service is usually pretty fast
I was dead tired at the end of my work day when I crashed here so I can't speak to the amenities however the room was cool the bed comfortable the staff friendly and the price was unbelievable
The food is delicious service is great and prices are low
We arrived around 6pm and were being called to be seated before we could even order a drink from the bar and no the bar was not slow
Our waitress was very nice and helpful and had that perfect I'm-here-when-you-want-me-but not-when-you-don't server presence
Surprise birthday dessert in room was a nice touchCon1
T'Cookes has not recaptured it's mojo from the glory years gone by - good service and food but it used to be head and shoulders above typical resort fare
Well lo and behold the reviews were spot on and the food was delicious the service was very good
I threw in a 4th star because we've had consistently great service there
We've had one waitress twice who is genuinely nice clearly doesn't hate her job and is on top of her game service-wise
Called into Zipcar customer service for instructions customer service rep was friendly efficient and pleasant - and provided me with instructions on how to handle the parking lot situation
The menu is filled with tons of items for vegetarians and the staff is friendly and fast
Our waitress was very friendly and prompt so I'll give them a second star for that
After reading all these great reviews I'm wondering if maybe I and my husband just ordered the wrong thing because we thought this place kind of sucked
It was nicely spiced and I wish I could have ordered more of it
Another thing I found to be flat here was the service which was generally inattentive and unfriendly
The staff is always friendly without being obnoxious and very accommodating
The service was pretty good I love that hipsters are bringing back the stache
I give the star for this guy -- however this business model is clearly about making money and they don't have to provide good customer service and they don't
We got 2 orders of Gyoza they were pretty good but very soggy
Our friends ordered chicken fried rice and a Philly roll they said both were good but they'd had better
The las vegas roll was actually very good but we had to scarf it down because they'd forgotten to make it for us we didn't see a waiter for at least 20 minutes after they dropped off the food and we were late for a movie
I'd rather pay more and have really good sushi and great service than put up with this place just for the all you can eat option
I've been a lot and have always had great food and good service
We had a nice waitress the iced tea was great and we ordered cheese crisps to start and as a table ordered beef chicken and shrimp fajitas along with a couple of sides of guacamole
The steak wasn't as good as I remember it and realized we didn't order the more expensive meat cadillac so that could be why
However the past two times I have been here I've gotten really bad service
Also the previous time I ate at Thai Rama the service was similarly bad
The point is  Carly's has decent food maybe a tad over-priced in this economy but hardly a deal-breaker the service is not great but not intolerably bad aside from First Friday of course and the vibe is actually quite good
It was soo good I wish I would have just ordered that
Service is extremely quick and friendly
They take the order fast and the food comes to the table 5 min later
So maybe once you know what to order it is not such a bad spot
Not so Jun was able to have a batch of rice made without the benito flake seasoning ordered us some fantastic veggie rolls using it and added a great veggie tempura sans animal product
My bottom line is this if you want good quality sushi and excellent service & attention then Sakana on Elliot is the place to go
I would say that it would as good as another deep dish pizza and if I wanted a deep dish pizza this is the place I would order it form but I don't think I will want another deep dish pizza
Since then I have been back quite a few times for various items and each time have encountered friendly staff
When I went last week I ordered one pizza from the MANY great options available and I have to say there is a reason it is called the California PIZZA Kitchen and not the California SALAD or PASTA Kitchen
the only thing I don't really like is the high price and the slow waitress
Decent service and overall good place especially for all you beer drinkers out there
Service was great as was the free shuttle to and from the airport
The staff was not too friendly I think that's the main reason why I even noticed such petty little things
It will certainly be on my list of regular stops if not just for the wonderful coffee good service cleanliness and FRIENDLINESS
The plum sauce was good but they are probably not something that I would recommend for anyone to order
Our friends ordered the beef green curry extra hot and thought that is was good too
Other than the spotty service which I am chalking up to a bad night and the skimpy Thai Rolls
We also ordered the truffle fries--SO GREAT
Good service three entrees one with side bacon a coffee tea and fresh OJ all for $40
However the front desk staff just has a bad attitude which I found amusing being as they all thought they were quite enlightened
Overall the food is good service is quick and the experience is laid back
I asked the friendly Thai waitress for some suggestions and she explained that you can order most of the entree items with your choice of meat or seafood or even tofu as your protein choice
It was a very quiet night and the service was a little slow but I was in no hurry
They were made to order and they were good
I'll go 4 just because of the overall visit friendly staff helped rate burger not
Friendly wait/server staff check really nice hard working folks
It's true service can be a little slow when they're busy but the staff is  always friendly
I ordered the Vigazz burger which was huge messy and oh so good
Although most of the staff was friendly we did have a pretty bad encounter with the pool manager
The attentive service and chic atmosphere boost the total up to 4
The service was good our waiter definitely knew the menu well and he was attentive throughout the evening and patient when our party was indecisive
There was a slight wait for our order but not too bad
Only thing to note is they were a bit disorganized the opening weekend as their register was not even working and the service was a bit slow
They always great you with a smile and work hard to make sure that you are satisfied with your order
The only reason this place even gets two stars is because of our waiter he was very nice and fairly attentive
The service was very friendly but highly inattentive
Though it's been stated that it's a order at the counter kind of place folks regularly came around to pick up extra plates and provide drink refills which was a nice unexpected touch
I made sure to leave a nice tip due to the great service
Other dim sum places are great but i tend to order alot of things that it's kinda pricey after picking too much stuff
And the staff a very friendly on letting you know what the dim sum varieties are
Cold popcorn service so bad that I had to remind them to get or soda and charge my card and return it to me
So basically the guacamole was good and the dessert was good
This time we were very pleased attentive friendly service which did not rush you
I cannot tell you what I ate since my friend did the ordering but everything was really good
This would also be a great place to order take out from
We walked in and got sat with a friendly waitress
I ordered the ham panini which was quite good; albeit just a bit small
But even when it's just me and my husband the service always seems slow
Not quite a five-star rating but I ate here Wednesday and the hostess/waitress was nice the food was served promptly
Dragon Palace provides quick thorough and friendly service
The customer service was very good our host/waiter was really on the ball and had excellent presence
My caterpillar roll was good but not the best but I 'd order again just because I like caterpillar rolls
Thought it was a cool local place with yummy burgers but really just a health scare with very poor service unless you sit at the bar - the bartenders are always great service
Other than that the entire meal and service was  good
Staff here is largely friendly and helpful
The service is consistently friendly and prompt
It was good though probably not something I'd order again as there are other things I like even better
The waitress was friendly and even with 6 of us we weren't waiting too long for food or service at all
Our waiter provided great service and checked on us frequently to refill our drinks
Unfortunately the service is generally pretty bad
We had some great sandwiches and sides plus fabulous desserts and took them back to poolside at our resort and gorged
the facilites are not nearly as nice as Camelback the food service sub par at best - while they did make it right - the fact that my friend ordered one thing and was given another and we complained to the waitress her response was oh I was curious at which one of you got the wrong order Really
He was a friendly ol' man who assumed I knew NOTHING about self-service machines
Great service good value and good sized portions
The family enjoyed the fried ratatouille that came with the wings so the waitress brought us two extra sides of it which was really nice
The service may have been a bit slow but the waitress was very nice and we didn't mind the slowness because we weren't trying to rush dinner
Beautiful environment energy efficient lighting helpful and friendly staff
The waiter was a great sport considering we had two comedians with us and put up with all of our silliness
Regardless the staff was still friendly the food was delicious and the drinks were still good
Our waitress Claire was very attentive and personable
Service is friendly although a bit slow but worth the wait
Somehow they managed to be friendlier more attentive to issues quick with any repairs and know your name all with a smaller staff than Alliance
As well as being a fantastic environment and atmosphere there is a great selection of microbrew beers the food there is really good and the bar staff are also very friendly welcoming and attentive
It was a really good selection at the breakfast bar and the staff who served me for breakfast were very polite and courteous which means a lot in a day and an age where 'pleases' and 'thank yous' are scarce
The service was great and the lunch deals cannot be beat
They have a great happy hour a friendly staff and a vast selection of draught beers
If you're a person that likes a good crowd live music friendly service decent food and great beer you should definitely go to Rosie's
In the past we've received good food and service at this location but yesterday was completely the opposite
We were too full to order dessert but I had a great decaf cappuccino and Hubby finished his glass of wine
We were sitting right next to the owners and if you can't get good service when sitting next to the big boss - it's a sign of trouble
We've seen staff and management come and go but we've remained loyal and actually have stayed good friends with many current and ex-employees who have become like family to us
But I and a dozen or so other regulars remained largely because of the friendly and efficient service of a few remaining long-time servers there along with a few awesome bartenders and wonderful bussers
For the handful of wonderful staff who remain--AND for the wings which are still great
Service slow drink coming out and entree
I am thinking the kitchen was a little slow and not so much the wait staff although they were a tad slow but of course we had a big group
BreakdownFood -      C            See above Service -  B            Service was good and efficient
If I had read these other reviewers review I would probley not come here but i had also stumbled in one day for lunch and thought the food was decent but my wife and i went last nite for dinner and had the baba ganough which was goodi make better we split the mix grill which is pleanty for 2  and also ordered the falafels which i liked as well and we took a to go container home with enough for a nice snack
3*- Sides cole slaw hard & under season corn on the cob soggy & sweet potato fries nothing specialI feel really bad for the one waitress running all over the place
The pizza's are all very good whether you order something from their speciality menu or build one yourself
That being said I will say that the Black Angus on McDowell Rd in Goodyear has never served me bad food and only 1 in the many times I have ate there did I get bad service and that really wasn't the waitresses fault but rather the family in the booth next to us was letting there 3 year old run around the restaurant with a stake knife even going so far as to run into the kitchen and climb into our booth and hit my husband at which point we asked to be moved
Then and even though the staff showed us other available rooms that we would have been more than happy to switch to the manager would do nothing about it and could not have been more rude
I always tip at least 20% if not more when the service is good
The other sad thing is that we spent a good part of our dining conversation talking about where we should have gone for better Chinese food and service
- 1 one star just for playing i think your tractors sexyTHe Good the hot under clothed Waitresses where aculy nice
Our waiter has served us three times now and he is attentive and helpful without being intrusive

Additionally their service is always friendly and attentive and their prices are reasonable
Service was good and drinks were refilled as needed
The rest of the staff was extremely attentive and friendly to boot
The staff was very friendly and not pushy in the least
I could tell she felt bad for me and she mentioned something to the guys in the kitchen before I ordered
If you want fantastic food with great service really nice people and dirt cheap prices this is where you want to go
The guacamole was good definitely not the best I've ever had but worth ordering
The service was very warm and friendly literally like a family welcoming me into their home
The servers that come down to the lanes have always been nice attentive and on-top of your order
com/408gd  has an impressive beer selection both on draft and in bottles very friendly staff and the place itself is very interesting
Everything was great though services was a little slow but I assume that has to do with the old-school vibe of the place dark booths lots of gray hair and an old-school attention to detail and the thought that dining should be an experience enjoyed throughout the evening not 50 minute race for the check
I highly recommend this place the food tasted fresh service was awesome and the place also played good music
The food was good however some stations were out of food before I got to them drinks were affordable crowd was mixed live band played a nice variety of music and the staff was very accomodating
I think it's hilarious one reviewer here said staff was overly friendly
that means not fussing with waiter or  waiting for service and you eat good but quick3
I don't mind waiting especially for good food and if the food is great and the service isn't I will always come back
Not only were they friendly the day of service each of the next week we were recognized when we went to the farmer's market that is in the center and Next had a table set up
I ordered a sundae and it was a good portion size along with good amount of nuts on top
I had no idea what to order so I ordered the Nutella Crepe and the breakfast burrito crepe
The breakfast burrito is pretty good too and I would definitely order it again
I'm pretty sure anything you order here is going be great so check it out the first chance you get
Some of the machines are out of service from time to time but that's mainly because they are being repadded/reupholstered which is a good thing
Services were marvelous and the goodie bags on the way out were just icing on the cake
masscotte is pretty rude so we no longer will see her but other than her the staff at banfield is great
Its really nice too because they give you a printout of services they suggest for your pet with prices so you can choose what you want and what You can afford
Twenty minutes in I was getting up to leave when waitress finally asked if I wanted a beer a 3 dollar pbr wasn't bad so I figured why not
More than anything the staff is very friendly and accommodating
My co-worker mentioned that last time he had eaten at Chakra he had ended up having a nearly 2-hour lunch because of the slow service
Service was good drinks were filled consistently and the staff even apologized that some food wasn't as fresh due to lack of customers
The owner and staff are some of the nicest people you will ever encounter
The owner took our order he was very friendly and helpful
This place just reopened today after closing for a quick remodel so maybe being closed for a couple of weeks has made them forget how to give good customer service
The pad see ew was not good so either I shouldn't order it next time or if I want something charred that's what I should get
The service was really good and the prices were fabulous
Great selection of music and instruments unfortunately you have to deal with a staff that is insulting and rude or worse
I have spent  a lot of money there through the years renting instrument for my children taking them in for lessons and buying music and it always surprises me when staff is rude to their customer base
I do think the music repair staff are nice and do excellent work and the are always helpful
Try this place the service is friendly and the ambiance is relaxed and warm - definitely a great place for a date
I used to work across the street from here and would stop in from time to time for a great happy hour occasional employee lunch for my staff or a special occasion dinner from time to time
My only other complaint is that our waitress was a bit slowing in refilling our water and bringing a box along with our check
The Lux experience offers great prices delicious drinks and a friendly staff
The moist cake and the delectable cream cheese frosting blend together nicely to make a perfectly sweet dessert
Eugenia you are a food goddess and your staff is friendly and very professional
Bad staffing doesn't even begin to cover it
Wrote a review on Southwest's Rapid Rewards Dining site and got contacted by the manager apologizing for the bad experiences
I thought - WOW that is not consistent with the service received at all - what a great way to step up and take ownership of your restaurant
Their foods is good and service is OK
Thankfully the cook was nice enough to suggest that I should get the chili on the side if I was ordering to go so I still got home with decent food and not a soggy mess
It's a fun place especially at night when the Cougars are out and on the hunt - great for people watching and relaxing but I think the drink ordering moment proved so uncomfortable for our server that she left us high-and-dry for the rest of the evening
Skip the reviews that reference anything about bad service
-- Good warm bread; accompanying olive oil was herbaceous and handily decanted from a table-set bottle-- Da Beau ordered a starter of peeled
Again pay no attention to the reviews here about bad service
Waitresses were nice enough but wow S L O W service
Same embarrassingly slow service in getting our check to leave
I was in good company both times and had plenty of time to spend so the slow service was not an issue but it could be a problem if you have other plans
ordered the #1 super beef with rice noodle bowl from the nice older gentleman who was constantly moving expediting aromatic orders of pho that were being churned out of the kitchen
I caved and went to thank the owner for the great meal - before ordering a second bowl The seafood egg noodle
Little things like the 21% service charge AUTOMATICALLY added onto the already outrageous breakfast $17 for a buffet - and not even any custom order options - all out of steam trays
Full at the end great  portion sizes and great service
The service was extremely slow and we were forgot about when sitting at the Sushi Bar

So now you have a sort of lack-luster menu of various burgers steaks chops and ribs none of which really stand out and service tends to be kinda slow
not bad considering how many WIN places I've found otherwise ****Also- looking at the picture of the menu their combo prices seem to be a MUCH better value than just purchasing full chickens or full orders of Carne asada
Both meals I had were good - in the smaller cafe for lunch and room service breakfast
Service is fortunately better in a bad economy
Second our waitress was neither attractive nor anywhere close to friendly
It's good to know that there are some people who can still provide great customer service in the fast food industry
I would give them five stars but there have been a couple times where the service has not been great probably high season and new waitstaff and one time that we got a pizza for pick up that was so disgusting we couldn't even eat it
Anytime an establishment is run by an owner it tends to be great friendly service
Overall their customer service is excellent and their staff knowledgeable and friendly
The decor is modern and the ordering set up is like a fast food joint wait in line order find a seat and wait for your food
Just to echo previous comments the service is slow and inattentive despite having only two tables occupied; the other table became irate and were offered free drinks
The service was ok not exceptional but good
The rooms were clean and comfortable the staff was all helpful and friendly and the lobby was cool
Great customer service our server Joey knew what he was talking about and just what to recommend
Excellent service they were able to get me in for a same-day appointment great staff everyone had a friendly smile for me and my dog knowledgeable doctor Dr

Heres why Freshest fishUnassuming genuinely nice chefs and staffamazing priceshuge selectionfast
What has won me over  fresh chewy breads the mgr who is bussing tables alongside the rest of the staff the bussers themselves are friendly a microwave if you have to heat up small kid's food even a courtesy phone
*shrug*This place wasn't terrible and the waiter/owner was attentive but I won't be going back; I just didn't enjoy the food that much
While the food at Sol Y Sombra wasn't complicated it was certainly yummy and the service was surprisingly given the cool vibe and the beautiful people -- I mean the staff not just the customers totally relaxed and friendly

The service is usually great at LGO-casual but efficient-the way we like it
Service was friendly and competent even though we didn't stick around long enough to really enjoy it

The staff is friendly and knowledgeable they have helped me make a few selections when I was unsure of what to get
Friendly bar staff wait staff could be quicker more outgoing they're aiight thoough lol
I usually order the same thing  Meat and Eggs which all consists of the following    * 2 Strips of maple smoked bacon    * 2 eggs prepared to order    * A pile of potatoes    * 2 buttermilk pancakes    * One cup of EPIC coffeeThe bacon is very good
If you want a nice place to hang out and have dessert while watching some music videos of the lightweight pop variety at all hours of the night this is a winner
The service wasn't bad but not steller as I would except for a $700 meal 4 people and booze includedThey are suppose to have another bar and water feature up stairs on the 3rd level they were at capacity so we were not allowed to check it out
However the service was lacking and frankly a little rude
This location is very clean the staff super friendly and we were seated immediately upon arriving at 11am on a Easter Sunday
For dessert they provided a nice dessert wine so we could toast our anniversary

The service has always been excellent very friendly and professional service staff
Good thing their service is quite fast so it cleared out pretty quickly
It's bad enough when you get poor service but when the manager lies about sending the waitress home
Drinks water and a beer took a good ten minutes to arrive after our waitress took the order
Food was likewise slow- partly because she made a second trip to the table to re-write the orders again
That is because of the amazing serendipity that landed my new condo not 30 yards away from a restaurant with superb food quaint atmosphere friendly servers orgasmic desserts and for the cherry on top BYO motha f***in' B

It's slow to get your food but at least you know it's made to order
Service was good though we were pouring our own Pelligrino throughout the meal - I thought hey i guess they don't pour the water refills here OK - until the  very end when she started pouring for us
We also ordered the pork lab this was good chicken satay peanut sauce was bland and thin and cucumber salad did not have much flavor and yellow curry thumbs up
Everything on the menu looked fantastic but I decided to be good and order trout with glazed carrots instead of pasta or fried fish with fries
Every time I have gone my pita has been dry thin and tasteless; the fillings have been sub-par at best; and the service has been present in body but not in mind something I won't hold against them personally it generally comes with fast food
Their offices are so high tech and the staff is so nice
Service was always right on attentive not intrusive
The deco is simple but cute and the staff is attentive
The good part of it was that I was no longer at Dirty Pretty god I hate nightclubs so I was actually excited to be in a regular bar order a cocktail and chill by the bar

On top of it the owner wait staff and crew are incredibly nice
The service has gotten a little more spotty as of late even when they are slow late at night
Reasons to take part- VERY friendly staff and instructors- clean and spacious facility- make it very easy for beginners to - community feel where everyone is looking out for your best interests- amazing full body workout
The prices were great and the service was decent
Then they have the audacity to say they didn't get good service because they asked for a table inside at 7 pm on a Friday night after reserving an outside table
I now know the owners of this bar and they are very very cool and they love great music of all kinds and the staff is fun
Their service is always friendly but they get distracted or confused or just lost can't quite figure it out
The staff was pretty good they treated my dog with care and I think they did everything pretty quickly drop off at 730am and pick up at 300
My cat is due for a checkup soon so I may be using their services again shortly because I was please with my visit and Roi has been doing great since the surgery healed quickly and never winced in pain
Our bartender/waiter was so nice and attentive and he was just great
He sits down and I tell him how slow and frustrated I am with his service
On a trip down to the valley from Flagstaff I stopped by and was amazed to find such friendly and happy Swedes in the middle of the Arizona desert hiding close to ASU in Tempe where I spent my first years in the US after moving from Sweden in 2000
The staff was attentive friendly and professional but not intrusive
The service view and strawberry lemonade here are really great
We always sit at the bar the bartenders are really friendly and give great service
Secondly I babysit my 2 year old cousin quite a bit and she loves picking out topping here for her yogurt and the staff are always extremely nice to me and her even though she sometimes takes a bit to decide what she wants
The cafeteria'-like ambiance and small tables are awkward for business and because the place is always packed service is slow but always friendly with the exception of the vapid 16 year old hostesses
The service was attentive although the atmosphere was pretty quiet
The wait staff is friendly and attentive and I will definitely be going back
As the bus boy was getting us water/chips/salsa the waiter in pseudo friendly way asks two margaritas ladies

I am probably a horrible person to give my opinion on what good Chinese food is so I'll offer up my take on the service and ambiance of the place without pretending to know what I'm talking about in regards to how the food tasted
The service is fast the food is authentic and the atmosphere is fun
Service was not friendly but not exactly unfriendly either
Staff including supervisor Donny said too bad can't help you Southwest is an independent airline and we don't work with other airlines to accommodate delays

The staff was friendly but somewhat MIA
The atmosphere is cool and trendy but the service is a little slow

Outdoor patio is great when weather permits and if you can't get an outside table the doors open almost all the way up so get a table on the border and you can still enjoy it
The food is always delicious the drinks are always delightful the service has never failed to be friendly and inviting and the restaurant is always clean
;Service at this location has always been quick efficient and the servers know how to chit-chat while having a good time
The bottom line is Sassy Glasses is good for people with minor vision issues who want to look hip in their glasses but people who need serious optometry services should look elsewhere
Service 5/5 I don't recall ever waiting for a check or a drink for too long and even when the occasional mix up happens they remedy it promptlyPricing I would really expect to pay more for food this good
And I ordered the shrimp salad which was very very good
So I have eaten at this place twice and the reason I give it 2 stars is primarily the atmosphere and very friendly staff
We got bottle service up by the pool and they were nice enough to find us another table downstairs when it began to rain
And it's no surprise why; great food good ambiance and attentive service
I ordered an egg and cheddar cheese bagel sandwich on a sesame bagel I was jazzed I could get the breakfast sandwich at lunchtime with a garden salad to go

Fast food/healthy mexican is something we could all use a bit more of in our lives if ya ask me - but so is their service
The bread is quite good and so are the desserts
If they were really a bad place as the others make it sound I don't understand why there would be over twenty bikes and atv's in back getting serviced
Everything was great had no room for dessert and i didn't even finish 1/2 my baby back order
The food is great - I had to take a way a star for service
It's another order at the front and have a seat fast food type place
The workers aren't rude they always get your order right and a few times I've gone they've tossed us some freebies
Service has been very good so far and  myself and my guests have enjoyed the food very much
Scale of 1-10 multiple visits10 Food10 Service8 Atmosphere8 ValueNumerous times since Verde shut its doors have I sat eyes glazed over longing absent mindedly for a good horchata
I have never experienced the slow service that they are referring to
Second time same scenario but we were treated to an order of the breakfast nachos for having to wait so long
Did not really get to much because I  was not that hungry but will say this about the place it was clean the staff was friendly and knowledgeable and the bits and pieces I did try from picking at my friends food was good
The pizza is as good as I have had here in the valley and if you go on a weeknight there is no wait and the service is so fast and friendly there is not one thing to complain about
Fast and friendly service clean restrooms a really sweet Thai mom at the counter all make Thai Basil well deserving of 5 stars

My wife ordered an egg bagel with strawberry cream cheese and I opted for a breakfast burrito
I ordered them hot and they had good kick
Overall the food was good and I would order pizza and salad from here again
The waitress was very attentive and the order prepared perfectly by the kitchen
She had no idea about good customer service or customer retention
It supposedly was good for about 7 different 30 min trial services including hair removal facials and some other girly stuff
She is very dissastisfied with the service yet feels obligated to leave a good tip the gift card urges it and winds up spending more in gas and time than its worth - what a dissapointment
It's too bad because she really has been wanting full hair removal service and now we gotta find another place
We have always sat at the bar and have gotten very good service from the bartenders
makes ordering a treat for the eyes and a treat for the tastebuds if you choose to buy some goodies
WHY you askService_Fast_Throw any variations or complicated instructions at them your dish will still come out perfect
Absolute power breakfast and came out exactly as ordered
Please go to The Place if you are down for great food great service great prices
I'm gonna add to the growing list of previous reviewers who have also had great service at 25th Street Automotive by giving it a well deserved 5 stars

The food is above average and the service is great
The staff has great attention to detail and they are personable
I was initially vary of the service from earlier reviews but our waitress was attentive and made out taco selections for us
Although they have some preparation inconsistencies there are at least one to two waitresses that are very attentive even on heavy Game days
The cheese & charcuterie platter was fabulous but the steak & onion soup was the rogue menu addition and bad order choice great steak but processed onion flavor
The service was also good but the food just didn't hold up
Great as a side dish; so _glad_ I ordered them on the side
It's very pretty inside and the staff is very friendly
The Manager was nice enough to make his very own concoction for free to have my hubby try it at home
Overall the staff was very courteous and the sub was great
I have visited this location many times and although I have always ordered the same thing Jambalaya I have a great dining experience each time as the food is always excellent and the service is terrific
The thalis combo platters are affordable not sure how the meat version is but the veggie option is a good start if you miss the lunch buffet and are at a loss after going to so many single-option vegetarian restaurants it's quite easy to forget how to order
Upon arrival I was greeted by one of the staff and he was great
Service was great though there weren't many patrons to serve
Another great asset you can opt for table service but can also just order right at the counter
Dessert was tiramasu which was pretty nice as well
Some of the wait staff are very rude and yet some are very friendly
I wish some of the rude wait staff would quit or get fired because they give the place a bad rep
They do have a good manager who is helpful with customer requests
The service was excellent attentive and well paced
One more tip Zinc you may want to get the mall janitor to move his trash can from the view of your utmost beatiful courtyard such promise undelivered due to tacky flaws that could have been prevented by an attentive manager or even a caring waite staff
Even the service and ambiance is perfectly female - oh and before I forget the baked goods that greet you as you walk in the front door seem to fit my waistline better than the date I would never bring there anyway
The staff when we go anywhere from 6pm-midnight is usually friendly and the store itself is always clean
I was kind of bummed that I would not be able to get my glass of raspberry ice tea they no longer serve it but our waiter was quick to point out that they do serve a tropical ice tea which was really good
My cousin ordered the BBQ ribs which she said were smokey and really good
Anyone who knows me knows that bad service is a deal breaker when deciding if and when I will return to a place but when it comes to eating here I guess I have to bend if not brake my own rule lol
Wait staff is mostly cute college girls which is hardly ever a completely bad thing
Never had a problem with good attentive service which CAN be a problem sometimes
Service is fast and friendly and everything always seems organized and clean
Their order up front and wait for your food at your table makes it a quick way to have a nice sit down breakfast with your family without the wait of regular sit-down restaurants

The smiling good looking staff make it a great place to chit chat with friends and spend a happy evening hanging out
the service is somewhat short and borderline rude at times
I visited Joe's Diner shortly after it opened and I couldn't be more pleased Fun kitschy diner du00e9cor tasty lunch-counter menu items and friendly wait staff that buzzed constantly around the customers all at very attractive prices
When I went back to the counter I went over my order slowly thinking it would be right
Great service and they have a reverse happy hour that has 1/2 price apps
With fewer people in the restaurant at that time service was relatively fast
The staff is always super-friendly and the joint is packed at lunch time despite being in an otherwise almost completely dead strip mall that isn't doing anything to help draw in new blood
The waitstaff was friendly and attentive although my visit was 8pm on a Sunday and we were the only guests
The service can be spotty previously Maria-Maria they're still a fairly new establishment but the great atmosphere and food makes up for it
The service was fast and the two employees I dealt with were wonderful
The great surprise was the baked beans that I ordered with my prime rib sandwich
His service was OK but how bad can it be to ask for a side and it takes 10 minutes onions for a hamburger take 10 minutes and again they forgot the pickles
Service was friendly and let my co-workers & I enjoy a nice quiet meal
Which is good because the nice waiter was super busy
Lots of yelpers mentioned the cramped style and slow service
I ordered seafood linguini and it was really good
They always seem to keep this place pretty clean and the staff has always been friendly
I came here about a week ago for the first time for a family dinner and they offered a 3 course fixed price menu for $25 which is a very good deal considering if you ordered from the regular menu one entree can cost you $25
We loved it so much that we decided to order another to take home and it still tasted great the second day
The reception desk was rude the waitstaff was so confused and had an attitude  about her mistake
Seriously the baristas can be really nice and sweet which is surprising considering the entitled Tukee non-tip leaving catty housefrau brigade that probably makes their jobs less than pleasant during the day but the overwhelming mediocrity of this place sucks the benefit out of the service's presence at this location
The food came fast and it was made to order
The employees there are friendly and VERY helpful - we actually had an issue regarding the billing for our room and one of the managers stepped in and resolved it very quickly
The service is understandably slow if it gets at all busy
The service was okay attentive at times yet forgetful
The staff is now much faster and on the ball and on top of it
Service was great and everyone seemed pretty friendly there
The staff was great the service was top notch

Their happy hour is one of the best in Phoenix and they have enough going on for them that as long as the mediocre service isn't disrupting my enjoyment of a glass of wine then we're good
the staff are very attentive and do very well considering the vast wine list
The staff is nice the dishes are well crafted and attractive
Lettuce onions pickles tomato The service was not good
The second time I went in the service was equally as bad
5I've had great service everytime I've been here
The girl at the register was really nice and helpful and took our orders after answering all of our questions
I feel bad for this place because you can tell they spent a ton on it but unless their service dramatically improves I can not see this place keeping its doors open for very long
I tried several cookies for dessert and all were good
The staff was friendly and the service was great
The service was very good as we were immediately seated
The ambiance and service was great but the food was amazing
Royal is staffed with helpful perky people who seem to offer a smile or nice word regardless of how busy it is
95/day uncovered $2 extra for covered- drivers and gate staff have always been friendly genuine and customer-service oriented- spot is safe and close to the airport for a quick shuttle ride even if you're running late- point redemption is easy if you have an Executive card and an online account- free USA Today and cold water bottle on entry & exit- driver always gives you a reminder card for where you parked your car life saver
Green curry is another favorite but I had one bad experience with it there watery and no flavor so I rarely order it
The staff is very friendly and accomodating
The atmosphere was nice and the wait staff was friendly
The staff is incredibly friendly especially Chris and the owner Eric who you can see bopping around from table-to-table making sure the guests are taken care of
In additional to the great atmosphere delicious high-quality food great drink prices outstanding happy hour warm and attentive service they also have GREAT hours especially for an Asian restaurant
He was genuinely friendly conversational and his service was A+
Great experience in customer service quality coffee good ice cream and local business
Service was not great either with servers running all over the place but none of them actually caring about the people they were serving
Okay the only reason I'm not giving this place a complete 5 star is because of the I'm too good to be serving you waitress we got
Sometimes patrons try a place out and its just a bad day - the kitchen is off the waiters are slammed the manager just got divorced
Since OW is a dive I'm not expecting great service
Now I ask you fellow Yelpers when a place gives you bad food and bad service - what rating are you supposed to give them
The ambiance inside is pretty unmemorable and the service inside was not that great either
Staff is nice but seem to know less about the beer than the customers I was served by reletively new employees
The waitress Heather took good care of us - and soon my attention turned to sake
The service is great and we were able to speak with both owners on the two occasions we stopped in definitely not our last time visiting They are great guys and had no problem stopping what they were doing to chat with us
So 5 stars for great service great time and nice decor AND its in the downtown Phoenix scene theres so much to do there and now theres bowling
Both times the service has been good and we did not have to wait
I ordered the #16 check out the picture which features a nice plate of injera the spongy bread that is so much fun to play with and on top had three different kinds of meat
The gals attending there were friendly and attentive and quick they did not have that same airport worker drone attitude that big airport service employees have
Very impressed for an airport establishment when this type of quality is usually not the case Friendly staff bright and fresh salad with plenty of ingredients great wine
The staff is friendly and they make everything to order
The service was fast and friendly and they were even able to wrangle Thing 1 and Thing 2 sitting at the table next to us bringing them food quickly and cleaning up their mess upon leaving
I never eat donuts because I feel like they're a dessert that you should eat at breakfast and I don't ever feel like desserts at breakfast
Well my husband had just gotten a PR at the Fiesta Bowl Half Marathon and I'm pregnant so that clearly justifies desserts at breakfast
I've been here twice and although the food and prices were good employee discount I've had two very opposite experiences in terms of the customer service
great now I'm going to cause a scene because she'll either A not want to move and tell me to leave they have one of those we reserve the right to refuse service to anyone signs plastered right by the cash register - lol or B give me a cold stare to strike fear in my veins before she moves
In summary the food is pretty good the prices are great average without the employee discount the food comes out pretty quick and the customer service is definitely very YMMV
The service is surprisingly good and I always appreciate that
As far as the service goes everyone is always SUPER friendly
The staff is very friendly and nice and go out of their way to be helpful
Obviously they need to staff better because you could tell he was getting flustered and was blatantly rude to a couple of the customers ahead of me
im not a sandwich person and this place doesnt have the good italian pastas that i would order
Joe our server was attentive quick with refills-always a plus especially when I go nonalcoholic and offered helpful suggestions and information when it came time to order
Very nice atmosphere with exceptional service
Service is usually not bad but the workers can be unfriendly at times
They have wonderful service with friendly effective waiters and chefs fantastic food and very reasonable prices
If you're in the area and you're looking for a nicer place to have dinner especially dessert then this is your place
The food tastes fresh the sauces are good but not overpowering to the dishes and the service is great
I could eat tons of them for my entire meal but I don't ;Some of the dishes we've ordered weren't so great here but that's just personal preference
Largely unaware of the logistics of CPC - whether you seat yourself or wait to be seated and whether you order at the counter or at a table I stood and watched for a moment before deciding to seat myself and within moments a friendly young woman named Hannah greeted me first offering a beverage - just water - and subsequently the restaurant's extensive menu which I browsed at length while listening to The Sex Pistols and then The Clash play overhead
Reading as I waited and enjoying the room as well as watching the team slice meat shape dough and chop vegetables it would be just under a quarter hour before my dish arrived and although smaller than I'd imagined I definitely could have eaten two - probably three if I didn't have dessert and dinner plans the Shepherd's Pie that was presented was far better than I'd have ever expected a golden buttery shell wrapped around lightly mint tinged lamb and although fatty and intense nicely balanced by the vegetables
Debating a second pasty as Hannah returned to check in on me The Pilgrim sounds quite good but subsequently turning my attention to the sweeter half of the menu I decided to not make the same mistake twice and inquiring as to which dessert she recommended I went with my gut and ordered two to arrive with a delay between them the first Shirley Temple's Pudding a $6 sticky toffee pudding served in a cast iron pot with a side of cru00e8me anglaise
Moving next to my second dessert and for my tastes the better of the two a goodly delay of fifteen minutes brought to the table Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding with vanilla ice cream - a truly unique spin on bread pudding made with what almost seemed to be cracker-thin pieces of bread juxtaposing a brandy tinged chocolate sauce and baked much like the sticky toffee pudding to be set at the edges yet dense and moist at the center
They're a few more bucks than a Filiberto's  but they take your order at the table and the food is served on a plate   good quality ingredients and plenty of it
We walked through a medal detector just like in airport security and the staff was friendly
The stadium was very clean and the staff was really friendly and helpful
Service was friendly too and the ambiance was pleasant
Service is always good and friendly though they could afford to hire more people as the wait for drinks when being served is usually long
Aside from having an awesome facility - they have an awesome staff that is extremely friendly and helpful
The hats were of good quality and they have a website where you can order them as well
Service is just okay they are never rude but it's nothing fantastic
I came here on a Tuesday and ordered the beef noodle soup it was good but the soup was lacking the complexity of flavors and the beef wasn't as tasty and tender as the ones we have in Taiwan
Fresh seafood fun atmosphere great service
Slow service followed by one meal not showing up with the others did not make a good first impression
The service is always great except it is consistently hard to get the bill
The beer selection is good and the staff are great and very friendly
you eat a good meal and then shop it off;  I ordered the grilled cheese and tomato soup
Otherwise the service was fast and friendly and I will surely stop in again in the future
Decor & Service  2/5 below average Cafe is a good way to describe this place's decor style and ordering method
Nice little place very clean and solid service

2 The staff is friendly 3 Bowling is fun

All around a good experience service was fine and the hostess was very friendly a nice plus in Old Town
Each section of the menu is mirrored in English and Spanish and the service is fast and friendly
The bartender Carmela was really nice and gave us service with a smile
Great views 2 TVs great service and plenty of room to sit from bar tables and chairs to couches
The manager at this establishment Pam kicked me out because her bad excuse for a waitress Kate Lynch was so inappropriate as to tell my friends mean things about me
We also ordered a milk shake that's a pretty fuckin good milk shake
That being said the wine is good the staff is friendly and they have good live music on Friday's
Don't order your typical Indian restaurant favorites like palak paneer it wasn't good here
But over all the staff members there and the manager for that matter are as rude  pretentious and second rate as they come
The atmosphere is excellent staff always helpful prices are good and the place is ACTUALLY organized
Poor service incredibly slow ticket times two order mess-ups and a FREEZING cold dining room made for a horrible lunch experience
Every person of the service staff we encountered was very nice and helpful
I would encourage the managers to be more aware of this as well it would have been nice for one of them to take the initiative and ask about quieting the child for their other customers
Usually I have had good food and service but this time it was just ok
Everyone was very polite and nice but we ordered the onion ring tower as an appetizer but it was brought halfway through dinner but he did make up for it by taking it off the bill =This time I ordered the teriyaki chicken sandwich which was completely messy and just tasted ok
With our voiuchers we each ordered a aguas frescas I thought the sweeter pineapple definitely triumphed the orange but both were really good
It was good but even with both of us sharing it we weren't even able to finish this rich dessert
The service was good; quick friendly but nothing that truly stood out
Staff is very friendly bartenders are generous prices are good
Chili dog was just bad and so was the brat that my husband ordered
-breakfast burrito with chorizo on the side quite bland actually and required a lot of their salsa-carnitas and carne asada tacos-eggs & chorizo plate Service was great and they made sure our waters and coffees were filled
While placing our orders our server provided helpful information which ultimately resulted in my decision to share my large portioned breakfast burrito since I wasn't very hungry
Service is generally good although sometimes they seem to have a problem keeping tables cleared
The good news is that the menu is still the same and the service is still great
Overall Pei Wei's awesome for great service and customizable food options so I recommend it as a relatively yummy and painless lunch break from work
But this time I was left very disappointed The store always seems very clean and the staff does seem nice
Overall an impressive setup with great food that can be reasonably priced if you order correctly and have your cocktails someplace else
I ordered some raviolis that weren't bad to the taste but three or four average sized raviolis aren't gonna do much for a brother who wants to leave somewhere not hungry anymore
Just don't expect much other than decent food and fairly good service
Evidently the service issues here are related to the owner's inability to hang on to good talent
The trainers and desk staff are so friendly and truly care about creating a positive fitness environment for everyone
My experience with the service was really good
It is clean the staff are friendly and the location is very convenient right off the light rail stop 3rd Street/Washington or 3rd Street/Jefferson depending on the direction you're coming from
Go here if you like your food cold your card overcharged your waitress rude and your customer service idiotic
It's tacky rude and awful customer service to send the same generic premade email to all of us
We had the burrata very creamy and great flavor the pretzel and fondue not bad at all but doesn't compare with Windsor's and an order of bread and olive oil
We found the staff very laid back and friendly knowledgeable and fun to speak with
Meaning if you are looking for FANTASTIC food that is real for good prices and GREAT service this is the place
This review is based on nail services by AngieFirst of all when I called to inquire about nail services and nail techs the receptionist was very nice friendly and patient with all of my questions
I've been going to this place for years and I'm on my forth time of telling myself to never go back due to the frustrating slow service
I'm sure at some point I'll cave in and return if I can't find a replacement deli but it sure would be great if they could improve the service
The services overall was terribly slow even as the restaurant was beginning to empty
The service has been less than good on all occassions but the happy hour pricing and great food makes it worth the try
However this hotel is really what you see is what you get there is no room service though there are a variety of sandwiches appetizers snacks and pastries available for purchase in the lobby and they do provide a free continental breakfast
Don't get me wrong though; the food and service was all great but it's just difficult to swallow a $10+ price on a half-and-half lunch combo
The staff are actually pretty good with a few notable exceptions
But usually the floor staff are helpful - if a little slow on the cash register - and they can always tell you plenty about upcoming releases and such
I'd say this would be a good time to check out the pastries but depending on how busy HS gets you may want to place all of your order selections in the beginning and get it over w/
The service is really nice and they offer honest suggestions
My brother took us here while we were visiting him in town and the scenery was breathtaking the service was fantastic thanks to our awesome server Dennis and the food was very good

The slow-as-molasses-on-a-glacier service
The food and service has been hit and miss over the past few years ranging from pretty good to disasterous
It was also nice sitting on the patio considering the weather is so pretty and the staff was attentive and friendly and slightly charming with their loafers and novelty socks is that part of the required uniform I wonder
Would be great to sit for hours and study/have a meeting/order threadless

Our waitress checked on our satisfaction several times refilled drinks without being asked and in general was quite helpful and nice
Say that three times really fast Culver's sure it's another fast food joint but they have great food and exceptional service

+ Employees were friendly and manager stopped by to check on my 3 year old daughter several times+ Fries we got half reg & half sweet potato were pretty good and definitely tasted lighter due to the type of oil CB uses

At the beginning the food was always outstanding and the service was great
The service is usually pretty good but lately they seem to be too busy and unhappy
The only good experience we've had in the past few visits was a manager named Dan
there seems to be a trend in fast-food places these days for the staff to yell out everything and at everybody
Drinks were slow to arrive and poor lighting outside made it awkward to order
Authentic Chinese restaurants aren't really known for their ambiance and service so if you're looking for a nice night out you might want to go somewhere else
We loved this place it's got a real great feel from the friendly staff who are passionate about their food and explain the process offer samples to the fact that they clearly are swedes

If your in North Phoenix and in the mood for a great burger a cool atmosphere and a tall glass of Sonoran draft root-beer make it a point to stop by have a seat and ask for General manager Courtney Cowan
Both managers came and said hi and apologized for the slow cook staff and made sure everything was great
The service was friendly but if you sit outside it may take a while for them to greet you

The tiramisu was melty and you could really taste the alcohol which was good at first but a bit too strong as we got to the end of the dessert
We started with dessert first and Jacob brought our cheesecakes out super fast
The food is always great at the Factory but the service Jacob provided made our visit Fantastic
On that note little secret though the gym and staff is really great it *is* somewhat small
The regular staff is also cool and helpful and the fact the place is open 24 hours helps my weird-work-hour self out  Again I'd recommend them but I don't want everybody gettin' in on MY goods so stay away
The staff is fast when you order inside and also when you order through the drive thru
John the bar manager is a great guy to talk to

The waitress' and bartenders are so nice and really make you feel comfortable when hanging out there for hours on end
This is attributed to the friendly staff and the selection of unique organizational things that geeky peeps with compulsive disorders like me seem to enjoy

The service was okay and the food was pretty good
The ancillary staff is just as friendly and professional
Tons of room and quite professional and friendly service

Pros - Cool House-of-Blues-like vibe includes music-related decor lounge chairs/sofas & dimmer lightingExcellent musicGood service wait staff write their name on your cocktail napkin - nice touchCons -Barstools at main bar are waaaaay too short makes drinking out of straws or from taller glasses difficultSpace for luggage - fail

Very nice restaurant with professional waiters a great menu and tasty wine list
Good selections fresh quality and attentive staff

The price was great for what I got but I would suggest that you just order it in take-out form so that you can take whatever you don't finish home with you
The owner was super nice the employees were very friendly and the service was great
Our waitress didn't seem to disappear too often and she was nice enough
They have good desserts if you're willing but you'll probably be okay with the pizza

After countless attempts in good faith of trying to get a meal properly prepared from this establishment they continue to mess up the orders and laugh it off
A girl took my drink order but the service was slow to order
Great service and the amazing wine list beware time for food
I have personally had very bad service when ordering breakfast here and on the occaisions that my wife has brought me home lunch from here I always hope for the best but inevitably get a sandwich with bread that is way too hard for my tastes
And plus some businesses tend to forget that great service has to also be extended in situations when youre not face to face
Service was a bit on the slow side which seemed odd for the place being practically empty on a Sunday around 3pm
I went there two times in Jan 2012 the first night the waiter was without personality it took a long time to get our food and the restaurant was almost empty BUT the food was good

But I give 3 stars because I've yet to have good service
Service was good; they could have been jerks since they are almost out of a job
The bar is lovely the staff was great and chatty and attentive and hard working
The sushi chefs were friendly didn't hand us too many dishes too fast and put made them in a pleasing order

Overall the place was good and I'd like to go back maybe for brunch but I hope the service improves
Tinkerbell has good customer service inexpensive merchandise
First of all bad customer service and overpriced
I assume the manager was also very unhappy with her job because she was rude to her customers especially those of color/ minorities

Yeah the staff is attentive and super friendly but the food the grease the ingredients - unbelievable
Service was a little awkward - friendly enough but amateur
The service in the past has always been pretty good but Saturday night was a whole different story from the bottom to the top

Our burgers weren't any better than what I could find for $4 at other really good burger places our service was non-existent and we had drunk patrons coming over to touch our kid

Overall I shop Bookman's for the books and I appreciate the friendly staff and ability to trade in my own books and games for credit or cash
Service was good but there are some inattentitive things that bother me
I don't care about the decor I don't care about mean waitresses which in this case we had a sweet one but just deliver me some good BBQ

This place is a really cool hip place really friendly staff and great craft beer selection will be back for sure
With a little caramelization on the edges and served with fresh berries it was like breakfast and dessert rolled into one

No matter what the service is always good and prices cannot be beat
The manager or whoever was at the front along with the hostess was very rude and did not seem to want to be there
With that said the waitress on the other hand was great and really tried to make up for lost time
I had ordered one crabcake from the appetizer section as my entree and it came accompanied by some micro-greens a lemon tartar sauce all nice and fresh but I couldn't touch any else since I had had that sinful brandy alexander assorted breads and that delicious french onion soup

I ordered the double char burger and while it was not up the quality of burger found at Delux or RnR it was better than most chains and just as good as anything found at Five Guys or Fuddruckers

I have NEVER had bad service or a bad meal - this place is GREAT
Our waitress was friendly at first until she realized we were not going to order a bevy of drinks and rack up a thick bill and hang out for an hour
We were immediately disqualified from good service the rest of the evening
If you ask her for her opinion she says in a very stoned face and quick manner it's good no descriptors no recommendations but simply It's good  Then if you pause even for  a second she says I will be right back let me get this other table their drinks really quickly while I give you time to decide  Then we had Charity Case waitress
CONCLUSION So you are probably wondering if the service is so bad why do I keep coming here the food is actually pretty good and it's darn right cheap

Service was good; poor waitress couldn't explain to me what Mae-Toh was but thru some poor translation I declined to order it haha

Bar staff is attentive and even when they're hella busy they'll get you your drink quickly without the griping
+  A really good drink menu+ A great happy hour+ Great atmosphere- Long wait for a table even when several tables are empty this has been the case for me on several occasions but luckily not last nightWait staff is hit or miss - luckily our server last night was fine although he didn't have much personality- Tables really close together both inside and outIn my case the positives really outweigh the negatives

Friendly wait staff though fairly attentive so they can refill your water or coffee well

Service was fine - quite attentive actually
I don't care if food is good or bad the service is horrendous
I've also had great luck with their waitstaff everyone is friendly and on task
HOWEVER one big comment is that possibly part owner Tim Englishman who answers the phone and is involved in payment is very rude and needs a lesson in customer service
So overall the food was not what I expected in a good way the service was slow and lack luster but I enjoyed the sporty ambiance with all the tvs
We ordered the Fez Burger real yummy the cinnamon pears really add something special the italo kisra flatbread pizza-thing with mozzarella basil sun dried tomatoes and a bit of salad on top pretty good but not super unique and an order of half-harissa/half-garlic rosemary fries the spicy harissa fries were the winners here but we liked that you could mix and match
The reason I gave this 4 not 5 stars is parking and seating are tight at this small space but will definitely be back as great food and service

I order the Santa Cruz pasta and it was pretty good
Bar--fully stocked fully staffed good drinks
If it's a non-peak time like after the lunch rush in the middle of the afternoon the service is slow like molasses

The service is always friendly with the owner stopping by your table often and encourages leisurely meals

I didn't order any sides but my lunch buddies did and the fries were good

Service is good but expect to wait a little bit for a table no matter what time you go
The service was also good and I was surprised at the server's ability to memorize my order of two rolls a sashimi and several nigiri
I also think that some of the customer service could use a little boost in morale although in many cases the customer service is pretty doggone good for a grocery store

The services provided for the amount of money paid was great
We thought it was a great way to sample menu fare w/out losing our wallets although in retrospect the very small portions necessitated our ordering more so really I didn't find the staff meals to offer such great savings but I digress
Staff was very nice but they seem to have a hard time keeping up with all the people
It's typically faster to call in an order because the wait can be ridiculous at times
We came in and sat at the bar for a good 10 minutes until I finally asked the cook behind the bar if he could take our order
Nonetheless they were very tasty and a nice different take on a dessert for a bbq meal
The staff were very friendly and helpful since it was clear I had just stumbled into their shop

Man's Mom Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry - our friendly and helpful waiter Owen recommended she gets the small one because the big one is apparently really big
Dessert The Man Man's Dad Breakfast of The Champions - i had a couple bites - absolutely delicious

DH picked the food up and said the man working at the counter was friendly and patient with his order
He very rudely said I don't know how many times I have to repeat that I'm the manager and you are not allowed to bring outside food in
I think the manager should learn how to talk to customers without being rude and make sure there is some consistency amongst the staff as to what their policies are so this type of situation can be avoided

Overall it was an alright gym that was a competitive price and nice facility with some customer service downfalls
My only complaint would be that service was a little slow but it's a quaint quiet atmosphere that is not packed with hostesses and servers jostling everywhere so in my opinion the quiet evening with fantastic food was completely worth waiting a little longer for service  This is a great place for a date night or a girls night check it out

we ordered the last 2 rolls on the menu which was the most expensive so we figured it ought to be good
we also ordered the scallop poppers which wasn't bad but it had a distinct taste

The staff was incredibly nice although the service was a bit slow and the seating options were a bit odd and not very accessible for those with disabilities
AND our mathematician of a waitress somehow calculated a super great tip
Great hidden little place in MesaIt is owner operated by a husband and wife husband takes care of front of house wife cooks so service and quality are always at their best
The breadsticks were good - it would've been nice had we known the baked spaghetti came with breadsticks - we wouldn't have ordered a separate side
The staff was nice though they forgot the meat sauce we ordered with our pasta
My last visit was a Thursday night for pad Thai also very good but I ordered it mild
The staff is friendly - mandatory greeting everyone with Welcome to Moe's
I ordered the coconut shrimp and it was really good
Very disappointed at the poor meat quality and the inattentive wait staff
Fast/friendly service and very polite people
Weekday lunch is great here with the extensive menu especially appetizers and of course the dessert
What I like the most is the good service because they seem to have a good corporate model for training their employees
The good it is new it is super modern the staff was friendly the location was GREAT and everything was clean
Service was slow food was average and they were out of a ridiculous amount of foods and drinks
Our server was prompt knowledgable friendly and very attentive; I was very relieved to see the service had improved

The staff at Lyte was good starting with the friendly bouncer at the door and continuing with the nice waitresses who came around with the appetizers albeit I don't think at times they knew 100% what they were serving
They get my orders right and are always friendly
They have a few REALLY good employees here as well in terms of customer service
Sometimes this location can be slow for unknown reasons- maybe the waiter on skates is cooking in the back
The burgers are cooked to order so that's a nice touch
The guy who took our orders was nice and chatty we sat and our food came out fast - I was pretty impressed with the setup really nice modernized and delicious
My bike had been in service for two months and now was a good time for a 20+ mile trial run

Nothing outrageously good but if you need a place with great service and accessible give this place a try
If you want great food and great service come on in
The setting is quite nice service was very friendly but a littlte laxed for as quite as it was
with respect to the other rave review their only saving grace is good service esp for people who had not had vietnamese food before as their servers do speak better english and because they are not crowded usually they would have more time and patience to explain the food to you
Also had a dessert lemonchello sorbet which was great
Needless to say good food - the worst service I have ever experienced
Very friendly service especially the manager dude -- I can't believe he recognized me after like 4 years
The decor is charming the booths create an intimate atmosphere and the service was good

My friend ordered the Casablanca Chicken Sandwich with Rosemary French Fries and said it was really good too
The service was good the food was delicious and I walked out with a few good photos

Apart from the Chicken Tikka Masala that i order everytime i go the Eggplant dish is also very good as well as the lentils and the Garlic Naan

Our waiter had great trouble it seems with running our credit card
The service was really good they all seemed very nice even the cook was asking us how the food tasted
Service was good and all of the staff were very friendly towards our sleeping baby

I ordered the chicken enchiladas minus chicken meaning just cheese and they were not great; they actually had a sour/tart taste to them
I ordered the green chile burrito and while it was very good I can't say it was the greatest thing in the world
The service was good attentive and friendly
We only had dessert and it was quite good though the portion was a bit small
I will be back soon for appetizers and main course but so far as dessert spot with a few pints this place is great
Pros fantastic environment totally nice people the most gorgeous men in fedoras and cool suits on the planet I nearly died completely unpretentious crowd band not on a stage so you are right up close and personal nice dark lighting with red lights nice bar staff $6 cover
The staff is very friendly and they think it's awesome if you're daring enough to order more traditional menu items like the special beef soup or the durian boba which is really tasty despite its stinkyness
Overall the portions are good and the service it good
I ordered the Pesto Penne Bake sounded good enough
Place Newer relatively clean good locationService below average - average ***The nail color came off before we left the place

I'm always satisfied with their friendly quick service and hot fresh food

It was good but the Lobster Bisque I ordered before my entree showed up was exquisite
GF ordered a breaded chicken salad which I had a couple of bites of and I thought it was great too

The staff is always really friendly and they decor is also kinda clever They also have a rooftop patio you can eat on that is cool if the weather permits
The customer service was great and come to find out Units is a family owned business which is awesome because I'm all for supporting local businesses

The ambiance candle light  and good service were redeeming factors therefore i rated them a 4
No matter what I have  ordered it has been great
The staff here is friendly and accommodating even the manager came over to say hello and check in on my experience
Portions are good but if you have a big appetite then order 2
I ordered number 7 cheese enchilada + green corn tamale which was good albeit pretty standard and my mom got the chicken tortilla soup which she said she would definitely get again
Since I placed an order to-go over the phone one time and my burrito was pretty good and in tact I decided to take hubbs to this place
Great outdoor seating area but you cannot order dinner outside
I may give this place a second chance because the service was good and there are other good reviews but if I had to make a judgement on just food
Wonderful food classy atmosphere but from almost the minute we sat down they were telling us that the food would take a very long time and that the service was very slow
People pay for good service and that is what keeps them coming back
For dessert we had a very nice gluten-free lemon meringue pie
The food is good it's only eggs and toast but the waitstaff is is slow forgetful can be rude and doesn't know the menu
They are reasonably priced have great customer service and everything we have eaten so far has been fabulous
Service was great - we ate alone essentially not a lunch crowd type place I guess - went at exactly noon on a Wednesday
The sushi itself wasn't half bad although I've had better and the service could be a bit more attentive out on the patio but all in all a nice little joint right on Scottsdale Road that i've always had a good time at
They also offer table and bottle service sky bottles starting cheap and champagne starting at only $40 a great place to get a buzz on mill
Food is generally tastier than the other concepts in my opinionServers are friendlyValet parkingNow the negativesFood was 'meh'Awkward patio seating with uncomfortable chairs sitting on dirtSlow serviceOver-priced especially for a kids grilled cheese plate that didn't even taste goodDon't come hungry  gnocchi was ok but was served as a diet portionValet parking I don't get this place but then again it's a Fox-owned business catering to the masses looking to make the big bucks
I ordered the #20 which was a carne asada burrito with beans and rice now I'm not a huge fan on refried beans but today the beans were great
In the past the service has been okay and food is pretty good
Also their fries are pretty good though they are not as unique as In-N-Out's or McDonald's; I recommend ordering the seasoned ones
The place was packed there was a group watching a college football game--extremely loud and the service was slow and forgetful we had to ask more than once for things
We got dessert to go it was very good bread pudding and a brownie the next day
His office is in a convenient location the staff is friendly and very professional and they remember your name
I sat at the upstairs bar and ordered a beer great except a little high price
The staff was also very friendly and very attentive
Sad because I think their quality is probably pretty good but if you can't get an order right I am not gonna like it no matter how good it is suppose to be
My water was refilled often and our service was fast and consistent
Talking to the Waitresses and my buddy who took me there the frist time most have been working there since for the past 2-3 years and that's a good sign
Given the fact a wait is common it might be a nice add to offer free WiFi or free coffee service outside for those waiting
The food was slightly above average but the service was slow and below average overall a good choice if you are in the area but not worth the drive
Tacky and given that they place a table by the serving station something a good manager should realize
The biggest problem aside from the table next to us constantly commenting on our food - People we didn't come with you so leave us alone I'm sorry your life is so boring but really - was the very slow service
We go here periodically because they have decent food and I like the staff - very friendly
The staff is super nice and accommodating
Staff friendly with regulars and friendly with newbies
The service is great and Thurs - Sat evenings will host a good crowd in the bar
Short and sweetStaff was very friendly
The staff has always been very nice and they were even kind enough to create a custom menu for friends of mine that were engaged there he hid the proposal in the words of the menu
The staff is very friendly & natural not robotic like behavior you occasionally find at the front desk of their sister properties - Hyatt Regency
Also the staff was super friendly in that we-are-all-family-and-we-welcome-you-with-open-arms kind of way
She and our waiter checked on us several times and were very good about explaining the dishes
A place like that will get my money as long as they continue to have good service of course
The kitchen service was wretched though the waiters were very nice and tried to compensate for the slow kitchen
Our waitress was nice and between her and the owner we got everything we needed
The staff is friendly enough and the service is quick enough but I don't think I'll be swinging by here again
The staff are friendly and the service is always remarkable
The service here is great and I've never had a bad experience
Service was a little crappy but it was nice how the whole front of the place was open
If you don't like cilantro - tell the friendly staff not to include it in this awesome dish
The wait staff has also been consistently friendly
I must say I was a little leary as one of the previous reviews had commented on the bad service she received from this waitress
We ended the meal with a nice dessert that I haven't seen at any of the Italian restaurants I frequent - Fruta di bosco con Zabaione
The dessert was good but a little to potent for our liking
Let me tell you if you want to taste some of the BEST pasta salad on this good brown earth order the seafood pasta salad
Also service at Zuma whether you are at the bar or a table is always fast if you go early
The food is consistently delicious and the staff is friendly and attentive but not hovering
Great to find out that the split didn't impact the quality of food or service
The staff was extremely attentive and always checked up on me while I drank water and waited a while for my friend
Only two things we ordered were good the tuna salad and the potato salad
I would give a 3-star for that not-so-fresh lumpia and the filling but the manager was so nice and sweet that I want to keep coming back --- and to add to it their other dishes like dinuguan and the arroz caldo are delicious
Pub Burgers Pretzel Fondue Fish and Chips Fried Chicken Potato Chips and you know I'm a sucker for fresh house made potato chips Prime Rib Dip and rest have all been tasty well prepared and nicely presented by very friendly and attentive wait staff
We also got a couple of orders of salmon sashimi again fresh nice cuts and fair portion sizes
Service was great and atmosphere was pleasant
Bass Pro shops have great customer service
After we got seated the waitress seemed in a horrible mood and made a bad experience even worse
We always get great service and they are very accommodating just wish the food had more flavor
The bartender was very friendly and attentive I have no qualms with the service
Our service was pretty good considering our poor waiter had busted up his knee earlier but my refills of soda were plentiful
Service is almost always good it's never too crowded and the food is not bad and very affordable
The service was a bit slow but the food was really good and good for you
which I always a good signSIDEBAR they have a waiter who looks like a cross between Ricky Martin and The Situation
Attentive and friendly staff complimented by the manager who gave me a basket of fries on the house to go with my burger and side of pasta salad
Not just because it's close but it's a fun atmosphere with good food and good service
Although the lines to order can sometimes be long the team does a pretty good job of managing it
Overall the food was very good service was attentive and the ambiance was chic & bright
Last but not least the service has always been good the few times I've been
Our waiter was very nice and recommended certain menu options when we asked
The service was pretty good especially since we had such a large group
The place is small service is quick staff is friendly
The hostess staff was a little unorganized but after getting seated the waitress Jamie was great and the food was outstanding
Front desk staff were very friendly and made me feel at home
I had left my coupon at home however but instead of just telling me too bad so said they went above and beyond and to make it easy on me took 15% off my entire order including socks and the shoe inserts versus the $10 off planned pretty much $22 bucks
So all in all I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice place to go on a Saturday night the prices are reasonable the service is good even if they aren't as flexible as they should be at times with the menu and the food is very tasty
I've been to this place a couple of times and each time I've gotten great service from the staff
My husband and I have had to take our vehicles in a few times since then the quotes have always been good the manager always has a ready discount or coupon to add to help out and they do what they can to make sure that you are able to get the repairs that you need if they can add a discount they do
We ordered the bruchetta board thinking we'd get some decent slices of bread with great toppings on them
For breakfast I ordered the Farmhouse benedict
Barely mediocre food and wildly unfriendly service earn this place two stars
The food here is good that's why I'm giving it a 2 but other than that they need to teach these girls serious customer service
The atmosphere is nice and charming the service is attentive and helpful and they serve a nice Pinot Grigio to boot
I tip my hat off to the friendly staff at this location
I ordered the Carlsbad Stuffed Chicken Breast  which was stuffed with vegetables cream cheese and topped with queso fundido and served with rice and choice of beans
As we were both slowing down the waitress made a well-timed visit to our table and we requested to-go boxes
Service is good du00e9cor is nice not too noisy lots of food for the price not that it's cheap but at $12 for my entru00e9e I got a very large and tasty chicken breast
Service was nice food was good prices were silly chairs were cramped pretty much what you'd expect
The food was good but the service was so-so
I won't really hold the slow service against them too much right now
However that's not a good thing in this case The college valley-girl type staffs the joint and very loudly gossips in front of customers- Like welcome to Tempe
The service was initially slow at the bar but it was really busy when we got there
My girlfriend ordered the Fettucine alfredo and it was really good
The decor would be nice the food would be average and the bill would be above average for what we ordered
My partner ordered meatloaf with vegetables low carb and I must say the broccoli was huge and cooked to perfection nice and crunchy
The only thing negative I have to say is that our service was not great
The office staff is also always really nice
The grocery have a very friendly staff who are extremely customer oriented
Lunch prices are fair food seems fresh and service is great
Four stars for the good service and good grub
The service was great and the cozy atmosphere was great for a date night
I don't have a lot of experience with macarons but judging from Essence I enjoy nibbling on one ]The staff was fine - not super friendly but they did their job
the only reason I give it a 2 star is because the service was good
we ordered our food it was sooooo cold in there I couldn't order my salad instead i opted for a breakfast dish
my food was not good- i ordered the breakfast enchilada
The prices are reasonable for the size of the meal you get and the service is always pretty good
Service is prompt and waiters are friendly and attentive
I felt a little uncomfortable they were not friendly and welcoming by any means but they eventually sat us none the less and our service was great from there out
Over all this place is pretty good friendly staff and lots of room
Very friendly service and clean women's restroom
everything from the Mesquite Grilled Artichokes to the Roasted Chicken to the Filet Mignon Cobb Salad and my favorite the Maytag Burger more about that in a minute is well prepared and delicious* The service has always been first rate and I have to say that I expected that when the server is aware that I am friends with Bobby but there are ton of people there that don't know me from Tyler Florence and we still get great service
Staff support was great convenient location ample parking very clean facilities even the decor was tasteful and the colors weren't circa 1980s like other doctors' offices
The staff was very nice and my food came out lightning fast
There are halal meats available and the staff is friendly
I sat down at the bar and was quickly helped by the friendly waitress
Those are pretty good standbys and it's nice that they give you bread and butter on the side no matter what you order even if you do get a sandwich which a lot of places tend to skimp on the bread if you ordered bread as a staple of your meal which is probably better for you anyway but thanks for the extra bread Sauce
I'll say that the food is good but the service on my last trip was pretty lacking
when you forget to order protein shake or metabolism boosters online this is good in a pinch
The food was cold service was slow and it was not worth the money
The offices are modern convenient at street-level and the staff was friendly
The food was great and they had the typical Four Seasons spot on service
Margaritas taste like antifreeze unless you order the super premiums which won't leave any money left for ordering food and that may be a good choice
The service is sincere and friendly but can be slow at times
Great selection of vegetables - organic & non and a friendly knowledgeable staff that is eager to help you find what you need and answer any questions u might have
since going back I have to update this real fastI ordered the Spicy Mexican Chicken one with the corn beans cheeses and green chili
Our service was great- our server stayed on top of what we needed and was friendly
I've been here a couple of times and the service has always been good
That said pretty much the entire restaurant and kitchen staff came over and apologized for said raspberry so the rebound and recovery was nice
At any rate I have had good experiences here and my insurance seems to jive well with them because now that I've got my teeth in order I rarely pay much out of pocket
Every staff member that we encountered walking the property was friendly and always acknowledged us
The breakfast buffet is good and it's nice that you can order eggs anyway you like them as part of that
Like every other In-N-Out I have visited in the area the store is clean and the staff are all friendly and each possesses many more brain cells than your average McDonald's or Burger King employee
I'm a fan of a good old American breakfast which is eggs bacon country potato's with onions peppers and jalapenos and pancakes which is what I ordered
Service was a little slow our waiter had a huge rowdy table he was helping
Wonderful service here and a great glass of ice tea too
Good service even though they did have a little mix-up on my order
The wait staff was very attentive but he spoke so fast that I couldn't understand him
Not only was the food great but the service was outstanding as well
The price is right the food is average and the service can be quite slow at times
We walked in to place our lunch orders and I was a little surprised by the cost of the food but it looked really good
Our waitress was very attentive and checked on us often
We also had to have their famous fries which were quite good and probably the best value on the menu but we usually just ordered the nachos
Granted if it's really a GREAT piece of meat you can order it medium well or well done and it won't taste like shoe leather but still
The bartender/manager was a nice guy as well
The restaurant is great for small and large parties or even a pickup order
The staff is extremely helpful and friendly and very knowledge in their menu
Great staff great conference area great food and desserts
The service was good the waiter very friendly
We sat at the bar in front of the kitchen and the guys doing the cooking were very cool as a matter of fact everybody working there was very cool and willing to go the extra step for example are waiter was telling us about the beer they had on tap and we were trying to decide so he brought us a couple of samples without us asking-nice
I ordered the 'bangers and mash' while my wife had the salmon both were very very good and for dessert we had the chocolate baked bread {that might not be the exact name but its close} good god it was soo damn good
MY FIRST REVIEW BELOWWe've had every type of crappy pizza you might imagine over the years so it was a great suprise when we ordered the spinach pizza and small calzone stuffed with spaghetti noodles sausage and ricotta cheese
This is more of a take out place but the staff is always friendly and know how to bake pizza's
I also love that they deliver serve espresso drinks and have a relatively friendly staff
Actually a GREAT staff with wonderful customer service and the genuine attitude of a local business that cares about their customers
To call her mentally challenged would be an insult to the mentally challenged seeing as I have dined there twice and seem to know a great deal more about the restaurant and the services they provide than this bimbo
Prices were very high service was slow and snotty
All of the staff is super nice and utterly kind
I can't stress enough that the service was seamless and everyone was so friendly
They are fast in service and prices are cheap so we'll be going back for take out too
Great service however we arrived off peak at around 200 and left before the dinner hour it was starting to pick up
Really friendly fast affordable service in a laid back environment
In regards to lunch you have Subway which I am sick of dirty water pizza at Cafe Roma hooters greasy tasting Starbucks great service Unos dark interior mediocre pizza 1130 Sams Cafe Big Fat Greek Restaurant Coldstone NY & Co AMC theatre and a barrage of touristy places as well
It was almost 5pm and I was surprised it wasn't already packed being a Saturday we were sat quickly and our waiter was great
Still being slightly full from breakfast I decided to get an order of the bruschetta and half of the Jamaican jerk chicken hoagie I thought half would be small LOL
The girls are very nice and talk with you until you get the food then they kind of hang out at the next table until they order neglecting the previous table
For a good time order the volcano bowl a multitude of rums juices and flaming shot of 151 in the middle all in a giant bowl
Don't expect good service or a clean bathroom because neither are there but what you CAN expect is to fall in love with the food every time you go
The service was prompt and friendly although they did forget to put our appetizer order through
We also ordered the veggie pizza which I was lucky to get a slice of since the table devoured with good reason before I had my chance to attack
I probably wouldn't go back but the lady was really nice so at least the service was great
The service was also very professinal and attentive
I'm not trying to be a traitor to a timeless institution or asking that it change its essential character - I just think that a few little tweaks here and there would keep the local population loyal and keep folks like me who want really good food part-way there in an amazing environment with friendly service check coming back
Before I get into the pizza I have to say the staff was superb and very friendly
The Internet connection is free but it can border on agonizingly slow when there are numerous people using it
Service was alright not horrible but the servers weren't as attentive as I would have expected
The staff is very friendly and accommodating to our weekly group of about 10-15 writers
I've been to other Maggiano's in Chicago and to me they're all pretty much the same - good and plentiful food and fast friendly service
Overall the price is right the location is CLEAN and apparently habitually so if you see they've aced their past dozen+ inspections and the service is friendly even if Alan is run ragged a bit during the rush
I've been three times and twice felt neglected for long periods of time and my service measuring stick is low - be friendly and keep an eye on my wine glass and you're my best friend
- It's nice looking inside clean and upscale appearance and decor- They have fun promos with the green pin waitress witnesses you knock it down when it's pin 1 and you get a free app etc
- The waitresses are usually great and friendlyThe cons - It is really expensive bowling
A star for the barista that always remembers my coffee order even though I've only been going there off and on for a month a star for being open early enough for me to get coffee before work and a star because it's not that bad
I ordered take out for lunch here today and I had a great experience
I called and placed my order and the girl that answered the phone was really friendly and nice
I only ran in to get my order so I can't really comment on the table service or the restaurant itself but that chick totally made my day by being so nice so this location gets 5 stars from me
It's a wonderful combination of great food ambiance and service
The service is great the staff is warm and friendly brought my young children and they were very accommodating even helped them construct their own pizza boxes as a project
We also ordered a chopped chicken salad - I have no idea what the name was but it had a great flavor - and the addition of grapes and celery just made you want to take your clothes off and run through the sprinklers
The owners and staff are the nicest of nice
The waiters are very nice explaining everything very well
Their service is top notch they have a great happy hour and a very large wine selection that they're happy to help you with if needed
The staff was friendly attentive and gracious as I have found them to be in every Fox restaurant I've been in
Service was nice be forewarned your tip IS included and they will not tell you this
The counter staff that I spoke with were all very friendly and helpful but the manager sounds like kind of a dick
*However* a good manager would have told the front desk folks to apologize profusely offer to walk over to the bar to have a chat with the event person and hand out earplugs by the bucketful
The staff was nice enough but seemed young and overwhelmed
We placed our order for breakfast the night before
Service was great both times so no complaints about that
The service was also very friendly and knowledgeable
I told her I would like to order a drink and she seemed annoyed like I was being rude
I have been to Cadillac Ranch a dozen or so times in the past year and a half generally service is slow and food is a little overpriced for the atmosphere they have a bull ride but generally I have had a pleasant time
We had good service until a group of about 15 customers came in we got our appetizers ordered one more beer and did not see our waitress for 20 minutes
I found her at the bar and said it had been a long time and could we add another beer she said she was terribly sorry she just got sat with 15 ppl way across the restaurant the 15top was by the bathroom we were behind the hostess stand bar side I said she has been great but obviously the mgr isn't so great since he does not know how to cut up a floor for service
Service is efficient friendly and unpretentious
Excellent food fast service excellent customer service great prices
but we found the sushi and other fish dishes to be really fresh and flavorful the service to be attentive and the overall vibe to be trendy but laid-back
However these two dishes aside we loved Yasu for the fresh sushi which is probably harder to find that good Asian-inspired steak the amazing octopus and eggplant and the good service
And my breakfast eggs were cooked just as I ordered them
Excellent filet mignon nice caprese salad and VERY accommodating and polite wait staff
The laid-back cool feel eerily good looking staff and funky decor make for a fun Happy Hour or dinner spot in Scottsdale
Service was not so great here we had a little bit of a wait outside not a big deal but the waitress that served us wasn't so attentive to our needs
Overall this place is a hidden gem not near as good as other Original Pancake House restaurants namely the one in Ohio where the diner experience was great and the staff were friendly
Nice mix of hot and cold choices on the menu and tempting desserts mocking you from their glass confines
Service was very friendly and helpful with all of our questions
The bartenders and servers were very friendly and service was great
Just posting a sign about coupons would be a good idea-The way the bar is set up with a crooked line to order a drink you got to just grab the bartenders attention
The staff I encountered however was exceptionally friendly
I first visited this location about a year ago to grab one product and ended up getting some great advice and a ton of samples from one of their staff members
I've returned a couple times since and always had excellent attentive service
Waitress does not come back a manger swings apologizes and asks if everything is good I said yes but my toast is missing so he leaves I was half way thru my meal when he walked by and saw I didn't have the toast so he goes again and brings it
but the food was so good you kinda overlooked that this time the service suck and food suck and once I find a hair in my meal one that you cannot miss it shows you don't care about quality
I think the manager was the only good thing of that experience and that's why I give them 2 stars a hair in my meal is all I need to take my business elsewhere
The food is great the wine list too and the service is decent but
The service when you do get it IS good I think they were short-handed though - our waiter was also the solo bartender
Well I ordered the Breakfast Burger with waffle fries
After interrupting and even having to be a little firm and rude I finally got the price quote and let him know that No I was NOT interested in the service package or what the water heater would cost me with the service package
The Camelback Barber Shop has very good service with a hot towel shoulder massage straight razor trim and at least if you ask for Albert get your hair cut with scissors
My Dad says it is one of the best barber shops that he has used--and they are very nice to us service dogs too
We have had nearly every waiter/waitress that works at Gallo Blanco over our many visits and we have had NEARLY consistently good service
The service was very friendly the pricing is a wonderful value and the clothes I had altered  three pairs of designer jeans shortened with original hem were completed very quickly
I'm just not completely happy with their staff usually not very friendly student that looks like he is really not happy to be here on Sunday
;- Room service was prompt and the food was pretty darn good

I didnt feel like telling them but the waitress was really nice and she could tell that I didnt like it and she persisted so I let her know yuck
-Low cost euthanasia services which btw are not factored in to that 52% number stated above-euthanizing an animal can be really pricey and there are some heartless horrible people out there that would rather let their pet suffer and die slowly because it's free rather than pay $150+ to have their animal euthanized so hopefully their low-cost euthanasia services help prevent that to an extent
The staff is always friendly and helpful
Both dishes we ordered were bland the bread they serve is nothing special there was just nothing that stood out as great

+ + +'sfairly ethnic feel fresh lunch food clean several areas to eat inside outside VIP take-out friendly service- - - 'sfaux materials we all know it's fake just paint it mediterranean blue or something tone down on the clean smellIn sum if you are looking for a bit of ethnic flair with decent food and a variety of seating choices this is your place

The service here has always been great and very quick considering that the place is usually full everyday at lunch time
The owner was there and took our order and he was suuuuuuuper nice
The patrons are very loud and very rude and the theater staff just ignores it
Now a rude patron isn't the fault of the movie theater but when the manager was standing ten feet away and didn't intervene that's not right
I decided to take a pass on that and ordered a breakfast beer instead
The staff was very nice and extremely helpful however I felt that they were a little *too* helpful aka I was feelin the heat to buy everything in the store
Of course there's a wait it's probably the most famous breakfast joint in this state and there's a reason people flock to it 6 days a week because its really good food served by a really good staff

I didn't give five stars because the service has never been very good
I have been in and out of this particular location several times since moving to Phoenix from Chicago and the customer service on the whole has been pretty good

The hotel attendants/staff are very friendly and helpful
This was as troubling as the prices - fast food prices and fast food service usually mean fast food and subsequent ring sting

Service was great although we did get the vip tavo service free guac and refills
a really nice surprise We also ordered the Flan since all the reviews said it was good
However I still feel their food is well seasoned and they give you good portions I would pass one the fried ice cream though for dessert for the price not worth it just make it at home

It's basically like a toned down version of Switch's menu with all the alterna-friendly staff and Diversity101 customers having been replaced by Claudeen and Martha's Deseret Book Club
Maybe it is just the vibe from the location being too family friendly that makes BLD seem bland but promising bordering on the edge of being a nice joint to have some tasty food instead of a middle-of-the-road crowd pleaser
Waitresses were completely friendly without an attitude
I really enjoyed the experience's the staff was slammed with patrons yet the service was still friendly and the wait times weren't very long at all

I have eaten in the restaurant a couple of times and service was great
This is probably my favorite restaurant in this semi-remote part of town now and combined with excellent attentive service I'm ready for part two when I return next year
The idea of ordering at the window and having a seat outside was a nice idea for a lunch on a sunny afternoonWhile ordering it was evident that the woman taking our order was very unfamiliar with the extensive menu
We persevered and slowly went through the menu items and got the order placed
The friendly and smart staff is ready to make you feel at home find a drink that works for your budget and palette and are polite enough to make it known that this neighborhood hangout is NOT a sports bar or dive

We sat outside and while the view could've been better they are doing renovations to the building nextdoor the table was comfortable and the service was extremely attentive

Chrissyowner Steve Tina and the rest of the staff have always been very friendly with me
Every member of the staff is friendly and makes us feel awesome
Yea yea this place does have some junk and don't expect years of good service out of their tools BUT for those usually expensive tools which you probably will only use 5 time in the next 5 years like lets say a sliding hammer then this place is just right
The wait staff has always been prompt and friendly
I ordered the Sicilian sub - great balance of flavor and texture and everything was super fresh

When it came to ordering a part they were kind enough to offer multiple price/quality options and the shipping time was unusually fast
Service was a bit on the slow side but the tasty food made up for it
The staff is some of the nicest hosts/waitresses I have ever met
With the waiter the bartender a chef or two and myself now being entertained by The Red Hot Chili Peppers my main course of Kentucky Fried Quail would arrive as I was slowly enjoying the foie gras and with the small bird surprisingly plump I again set aside the liver and moved onto the hot dish before me; the first bite a crackling of deep fried skin and lightly herbed breading that would set the tone for everything on the well composed plate
With the hour now nearing three Spencer returned to ask if I wanted to see the dessert menu and with my mantra that it never hurts to look I said sure and received a short list of four choices all of which sounded okay but none which sounded great and as such I deferred to my server's opinion and he recommended the Fourplay based on his own personal preference for cheesecake a good recommendation though certainly not on par with the savories
Described on the menu as Flourless chocolate cake New York Cheesecake Chocolate Cream Milk Chocolate Parfait and a Chocolate Fan and mere minutes after ordering it was clear from the start that this was a pre-prepared dessert and while each texture was nice enough the cake itself was a tad spongy thus relying on the 'fan' to add a bit of crunch-rich but not heavy cold but not frozen the flavor itself was not all that different from a Hostess Ho-Ho
not a 'bad' thing but at $7 perhaps the only overpriced item I ordered and an area where the Praying Monk could definitely stand to improve
The burgers looked great and those that ordered them said they tasted just as good as they looked
There are many choices and we have had some wonderful meals here so I suppose we shouldn't have been surprised to find the food fabulous and the service stellar especially considering the great reviews here on yelp

Great food great service and your wallet won't be sore the next day neither will your stomach
the service i had was absolutely amazing it was nice to see someone like the tall good looking gentlemen i had wait on me

The service and products are great but this new free run really puts them over the top for me
The salads are all good too and their chocolate dessert with the ice cream not sure what it's called is amazing
The first tikme i ordered the green chile pork stew - the flavor was good but after a few bites I was bored with the same flavor with each bite

The service was slow but we had good conversation so we didn't mind it too much
The restaurant is good - food is decent and service is accommodating
I appreciate the staffing constraints but I really had to see the place lose customers on account of a bad experience
If I ever run into bad food and bad service in the same visit though that will probably do it for me
This place is highly recommended for having a great staff great selection of options and for feeling like a fun place to shop
Bottom line is  this place has great food but slow  service

All the staff was super friendly as well
Other than that our waitress was actually very attentive
Food service is all self serve as well and there is a nice assortment of snacks and light fare am and pm
Service was good but it had to be because this place is f'ing tiny so we sat next to the kitchen door and they had to walk by us every 30 seconds
However they made an impression and it was bad but I tried to overlook their obvious lack of service gave them the benefit of the doubt good food will always win me over
I proceeded to order items which I had ordered before that were actually good the first time
But you order whatever on the menu and it's great
I have been able to experience both lunch and breakfast at Taylor's Cafe and on both occasions both service and food were decent
My guest ordered a build your own omelet with chorizo and another guest ordered the waffle with fresh fruit and both looked good and were highly complimented
At Oregano's you will hear that same Louis Prima song on repeat during your entire dining experience but at least you'll get good service
Actually I pretty much love Oregano's for their Aunt Shirley's Gorgonzola pizza an order of their nice meaty wings with mixed sauce
The service was extremely friendly from the hostess to all of the waiters and waitresses and bus boys that came by
The staff was friendly the service took a while
The wings were great and I'd go back and order these; definitely not the typical wing sauce on them and a great flavor

There are a lot fewer Valvoline's in AZ than in MN so it is so nice that one is somewhat conveniently located to me and supplies the same exceptional customer service and friendliness
Even more the owner of the Valvoline called me himself as a random customer service check and was also exceptionally nice and caring
That one person Tyler took control of my issue and handled it flawlessly from beginning to end over the course of less than a week seems to be a rare thing in AZ much more common in the Midwest - so I am still adjusting expectations and I remain so impressed that as a client it was all handled with minimum effort follow-up or inconvenience on my part that I wanted to write this review in the hope you can have a great customer service experience as well
Fish was good atmosphere stunk service was incredibly slow and it seemed like a cross between red lobster and chilis

Besides the food being totally awful the 'manager' on duty was rude to every employee working
After the rude manager gave me my order he went over and pulled a basket of fries out of the fryer
One customer as i was walking away made a comment to the manager perhaps if you were a little nicer to them they'd listen better referring to how she was treating the  employees
I thought that $28 for a mani/pedi was a great find we normally make the haul to Ahwatukee for these services for $36 but I had to wonder if the foot spa had been cleaned before I stepped into it I was hesitant to feel the walls of the spa with my feet but did it anyway

I can't believe I've waited so long to review the Roosevelt as it is everything I look for in a bar amazing beers and a significant wine list  great food  friendly staff and a crowded yet comfortable vibe
Staff are friendly and outgoing and contrary to other reviews the crowds is diverse and welcoming -- sure there are the requisite downtown hipsters esp on First Fridays and the Scottsdale 'slummers' on Saturdays  but depending on when you're out there are also T-Gen scientists downtown professionals visiting ASU parents suburbanites on the way to or from a game visiting conventioneers and local residents just hanging out
I have had mostly good experiences at this location although they have messed up my order a couple of times and once the ice cream we got was so awful that we had to throw it away
I'm not going to say anything else about the service; I've only been there once and I'm hoping that bad service isn't a theme with the Encanto restaurants

I mean the place is nasty and the staff looks like they would really like to be someplace else but the pizza and calzone were really really good
The service was very good they even made accommodations for us to sit outside at a special table because we had our dog after the hike
But it was still good and I'd order it again

We sat down and took a look at the menu everyone in my group kept telling me how great their Chicken & Dumplings were but I figured everyone was gonna order it so I could always try it from their plates
However the biscuits were super delicious really fresh and puffy on the inside with a slight hardened outside dunked with the white sausage gravy and life was good  I also had a bite of my buddies Chicken & Dumplings which honestly tasted really close to a home made casserole and the chicken was a bit dry guess I'm glad I didn't order it  I guess I missed out on their breakfast menu so I'm definitely going to have to try out their breakfast next time I'm in town
Then we ordered a bottle of wine that was very reasonably priced and to our liking for $24 - a nice Argentinian Malbec
Customer serviceEveryone I came into contact with here was super nice and helped us promptly

Been a customer of the original Pita Jungle in Tempe since it opened service was always so-so but you got a good deal of good food for a fair price

It's always good to gauge a new restaurant by standard staples of the cuisine that's why my first orders at pizza places are pepperoni etc
As such I didn't get to experience the restaurant and service past the front counter however the atmosphere from what I saw had a nice clean classy sports bar feel albeit a bit commercial and unoriginal
My only area of recommendation was that the service at the counter was nice and it seemed like it could be a nice place for dinner with friends while watching a game

It was delicious and the service was great
But the service was lacking - for this level of restaurant you expect exceptional service - and frankly this caliber of food can be found elsewhere with good service and more reasonable prices
But we have concluded 1 Rokerij does offer good food - but they are slightly over priced for the quality 2 the professionalism was seriously lacking in service presentation of the wine list focused on the price and not the taste pallets and 3 they should get their ego in check - I get that you have a long list of people waiting for tables at your restaurant - but the next time I have a special event I will be going to one of the dozens of restaurants in the valley and receive the level of service that should come with the ambiance and food
Though I only ordered chicken which is hard to do great since I knew that it was one of the few entrees I could finish

Just order and enjoy the food truly is so good you shouldn't have to make special requests as it is
The bartender/waiter was awesome - very friendly funny attentive and accommodating
Service is usually friendly and fast but there are the usual girls behind the counter who look and act like they would rather be anywhere else

The waiter himself tried hard and did a good job
This place has been one of my favorite spots to dine love the cozy deco friendly staff and of course the food

One of the staff there gave us a great recommendation for post-dinner drinks at Four Peaks Brewery another quality recommend
While overall I felt the food was uninspired and I truly made some ordering errors the greatest crime of the night was the service

These guys were sitting behind us at different tables and started lightly arguing; ten minutes later it escalated to punches and beer being thrown literally over my head with the cooks and managers coming out with the cops on their way - subsequently slowing our already slow food by another 10 minutes
The staff is always friendly as well as quick to get your food out

That being said we had very good service - not super attentive but I much prefer when servers don't spend a lot of time hovering

Although I''m reluctant to go to a theme restaurant inspired by an SNL sketch I found cheeburger cheeburger to be better than a theme restaurant with mediocre food I was here once before when Tempe marketplace first opened and was overwhelmed by the topping choices Think last time I had a burger with feta mushrooms and olives trying to imagine a Mediterranean    burger really what ended up happening was flavor overload that I couldn't really taste the burger so I decided to give them another try this time around I got 1/2 lbs burger sorry a pound is just too much food with cheddar jack bacon and sauteed mushrooms we ordered a half order of the best of both worlds which is a basket of fries and onion rings with a side of cheese  the fries are good very crispy well seasoned and appear to be fresh cut  or at least a very convincing fake the onions rings are very crispy with a light batter that almost takes on a yellow tone my burger was well prepared they use sliced whole mushrooms instead of pre sliced the bacon was crispy and the cheese was nice and gooey so all in all it was a pretty decent burger I must say my burger was a bit greasy I cut my burger in half to eat it and by the time I moved on to the second half  my lower bun had become one and fused with my burger pattyOverall my experience was good and I would go back but I don't see it being a frequent choice and not just due to distance the main attraction seems to be the wide variety of burger toppings and the build-your-own inspired menu despite the food being consistent and good it's nothing I haven't tasted before though if I ever get the urge for a pepperoni peanut butter coleslaw Sri racha burger I can sleep easier at night knowing I've now got that issue handled
We walk in and let the waitress know we want to sit outside since it's so nice and they had misters
I didn't listen to her of course and ordered the Southwestern Burger w/ coleslaw and started with a nice stack of rings

Waiter was great but a bit pushy on menu items

*******Overall again super friendly staff which is nice
Always clean and neat well-stocked and with very friendly service

And it is possible that I expected something earth shattering within the vicinity of so much greatness read Pizzeria BiancoFirst of all - I had to approach the bar for service refills and a check

My order is always correct and the wings are still crispy when I get home so overall this is still a convenient and good place for wings

The restaurant itself is spacious the hostess and service attentive and friendly and the decor is tasteful
It would have been nice if the other customers at least looked happy with their orders as they arrived or by the time they finished
In fact the waiter who had never served it with that sauce combo said it looked so good he was going to try it out
It's got a nice ambience the waiters are really nice and for 3 people our bill was only $66 which in my opinion is a great deal
The inside is great there is a big horse a small stage and a bar maned by a fun staff
a good room and great guest services for a great price
The service is a bit unfriendly at times the large woman at the cash register just stared at me blankly as I stepped up to order
The place is also very clean  the ambiance is fabulous and service is always great
I will say the food is great the specials are the best deal going the staff helpful & quick
Awesome friendly service from Bobby too
Server was great but service was slow because she had tables outside and we were inside
Ordered brats and they were severely overlooked and bad
The staff is also consistently friendly and helpful
If you order a regular pizza it is not nearly as bad tasting as the lunch buffet
Service was VERY slow and the staff was not very helpful or knowledgeable
Its smart the food is good the service is on point and its different
The friendly always changing staff is helpful and yet to the point
The not so great thing here is the parking and the service is severely lacking
We remembered that in the good old days Rigatony's desserts were awesome so we ordered the Tiramisou and chocolate layered cake
The service is great but the crowd can be a little annoying at times
5 stars for price cleanliness fast and efficient service and delicious food

At the end of such a wonderful night we were hoping for a good Italian espresso with our dessert
They were able to quickly accommodate all 8 of us at 7pm before the monsoon hit our waitress Jody was very nice and was able to get our food and drinks to us quickly always a plus when you have a 3 year old near melt down
Customer service here is really friendly and the fact that this place is always packed and caters to the Sun City crowd and snow birds really isn't Costco's fault but it really makes shopping here a real pain in the ass

ProcessMB has a nice setup as far as ordering/paying is concerned and you can see everything they are doing i
Their staff is so knowledgeable friendly and willing to help locate your favorites amongst thousands of choices
It would be nice if they would expand international service out of Phoenix giving us non-stop options into Europe Asia South America maybe even Australia as Phoenix is easily within a large aircraft's range of all three continents
If they are too busy service gets slow given that there ain't too many servers but I go there to sit and dine at ease so no complaints
service on the other hand was not so great
other then the service being a Lil lousy id say its a great place
The service was very very painfully slow even though only one other table occupied the restaurant that Thursday afternoon
The French Fries are very good though and you get a whole BUCKET when you order 'em so be prepared to share or take them home with you
The service wasn't bad for our large group of 8 although they did screw up the order a bit
attentive friendly service and simple steak house fare prepared very very well
The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because the waitress was very nice and tried to be accommodating
I ordered the Cioppino which looked and smelled good when it came but it had several issues
Service was good and able to get drinks from next door as well
The staff is friendly and they finally did away with the cheap-o' paper towels and put real napkin dispensers on each table
Then the manager said that they just had 400 people come through there in movies so that was the reason they were slow
Beautiful resort great staff Sally Hilow made everything perfect she was very helpful
The staff was friendly and frequently checked on us to make sure we were taken care of

That special treatment includes Great Service; Great Food; Great Conversation; Great Atmosphere
I hoovered this thing down so fast I think I embarrassed my sweet beautiful and indulgent wife who did manage to get a bite or 2 of the dessert but not much more
The Waitress was very friendly she brought me a special sauce that she likes on the pizza a spicy aioli
The nice people from Peak Data ordered pizza for everyone
We ordered the dessert sampler but they were out of the creme brulee and the server was very gracious and was offering us a good choice of substitution

Came here with a huge birthday group and the staff were very accommodating and the service was quite fast

It's not as spacious or as GRAND but the food and service is still great
My son and I had a great time because of the level of service to make us feel welcomed
The drinks are cheap the food is great and the service is outstanding
Because the manager was really nice about the situation and I could tell the waitress was overwhelmed I will give the office two stars for now
We enjoyed a beautiful evening with a very attentive staff and wonderful food
A cute cozy spot with perfectly attentive service and fabulous and inexpensive food
Service was efficient and the check was split with no attitude which is a good thing although the waitress was a bit slow to pick up our checks
GradesOVERALL    B- Service   B-    Service was attentive but slowness in picking up the                         check is not a plus Food     B- Burger was good but too large and fries were forgettableDrinks  B It's good but not something I'd write  home about just in case you're wondering - I give A's only if it's superior
The service is good and so are the prices
The food is good and there is plenty of  desserts
Helpful clerks- good customer service but you have to ask
The service was attentive and complete
It was very clean and staff was very nice
Service/Cleanliness  Service can be slower than anticipated but then again this place isn't trying to dethrone McDonalds
Their staff of what can only be described as sweet natured hipsters are extremely friendly without coming off as insincere
On top of her being a bad waitress she had the personality of a door
Du00e9cor and Service  The place is very nice inside and the service was great servers and hostess are very friendly
I like the patio and have been told that it's a great happy hour hangout and they have a nice weekend brunch service that's on my to do list still
Of course they won me over with their friendly service and the free to-go ice tea
I ordered an Italian sandwich and it was good but quite standard
My only problem was this we ordered the cornbread bc it's obviously their highlight app and it was reaaaaallllyyy good but we didn't get it until after they served our main course
So no- they don't have much of a kitchen hummus and some small snacks are available and frankly I was a little surprised that the bartender didn't know more about the beers even though she otherwise gave great customer service but the beer itself makes all those other issues disappear
I got the order home and it was piping hot which is usually a good sign
I had ordered a chicken corn soup which had good flavor but more of that overcooked chicken and absolutely no corn
Everyone elses food was also great along with the service
But our waiter had a bad attitude right from the start
My mother-in-law asked the waiter if he could dim the lights because they were too bright for a nice dining ambiance and he said he would
Service was friendly and overall very good
The staff is amazingly friendly and down to earth
I ordered the meatloaf as many people on yelp raved about it - I did think it was good but nothing I would rave about
We got dessert even though nothing really sounded great - had the cookie tiramisu which was nice for an ice cream dessert which I wasn't expecting it to be but nothing special or memorable
The prices are excellent and the service is good
Dirty dishes were removed very quickly and service was attentive
I lucked out and got a very good waitress who checked on my table often
That's what great beer much better than average bar food and a young staff who think of you as that funny and hopefully not creepy older guy or gal as opposed to potential date material will do
I keep coming back because not only is the beer consistently good but so is the food and the service
The place is definitely a hole in the wall and the service was good and very nice

It is so nice to have vegan alternatives and not be stuck ordering side salads everywhere
I've never had a bad food or wine experience at Postino and I could tell that the staff is highly trained on all menu items and the wine they offer- which is a refreshing change
Our server also recommended a really good dessert wine to go with the tarte and it was fantastic
the staff here are very nice and friendly I wish all the other places I have been were like that
drink service was slow bartender poured weak cocktails and the whole experience was below average
Service was great but when I have to send something back which I rarely do I can't give more then 3 stars
Although the wait staff was friendly and it is where the Mai Tai was conceived I was not overly impressed
*Service = really nice*Decor = cute*Food = boba was horrible
The Staff was pretty attentive and the open kitchen kept things interesting with the occasional flames of fire catching my eye
My coffee barely a touch of pumpkin maybe that much the coffee wasnt so great and the service was very unfriendly
Right off the bat points for very friendly service
We were able to put in our order right away and the food came up fast

When most people think of McDonalds they probably envision stereotypically bad service
Good food fun vibe and friendly staff here
The place is clean and decorated very nicely the owners are supper nice and service is top notch even though you order at the counter they take care of you after that
However the nice service and the cleanliness earn it an extra star
Dessert was also really good we had the chocolate torte and the churro's w/ 3 sauces both were a delightful end to the meal rich and tasty
Justis was our server again and we had several other staff members catering to our every need including an extremely friendly GM
Staff was always friendly and inviting and remembers you
Staff was friendly and accommodating though
Service is slow because they don't seem to have the assembly line thing down like at other places hi Chipotle
The staff was not rude but I have no idea what our servers name was because she didn't say more than 10 words to us the entire meal
I feel bad as I write this review because the proprietors and staff are SO nice

We always have super-fast service and perfectly prepared food I just can't give this restaurant a better review
Everything about this place was fine in my book but absolutely not exceptional or worth the long wait loud space and slow order time for the pizza to arrive at the table
The service is great the food quality is awesome and the ambience is upscale and refreshing
The wait staff was very friendly and mostly attentive although I do feel like other tables got a bit more attention I think it's because I tend to be a younger diner at these types of establishments which means I won't order as expensive items or won't tip as much - so wrong but I digress
The others at my table ordered the special of the night that was some sort of fish and polenta that looked great
We also all ordered dessert carrot cake meh I've definitely had better chocolate mousse pretty good but standard bread pudding with a bourbon sauce super rich pretty good and homemade sorbets the lemon being the best and very refreshing
We ordered the Old Timer Breakfast and the Mamas Pancake Special
In summary the food was good the service was excellent but I've experienced better at a lower price point than Cowboy Ciao
Great group of people and excellent customer service
Service  Our server was friendly and attentive and she let us talk prior to ordering without interrupting us
I've been in this store numerous times and though I like to be left alone to wander when I do make - or try to make a purchase the owner and her staff are borderline rude
There are many other great places where the staff is welcoming and anxious to help
So as our evening was progressing and being seated my a friendly FEZ host did I tell you that the staff at FEZ have always been friendly and have never really given attitude and I like the service
and the idea of dessert and water with good company still sounded ok it just wasn't the same since I expected something to pick me up in order to keep our conversation flowing
Soooo good we order double of that everytime
Great friendly service and the food was fab
Everything I've ordered has been good and reasonably priced
Service I asked the clerk what would be a good meal for a family of four
They were all so nice & friendly and the service was remarkable
I would warn against the Chicken Tikka Masala though; the waitress said 'It's good if you like Indian food'; I'd say only try it if you've never tasted the real thing
Well wish I could say this place was top notch as the service was good
I plan on going here again most likely for a Pedicure and a few other services as she seems to have done quite a nice job
The food is great the ambiance is good the staff is cheerful but you're paying a lot for that when you can go down the road to In 'n Out Burger and pay a few bucks less for something almost as good
He's really nice but no matter what you try to order he'll try to point you towards something similar on the menu he thinks is better
Nor the service which is friendly and helpful
Our waters were consistently refilled for us by wandering good-looking waiters
Our friendly waiter came over pretty quickly and took our drink orders brought those out then took our food orders
Both were excellent and the service was great

The manager replied that was not a good idea because this is an asian restaurant

We ordered and got our food in a good timely manner
We each ordered something different and all was good
Our waitress was really friendly and bubbly and was quick to serve us and return to us often
Our waiter was friendly enough but not as friendly as he was to the group of women that was seated next to us
The wait for the food wasn't bad either but I hate when you as the customer have to ask for a wine list because your wine was empty for 10 minutes but the waiter didn't ask if you wanted anything else because he was focused on the table of 5 women next to us sharing an appetizer
The service was very attentive and professional the feel is genuinely festive
You know since you are at Safeway you are going to get good service but I have to say the bakery people are the best
They also have the beef patties but happened to be out today booo guess I'll just have to go back Overall a great little spot with perfect service for a little takeout joint excellent food and great island flavor in the heart of Phoenix
The staff is really friendly and knows most of my family  by name
Service was quick and both the servers seemed friendly enough and pretty quick with the water refills and ice spill disasters
To be completely honest if I didn't need work clothes so bad I would have turned around and taken my dollars elsewhere given the customer service I received in this store
Great product but customer service needs some work
On the plus side the atmosphere was nice service excellent and I for one did not think it is as overpriced as some other reviewers did

Haven't been inside the restaurant yet having only used the drive through but will say that the drive through was quick and they have pull ahead spots designed for those times when your order may be a little slow so they don't block up the window

Normally good service however the server we had today 09/19/10 sucked she waited on us like she did us a favor blonde with a blue hat or bandana on her head not sure her name
Postinos normally good service food is ok but that blonde server on Sunday placed a sour note on breakfast
There is no indication of how you order your food and when you finally figure it out the food does not taste good
I didn't even know she was the manager she just seemed like a nice person who worked there and was genuinely interested
My manager said you guys discussed your experience with her and were very friendly and we appreciated your feedback and the fact you were really nice about it and she wants to make sure you always get the best experience possible when you come here
I even told him the food was not bad and neither was the service and she didn't have to do that

Yogurtland has some awesome flavors is always spotlessly clean they even use those little mini vacuums to clean up the toppings off the counter and has great service
All of the staff is always super nice to me especially when I'm embarrassed that it's my second visit in one day
The other thing that chapped my ass about this waitress was the fact that we were there well before 6pm and there are Early Bird Dinner specials offered from 3-6 which she never suggested and looked to be a great value
Lousy service never felt like I was a welcome part of the restaurant BUT great food
Staff is so friendly here and are willing to go out of the way to help and entertain you as you get your drink on

My friend and I both ordered the croissant breakfast sandwich which was super delicious and filling
My friend ordered the Iced Toddy which was really good-- spiced but mellow
For our entrees dad & hubs ordered the breakfast enchiladas mom ordered their signature mushroom dish & I ordered the fried egg & bacon sandwich
I thought I wrote a review on this place but we will try this again this place sits in a half empty mall but it is a great down home breakfast spot but they also do lunch and dinner Service is good wends day and Friday are fish fry night  which we gave a whirl as well it was good but being from Seattle we have a tough time finding good seafood except at sushi restaurants we frequent this place is well worth a try
Great prices cool atmosphere young friendly attentive staff
The pizza was good but I can't imagine ordering anything other than that off the menu
They were professional and had great customer service
I will go back to order there family meal which sounds like a great deal
We were showed to our table our waitress was Jennifer very nice and very sweet she explained the menu to us since it was both our 1st time there we ordered the Cowboy Stuff which was bbq ribs & chicken crispy shrimp steak & seafood kabobs beans veggies potatoes wedges and some other stuff I have to say the one thing that stood out was the ribs omg they are fall off the bone melt in your mouth good
I have to say Jennifer and the nice man at valet parking showed get customer service but the hostess left me with a bad impression and she is where the dining experience starts
The waitress was very helpful and very fast
The only thing that was a little concerning to me was how fast my waitress brought out  the food
Normally that would be a good thing but it took around five or so minutes for her to take our orders in and bring out the food
We stayed for a week and the staff there was pretty friendly and professional
Had lunch today and it was yummy and the service was particularly nice
Slowish service with friendly staff jazzy electronic music

It's kept very clean the staff is friendly and the food is DELICIOUS
On this occasion the wait staff was very friendly but I've had it before where they are like buzzing bees
The staff was friendly and very helpful
The staff has been great and put on any televised sporting event that i requested
Had a great experience watching the US/Ghana World cup match in the bar as the staff was very friendly and into the match as were the patrons
The service that I received with regard to our rehearsal was great

BIG PLUS d'lish is staffed by pretty good looking people and the clientele is as friendly as they are
Prices are reasonable but more importantly the staff is professional and very friendly
The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly
Several of them aren't even all that friendly or accomodating and none of them are at all efficient-- and it's not because they are letting you enjoy your stay it's because THEY FORGET ORDERS
I saw this as a good opportunity to get some maintenance done so on January 24th I went to my local Jiffy Lube at the address above a location I've been visiting since around 2003 and got an oil change and two additional services done
The waitstaff is attentive usually though there were times at the breakfast buffet when I needed to get my own coffee
After this it took another good 15 minutes just to order dinner and I figured I better get a drink in while I had the chance
Oh and by the way bad waitress you took all of my silverware away
Needless to say the service was HORRIBLE and the food wasn't good enough to make up for it
The prices are reasonable the food and service is great and the atmosphere is really nice
The service is friendly and they'll good care of you
I came in and was met with a very friendly staff and a nice office

The staff is always friendly and the service is great
Reasonable prices good service over-priced snacks like every other theater and comfy seats
The service the first time and each subsequent visit was excellent and the food was brought out ridiculously fast
Otherwise everything we ordered was good and at the right price
Next time let me order at the window give me a number and I can pick up my food and drink a lot faster
The staff is very friendly however they are either extremely attentive-like all the waiters seem to come up one right after the other and ask if we need refills-or you have to walk up to the bar to get any attention
While the view and atmosphere were very nice our service there was inexcusably poor
However the hostesses bussers and other waiters around us were all great so much so we were tempted to move to another table
Maybe he was having a bad night but for this type of establishment and for the amount of money you're laying out you would expect half-way decent service
Consequently we had great expectations for our entrees- if the service was bad at least our food would be good but alas to our dismay again we were somewhat disappointed
There are too many other great restaurants in Phoenix with fantastic views and ambience to waste this type of money on poor service and mediocre food
As stated in other reviews the staff is friendly
The service wasn't bad but wasn't impressive either
It's not often I give a place less than three stars unless I had a real bad experience there like shit service huge wait or a cockroach in the pudding

Beyond the very friendly staff nothing else is making me want to come back
On my first venture I ordered a breakfast burrito
The next time I went I ordered a breakfast sandwich
I didn't really have the customer service issues everyone else is mentioning - I had a nice 20-something girl who helped me with the my two Groupons that I came in with
First our waitress was a bit off - just off on timing her explanations a whole host of things but she did do a good job keeping up with the pony keg of iced tea we all drank

The facility was clean the coffee was free and looked like it had been brewed the same week the service was fast and the staff were friendly
I've ordered it several times and it is consistently good

Ok service was not good --- when we got the bill the pizza and wings were charged separate -- not right -- it was a together order per the menu
Ordered the Mexican breakfast and it was listed as coming with rice & beans on the drive through sign but I never received them
The staff has always been friendly and helpful

Pho Van was very quick to seat us the staff was amazing in taking our order and explaining the various dishes and the food came out lighting fast
The gym was perfect & the staff were helpful & friendly
We had great food at the restaurant but TERRIBLE dinner service sadly
Staff isn't always the most friendly but I suppose that's bound to happen everywhere
Be prepared to wait at least half an hour on weekends to get a table and  table service is slow as well  they don't take reservations for parties under 6
You are still able to order dinner menu items from the bar as well which is nice
The Manager Peter very nice guy took time to sit with me and talk about the concept and make sure I was happy with my meal
Such a great concept plentiful and good food priced right and very friendly staff
They have great customer service and the inside decor makes you feel as if you're actually seated on a patio
the service was great but it was pretty busy and so maybe the kitchen was backed up
I've read some of the other reviews before we went & was rather taken back by customers indicating the food was ok or the service was not good
When our waitress came to take our order my boyfriend asked what's really good

Actually the Doubletree Phoenix hotel at Phoenix airport has great service provides nice amenities and a free full breakfast buffet
The service was excellent and attentive throughout dinner
The service other than on minor point was the absolute best and the food was great
-Order took maybe 20 minutes to receive not good if you have a certain amount of time for lunch
To top it off the staff was friendly helpful and actually knew the menu what else could you want

Although it was good I wouldn't order that for myself again
The service was SLOW and the people that worked there didn't seem to care
Overall very nice service  - they had no problems splitting our tab with the other person we went to lunch with - and pretty decent food for the price
The service was quite attentive as well
Tuna nigiri was great and the two orders of yellowtail nigiri we had were split - first one was great second order wasn't as tasty different fish I guess
Staff were friendlyhelpful and attentive the place was clean but  that's not really a selling pointthat's meant to be a given
I mean once is good service but after the customer replies that they've had it before don't continue to treat them like newbie white devils
The staff was all friendly and not at all salesman-like
This place is wonderful the food is great and the service was top notch
First off all of their mexican food is grossly overpriced and their delivery takes FOREVER but their burgers were good and they delivered to our work so we still ordered
Guacamole was great and there was plenty for 5 people to share in the order
the desserts where awesome the thres leche cake with coconut icecream and pineapple was great the also had a lime tart which was basically keylime pie but not so thick
There is a great selection to choose from for the desserts
The staff was courteous very pleasant and incredibly attentive; they came around often to check up on us
Now in all fairness I ordered cheese enchiladas for my dinner and they were actually VERY good
Overall good meal the dessert was memorable and I want to go back just for that Salted Caramel Pudding
But it would've been nice to have them tell us straight out that they had a 46 person table on the other side of the restuarant that just ordered and that the giant party to our right hadn't gotten their food yet either
My experience was not bad but not very great either it's more on the bad side but I was okay with the service
Very small restaurant with only 2 people running it made for understandably slow service but they worked incredibly hard
Silly name friendly staff small interior generous portion fresh flavorful ingredients good value for the money
There really are few words to describe how perfect the food is how delectable the salas are how great the waitstaff is and how awesome the vibe is
However it was a little slow when we went in and the cashier not only took our order she let me sample anything I wanted to try after my friend told her it was our first time eating there
The service was great and they have a pretty huge space so if you do find yourself needing to lay across 3 chairs after eating you might have that option if the restaurant is slow
The service here is good and they've got an AWESOME home-made meatball sandwich that kicks the %$% out of anything you'll find at one of the bigger chain sandwich shops such as Subway
The waiter comes out 5 minutes later with the bill and gives a super friendly thank you
I'm a great tipper if and when I get good service
Well the food and service definitely weren't good
The sound system was good the staff were all business and got the job done
This was the worst Ethiopian food I have ever had combined with slow and inattentive service
The servers were nice there were two trying to help us but they kept miscommunicating with each other about what we ordered
If you are looking for Ethiopian food I highly recommend Cafe Lalibela for prompt and attentive service excellent food and a friendly atmosphere
The staff was very friendly and helpful
Service friendly but VERY SLOW I wouldn't recommend coming here if you have somewhere to be after dinner
There isn't another shop that carries the selection and if you don't see what you are looking for ask has the friendly and actually knowledgeable staff and reputation that Haus does
The inventory and shop is always rotating and fresh so I like to stop in and see what's new almost weekly plus the staff is really friendly and always willing to talk bikes
Bottom line if you are looking for good quality and service this is the place
I ordered a $12 margarita which was good but I can't imagine any margarita being worth that
Total price of bad pod and overpriced drink and decent service for one is $28
Our initial server was not very friendly and service was slow
Service was fast with an assembly line of folks churning out these sandwiches with extreme precision and never missing a beat on preparing gourmet selections
Its prior location in a retired bank vault hence the name was presumably much more charming than its current Valley-standard strip mall locale but it makes up for it with friendly and helpful staff
The admin staff was also really friendly and helpful
The food was amazing the customer service was great and the prices were modest
As you enter the store you are greeted by a friendly and knowledgeable staff member who will point you in whatever direction you need to go
No self-checkout here with a toothless ogrish overseer great service from start to finish
just a nice bar with a really friendly staff
Super delicious pho very friendly service that goes the extra mile to make their guests feel comfortable and wonderful atmosphere
The service was annoyingly slow due either to understaffing or inattentiveness
Altogether a good place with a nice atmosphere and attentive service
We stood so long at the door with half a dozen staff people walking by us that I said this is a bad sign maybe we should go somewhere else
The service was friendly and attentive but what else did she have to do
Great menu selections awesome specials friendly service classy simple ambiance fantastic wine and cocktails
However they more than made up for it when it came to the friendly service and sangria happy hour
The view is incredible the locker rooms are clean spacious and equipped with everything you could possibly need the showers are awesome customer service is great and I could go on
Nice spacious restaurant with a more than friendly staff who were very attentive to both me and my guest
The staff were very friendly when we arrived we immediately felt right at home I was kinda looking for a sofa in the corner to kick my shoes off and take a nap afterward
If anything the staff may have been a little too attentive
All in all nice place with pretty good service and pretty good food
Our waiter brought it out with a candle on top and it ended up being free nice touch from the restaurant
The bottom line was I found the food and service good but nothing above ordinary for Mexican/Southwestern fare
ORIGINAL REVIEW - October 17 2006It's a damn shame that food this good comes with service that bad
The food is good enough that we continue to go there about once a week despite the terrible service
quality staff was very friendly and lastly - probably the best pizza i have ever had in my life
It's just really amateur hour here with the piss poor service and their bad attitudes and obnoxious patrons
Honestly I wish the waiter would have said oh and if you don't prefer breakfast you can go grab a wrap and bring it to the table
The wait staff were very attentive and pleasant
My guy and I stopped for breakfast Saturday morning it took awhile to be seated but once we were the service wasn't bad for as busy as they were
Ordered the usual a Raspberry Lemonade and Grandpa's Breakfast whatever
and a friendly and awesome staff always there to offer tips on types of food if you're feeling ambitious to try something new
The croquettes were borderline life-changing in a good way as were the hazelnut chocolate creme lollipops that came with the check
We ordered the sausage Sampler at $10 and were surprised at the size of the sampler nice size
The ambiance service and fushion of ingredients were great
But I will say that the staff was very friendly and attentive
The exterior of the building may be very generic but inside it is very clean and cozy with a friendly staff adding to the overall warmth of the place
Gave good recommendations very attentive and even when all eight of use were yelling out an order she got everything right
So far they haven't gotten our order wrong everyone has been incredibly nice and there is always a game on
Staff was friendly and the grounds were so well kept
Everyone was friendly and because of their customer service- the gentleman at the counter Brett and Yogie we will be returning
Ordered the Chicken Tika Masala pasty since I was in the international mood & Yelpers said it was good
It probably took ten minutes or so for the waitress to return to our table with our glorious fancy fruit decorated drinks and a moundful of torta goodness
They were ready for the crowd and although the line was long it moved quickly and the staff was friendly
But again although there was a line it moved quickly and the staff was friendly
Incredible bend-over-backward-friendly service
The waitstaff was incredibly attentive and polite
The place is small but the Host/ waiter / Owner's Son did a great job serving the 4 groups of people
The atmosphere was fun and the service was speedy and friendly
They continuously had to go through the entire order so people could figure out if that was their order which slowed down the entire process and made the front of the place a zoo
The VIG got too big too quick and forgot about good customer service
The rest of the menu looks really good but the gyro is so good I can't get myself to order anything other than that
The staff is typically young friendly ladies and I have  anew fan at the Ind
I have had great service from the estheticians/ masseuses otherwise I would have given one starI'm going to give this location one more try because they are new but if they can't improve their customer service I'll pay the extra money and go back to Dolce
It has a great selection of everyday items photo services a full section of alcoholic beverages easily accessible pregnancy tests a friendly staff and really competitive prices
The service was superb and they even packed my left overs in a box with a nice looking bag
Our service was actually quite good maybe because we got there at about 1130
phpService at Havana can be a little slow but that's very true to it's cuban roots
The bar area has a separate menu with lots of great specials but you can also order from the regular dinner menu if you'd like
The wait staff is friendly helpful and very attentive
I don't go here as much for the food though as I do for the great service wine and laid-back environment
Their salsa is very good but it can be a struggle to get the waitress to get a second bowl
Usually they will be good about giving you tips on ordering so that adding extras doesn't cost you
You will get great customer service if you dress like a Scottsdale snob flashing your money worse than Rodeo Drive
The staff i dealt with was friendly and attentive without getting on your nerves
This place is characterized by rude service okay food and a generally callous attitude toward customers
The manager was not helpful either and his attitude was simply that the waitress is usually very good - this despite the fact that we complained that she was awful
Anyhow the restaurant's dining areas are lovely but the hotel staff the bartender in the lobby area bar was rather cold - no smile not friendly in the least obviously we weren't hip  enough to be treated politely and the pre-lunch cocktail we had was greatly lacking in alcohol content
Our waiter was very attentive very courteous and efficient
I was pleasantly surprised with the good service and will be back again
The staff has always been friendly here
it's clean and the waiters are soooo nice
The staff are very friendly and my favorite part is you are asked what you want to drink right away and don't forget the glasses are HUGE
Service was attentive most of the time and although he forgot to get our straws and slipped up on one of our drinks I'll give him the benefit of the doubt
Very good pizza for the price much cheaper than a Cibo or Pane pizza and of comparable quality minus the wait and snobby staff
Service could be a little more attentive and personal but it was acceptable
After looking around it seemed that it just might have been our waitress as the people around us didn't seem to be getting great service either
Unrelated to the actual service the water from the fountain was so good
I hate to write a review like this the food was really good the service was really bad
I liked the food so much that even with the bad service i wanted to buy some gift cards for gifts I waited and waited for the cards then when I got the acting manager to sell me the cards he told me that they have a promotion if you buy a $25 gift card you get a $5 card for free I thought that was a nice bonus
The servers had no direction in what they were doing the place was way understaffed which made for a less than great dining experience
In closing I have to say the food was really good the service was really bad
Sometimes I don't feel like I'm getting good service because it seems like some of the waiters think it's more important to yuck-it-up with the regulars than to give all of their tables the attention they need/deserve
You can find a great selection of Simply Bread shout out to my old 'hood purchase your herbal supplements buy some gluten-free breadstick mix pick up some environmentally friendly cleanser order a fresh coffee and pastry and soon be able to order meals from their deli
With that out of the order Firehouse is good
The service staff is friendly but not well versed in Japanese food fare and this makes for unknowledgeable people who cannot answer questions about the food and its preparation
Waiter was very attentive and service was unbeatable
The place is a little small but filled up quickly and service was friendly and we never had to ask for anything
The atmosphere and decor is nice but the service was ok
The coconut flan with caramel for dessert was very good
The atmosphere and decor is nice but the service was ok
The coconut flan with caramel for dessert was very good
We ordered a nice tabbouleh salad $2
I had ordered the Turkey and Avocado sandwich  can't remember the exact name of it and it was good
When we came in we found a nicer tree that was slightly higher in price but the manager waved her hand and said not to worry they would give it to us as a fair exchange for all our troubles
All through this experience we were very patient and felt the staff was really working hard to satisfy our needs but in the end the products they were selling weren't as good as their efforts
The service was quick and friendly the bartender was attentive
Great food meets wonderful service with the added charm of a tremendous venue
The service here is good quick and friendly as well
Even the service was good which seems to be an improvement since the reviews began
Beware though these bad boys pack a punch in your stomach you get three to an order and I am lucky if I can eat one and half
Overall I think this is a great lunch spot and the service is always great
Nothing fancy or shiny just solid food from the eggs and pancakes to the constantly fresh cup of coffee and polite attentive service gets me coming back again and again
The staff is very nice and the little boy that runs around in a Cardinals jersey is adorable
I would recommend the place to anyone who has some time to spare for a long breakfast since there could be a little wait to get your food they are usually really busy but friendly service
Service at the kiosk was also amazing and the bathrooms are easily some of the nicest I've seen and let's face it this totally factors into the rating a restaurant gets
Ambience was nice though and our waiter B was amazing
I explain to said manager about the situation to which she rudely and flatly responds Yeah that's right there's no substitutions and gives me this stare like I was retarded or something
The ambiance and friendly service from the baristas is enough to pick this place over Starbucks or some other chain but no this place goes the extra mile in every which way
The coffee is almost bad but the waitresses always look happy
One star for fast service and clean environment
They don't have much of a happy hour just $1 for drafts but our waitress was nice enough to sneak in an order for 2 beers each since we arrived about 10 minutes before 6pm
I've also had slower service inside not bad just a little on the taking-their-sweet-time side
The staff was friendly knowledgeable and prompt when we needed something
So if you're looking for a nice dinner in a quaint environment with a wonderful service staff then Quiessence will suit you just fine
First the staff is as attentive and friendly as any restaurant I've ever been in and I've been in 47 states and three continents
The desserts are nice though I'm usually too full to eat one
Service was good - Muey is beautiful by the way - She was vert attentive checking on us often
I just want any new staff to listen  when I ask for no cheese on my breakfast burrito  I don't expect to find my egg swimming in extra cheese wiz when I arrive at work
I really really want to give Postinos Central five stars but the service was so slow I had to down grade to four
They were so good that we decided to ditch ordering salad and get another bruschetta board
I recommend this place because the food is so good but bring your patience for the parking and slow service
This review is only for lunch because they have a good lunch special and unlike some of the other Thai restaurants in the area you have the option of ordering off the regular menu or the lunch menu which is necessary if you are in the mood for Tom Yum
The staff is very friendly and always helps me carry my food to the car
Big portions great sides and great service
Side-note there is free wifi the customer services is great also the atmosphere is perfect for meeting friends getting work done and studying
Service has always been great friendly attentive staff
We ordered a pitcher of beer and the Jalapeno bottle caps beer battered-deep fried slices of jalapeno goodness
2nd time we couldn't figure out What to order I lost my appetite from the menu choices and the waitress had a bad attitude
I will say the place is pretty spendy try about $28-$55 for an entree and all ala carte but worth it for special occasions especially when the service is so great
If you need to be in-and-out quickly this is a good time to fill up a few little plastic cups with salsa for the road - there is a salsa bar with probably 5 or 6 salsas to choose from and there will be no salsa already included with your to-go order
What clinched it for me was that I ordered it To Go which is almost never a good idea when it comes to the pho do not attempt to assemble at your desk
Our server/bartender redeemed herself from the earlier mispronunciation with some good recommendations efficient service and a friendly smile
Staff was very friendly and even offered me a glass of water while I waited
Service can be great if you get the right server in the right mood
Our waitress had great advice and pointed out several cost saving tricks while ordering She had great knowledge and was completely on top of all our tables needs
The food was very good and the service was exceptional
Finally the waiter was attentive enough to make sure we had everything we needed but never pushy or overbearing
I don't recall the service ever being friendly
With that said Cibo still gets 4 stars from me because of the adorable converted house it occupies the decent service and pretty good pizzas
Our waiter was this funny guy named Derek who at first I thought I wasn't going to like that much I have an aversion to trendy scottsdale people but turned out to be wonderful and make great suggestions all night
The service is pretty good even when the place is full
Not bad but the cutters mixed my order and I got a combination of regular and spicy sausage
The food was quite good and the wait staff very attentive
Clean hotel with very friendly front desk staff
Our OrdersAnne Boleyn Hot Tea & Herbs really smooth and flavorful served in a cute teapotHealthy Protein Burger good the air-fried sweet potato fries were really good
I even asked the server if it was a good veggie burger or if I should order something else she said We have VERY good veggie burgers
Our server was very prompt and friendly and suggested if we were going to order fries off the gluten free menu we should do so early as they take longer to prepare so we ordered them in advancebaked not fried
OrderingI was being stared at by the seemingly nice woman behind the counter which caused me to precariously decide on the carne asada
I'm sort of a plain Jane and generally just order a non-fat latte don't ruin their great roasted on-site coffee with a syrup
from their friendly knowledgeable staff
Yes it's cheap and it's great that they deliver but I won't be ordering from them again
Place is generally well kept and service is friendly and courteous
Excellent service friendly staff especially the  handsome young german ;
Very efficient professional and friendly staff technicians and doctors
The folks are very friendly and the service excellent but that's about it
It's too bad that bad service detracts so much from good food
They are made to order so have a little patience- as good things come to those who wait
I have also ordered the Sarah Palin Salad which despite its name is actually really good and the perfect lunchtime salad

For my boyfriend and I we ordered-  Pho Special- Lemongrass Chili Chicken- Spring RollsIt was all sooooooooo good
Wiser the second time I went I ignored my waiter's advice to order another dish that seemed to be also a prime candidate for cheese drowning and went for the fish tacos which were quite good and served with a heaping portion of rice and beans
The service was very good at the start but died when they got busy
Although the manager here was great printing out nutritional value menu for me and another waitress walked me to the bathroom
Sure the place may be pretty fancy but if customer service sucks then I find that more important than having a nice looking bathroom
Our waiter was very friendly and quick

When I told the manager that it wasn't the dollar amount that mattered it was that my credit card was charged for something I didn't sign for he was rude and said that he was sending me the dollar fifty what else did I want

I had a good classic breakfast but was a little put off that you can't order sides of something
Once we finally ordered after almost 20 minutes and my partner was ready to eat the flowers on the table food came out improbably fast so the problems this place has lay firmly with the front-of-house
The staff is super-friendly which makes it fun to hang out while having a few rounds and playing a game of Farkle to the death

I'm the sort of person who will frequent a business with great customer service even if the goods they offer aren't the best

We ordered the strudel since it sounded adventurous and was it ever delicious
All in all a very pleasant experience with attentive service great presentation and delightfully tasty food
I had planned on eating lunch there but did not order any food in part because I did not want to give them the satisfaction in part because their food really isn't that good anyway and in part because my stomach got quite upset after they picked the fight with me
There was only one good waitress on staff and she came by our table to let us know that she was being sent home early
I never thought that any place would ever do this to any club that lets them know in advance that we're coming shows up very regularly with good numbers behaves well and provides much-needed revenue for the bar and the wait staff

It's layed back nice patio off of Scottsdale Rd open bar to the outside good bartenders and waitresses and so on
We order the chips and guac every time the guac has chunks of orange in it which makes for an unexpected burst of citrusy goodness
As I said their service was a joke extremely slow and not friendly
Chips are awesome and so is the salsa  I always judge the Mexican restaurants I go to by their salsa BAD the first time we went the service was just okay
The waitress came out right away and had a thick Italian accent always a really good sign when you're at an Italian restaurant
Also my water glass never got empty which to me is the true test of how good a restaurant's service is

00 one mid-range wine you could buy for 20$ at Bevmo 6 beers and 2 vodka martinisbad bartenders we had to practically grovel to get any kind of service and her male sidekick wasn't any better bad waiter too busy to talk and chat and the room was EMPTY what more can i say
One bad thing was that the server knew we were sharing and he let us order the manicotti and eggplant dish which were virtually identical outside of the texture
Anyway the service wasn't that great but I give them the benefit of the doubt for it was new years eve and it was pretty crazy in there
But all the items we ordered from the dinner menu were very good and I would dine there again in a heartbeat
So it took a while to get our food but this time I had a better experiences very friendly services good food good conversation

Food-Table-side guac best and freshest-tasting guac ever; little guac man actually pushes a little cart full of ingredients to you and makes the guac by your table-side-Street corn good liked the option of having the corn shaved in a bowl instead of on a cob so I didn't look like I'm from Sparta eating-Chorizo porchetta decent but not the best pork shoulder I've had wasn't as tender as I'd like tasted more gamey than I'm used to-Green chili duck confit I didn't try this but feedback from my dining partner was thumbs up-Pumpkin bread pudding with ice cream and pomegranate pieces I approve as a dessert connoisseur-Espresso churros interesting but was just okay; didn't like the milkshake you're supposed to dip the churros in hate alcoholic taste in my dessert stuff; churro sticks looked like poo on a plateService-Our waiter memorized his menu spiel but didn't seem too genuinely enthusiastic about anything was very fatigued or stoned
looking the whole time also his stoned smiles made me feel uncomfortable/creeped out-Forgot our orders for a really long time and I almost got full on chips the waiter didn't try to make up for it but just did his creepy-stoned-smiley-apologyAmbiance-Very nice setting one of the few outdoors patios I like-Lights are too dim and I couldn't see shit
They do a courtesy check even if you do not ask for one which sounds great but its just a ploy to get you to purchase additional services
The only negative thing I will write is that the service is not great
If you need ideas on things to do with your out of town guests there is a Visitor Center staffed by Certified Tourism Ambassadors from Greater Phoenix Convention & Visitors Bureau with lots of tourism information
While the food was tasty aside from the fact that it was cold by the time it was served to us the service was EXTREMELY slow and lackluster they were fairly busy but not enough to warrant the slow service

The food is good the price is right for sure and the service is prompt
Friendly family staff loved the fact that if there was an argument between family members in the dining area it was in Swedish or German
The staff was friendly and management was very gracious for taking the uneaten veggie burger off the bill but it was still too expensive and not a good enough first-time experience to return
However I could not give more than three stars because in my several at least 10 times of coming here I have only received good service once
They repeatedly mess up orders they are very slow

The unusual warm service was smothering my nonchalant I-just-want-to-eat-good-pho mood
The friendly bar staff provided good service and kept the bar clean
The steak was cooked well exactly as ordered and was a good cut
So just to clarify - I still love the product and the friendly service and the delicious toppings but I think I'm safer financially and diet wise heading to the the other location
Good food a bit limited breakfast selection their on line menu had more options but we had been waiting so long to just get our drink order we didn't waste more time asking questions
This place seemed to be a popular breakfast spot so they should really address the common complaint of slow service but staffing more waiters or cooks to remedy the situation
The staff was all very funny and nice which was great
There was not a manager in sight and I would guess this is a manager lack of control issue- you can tell this happens there all the time- TOO BAD

The fish was the best we had EVER had the drinks were exceptional the atmosphere was great for our date night and the service was on par
Our waitress was great and got Hubby's requisite Oyster Crawfish and Mushroom Fondeaux started right away
Gina B was correct - maybe negative stars ----- I ate there once with my wife years ago ------ she didn't remember it ---- we drove by tonight ---- and I said why not ---- The waitress we had was really good from Guatemala ------- The food was average at best and probably less then average ----- it was not crowded for Friday evening - and it seemed it has a regular crowd ----- My wife had the fish ---- special ---- she commented way to heavy on the potatoes or fries ------ and my patty melt looked like it was just thrown together and the onions - way overdone ----- and dammit or darn it ---- I order a root beer and it comes in a can ---- come on Linda ---- and then the bill ---- Fish special - patty melt ----- two sodas ----- 28

Can we all agree that the absolute most annoying thing is bad service

The staff is friendly and incredible nice to us

*SERVICE  Down-to-earth super friendly
Yes - I see posts about the waiters and waitresses not speaking good English
The staff was friendly- but our server was a little flighty- I don't think she had been working there very long as she wasn't very familiar with the menu and had to ask us what the menu said
I am a restaurant manager and I would never put someone on the floor who wasn't familiar with the menu- it looks bad on the serve and on management

You order and pay at the counter for breakfast
Pros Correct portions which leave you full and satisfied without being uncomfortableThe food is fresh and simpleNice clean simple build out in a space that isn't crowded and large enough to accommodate the crowdsConsService is unremarkableThe food can be a little plain to the point that you find yourself reciting the line it's healthy when prompted for your opinion

Anyway we finally ordered and I got the fried chicken and the BF got the short ribs which he was really excited for and we got the green chili mac and cheese due to the good reviews of it
but nothing on the dessert menu looked very good and honestly we were scared to get a dessert after the food being so lackluster
The staff was friendly and my watch was fixed in a matter of minutes
They also wanted coffee and since nobody at Next Coffee could be bothered to greet those horrible pain-in-the-ass customers who had the temerity to show up before closing time without giving prior notice to the staff it was up to me to tell them that the rude jerkface staff not only was not going to sell them squat even though it was 10 minutes shy of their posted closing time they wouldn't even have the courtesy to say 'sorry no service now'

Good thing the servers were nice and the service was good
I asked the waiter about it and asked him to check with the bartender to see if it was a fresh draw from the tap or maybe it was a bad bottle or maybe it had been sitting opened and gone flat or

The bartender/our waitress was soooo friendly loved her

There were several kids in our group this totally could have been a disaster anywhere else but at Grimaldi's it was great service and excellent food as always
however no one told the patrons it was a soft opening so it just looked like a badly run place - from wrong orders to a severely misspelled menu I had fun going through it with copy-editing marks to what seemed a lack of caring about the patrons with a blase attitude
And did I mention the helpful friendly and knowledgeable staff
They are always friendly and like to strike up random conversations with strangers - the staff is super nice as well
The food is overpriced and not that great including the desserts
However I gave the place 3 stars because 1 They had good service 2 While they don't cook the greatest steak in the work their Rib-eye wasn't bad 3 The side of mash potatoes were fairly tasty

Will need to come back here to pass better judgment but so far- open late on a Monday- friendly staff I've never heard of someone mixing beers to approximate something that you wanted that they ran out of but they did- cozy atmosphere in which to either zone out by your lonesome or chill with votre amis I'm on business travel by my lonesome for three weeks so I was the latter that third-parties would likely take pity on when I'm in reality running a GREAT buzz and fully entertaining myselfAnd no cons to report
Overall staff were great and concert-goers were pretty polite but then I wasn't on the Floor where the crazy general admission mosh was going on

I don't know if my stylist was having a bad morning or if she just decided she didn't feel like doing the customer service part of her job but I immediately got the notion that blow-drying my hair was the last thing she wanted to do
The main reason for this yelp is the rudeness of the staff here the woman behind the counter had a chip on her shoulder and treated not only us but others in line with arrogance

~the service was really good i had no idea what to order and the clerk suggested a sandwhich that i was already leaning towards grilled ham on rye he suggested several other dishes and explained why he liked them the other dudes who worked here were all smiles and quite genial they made you feel right at home
~the prices were all pretty decent and nothing was out of order all fairly commonplace for the neighborhoodthe bad~the ingredients; while my sandwhich was delicious and im sure everything on the menu is as well i noticed some key factors that made me go tch  -shredded iceburg lettuce c'mon really
All in all Zoes is a tasty convenient fast place to grab a bite but the classy interior and quality of service bely the tragically roach coach aspect of some of the ingredients
which when compared to other airport Starbucks really isn't different at all BUT this one has AMAZING staff who's friendly and willing to make whatever your heart desires despite the long line of people they have to make special drinks for

Service was good and I would definitely come back to try the small plates that were listed during happy hour and check out the downstairs lounge but can't recommend the entrees for the price

The music was nice for the setting and the cocktail waitress was a sweetheart
But I felt completely comfortable here and the customer service was great
The food was good the service was okay the ladies are a bit older so smiling is not part of their service
Hopefully I can update this review in October when I stay with a nice glowing revival of your staff and your hotel
Service was fast we didn't have to wait for a table at the 545ish time frame fairly friendly with consistent bussing and refill service
Finally he took my order very rudely like i totally bothered him 2-3 minutes later and as I left he went back to talking to them instead of making my damn sandwich
I have no idea why there are so many bad reviews on here but we were more than satisfied with the food and the staff was very nice and prompt
Good friendly service doing their best to make you happy - even with HUGE numbers of people - you get good fast service and they have a system that gets you in & sitting painlessly
I ordered the Vampiro because it sounded good had guac carne asada and was portrayed as a quesadilla type meal
The food and staff were great I tried numerous sandwiches and salads now and depending on what you are looking for its all good
The service though is sometimes lacking; unfriendly waitress at lunch and a bartender who ignored me at night BUT that was only two times out of a handful of other times where I have had fine service
Everything from beginning to end was perfect - service ambience seating and selection and amount of food was incredible along with a very good wine selection
Therefore the service could have been a little better but it wasn't too bad compared to the amount of people who were there
Our entree orders were Breakfast Steak and eggs and Smoked Salmon hash
So our overall experience wasn't so good with the egg situation services wasn't  attentive either
Rude inattentive staff confusing lay out ridiculously priced drinks and good food if they aren't out of it
I don't think the owner is reading these reviews because the only thing that is constant is how bad the service is
The staff was friendly & fast attentive to our dwindling water glasses and clearing plates quickly
i ordered the egg sandwich and mr h ordered the big breakfast
When I went to pick up the truck the Manager rudely asked me if I really needed 2 days to move
Service could improve The busboys were extremely nice and helpful but the majority of the wait staff had attitudes
The staff is always pleasant and friendly usually the guys taking your ticket inside will joke with you
Bright colors fast moving waiters even when the service is slow the waiters seem to be flying by
If you are lucky enough to have an attentive waiter you may even get the basket refilled
Just walking into the restaurant the staff are very unfriendly and make no effort to greet they just don't care that permeates every member of staff in the restaurant
In Japan you are supposed to eat sushi whole but when we ordered the Hana Roll Their best standard roll IMHO I could cut it into two perfectly sized pieces--if nori was nicely cut-able so in the end it was a disaster on my plate and eaten piece-meal
Hard to beat but I do struggle when ordering because their Yakibuta Ramen Japanese BBQ pork w/ egg noodles is also SO good
Good thing you can order it as an appetizer
I must agree with other Yelpers in their spottiness but there is one waiter who has always made a good impression on me
I love this Farmer's Market the vendors are nice the produce is fresh they have a variety of things fruits salts vegetables meat seafood cheese tea bread pita's desserts popsicles food trucks a farm face painters
The atmosphere of the place and the friendly wait staff made up for some of this place's shortcomings and they even comped the appetizer for sitting us in a noisy area with the convention goers
Gave our order to the friendly clerk and waited and waited and waited and waited for our order
The patio was really comfortable and the service was spectacular to bad the food was mediocre
Our server a thin girl with little make up and long dark hair was waiting on us personally thought you should put a little more effort into looking professonal for your job I dont think she smiled once and when she brought our order she lightly threw our plates down and as she walked away said you're good right
Don't get me wrong I enjoy a good dessert coffee once in awhile
The service Awkward but very friendly
If you want real good Chinese foods and restaurant services go somewhere else
We had a great time and the staff was super friendly
Although I have to point out that both times our service was not bad in any way but rather more on the slow side
Scott the manager is super nice and he is ALWAYS there
The service has always been great - my beer never gets empty before another is brought - a really important consideration if you are eating the habanero sauce
On the positive side they are friendly the service is good the place is clean and it's also relatively nice for a strip mall Chinese restaurant
I always look to Yelp and do my due diligence when selecting service providers such as movers and these guys were great
I wish they were as polite with the residents as they are when you come to sign up for the apartment; it is ridiculous that they assume the right to be rude to residents who pay for their services
The staff were very friendly and knowledgeable
The only minor picky foody issue was the Nectarine Crustada for dessert was luke warm at best would have liked a nice hot dish to melt that delicious ice cream
There's not much of a waiting space but the Lolo's staff is friendly and helpful they'll get your butt in a seat as quickly as they can
Service is friendly and efficient without be hurried or quick
The staff is also incredibly friendly and helpful and the clothing & accessory store in the adjacent space is fun to browse around in while you're waiting for a
a huge menu of possibilities all unusual and yummy sounding good service and home-baked goodness down to the English muffin
My wife's mushroom and cheese risotto was great I wish I had ordered it
The pizza my son ordered looked real good and he enjoyed it but about 15% of it was burned from the wood fire
The service was great the people who run the place are very nice
This place has friendly service a sunny interior with a relaxed atmosphere and comfortable if slightly cramped booths and tables
I ordered their egg sandwich sounds weird but it was sooo good
Waitress was super sweet and very attentive
It doesn't seem like the cleanest Quiznos and the staff moves really slowly at times
The gentleman staffing the bar seemed a bit gruff but a good caffeine fix will help me forgive even the orneriest grump
The service is good; it's definitely a trendy hipster vibe but the servers are not pretentious or annoying
Good thing we only purchased our prescription food for our cats there because I can't fathom taking my cats or dogs to a place like this for medical reasons where customer service is at the bottom of their list
Their customer service is excellent the doctors care about their business and don't brush their clients off to other locations because building relationships great customer service and medical care is what they are all about
Like others have said the service kinda sucks the waitress was kinda rude when we got in because a big crowd had entered right behind us but she did get nicer throughout the meal
Other important info service is friendly and a bit scattered portions are generous chef was nice and sometimes funny but most of his jokes and moves were canned VERY SIMILAR TO BENIHANA'S if you've ever been and ample parking
I would like to say service is slow but it might only seem that way since I always have to battle my way up to the bar see closet comment ^^^
Good service will make or break it for me and these folks are on top of their game
We ordered the sandwich dipped so the good news is that it made the bread edible
We both had the coffee which for restaurant coffee was good and the service was good as well
Two & a half stars for VU Bistro because the view isn't really that great service is really slow portions are too small and the menu is overpriced
The service was super slow when my boyfriend & I went on a Saturday afternoon even though there weren't many people there - it took forever for someone to take our order and then the food took a really really long time to come out
I can't tell you how disappointing it is to finally zero in on what taste we are craving on a holiday load up the car to first eat mediocre Chinese food at a fast little place so we have money left over for the BIG DESSERT IDEA drive to Elephant Bar park the car and get to the hostess station to order our mud pie
The atmosphere is nice and the service was average can't say enough about how average this place is so I am not sure what the big deal is about this place but if I would rather go to Hooters to have lousy food with a better view
SERVICE Great staffSKINNY Rula Bula is a double threat
great food and service and all for a great price
I will say the staff is excellent and very nice
Order taker was friendly and got my order totally correct
At the window the staff was friendly took my dinero gave me the right change
For dessert both the good old cannoli and the apple serenata with vanilla bean gelato are very good ways to end a great meal
Service is always fast and friendly and the place just seems very inviting
However the service made our experience great
The service is for the most part pretty good
We had great service as expected from our server she was very attentive
I actually had to waive different waitress down to refill our glasses after they were empty for a good 15 minutes
I love Pita Jungle but this isn't the first time I've had bad service at this location but it will be the last
There were also quite a few good desserts on hand including good soft-serve ice cream
The place looks great inside and the service was excellent with the only hiccup being a long wait for our first cocktail
Good place great drink selection small food menu reason for 4 stars wonderful service
The staff was great and attentive and I will definitely go back
Mike helped us this evening and I must say not much personality but great service
Maybe if the place looked nicer and the staff dressed nicer I wouldn't mind paying so much
I felt kind of bad for drawing attention because the owner lady became very controlling with the staff and I was a bit uncomfortable for them
Sometimes the service is lacking and sometimes like this time it is great
Overall our waitress was really nice the DJ spun upstairs which added to the fun and the food was good spicy
UPDATE Went back a second time and while the food was again very good the staff was not as nice
If you're a newbie to Texas Grill - it's good to know that probably 90% of the clientele are regulars and are likely close personal friends to the staff of many years
One great value is to order the chop steak as a burger it's not on the menu and you'll have one of the best burgers in town
The staff is as friendly as any other Mexican spot
There's a couple TV's playing Mexican music video's to get your mind off of waiting for your order which is surprisingly fast
I dug the old-school ambiance with the wood paneled bar we received very good service and the selection of beer was amazing - truly something for everyone
I am not sure the bartender's name but he has long hair and is very friendly and definitely a Great Waiter/Bartender you just don't find many these days
The food is always good no matter what Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to but I just wanted to comment on the bar staff and their extraordinary friendly and knowledgeable service they offer
The gentleman who took my order was very friendly and offered suggestions on what to order
I was greeted smile-lessly by the same rude front desk staff for reference - the heavier woman with the short dark red hair who promptly began to patronizingly lecture me on the utility of a urine culture as though my name tag and title weren't in plain view
Disrespectful dismissive and rude staff like this have no place representing a veterinary office
Bad service will kill this place eventually
For sides we ordered the Flemings potatoes which were really good and the baked potato which was fine but honestly how hard is it to mess up baked potato
My boyfriend ordered the Fried Tilapia and cous-cous which was finger lickin good
I loved everything and the service was great
Although I was braced for serious rudeness the service was polite and one of the waiters was willing to take a moment to explain the menu which I appreciated
The staff is also very friendly and welcoming
The good- Great toast/bread- Cute atmosphere- Friendly peopleThe bad- Slow service I had to ask for coffee refills- Have to wait outside with no misters 20+ minutes- Very bland hash browns - Very hot inside we were sat next to the door but still when it was closed it was hot
Most of the us there were 10 were very happy with the food and the service was very good
Their good customer service will see to that
The waiter was nice enough to have our meals split and everything for us
Great staff great food and high on our list of places to eat
But our waiter finally came by and was more than attentive from that point forward
Overall I say A-OK and maybe that's a little unfair the service was great my burger was outstanding and the family got the show they wanted
All the staff seemed pretty easy going and TEXAZ friendly
However I don't care for ambiance and classy settings I care about decent food and friendly service
it was nice but next time I think I will order a roll as I sampled some of the New Zealand roll and it was delicious
lol There were a few nice wines to choose from on the menu and our waitress was very good
The service may not always be as good as it could be slow sulrly even at times but the excellent food and reasonable prices make it forgiveable
Service was attentive and sitting outside on the patio on a warm fall evening made for nice ambiance
Two of us with wine and one dessert was $75 so a good value as well
The service is quick and friendly the place is clean and the salsa is good I prefer the green over the red or both
The service was attentive and drink refills were plentiful
All in all pretty awesome new library with a nice staff and it's in a good location
The staff is super friendly and remembers me ever time I stop in about once or twice a week or so
to set the tone for our visit we met our friends in the bar and be gain ordering apps flat bread w/chicken cheese and some other goodies sweet potato fries
As for which pizza to order there is only one that is truly good
Great service great food but definitely over priced- over $10 appetizers and over $10 desserts- it's prohibitive to eat anything other than the entrees but wanted to try everything anyways
My server was excellent he was the only waiter serving 10 tables and he was super nice attentive right on time with everything and pretty amazing-  I don't know how he dd it
Although it took a couple attempts 3rd call p when I got someone on the phone the service was super friendly
When I went to grab my lunch the place was packed and crazy so I had to wait  few for my order but the service was again super friendly and totally on top of things
The manager at the desk put us into Mountain 312 a corner room which was great for us as we weren't looking at a parking lot like a lot of the other rooms and the floor didn't wrap around our room Our view was a small green hill
After we ordered and payed we were given a # to bring to the table - I do like the fast casual concept
Presentation was beautiful service was friendly and best of all our salads were delicious
We went there around 800pm when it's slow so our service was stellar
I had everyone from bellmen to wait staff to security to the cleaning crew who were willing to go above and beyond to help me out and they all did it with a friendly smile
Overall very good service with the exception of the slip in of the Pepsi for the water the first day
The hotel staff was also very attentive and responsive
Or is supposed to be a place where the food and service is so great that I can't wait to return
The lady maybe the owner was very friendly and was very welcoming and even gave us little plates to sample whatever we wanted to sample before we ordered - that was really helpful
I would return becuase the service was great - friendly not stingey with portions generous educational genuine; and the chicken was stellar
The service was attentive the ambiance was awesome both indoors and outdoors
The salad arrived pretty fast since our server placed the order in BEFORE asking us which pizza we wanted
For an entree I ordered the burger and it was very good
My first visit I chatted a bit with my server on some of the condiments and what goes with what Now everytime I walk through the door I am greeted with warm smiles and great service
The staff is very friendly not entirely as knowledgeable as I would like but they will look things up and find out information for you
The food was very good It was a month or so back so I forgot what I ordered but it was on the customers favorites section  It's no longer there
Good service a nice menu obviously they change the menu up which is also a plus
They serve up pizzas gourmet salads gourmet sandwiches breakfast sandwiches freshly squeezed juices and all sorts of other things all made to order
The staff is always super friendly and you can definitely come here with a group and have a great time
The atmosphere was subdued urbane comfortable and the staff was attentive accommodating and knowledgeable
The remarkable note here is that the staff is VERY friendly and HELPFUL
In the past five mos or so I have noticed that some of the TB locations have not been as customer service oriented nor as friendly
I expect fast food orders that have food which is generally paired with condiments to have condiments provided automatically
The staff is super-friendly and the atmosphere is great
Overall a very good dish that I recommend and would order again
In conclusion the food was good service nice but I won't stray from the menu and I'll go in knowing that the waiter will probably try to up-sell me
We sit at the bar since it's pretty slow and that way would be able to order right away with the bartender
Now some restaurants have such great customer service that they actually box it up for you other offer you different sizes and check to see if you need containers for condiments as well
But at least now we know that if we want to have good service next time we just need to make sure that there are absolutely no men in the restaurant to distract the server
Though the service was slow at the beginning the place was crowded and had to wait 15 minutes
Ordered the carna asada steak and my friend ordered the shredded beef chimi both were really good
For the main course my friend ordered the tuna and I had the crab enchillada and both were great
Great if your on a date & want to order desert & coffee to hang out though
I like the old school ambiance of this place what I didn't like was the waitress telling me the lunch salad was a good portion I'm sitting here starving as I write this review
It's a hopping place on a Saturday night keep in mind it's 109 at 800 so the patio is sparsely populated so we wait about 30 minutes TIP  ask to order your food while you wait the food will hit you a lot faster
Calamari and fried zucchini were both oily and needing of a good squeeze of lemon and marinara for dipping in order to make them a little more palatable
The waitstaff is pretty nice and attentive
For the next intermezzo all I can call it is a tease - a bit of dining refinement between novelty desserts that absolutely wowed - a two-bite Peanut Butter Souffle with Raspberry Jam every bit as soufflu00e9 as the sloppy joe was its namesake and along with the foie gras beignet perhaps my favorite bites of a great meal
Also if you live in South Phoenix like I do and have relatives in town this is by far the nicest place in the area that you can suggest and has a calmer more adult-oriented feel than the Arizona Grand Resort which is on the border of South Phoenix and Tempe
The service is friendly the food items priced par for the course for Korean food moderate not inexpensive and the food quality is good
The staff here is always really friendly
The staff is friendly and helpful without being too pushy
She didn't seem to really know anything about the menu either - she went around the table and her description of each of our orders was that they were very good or really popular
If you happen to be fortunate enough to catch them during a slow time it is a very pleasant dining experience with great service
For a good quick meal with friendly service head over to Brooklyn's Best
Seriously the rude waitress thing was something new too
The manager John is a good fit for this space

The food is fresh service is fast and friendly and the restaurant is extremely clean
there's all kinds of funky flavors and add-on's that a slow southerner like me has to process before ordering
That was it; lousy customer service in response to a complaint of bad food because the kitchen used ingredients that should have been thrown out
At a place like this you can actually order your burger cooked like a steak since they're so good and the flavor is enhanced even more
Service was friendly enough but we had some trouble communicating what we wanted
Since we don't know the area very well the stars are good service being open at odd hours I think we got there at 4pm
I'm pretty happy with this place overall; drinks are good service is friendly atmosphere is enjoyable and I delight in the immediate neighborhood where I inevitably have to park
My service was fast & very friendly even though it was the lunch rush & both my Pastrami & Chicken Club Salad were delicious
The bar manager who is a 5-star all around GREAT guy himself actually called out for his chef to start some chips and salsa
A samurai trained in the bushido tradition standing by the door in order to slice up unruly guests would also be a nice touch but I'll give them a pass on that one
The staff is always friendly and professional
The food is amazing the service is great and the atmosphere is clean and inviting
It isn't that the food that I ordered was not good but it wasn't very creative
After a 30 minute wait to be seated service was good
I have to mention to all the sprint haters out there Sprint has changed from bad service to good customer service and satisfaction
Donna is the service manager that I deal with the most and she is fast friendly and very comfortable laying out exactly what services are required at what prices and what specials effect those prices
It has been nice that the sales staff that I've ran into while waiting on longer services have been laid back
The atmosphere is great and the service was fantastic
- Cocktails huge menu list of fun mixology and tropical items - Bread big hat-shaped hunk of soft and warm yeasty goodness - Desserts the tray always looks enticing especially the pina colada cake but I usually don't have room
The service was fast and the waitress was really professional courteous and smiley
We also ordered the lechon asado which was actually pretty good
I understand that mistakes happen we are pretty sure she forgot to put the pizza order in but to completely disregard the mistake and not apologize is rude and bad business
And throughout the night the staff was great
The service as always is good but the food leaves much to be desired
From the captain to the busser the service was great
My coffee was kept full until the cab was announced and we got home safely in a nice Escalade for a couple of dollars more than one of the discount cab services

I didn't try the food but someone in my group ordered wings about 15 minutes before the kitchen closed and they were very friendly about that
Everything smelled so flavorful and the naan was huge good thing we only got one order
The major plus was that when you ordered and received your food which by the way was friendly service with a smile and not a lengthy wait it actually tasted as good as it smelled
No wait quick/good/friendly service good food and lots of good beer
I usually get good service from Dicks but not that day I needed up spending over $500 on shoes and clubs that had to be custom fitted
What is most frustrating is I also went on their website to rate the service as they asked me to and I mentioned the customer service wasn't very attentive to me and was never contacted by a District Manager or Rep seems like they didn't care
Service was good was seated right away took my drink order came out
The service is still very attentive and the place is cool to see but the food is at best average
The cuts of meat were marginal not bad but nothing special at all and were cooked inconsistently and not always to order
Being there for the reason I was made these variances a positive to me but on other occasions they could just as easily have been a negativeRandom notes  The service was great in a very straightforward way
The service is wonderful everyone that works there is so friendly and always have a smile on their face
I again had the Light Chicken Fried Steak Breakfast it is funny that they call it light because the only light part is that it comes with one egg and a half order of the hashbrowns but it makes you feel good when ordering
Although the staff was very nice I was rushed through both my pedicure and manicure despite there being no wait but it was a full house
We've always had great service and the waitstaff are FUNNY
The staff is extremely friendly- they know when to check in and when to just let your group hang out and enjoy the Windsor

The staff is friendly and accommodating
As I have said in previous reviews I don't give fast food places great ratings because the food isn't great quality and the service is poor as there is no waiter service
happily the service was consistently great throughout the entire night
it got two stars because the service was attentive and staff was friendly plus the 3 mojitos I drank were the best out of everything there
The food is fantastic good service good atmosphere it's perfect
We received great service though so I can't fault them there
The service also gets really slow on the weekends
I don't think i've ever really had good service there

I was really wanting to pig out on some sushi rolls but after seeing those we just ordered teriyaki chicken which I have to say was good
Drinks were stiff and delicous and waitress was good and friendly
Really attentive service from both bar and lane area staff
Beer selection isn't the best but cocktails and lightning fast service at lanes on a busy Friday totally make up for that
I ordered a breakfast sandwich and that brught with it a side of home fries
Super young wait staff that look good but are slow and sometimes rude
In sum the food is pretty good and the atmosphere makes this place an appealing restaurant to return to however the sub-standard service hit-or-miss drinks/chips can taint an otherwise good experience
My waitress was kinda slow when I went but it was okay- I wasn't in a rush
I have overall had  good customer service
Service was decent and the wait staff was very attentive

The service there is really not that good as far as getting you seated goes
The staff was nice and they had a cool arcade area
Everything was wonderful -- from the friendly doormen to the breezy check in to the fantastic restaurant staff up at Lustre Bar down to the attentiveness of the hotel manager Jim
As we were leaving we got a chance to play around with the hotel manager's dog Bosco  We had a brief chat with the manager too and you can tell that they are genuinely interested in finding out how your stay went and cared that you had a great time
I love their protein pancakes and their staff is very friendly
It is clean the staff is friendly always the same guys there
The staff is fun friendly and will to accommodate
I cant remember the names of the rolls we had you can thank that Traditional Manhattan I ordered but I thought they were good not THE best but def not THE worst

I will say that the ordering process is great very easy and fast took just a few minutes then hit send

Also for as large of a property they are the room service is great

Service is fast and efficient though leaning on the perfunctory side
Service at this location is good and there always seem to be employees around if you need assistance

SRCH is pretty decent  grub and better than average drinks and service I mean these people are always smiling and friendly and
The staff doesn't look too thrilled to be there and have never been overly friendly
Atmosphere was really nice and the service was great - until the end when they forgot to bring my friend her coffee
We've been to Palatte twice for breakfast/brunch on our stay in Phoenix and while I give Palatte major props for superbly quirky/tasteful decor and friendly service their breakfast food is only 80% good
Bottom line look like you have tons o' money read older and rude demanding personality and you'll get service regardless of whether you have intentions of actually buying anything
but even then the service is rude and slow
I gave the place several chances but each time the service was slow and ignorant

PositivesService was goodMashed potatoes and jalapeno corn were very goodTostadas were fresh tastingPortions were large - prices are okayNot so positives not really bad enough to be negativesThe side room not the main dining room was extremely noisyThe chili rellenos sounded great but the seafood taste was lost beans and the crust was a little heavy
the food was good the service was good the atmosphere on a warm spring afternoon was delightful and it was splendid little spot to let the dishes and the glasses pile up
Staff is friendly and helpful without being obsequious
The atmosphere/decor is spot on as well and the staff was very attentive
The majority of the staff knew me and were always very friendly
The man I believe to be a manager though I'm not sure I see him frequently and he's a great guy approached the couple as well and asked them to quiet down and apologized to us which I really appreciate however these people couldn't even form coherent sentences
Yes it has a great patio good service most of the time and some very attractive staff
Because it's soooo busy during happy hour service can be a little slow but it's not because they're not trying
The decor was pretty and the service was great--the server checked back several times to see if we were doing okay or needed anything
Huge portions salsa bar cheap and the staff is friendly
My big gripe about this place is the unfriendly staff

The sushi was served in a very nice order 2 or 3 items to a plate

The service was great and the food was very delicious
The dessert is pretty standard not bad just not spectacular

The staff was friendly and not intrusive
The waitress did a good job of replenishing my soda
The chips and salsa are likewise fantastic and the service is fast and friendly--especially if you're a regular

As a result the service was great because we got the undivided attention of our server Gabe

Really the service isn't much to complain about as the food is so good I can kind of overlook the service

From the Hostess to the Manager to the Server everyone was great
Thirdly they have this weird ass schematic to order from like we had to have the nice gal at the counter explain the combos/options/sides over and over

I ordered a simple peperoni pizza and sat at the counter where the cooks chatted with me off and on and were very friendly

Order a stack here and you'll have enough breakfast for two to three days afterwards--getting your money's worth is always a good thing

customer service- att customer service hasn't been bad but tmobile has that little pep in the step
Even though we were a bit disappointed with the food kudos to this place for the service dog-friendly setting and great coffee
The queso dip is very good but you need a minimum of 2-3 people to justify ordering that much queso
Great food when they get the order right

My service is always amazing and cannot help but ask for the same server every sunday I cannot believe I have forgotten his name but he is great
Our waitress was funny and very attentive
The staff is friendly but most don't speak English so you have difficulty asking questions or ordering things that are not on the cart where you can just point to what you want
A friendly waitress in traditional Japanese attire seated us immediately; $5 sake bombs were in front of us within 2 minutes and complimentary miso soup; sushi was presented to us within 5 minutes of taking our order
This was probably the FASTEST service I have ever had
The service was OK I like when I ask a server what she likes or what is popular but she gave me the same boring cliche that everything was good and nothing was ordered more than anything else yeah right
Anyway my wife and I ordered the the artichoke dip which was so good we licked the bowl
I also got a half order of the many sliders they have to choose from prime rib for me and they were great dipped in the au-jus
Thanks for a great atmosphere with a solid staff all around

I like a waiter who is confident in manner and trusts that in either instance I will have a great meal so he's not afraid to give a direct answer

If your looking for quality breakfast great customer service at a good price this is the place to go
But the manager was so friendly and helpful and descriptive of what I would find when I tried the special that I couldn't resist
The staff is friendly in their own way I think they're pretty decent when it comes to being honest about what clothes they will and will not take
I didn't say anything about it after they fixed the curdled drink I felt bad for the waitress
For food we ordered the portobello mushroom burger nice and fresh the   spring rolls again fresh and tasty ahi cups looked impressive & a good sized portion arrived but I didn't try any because raw fish makes me sad lastly the sweet potato tots make me want to nom nom nom all night long
Service was busy on Monday nights there is a special so the place was understandably busy but our waitress was super friendly and what bumped this place to five stars was the manager
He was helpful accommodating all around a great guy and what a manager should be
In fact all the male servers have always provided great service-unfortunately not so much with the female servers i've had

The Good the service the ambiance the drink menu great looking people the bathrooms the bread the desserts are yummo
On a lark we both ordered their chicken enchiladas - goodness even most gringo places can't hurt that - but they did
I will admit the service was great but that can't make up for $170 sub par meal
We get fast pleasant service and generally perfectly prepared breakfast food
Good service inviting atmosphere super clean appearance and most of all freshly prepared food that is attractive and delicious
I did not even have to ask the friendly order taker to make the bacon crisp or the salmon to be slightly charred
The wait staff have always been helpful and friendly even before they recognized us as regulars
Service was great  Nothing I'd go out of my way for but if peeps were going and I was in the area I'd go back

Let me first begin by saying the staff was extremely attentive and tried very very hard to make us all happy

No hard feelings really - staff was pleasant valet was efficient food was just not great amigo
The location and atmosphere were promising as was the open kitchen and friendly staff

The portions are large for the price and the staff is nice and friendly
I have no problem going to a nice place and paying 8-10 bucks for a cocktail but please don't make me order another round every 5 minutes
Our waitress was friendly and on top of things
That being said The bed and pillows were comfy there was very little noise/lots of proivacy and the housekeeping staff was really great when thinsg were brought to their attention
so obviously i over-ordered which i guess was a good thing because i got a solid sampling of food
The girls behind the counter were very friendly and our order came out quickly
I ended up calling Papa John's to order a pizza the team member was friendly and polite and my pizza arrived in 30 minutes and fully cooked and fresh
It was quite busy for a Saturday at 3pm and a service was slow
Foods wonderful and great concept but they could hire a few more people to keep up with the service
But to make nice we were given a coupon to redeem at the Service Center for a book of coupons that FAR exceeded the $10 charge to park
It had cool art cool bar the staff was super friendly it was an all around awesome experience
The service is good and the servers friendly
Overall the food was really good and the service was good as well

The staff including the owner were very attentive to the whole table but I have to say they made my granddaughter feel like a million bucks
Service was attentive and cold drinks were brought out right away
The staff is super nice they even bring you the drink to your table and it feels more like a family run friendly place than an assembly line setup of the typical starbucks and what I really like too is their super fast and free internet
The location is great the interior is adorable & the staff extremely friendly
I want to write a great review but I don't wanna use the words superb or excellent when describing the food and I don't wanna say the service was friendly since all of these are overdone
One of the best meals I've had in a long time as far as value for the meal overall presentation of the meal and restaurant and just an overall well trained and attentive staff

Someday I will write a review that is all twitter handles and #HashtagsAnyway we had a great dinner here service was very good and I enjoyed my food
Ordered my magazine through them the first time and I got my proof fast
We are 14 days into the order and I have deadlines and customers who prepayed for their mags so I can't drop this order and find a new printer and set myself back that much time I say just send the proof we'll be all good
I can't say the service was bad but it seemed a bit awkward; which was a contrast from the initial attention we received before being sat
All in all the food was great the beer was great and the service was OK
Bottom line - what a deal for such a great room and good service
Staff overly friendly at times; self involved at others
The food was sophisticated the service was good and the price was so reasonable
Good luck coordinating a take out order with the normal busyness of the operation

I ordered a nice IPA on tap and my wife ordered a glass of wine
I still make the drive once a week over here to pick up and few things because their customer service is so good and they have AMAZING deals on beer
Plus the waitstaff is always incredibly friendly
I'm sure the wait on a manager would have been just as bad as the service
It paired quite nicely with my hot smoked turkey sandwich with havarti tomato and mayo-mustard spread on a delectable cranberry walnut bread that my dear order-takerer enthusiastically recommended
The service was horrible the two girls working were rude and unfriendly
The staff is super friendly and they always make sure we have plenty of extra sauces and fortune cookies
Maybe it's because my family are regulars but the staff at Pei Wei couldn't be nicer

The bartenders and staff are also very welcoming and nice
Clean cool well stocked friendly and polite staff
The staff are friendly fun and helpful the beer is good and the food is delicious
I've always had good service and they at least pretend to remember me which I appreciate
The service was super friendly and everybody was treated like old friends
The location is good my sushi was good and reasonably priced and the decor is pretty cool so I am going to give them three stars but the service was so terribly slow I feel like being served by a sloth would have been more efficient
Let me start off by saying i love breakfast so my reviews for breakfast spots are going to be the toughest because places really need to blow me away in order for me to rant and rave about them
My girlfriend isn't a big breakfast person so she ordered the cheeseburger and fries
We had very good service- from the hostess to the waitress
The waiter was very friendly and made great recommendations
Made to order cobbler for desert  served a la mode and mud pie  which is mode all on its own - a big frosty slab of coffee pie with whipped cream and chocolate sauce are good bets
Most times we've had great service but it's never personal meaning the staff doesn't really chat or form a bond I like to bond with people bringing me food - it's an Italian thing
We found the service very attentive and nice
Of course what turned started out as a stop for a couple loaves of bread turned into cookies dessert and some great German sausages
-Very reasonably priced items-Great helpful energentic & informative staff
My very first visit on their {soft} opening day- I had a severe cold and the nice young lady / staff made me an herbal tea called Vitali-Tea
Our waiter Gary was fabulous and provided great recommendations on the menu
Many many others must agree or they wouldn't be so packed most of the time great neighborhood place too that's why you see them do so many take out orders
The food came fast in larger than average portions and service was attentive
Their service was very good their drinks were good  and the pizza took like 10 minutes to come out
Arrived at Chompies early in the morning wait staff was nice and friendly

This is a fast paced place and process orders pretty quick so move along okay
If I want a better-than-fast-food burger that I can see being made and get it made-to-order I think this will be my place
Great atmosphere great service and high-quality Italian food are enough for me any day
The selection service and prices at Total Wine are great and I'm glad I don't have to drive too far for good hooch
We ordered the crostini with hummus eh black olive tapenade eh and tomato something this was actually really good to start off and bottled water
Each staff member we came into contact with was smiling friendly polite and helpful from the bell staff to the front desk and room service
The wait staff was less than friendly and can not customize an order worth beans - no pun
Almost 60 bucks for mediocre food small drinks rude service and an overall lackluster experience
During peak hours the service can wax a little slow but one isn't supposed to rush Japanese dinners
I'm not exactly sure why as our group pays the bill for the room orders food and drinks and pays the added gratuity - shouldn't they be at least a little nicer about the business
I did not order the desserts although they all look great and are huge
Service is fast because you don't have to wait for a server to bring you menus and take your order you go right up to the counter and order off the menu they have displayed then they bring your food to your table once it's done
A definite plus is that they do have a bar as well so if you want to order a Screwdriver with your breakfast more power to you
The restaurant on the property is good I tried room service dine-in and having few drinks at the bar
This resort definitely exceeded my expectations - the staff is AMAZING friendly accommodating etc the food was delicious the resort is beautiful and the rooms were also clean and well-maintained
Yet even I admired how our strategically inattentive waitress 'forgot' to ever swing by and inquire how little I was enjoying this star crossed or was it Starkist
I am impressed with the friendly service it's a notch above what I'm used to receiving in pho shops
The service was very good and so were the prices but the food wasn't very good at all
Service here is always attentive and friendly and it seems they are all well trained and know the menu which is a plus when asking questions
]- Starter platter Gratis Brie olive tapenade and some crostini celery and radish - a light start and a substantial improvement over the standard bread offering which is also optionally served at entree time upon request- Crab Cakes ~$15 Great crabmeat to breading ratio but not superlative as advertised- Sweet Chili Calamari ~$12 Expertly lightly fried breaded and sweetened- Petite Filet ~$30 Dry which is unfortunate in the most tender of steaks- Bone-in Ribeye ~$30 Very juicy and flavorful significantly superior to the former- Beef Flemington ~$28 Filet Mignon in a light pastry shell and a Madiera sauce juicy unlike the vanilla offering - a solid A- Dessert Sampler $13  - Creme Brulee Divine vanilla goodness I'd order it again and I'm not a general fan  - Cheesecake Thoroughly unremarkable  - Chocolate Lava Cake Overly sugary molten chocolate in a thin souffle-ish cake shell  - Peach Cobbler a La Mode Proving the exception of the less filler trend heavy on the cobbler but light on the fruitOutside of parental benevolence an expense account or a serious apology to a significant other from the heartland I wouldn't be looking for a dining experience like this but I'd come back if the time was right
Service is really good at this restaurant but be careful when you order sides
The service is always great the food is priced well and very consistent
Nothing fancy just a great selection of bikes and accessories and WORLD CLASS service
The place is cozy and the staff is super friendly
Groovy concept flawless service nice variety really cool drinks
It wasn't as spicy as I would have liked it they season to order but we were told they are prepared to medium unless otherwise stated but had a great consistency and was so delicious mixed with rice
They've always got something cool and new to check out the prices are reasonable and the staff is great
This store has great customer service and the staff is very knowledgeable about the products they sell
75 and we ordered a crispy calamari app that was pretty good
Its a fast casual type resturant where you walk in place your order at the counter and they walk the food out to you
The interior passed my expectations  I was comfortable enough I found my own entertainment  magazines books and my phone food wasn't a problem because both my flights were under four hours and the leg room problem was solved by a few visits to the washroom to stretch out my legsI am giving US Airways 4 stars because they got me home safely the staff was friendly pilots were excellent and communicated with the flyers frequently which calmed my anxiety both my flights were on time I was happy I didn't have to pay 1500 for an American Airline ticket and spent 400 instead and had an overall satisfactory experience
I walked in and told the lady that me and another family that were on their way were looking for a place to eat and wanted to know why i should eat here just giving her a hard time i asked if the service was good the place was clean and if the food was good and what mexico city cuisine meant
The food was great but I had to drop the rating by one star because the service was just not up to par
Server was friendly but I should have known to ask the price on the halibut before ordering it
The service is always good the ambience is sophisticated
The location on West McDowell has the best most attentive staff I have had so far in the valley & one in Cali
Service was super friendly even though they were packed in there
When I called the manager seemed nonchalant about the whole thing never once apologized for what happened and then said I shouldn't worry about it because they didn't actually charge my card and it would probably drop off on its own faster than he could contact his merchant services about it the following day
the staff was beyond friendly from the valet to the bell boys
This is a great bbq place and the service is always fantastic -- thanks Famous Jim
Cost was somewhat high I thought $15 when ordering yet it was really good and what I wanted so I was ok with the price
Chakra staff was very helpful and friendly
Overall a good people watching experience very loud and crowded with terrible service adequate beer and generic yet palatable cuisine
The service was great and there's plenty of space but there's really no reason to eat here and in my opinion there are better places to get beer
Service Started out great but  the drinks stayed dry for most of the meal
Our waiter was awesome very fun and friendly and being that it was the GRAND OPENING night he tended to our table party of 13 very well
Maybe it's just me 'cause the waitress raved about this drink but frankly it wasn't good
To the restaurant's credit though the waitress was pleasant about it and substituted my drink for a strawberry daiquiri which was pretty good - sugar rim no whipped cream or strawberry garnish though
They did a good job of cooking the meat to order particularly our prime rib orders but the seasoning is a little blah it leaves a weird aftertaste that I can't quite put my finger on
The same guys run the place but they've ramped up their friendly service to an even higher plateau
One of the owners was greeting every group of customers as they came in and the staff was doing a great job finding tables etc for the huge lunch crowd that was coming in
The waitress was friendly Lauren I believe and her recommendations were helpful
The waitress came back around and we asked if we could get our drinks very stressed and rude she said we had to wait and she had to take care of the people in the cabanas first before getting to us
And the staff four to five were again somewhat rude that we were wanting to order drinks and we were sober
It was nice being on the other side being a client and having someone else provide a service which is usually what I do
The food is always great and so is the service
The chicken salad sandwich with grapes in the chicken salad and the egg salad sandwich on fresh sourdough are probably my favorites - actually I order one of those two sandwiches every time I go there and like them so much they are the only sandwiches I ever order - except for breakfast - they have an awesome make your own breakfast sandwich english muffin crispy bacon egg provolone cheese
The service is always friendly but not overly bearing and the servers are usually always the same people at lunch and they are always on top of things and now whats up
The food comes out fast so it's great for a quick lunch spot while still getting sit down service
Anywayswe looked over the menu and I ordered the chorizo burrito breakfast and my husband ordered  steak and eggs
The staff friendly and the decor had clean lines and was pretty hip
The service was friendly and the price is not cheap but not to bad either
All of them friendly and have no problems with the service
Service was great cute little restaurant beer flights and wine flights but the pizza dough was just ok
The staff/owners are incredibly nice and will happily chat with you about the food if you ask them questions
That demonstrates great communication amongst their staff
Always a winner  Their staff is friendly but service is more on the slower side but that is nice too
The one knock this time was service - again like last time the servers were slow to respond to an empty salsa bowl and an empty water glass
Service from the waitstaff is great but I took a star away for the hostesses
Service was a little slow but it was Saturday around lunch time
The service was excellent with refills never taking too long and food coming out faster than expected both of which are huge pluses
The hummus was good but certainly not the best in the valley as our waiter purported
Our service was good if not a little overbearing otherwise I would give this place 2 stars
Also every staff member I have interacted with is extremely friendly & helpful
It's on the short drive from my house downtown to my parents' joint in North Central so my lazy ass pulls up once a week in a bathrobe or some shit and orders a few hot ones from the nice girl at the gas pump
Service was good food was good atmosphere was cool
I understand the liability around this however the staff was not friendly about it whatsoever
The atmosphere and service were nothing special but the food was good
The portions are enormous so you get really good value for whatever you order
I'd actually been here once before a while back and don't evenremember what I ordered - it was that good
In addition to the great ambiance and gorgeous views the food and service are sensational
Other than that service was good and friendly
Until I try their other dishes they'll get 4 stars because the memories made me happy the service was good and the food wasn't half bad
Why is it so hard for people to even TRY to offer good service
Ever since we moved to Phoenix from NYC this is something we've always noticed good customer service is just a rarity here
I noticed so many reviews on here where people say what great service they had and I've gotta wonder are your standards that low or did I just end up with a dud both times
We also ordered a plate of chow fun which was good
The service is always friendly the drinks are always refreshing and the bathrooms are always clean
It was a great first-time Cuban meal and also the manager and server was so friendly
I've been there a few times and some of the staff could be rude and snobby and one instance that irked me was when I talked to the server about adding burratta to my order he basically charged me for the whole plate burratta olives salamis etc and didn't add it on to the big appetizer plate like I thought he would
All I had to do was come here once and I was hooked  The staff is always really nice and attentive too and I mean every single one of them
Good selection of menu options and I ended-up ordering the Chicken Scallopini which was excellent
Plus I was there at 11am when they first opened and when I told the waitress I had 30mins to eat for lunch they got me in and out within that time and the food was good
The staff is always nice and friendly
But the service last night was not so good
Normally the service is really good but in this case it just wasen't
They have brands that I know really reasonable prices and the staff is genuinely friendly and helpful
I love Harkins and this one feels like an old family member as in it actually smells musty in here -- always -- but the staff are always friendly and the popcorn is fresh
On the plus side Windsor has great sides and appetizers good drink list excellent service and always a good crowd
I've always had attentive service and like the general Greek vibe I get when I eat here
I have always received good service from very helpful waiters and waitresses
I'm not a huge breakfast person and I currently live at least 20 miles from Harlow's but will still come here from time to time to enjoy a great breakfast and great service
The staff have always been good about ensuring the numbers on them match prior to releasing my child to me
I am a typical foodie so excuse the excitement as i text as i am preparing for my day of work and stop for my breakfast burrito along the way ; I once ordered rolled chicken tacos and it was extremely bland and just meh
It's incredibly clean and the service is always friendly
So I'll give them the extra star because it seems great service these days is harder to find than great food - not to mention at a great little neighborhood location
I stopped by at lunch time and had fast/friendly service from the host and the girls behind the bar
Both of the burgers we ordered beef medium rare were very good but the portion to price ratio is off

Overall the service was great food was excellent
Actually I have tried two Qdoba restaurants recently and the staff is friendly but the food is just OK and I don't see the value for what I get
Oddly years of bad service bad food and surprisingly boring bread haven't stopped people from giving this place a chance
Take away the bad service don't expect too much out of the food disregard any of the servers suggestions regarding wine and what do you have
Bring some friends order a bottle of wine of your own choosing not the server's suggestions and have a great time in one of Phoenix's few unique cafes
Came here for breakfast yesterday it had been years since I have stopped in here and do not remember the entire place having waiter service
It was so good that all I said to the lady taking my order was I want whatever comes with that bread
It's great for a mid-level hotel experience friendly service and suffices nicely for either the business or leisure traveler
Service was also not very good at all
The service was great they were friendly and helpful
It really isn't the friendliest place around - the guy taking orders wasn't really rude but didn't seem to go out of his way to be friendly
The service again was great and the food was tasty
I even got to order a to-go coffee and it was a nice cup of Joe- just what I needed after a chilly evening on the patio
The people are very friendly and asked a lot about what I wanted on my order instead of just going with what they felt was standard
This wouldn't be too bad if there was an organized way to do this but the place is so small you just kind of get stuck between the people ordering and the people paying
The service was friendly fast and accommodating
It was great the cashier I think he was the manager and gay to boot; must been attracted to the name told me that the meal deal was a better deal
+++'sDecent food bottled beer on ice friendly service good cooks fresh and filled condiment buffet fun to squirt your own ketchup and mustard from the buffet area free refills outdoor patio not too busy for weekday lunch time- - -'sChintzy du00e9cor no eye candy a tad overpriced for what you get yellow circus awnings drab atmosphere no wifiIn sum if you are in the mood for a hamburger a quick bite to eat and are in the vicinity of a Fuddruckers this place delivers
and as he ordered a second it must have been damn good
Service was good and a couple subtleties worth noting
the husband ordered the chile relleno and it was really good as well filled with meat and cheese
the service is super friendly and they CARE; our waitress was eager to explain the menu to us and when 2 pupusas were switched onto the wrong combo plates they were more than happy to remake the pupusas and deliver them to their rightful eaters
Hello I have very average food lackluster presentation servers with minimal to zero personality a boring menu slow service and I was probably a lot better 10 years ago but lost the will to live who am I
Oh our waitress filled my iced tea X3 which was good but never checked on us after we got our meal not so good
We eat here often and have yet to have a bad experience with food or service
All in all we had a great time and enjoyed the food drinks and service quite nicely
Great said the manager but why did you leave the register unattended
The food here has consistently been very good and the wait staff is very nice and cheerful
Rude management and office staff very slow response times from maintenance team if they came at all and ridiculous charges at move-out
The complete lack of help from the office staff leaky roof frequently shut-off water and bad termite problem made living here a total hassle
This particular location has great customer service the aisles are roomy and there always seems to be some sale or another going on
The server was absolutely charming gracious and accommodative referring to us by name refilling our water/wine glasses and supervising small touches like fetching the sommelier and informing the pastry chef that it was our anniversary [with that information they gave us a chocolate script 'Happy Anniversary' on our dessert plate - nice touch]
The place is busy as usual and service was a little slow although it looked like the staff was working their butts off
We moved to the bar where we find we get a little faster service
Had some nice cocktails and ordered a sandwich
Once we were able to figure out the seating situation our party grew by one our waitress was attentive
Service was good the staff was nice and accommodating
But the service is great and there are plenty of TV's where I saw the Cubs spank the Sox today

Our experience Hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful with any requests or recommendations
The food was delicious we got the vegetarian tamales and the service was great
We sat and had a drink at the bar while waiting and had great service throughout
The menus at table and written on boards are overwhelming so went with assorted nigiri Chef's Special recommended by our attentive waitress
Overall very good experience but do not order the green tea ice cream - tastes like soap
I've only ever had friendly hard working service each time there perhaps because we are unassuming non-demanding realistic people
nothing to rave aboutService was very good
Ordered the 5 course tasting menu  plus there are a lot of bite-size bonus dishes some of them are pretty good
although the service wasn't as good as i expected it to be - our waiter disappeared for long periods of time and didn't check on us very often - it wasn't bad enough to the point of knocking the place down a star
On a more positive note the views from the patio are phenomenal and the service is very good
Their entire staff from the people running the event to the managers to the cashier were all very fast friendly and helpful
I went to Spinatos for the first time and had a nice younger gentleman as a waiter

A lot of food very affordable prices and great service equals 4 stars
The owner was at the cash registered and from placing my order over the phone with a female employee to my encounter with the staff when I arrived and despite them being busy was great
Place was cleanit smelled good the people taking down orders were attentive and bubbly
If you are a burger fan and by that I mean someone who like a burger that tastes great without a ton of toppings you enjoy the beef order the Triple Prime burger you will love it
Overall I really enjoy the quiet good service

first the highlightsvery nice and attentive staff
The staff were all very friendly and down to earth
after another good 10 minutes our waiter finally came around for our orders
There were only 4 other tables seated so you would expect GREAT service
So when its slow waitresses seem to slack off
Food is pretty good too I love shoestring fries so when I want to splurge i'll order something with the fries or steal some from whoever is with me
Let me start with saying that the service was great 3pm on saturday pretty empty we were seated immediately and drinks were constantly refilled promptly

Good service waiter knowledgable of vegan items on their menu great food
Service- Every time we went there it was busy and we received very good service and our servers were knowledgeable about the beer

This could be a nice spot if they cleaned up the service problems and added a little oomph to the food
The staff is extremely friendly and recommended great stuff  3 of us got the chicken burro and loved it
The staff was friendly and knowledgeable about what she could and could not have on the menu
I've ordered breakfast on two occasions here and both times it came out cold plus the order was messed up
Wait staff and hostesses are nothing fabulous not overly friendly considering the price and the wait
The food service and atmosphere were more than great - I felt like I'd been invited to the most hospitable of all Arab homes where the hosts and the food left you speechless
Then I look at the menu and can't decide of course which to order because - in peering over to the next table - I can see that all of the food looks pretty good
I think I waited a total of maybe 20 minutes after I made my order which isn't all that bad
The service was OK my waitress was very nice
The service is great and both times I was greated warmly and they seem to appreciate that you are there

This small local Mexican restaurant has the nicest most efficient staff who are quick to refill your glass grab you another margarita and dish out those warm crispy house-made chips and salsa
The chips and salsa alone are addicting but their rice and beans that thankfully don't taste like they're from a can and their cheesy-but-festive decor friendly staff and very local feel keep people coming
The staff is extremely friendly and the food is incomparable
The service is professional the food always looks and tastes great and the ambience is mature dark and potentially romantic

Genghis Khan could never make it past the great wall of china unfortunately Arizona's border is not as secure

The other staff members are equally friendly and helpful and the food is always fantastic
Thanks BWW for always assuring a great experience with a super staff and excellent food
the overall staff and service quality is OK never really crowded but the staff is rather slow on a good day the prices are rather pricy but not too bad this location is just a few miles from my house so it's pretty convenient if i need to ship something
our service was good the first go round as we sat at the bar and learned a lot from the bartender about their tequilas
Microwaved enchiladas no rice rude cold unfriendly uninviting service
The location isnt as great but the food service and drinks blows this place outta the water
Overall the service was fairly slow and not necessarily the best I have ever had
It's pretty close to our house great happy hour and great service both times we've been there our servers were really cool
Also the staff was very friendly and ALWAYS looked great
Cut to the drive-thru where I order their version of a Blizzard switching up the fast food references that can even be chocolate-flavored
The Good * Good prices and friendly service* Great flavors - Had the ham and cheese panini and it was awesomeThe Not So Good* Little slow took a good fifteen minutes to get food* Not all that child friendly
I went in a few weeks ago with co-workers and it was busy at lunch so I figured it was a one time glitch - but the service was slow and half the orders were wrong
Bad service bad food and most of all bad manners is a trifecta that will lose my business every time
The decor was great restaurant was nice and clean and service was decent
I Thought it would be ghetto due to the name location and coupons for $3 breakfast but it was very clean and bright inside and the waitress was very nice and professional
The staff is usually pretty attentive and they definitely know how to talk to the mostly senior crowd
First the good Local Breeze Patio Cafu00e9 has a wonderful patio exceedingly friendly and prompt service and some absolutely amazing house-made breads
One of the things I really like about this location is that I don't feel intimidated to come here like I have at other gyms *coughs* Gold's Gym *coughs* The staff has always been friendly I don't feel like the other gym members are mocking me as I try to work out
The service is nothing to write home about but it wasn't bad
The staff was VERY nice especially the one guy Abraham

I would order this again but maybe because it was the only thing that sounded good to me on the menu
The staff was very friendly to everyone and I think that everyone else in there was a local
Kona coffee ice cream dessert and homemade brownie are nice desserts
It would've been nice to put our food order in prior to that so that the food could come out when our apps were gone
It would have been nice to have waters and sodas refilled without having to ask a manager-type person who was passing by after our glasses went empty for 10 minutes
On the upside service was great and still reasonably priced but this was a terrible disappointment and not at all the place I used to love
The service is good and food is even better
Staff us also friendly and helpful but for the life of me I can't get myself to spend south in a cup of coffee
I have on occasion order other foods and yeah it is all good
It is clean new and the staff is friendly
I feel bad about doing that in Harlow's because it is one of those places that the waitresses make more money via the turnover so I don't think extended lingering would be appreciated but Cartel can fulfill that part of your Sunday morning experience if a little Sunday paper downtime is part of your preferred weekend experience
They ordered the Greek Salad and it looked amazing-- they confirmed that it tasted just as good as it looked
a simple menu with the freshest ingredients good service and a cozy down home setting that makes you feel like you're eating in Grandma's kitchen
We ordered the Salami Scramble good and the Waffle great along with a side of bacon
The service is really fast compared to other locations because it's pretty much a ghosttown
I feel the service is always prompt and friendly
Our core orders areSausage Pizza hold onion add roasted red peppersGrilled Chicken Pasta AKA chicken AlfredoHollywood Cobb SaladDemi breakfast with the bacon pancake and a well done turkey maple sausageCapresse Sandwich grilled in oven best when tomatoes are from AgritopiaMinestrone SoupFar East SaladThe burgerNow there is a subculture at Liberty Market that is worth notingThe E-61 bar is a separate but conjoined experience and the Baristas are able to create outstanding beverages that are like nothing I have found in AZ
The only reason this place got 2 stars is because of the friendly service
The staff seems very friendly and accommodating
Ordered breakfast and special ordered my omelet the way I like them and without a problem it was done and served in a timely manner
Even though we had been looking at the menu a good 15 minutes and were ready to order
Ordered delivery and had a nice smiling and polite gent deliver within the hour
Unfortunately our waiter was embarrassingly terrible he was nice but he clearly did not care he was messing up our order and just about any table near us
Service ranges from acceptable to nice and friendly and with the tiny bear paws running the length of their kooky suspenders as part of their uniforms you hardly even notice most of them have freaky punky tattoos up and down their necksetc
We ordered the sweet potato fries which were good
I'm always impressed by great service from everyone
Service was great - my waiter was a young man that couldn't tell me what Hite beer taste like told him to take a sip and let me know   Shhhh
Prices were reasonable and the service was friendly
Our waitress and the manager  were like tequila sommeliers and knew about every one of their tequilas on the menu and provided great recommendations
The wait staff are usually attentive if you are lucky enough to get a couch
just stand in line place your order and wait for the good stuff to grace you with it's presence  I remember people comparing Lenny's to In n Out and Sonic
The staff was very friendly and attentive
The staff is friendly and helpful too
The idea and concept are great and are executed well but you want help with anything the staff would rather drink arsenic or so it seems
I thought my suggestion was really good and didn't want to be turned down by someone so I asked her if her manager had an e-mail or if I could talk to her manager
Being nice to the employees doesn't help and you can never get a hold of a manager
Had to give Sol 5 stars simply because of the super friendly and helpful staff
Food was good had the street taco fight which consists of 6 tacos and an order of guac
Normally I would knock down a star except for the great staff
Hostess and wait staff were super friendly I wasn't sure what the reservation was under but they made the situation light and directed me to where I needed to go
Staff isn't belligerent but neither are they friendly - mostly disinterested unless trying to sell you something
The service was friendly but not overly bearing
There order system is very similar to local places back east basically avoiding technology and that probably ties into part of the slower process of ordering and getting your food
Service was great - it was a slow Monday
The staff was friendly and the drinks were well priced I think $6 for most beers
Service is really friendly and the vibe in here is really relaxed and fun
The bar staff Alfredo Benny and Sarah did a great job of keeping us hydrated and the on site restaurant was great
The service was prompt though and the people working were friendly and seemed to be in a chipper mood -- that's hard to imagine when you've been on your feet since before 6 a
They were so NICE to us while we ordered and waited for our food and when they brought it to us we ended up in a great conversation about the love of food and how much they care about what they are doing in their restaurant
Thank you for providing good customer service
Incredibly loud music managed to drown out any real conversation and I am also assuming this is why the service wasn't that great - I don't think the waitress could hear us
Our service was also good and nothing to complain about
My water was always full and our waitress was attentive
Even on the phone I could tell how friendly the staff was
I ordered off menu their Szechwan cucumbers which were fresh crisp slightly salty with a great hot oil and many red chilies tucked into the dish
Breakfast & diner food is short order stuff and should move out of the kitchen quickly
The service however was just not good
Very good food coffee and service and delightful when the weather is nice and the front doors to the street are open
We order-in from Asian Grill at least once a month if not more but have never actually dined at the restaurant though the tables are often crowded so our reliance on this great Chandler/Sun Lakes fave for takeout shouldn't stop you from dining in
The food is pretty good but not up to the ambiance or service
My boyfriend and I were so happy with the service we received and how easy and great it was to work with Chris
5 beers 2 meals and dessert all came to $70 with a nice tip
Always sincere and friendly service from the bartenders waitstaff and hostesses
I don't have the highest expectations for any drive-thru but Starbucks always promotes their friendly service and my experiences at other Starbucks have always been pleasent; so I am shocked this Starbucks is still open
Also try their desserts they were created by the owners wife and are a great compliment to the end of a great meal
The staff as with all locations are always super helpful and friendly
Then again this might be a management problem too since one person cannot do everything in a full service restaurant and do a good job
The bad thing about that is you cut down on service too
Our server was friendly and prompt with the order
We ordered breakfast and I was totally bummed with the gravy for my biscuits
The service was as good as usual and we got good food at good prices
It was so bad I had to comment When you go to a Chinese place order Chinese dishes
Our waiter Ricky was very attentive and the manager stopped by our table twice
When we mentioned the manager to the server he said how great she is to work for
What I do have a problem with is their service is TOO GOOD
I know they assume this is good service but to me it's annoying
I love good service just as much as the next person does but it does not take 18 yes I counted visits to my table and 3 different waitresses to accomplish good service
My first visit I was impressed and thought wow what great service

The staff was super friendly especially the ones in the restaurant
Price is right service is great and it would take a long time before you became bored with the flavors
but anyways the staff is great and friendly the food is OK nothing special but the price is AMAZING if you are looking for good food for cheap this would be for you because for 5 adults and two children it only came up to $40 and that is really good
They don't take reservations anymore and they don't do takeout although I did order a pizza to go and with there always being a huge wait I think he's got a good business going where you eat and drink while waiting at his other place next store Bar Bianco
It's so great to be able to go to a restaurant and order anything on the menu and know it can be made GF and have lots of flavor
Due to the bad service and not so yummy food I won't be back
I've been when the food is great and the drinks are great and the staff is really friendly
I did like the place the waitress was nice and service was fast once we got seated  that took a while and we sat outside cause it would have been midnight if we would of wanted seating inside

Service is always quite friendly and fast
If you're ordering one cup of tea and stretching it out over several hours while taking a seat that somebody with a pulse and some social skills could be occupying - that's just rude

RM ordered the corned beef hash breakfast that was accompanied by two eggs hash browns and biscuits and gravy

The service was very good from a waitress named Cara who was knowledgeable and quite personable
The service was great even in a fairly busy environment

The restaurant wasn't super busy yet the service was still slow
So be ready to slow down and take in the Wild Wild West and not expect speedy fast paced service

However these good people in Chandler are from the same small town along the border I am  so I trusted their taste was similar to mine and I was not disappointed
Trade in value is pretty good and the staff is super nice
It was cooked to order nicely med-rare but had little flavor other then the toppings
The service - in case it wasn't clear - was absolutely wonderful I had a great time and I rave about you to all my friends - if they ever come out to Phoenix I mean
Pros - Nice rooms super friendly staff except the man in the gift shop who was strange and kind of rude food was excellent in the restaurant Starbucks onsite and of course the outdoor hot tubs
Cranberry Hills is a great spot to grab breakfast or lunch or order takeout via phone from a nearby business
I think the food is great the service is spectacular and it just looks really snazzy
When I asked to see the pistol I was interested in the guy seemed annoyed I was bothering him and told me he didn't know the answers to my questions how long would it take for delivery was it faster to order online
The staff is professional and friendly and the wait is usually minimal even on busy Sunday mornings
I generally order either the breakfast sandwich canadian bacon scrambled egg and cheddar on a fresh croissant -- always perfect or the traditional breakfast which I transform into Andrea's Personal Breakfast special by making 8 special requests
Conclusion If you want amazing Korean food and friendly customer service please just go to Chodang
The service is top notch and the grounds are pretty nice
It is a nice place and the service can be accomadating but there are some problems that keep it from getting 4-5 stars
The bartender seemed to be having a bad night so the service was average at best
but it took nearly 15 minutes and I ordered from the fast to-go counter
The staff is extremely friendly and helpful
Since I had the craving for Chicken & Waffles the nice staff at the hotel recommended Lolo's Chicken & Waffles
I was not disappointed the food was amazing the service was attentive and friendly
They have a great web order system that I checked out as soon as I got home but parking is so unbelievably unavailable at the Tempe Marketplace that I'm not sure this run in and grab it approach will really be of much use at this location
So I recently ordered delivery of which I found they do not deliver south of Curry so Score 1 since my friend lives at Miller and McKellips the invisible border of Scottsdale/Tempe menu items are moderately priced and the third best thing about LCP Little Chicago Pizza is the food it's pretty good
I struggled with the rating for this place as the beer is really great as is the service
The locals seemed to be happy service was great and owner seemed genuinely interested in who was eating at his place and how we had discovered it
The server was very slow and never asked us if we wanted refills on drinks forgot an entire appetizer order and had to be found to pay the bill
We ordered the roasted jalapeno rellenos appetizer great the pollo fundido good but the chicken was a little dry the lamb barbacoa very good the plato burro with pork and fundido great and the chocolate tamale for desert very good
The food was good the service was okay but the experience was slightly hurt by the silverwear and glass problem
All of my friends said our experience wasn't typical so maybe we just caught a bad waitress on a bad day and a bad cook on a bad day
We were hungry and after eating our mediocre apps we waited and waited ok let's say service was slooooowwwwwww and when you have slow service and hungry sushi craving people tempers flare and what was supposed to be a great dining experience suddenly becomes a bad one

There aren't a lot of vegan dessert choices around the valley and this is a good one

The Phoenix location has always been GREAT in all areas food service etc

The service was great though I would have preferred if they replaced our silverware after the cinnamon roll and the meal was well paced
The man taking our order was very friendly and offered a sample of the Wednesday Special Eggplant Stew
The place was packed they had music starting at 6 pm which was pretty good and service was very good and attentive

Clean unique establishment w/ good service and great ambience
There are costumes for purchase and also for rent and all of the staff working are friendly creative and totally nuts
The food isn't bad but I've never been blown away by anything I've eaten there--I've been for both dinner and happy hour and aside from the wild mushroom pizza I've never felt the need to order anything a second time
What blows me away is how bad the service is
The rooms were very nice big and terrific service from the entire management and staff
I have tried a number of the burgers and chicken sandwiches all are very good and it's especially nice with all the items you can add or change in an order
The wait staff is willing to customize and is always friendly no matter how many changes we ask for
Another great thing about this particular store is that the staff comes by so frequently to refill the drinks and fries that we hardly ever have to wait for anything
Now add to the great food some great service
cute place nice patio and extremely helpful staff
Their catalog is a great shopping aid as you can call ahead and phone in your order - and especially if they don't have what your looking for they can get it for you within a weeks time so you don't have to waste a trip there
they know my order by heart and the staff is so nice
I love this cafe its near work and they have a great selection of lunch items and there is a pond outside you can sit at quick service too
I'm appalled at the lack of concern and assistance  by the manager who watched me wait for 45 minutes for my breakfast and did NOTHING
Everytime I come here the service is great
The food is on the spicy side which I personally greatly enjoy but I know some people aren't a huge fan so they suggest ordering it gringo style if you don't prefer a lot of heat
the staff was awesome and friendly so cool
NegsService was inexplicably slow despite the restaurant having only a few parties
Not only was the customer service exceptional but their food was very good as well
We upgraded our dish to the combo so we ordered fries option we chose which were really good too and had unlimited refills with any drink at the fountain
Again delicious food and really great and friendly customer service
Waiters come around with carts of goodies and you tell them what you want from their cart
Great food unique cocktails and outstanding service is what earned Ticoz 5 stars in my book
The service inside is great and everyone acknowledges you when you walk in
this is American Chinese food and this is AZ so I am grading on a curve and I am giving this place an automatic 1-star bump for great service something for which I am usually deducting stars from restaurants in the area
I'm surprised to see the review that said rude staff everyone was incredibly nice
They're small patties so it's a good idea to order a double
The bartenders work as a team and the service was good
The service was good I will say and for that I would offer a higher rating
Let me start out by saying that the two stars I gave them was because of the good service
I'm wondering what menu they ordered off of because my food wasn't that great
The only reason I am not giving it 4 or 5 stars is the service wasn't very attentive and the regular prices are a little high
He was a really nice guy took my order and paid for my lunch
I ordered the same thing I did last time Bacon Cheeseburger side of fries and a drink to make it a good comparison
All the other great stuff from my previous review still stands I love the organic concept it's really nice inside very clean the service is friendly and that soda machine remains great
While I had no issues with the staff upon moving out the original staff made it a truly great place to live back in 2002-2004
The bowl is also good enough for 2 if you order enough sushi/appetizers
The restaurant is very clean and the staff very nice
All in all expect rather slow service but better than most cajun food in phoenix
The ambience is relaxed yet upscale and the staff is accommodating and friendly
The service is always great and you'll most likely have the owner of the restaurant serve you
Of course I drove past the restaurant several times before realizing it was in a strip mall but I forgave the drab exterior the second I arrived and saw a packed restaurant aflurry with wait staff flying around every corner attentively serving their patrons
Chili's may not have been my first choice in fine dining on such an occasion but I know it's family-friendly and pretty standard in the food and service it delivers
After finding out a friend of mine had never been we headed north for breakfast nirvanaRight from the start there was almost no wait to order
The staff is friendly and they toss your slices in the oven for a couple minutes to make sure it is warm for you too
The Guest Services team was great they sent up some medication for me charged it to my room and then the young woman who brought me my cough medicine even sent up some Green Tea and Honey since I mentioned that it would probably be a good idea to order it
The waitress was nice and we were seated right away ordered the Hawaiin style pizza
I completely understand ordering good food and expecting to wait for it but this was OUTRAGEOUS
I can't say anything bad about the hotel itself or the service but I believe they should be required to make this fact known to their guests before their arrival so they can plan accordingly
Dessert is just as nice usually you finish with smooth ice cream flavors and fresh fruit
I've been here several times now and the service is always on point-waiters are attentive without being in your face
The service was good friendly and prompt however in the time span of 3 hours we had 4 different servers
Sometimes during lunch they get real busy and service can slow down
And the waiters and staff there are very friendly
I love the atmosphere at Mazie's and the service was great
However they do give you a nice big side salad if you order one and they are reasonably priced
The pizza salads and dessert are all fantastic they have a pretty good beer selection and the wait at dinner is never more than about an hour
The staff is friendly and takes good care of you
Staff are friendly and service is good too
Drive thru service is ridiculously slow- and even the drive through configuration makes no sense
Beer was way too expensive service was slow even for sitting at the bar the fish fell apart fries were cold and lumpy  were not CHIPS NO FULLERS
The staff were all upbeat and very friendly you can tell they make a lot of people happy here
The service was very good and the food was delicious
Also their shop and warehouse was very nice and the people are very friendly and customer service orientated
Our waitress answered all our questions and was very helpful to explain all the dishes and gave great recommendations
To top it all off the staff is very courteous and nice
The chicken schwarma was OK but I was expecting grilled chicken -- my bad; did not know what I was ordering
I had to wait a little bit but the owner was very nice and gave me a small iced tea gratis and an order of baklava
Oregano's is home to the Great Dessert War of '02
The pizza was good but not on the level of the dessert
The service was attentive but the food was poor
Bad when you don't know when to stop and you find yourself stumbling to the bathroom not knowing whether you want to throw up or order more guacamole made in front of you at the table-delish with extra jalapenos- dirty look to those wusses I have gone with who have opted for less spice
The ambiance is just right dimly lit comfortable booths happy hour is only at the bar or at the tables surrounding the bar though and friendly staff
Until He made a comment that people of my gender are really bad at ordering coffee
The sides were excellent as well and we've always had friendly service
This place was so good the food was great the service was awesome and I really liked the whole set up of the place too
The manager stopped by our table and was also very nice a friendly and even cleared our plates away for us
However the music was good but VERY loud and the service was bad
The waitress herself was nice and helpful but she seemed to be the only person working so there was a long wait for everything
On top of it all customer service was rude
I'm told the beer selection is good although when I tried to order something seasonal they didn't have anything
I ordered a Mojito and was expecting greatness but was SO disappointed
The atmosphere was great as was the service
~*Friendly helpful and professional staff
The service is good although it could be improved
The food was good the service was excellent and the atmosphere was pleasant for such a busy place
Cute location welcoming seating area and friendly staff round out the mix
The waiter was clearly inexperienced and his English abilities were probably not what they should be but the restaurant was not so busy that the service should have been THAT bad
The staff tells us that after dark is also a great time to see some animals
Aka you order they cook your food cook not microwave fast-food-style and then you pick it up at the counter
I was headed to complain only to encounter some really nice staff that made up for it
The staff is always very friendly and warm
Finally the NICEST waitresses/waiters
then here's some more you should knowThe pizza is damn good the service is damn good and the prices are fair
So thank god Bomberos has such a dope wine list and attentive service because I most definitely needed the Chilean Riesling to take off the edge of that massacre
Overall this is an above average Thai place where the selection is very good the food is high quality and you cannot go wrong with anything you order
-Vegan Deli items like -Vegan Sheperds Pie Amazing -Vegan Margherita Tofu Lasagna Ridiculously Good -Endless Salad Bar Creations Love the stuffed Grape leaves -Vegan Soups -Vegan Pizzas -Vegan Made to order Sandwiches Love that Olive Spread -Vegan Sushi Avocado Cucumber Rolls better than most restaurants -Beautiful Organic Produce Local Choices too -Organic Almond Milk -Hemp Seeds in Bulk -Mrs
The food and service is still as great as its ever been
I gave this restaurant 5 stars for the quality of the food the fast and friendly service as well as price
I think its worth it as everything tastes good and plus there's that made-to-order steak grill
The customer service is great very helpful attentive and get your food quickly
First of all the waitress was VERY nice but the restaurant was very busy given it was Valentine's Day that the service was very slow
We had the donuts for dessert which were good but overwhelming with how many you got
or at least longer than it should have taken to place a fast food order
Friendly staff and you can munch on some peanuts before your food comes out
Lack of service the nurses chat with you and are friendly but they don't serve you
I really enjoyed chatting with the manager who was really great about directing me to the coolest spot in the room their a/c was having issues - it happens
unfortunately the momentum of the servers was already exhausted because it took about 45 minutes for our breakfast and it took about half that time to place our order
Excellently prepared entrees with great service
The steak dishes are understandably the stars of the menu and on Sundays they have a great special for prime rib for $37 in addition to the prime rib you get salad side dish and dessert
Service was very attentive and even though I didn't need it they offer black napkins to place on your lap if you are wearing something dark so that any lint from the white napkins on the table doesn't get on your outfit
definitely not enough nut options here again I may be too picky so judge for yourself- The machines at this place are low-quality not only do they look it but they pour poorly and you basically have no control of your pour- No friendly welcome or chipper staff okay I may be picky here but froyo should be FUN
We were seated right away and the staff was very very friendly
I found this restaurant to be very clean and the service was great
Great service fresh and delicious seafood
Great staff and no crowds so we enjoyed a quiet lunch indoors
Service was good but nothing to rave about
Service is always decent decor is nice and the food is interesting if a bit pricey
We also ran into a friendly staff member who saw my daughter in her princess dress and came talked to us
We walked in and the staff was very friendly
Service was attentive but not constant which was nice because I just wanted to enjoy some time to myself with a nice meal
The only positive i can say is that the waitress was wonderful and very friendly
Prior to this we went to IPIC several times and why it's very nice and trendy the service has always been horrible and it's way overpriced
The food is good the drinks are reasonably priced and the service is amazing
There's certainly an authentic flair to the inattentive service you get I felt right back in Germany when I had to finally get up from the table to hunt our server down for another round of beers
There are still things I love about it--the convenience the friendly staff the fact that no matter how big or small my order is it ALWAYS is ready in ten minutes
I love that it's small and everything I've ordered has been great
The service was excellent and the food very good although maybe not the best choice for the night before Thanksgiving
Friendly staff that actually returns calls
I would go back just for the friendly staff and crowd with the good food and solid drinks as a bonus
Second the staff was friendly a bit on the helpless side though still new so no bad marks for that
Drinks nice change from the norm Boylan's Sparkling Beverages sticking with the natural theme nice touch also they serve Gelato shakes seems like half the customers ordered them
Each staff member was friendly responsive and never devoid of a smile
As stated in my previous review service was very very slow
It can get a little hectic in there especially during peak lunch times but the service is usually pretty good they've only messed up my order on two occassions and they corrected it promptly
It's a small place great for grabbing a quick bite or ordering take out and the food is always ready within 10 - 15 minutes
They also get 5 stars from me for their excellent service - the guy who is always there who I think is the owner is super nice
We also had the crab rangoon which was like dessert it was so sweet and good
Very clean store friendly and helpful staff great prices and open every day from 7am - 11pm
We love the food the price is fair the people are very nice and service is quick
Usually I am not bothered by slow service but with an eight month old baby we were anxious to order so we could finish before she became restless and irritable
This place was fantastic when i have been there in the past and the food is still good love the mini tacos and the avocado bowl is well worth it for your chips and dinner side but the service this time was sooooooooooo bad that it made it all seem not worth repeating
Nice location close to convention center; great staff but falls down in other areas
Bellini's = good strong mango/peach margaritaPazookie= skip the food and just order one of these
The food was yummy the atmosphere and friendly staff as well as the attempts to be sustainable make this place just plain cool
I had really good service from the dealer and have been happy with   interactions with them since but it is a completely different experience with the collision center
The staff is unfriendly not very accommodating or particularly compassionate
The work I have had done has been done well and been satisfactory but bad service just drives me nuts
way better than that Taco Bell place and the service at this location was VERY friendly and helpful
I have been shopping at various Fascinations over the years and its always a great experience with the staff this company has done a great job recreating the image and feel of a sex shop and mainstreamed the whole experience
I would spend money with this business in the future but never at this location as I have now gone 2 for 2 with bad customer service here
If you find yourself craving something sweet and are anywhere near Scottsdale or the Prescott/Flagstaff Farmers markets find the time to visit Goodytwos toffee it'll be worth the trip
Next time I go I am going to order some italian just to see if it is as good as everything else I have ordered there
The waiter was rude but he brought us a refill during a commercial
If the food was above average and the service was good this would be a fun time
Anyway the food was good and the service would good also
Sometimes I am disappointed with the wait staff because certain servers aren't really on top of things even on a slow day
The portions were large and the service was great
The staff was friendly no snobbishness experienced on my visit
I don't like this style of dining especially when the waiter or waitress doesn't even try to make an effort of being friendly or happy to serve you
I went there for business and it was pretty good- The service was on and off as far as the front desk went the woman who checked me in was really nice but then when you called for anything it always seemed to be a big problem
The service people were soooo nice and polite and quite funny- the servers and doormen
Good looking staff and plenty of bottomless mimosas
Very friendly and helpful service but not overbearing
Our waiter was very nice and attentive
Overall this place is adorable and the staff including the owner are helpful and friendly
The bartender staff were pretty wild and seemed to be having a great time
Service was great and our server gave us great recommendations and always came by to check on us which is always a plus in my book
Wonderful in-room massage by Gina and great service during a corporate meeting
I usually order the bacon and eggs which is awesome but today I ordered the Florentine Benedict and it was very good
Combined with friendly service a major component in a happy dining experience and a relaxed atmosphere
I ordered to go as usual and I had bad feeling about it since it was almost 9pm when they close
I can bet anyone 5 dollars that with all the reviews regarding their downward spiral of bad service that the owner or manager doesn't give a rats ass that they are doing this bad now
Service was very friendly and fastWhile the place had a funky smell upon entering - don't let that put you off
The bartender Heeley was a friendly guy who definitely liked to converse and when we realzed almost all of the staff was like this it was very nice
To compliment the great food and service the price of it is great
Good service fantastic huge food and reasonable cold beer and margs
So the answer between going to the bar and fighting your way to the bartender or waiting for table service is up to you its slow either way
The vegetarian pizza that I ordered  was medium sized and a very good value with a variety of fresh toppings
Well they were really good and freshly-fried I was shocked considering the kitchen was closing in 30 minutesI ordered their famous orange chicken
The good parts are the Service is very good and for lunch it is very affordable
Service was pretty slow and took awhile to get the check
The waitstaff are cool and the food service is timed nicely
Ordered the Original Breakfast burrito from this place and added chorizo to it
For the most part customer service is great even the newbies that work there are great even though they can't fold a tortilla
What I like Nice fancy atmosphere Comfortable chairs Helpful service Plenty of Staff You can drink in the movie What I don't like
There is plenty of space in your big comfy chair the wait staff is at the push of a button and you can always get a good seat
Waitress service in the bar was attentive
Good service especially in Old Town beergaritas drinks and food's ok
Great staff great food & with happy hour & reverse happy hour it's happy hour literally all day long
This place looks nice when you walk in but don't expect any customer service
A non-mall location bonus points easy parking talented organists and friendly staff
But at this point the two waiters on got slammed and I counted our waiter running around with at least seven tables   some were outside on the patio  He had help but wasn't able to ask us how are meals were  although they were great  We wanted to order dessert since the meals were very good and Grant did make the trip to clear our plates and give dessert menus
I think the menu is slightly dated and the dessert we tried was good but is not on the level of the really great meals
I could only imagine how bad the service in a restaurant could be until I visited Sushi Ken with my family on 8/12/2012 for lunch
Staff has always been friendly and helpful
Service was not so great and at the end one of the servers asked if we were ready to cash out
We got sat right down with very friendly service
Unfortunately the service is so bad that it takes so much away from the experience and I am personally disappointed
I'm not referring to a single event although my latest experience would certainly deserve a much more negative rant but I am referring to consistent bad customer service
I've never had good delivery service from here so I stopped ordering for delivery and picked up myself
The iced tea is always fresh and the service in the store has always been good
Not to mention great music ambiance and staff
The service here in the afternoons no less is consistently slow
The only thing I'm unsure of is if its just the employees who are slow or if the inside of the kitchen is actually another dimension in which time slows down and thus making orders coming out of the kitchen take three times as long as any other Sonic takes
Con staff is not always friendly sometimes I do not feel welcomed
The waiter was very attentive and when we asked to split the check with two cards he was overly-apologetic about explaining the $1
The ordering is basically fast-food self service so why not the clean up
Service was pleasant and not overly pretentious just a tad slow at times
Yes there could have been more smiles or slightly faster service but it was a one person operation for much of the time I was there it seemed like other servers showed up later
built your own pizza is a good way to go  always FRESH incredigents  great pizza crust and for those FISH LOVERS note   they use FRESH ANCHOVY  which DOES NOT TASTE SALTY like the can ANCHOVY  which gives the NON FISH  taste    but all in all a good clean place for a afternoon lunch service was VERY GOOD
Small and cozy although not much ambiance it offers friendly service good food and relatively cheap prices
We arrived after 5 on Wednesday the 27th and found the front desk staff friendly and helpful
I'm not sure about the other reviews mentioning terrible service but every front desk staff person we encountered couldn't have been nicer
The enchiladas were pretty good but I would probably not order them again
The server was great even though he forgot my daughter's drink and ordered her a cheese quesadilla appetizer and not the kids cheese quesadilla
The waitress said she gets the Penne Boscialo when she eats here - ham mushrooms meat sauce mixed with Alfredo - so I got that and it was great
I did though and I have to say the food was yuck the coffee was watered down and the service was slow
The service was fantastic though they were so attentive and cleared away plates and bowls immediately food was fresh and served very quickly
so even though the food didn't blow me away I would go back simply for the friendly staff
Both the restaurant manager and head chef are there all day everyday making sure every meal is great
The staff is amazing-  super friendly fun and helpful
Service was good and the burger was above average
The customer service was wonderful the girl who took our order really knew how to be helpful fun and super nice
The staff is friendly and the decor is very nice
The roomservice is great 24 hours and they also have a lot of restaurants and a few different bars/1 club you can go to
I assume they can only get away with these practices due to the economy perhaps with so many people trying to rent instead of own - but this is only grasping for a reason that the company and management behave so badly   Be aware of any company that seems to have as many lawyers than maintenance staff  they lawyers respond faster than maintenance
Place is clean food is good service is great women are beautiful
A truly great experience and I look forward to using this restaurant in the future for any event that requires a great atmosphere with great food and great service for a large party
When I mentioned to the nice young man who waited on us how much I wanted to taste the lemon/garlic/pepper dressing in the lok lak beef - which I didn't order cuz the weather was too cold for salad - he brought me a little bowl of it complete with two tasting spoons
The service was fast and friendly from beginning to end
The waitress was very friendly and helpful
The hotel is stunning is most ways and most of the staff is really nice  the restaurants not so much for me I suggested eating off property
It was busy but the service was pretty good
The service is good they are polite and timely with your order
Great service and atmosphere capped off an already wonderful time I will be going back often for sure
Beyond the vegan thing the service was okay but clearly taking on hour for pizza when it's slow is not cool
Our waitress was friendly and attentive
A general atmosphere of friendliness in this restaurant probably starts with Outback's friendly manager
I have never had a bad service or had to complain about my food
Fresh Warm Pita Bread a must haveThe restaurant is cozy casual clean and the staff is very friendly and prompt
AMBIANCE/SERVICEThe waiter was incredibly attentive and friendly
The staff was nice and pleasant and I really enjoyed the patrons as well - we chatted with quite a few and it just seemed like a really nice upbeat place
The restaurant is always clean and the service is friendly in the way you want a neighborhood place to be
99Let me be clear the food on the buffet is just as good as what one could order
Nothing beats a good sushi bar with it being made right there to order but this wasn't bad
We will go back and look forward to another wonderful meal with great service
The upbeat vibe and warm decor actually made me forget the loads of work I still had to do - plus all of the staff was so friendly
We ordered from the summer price fix meal and found it to a great value - filet and pomme frites with a great green salad for $25
Prices very reasonableService  attentive - I loved the fact that they brought us a liter of Diet for my son and I to help ourselves
I ordered the Hackbraten German Meatloaf which was very good the mashed potato and red cabbage were superb
Our waiter was awesome as he knew everything on the menu so he was very helpful as well as very friendly and a great photographer
Everything you need in a waiter  The German music playing in the background was really festive and added to the great atmosphere
Great service I can always catch the NBA games I want to see and another bonus well more of a bonus for girls than anything else clean bathrooms
Once you get used to the website learn how it works and how to carefully select the options at the end of the check out its a great service
I have never experienced the bad service that most of the reviewers mention
Overall in this house we've had nothing but a great experience with this service and we tend to order our groceries from them at least twice a week- when you get your groceries delievered it leaves a lot more room for fun and other things in the day vs spending an hour or so at the grocery store
Manager Leo at this Scottsdale location is welcoming and attentive to details throughout the restaurant
Regardless a friend of mine made a great point; we are served what we did not order
One persons food came out promptly ours see above another couple waited an 45 minutes for their pizza that when it came out the very rude male waiter told us it was our caprese pizza when it was our friends pizza
Anyway we ordered the pretzel bites with cheese I thought it was good because I was hungry but after a well I found that the cheese was to heavy and thick for me but still alright
Always lots to explore good stock to peruse and a happy friendly staff that deserves special mention
We ordered the Strawberry Lassi blended plain yogurt fresh strawberries and ice- not quite like the lassis I've had at Indian restaurants but like a very good not-too-sweet smoothie
PROSCheap like a business hotel but more like a resortYou can park near your room if it's not too crowdedSurprisingly excellent breakfast buffet at the restaurant it was open on EasterNice big rooms join the Hilton club to get an upgradeTwo pools and pretty groundsGreat location Incredibly nice staffCONSInternet in the room is not free  the hotel website was misleadingNo interior corridors so if it's raining you have to deal with puddlesElevators are far away so you're hauling your luggage upstairsOn Saturday they cleaned at 3pm on Sunday they cleaned at 9am
Not bad considering U-Haul is the biggest and probably overall most obnoxious truck rental service
Service was nice but weird I wanted to book under either my AAA or government rate but the front desk said I had to call the main ritz number to do that
The server noticed I'd picked off the fat and tendon pieces and told me that the tendon was good for the joints- it's the main reason consumers of this style of soup order it
First off the staff in the office is first class friendly and professional
The only small problem we encountered was constant malfunctioning of our hotel key cards but the staff was so nice and understanding every time we came in to have them re-magnetized
Good prices great service and best of all cheap Margaritas
We went for our 1 year anniversary and had made reservations ahead of time they took great care of us and the entire staff was great
What makes me a big fan of this store is the great customer service
you've seen these reviews cause in my head if the food and service are good why should i give a shit who is serving it to me
Beautiful decor super cheerful staff and soccer on the TV which will keep us there for a good long time
The staff is pretty friendly too except for yesterday
The staff are always friendly and the restaurant is very clean
The staff at Total Wine have always been friendly and ready to offer their picks
It's close to my work and the service is fast and friendly
It's a fairly nice sit-down place with good service a full and fancy bar and an open and airy pretty space
I gave 4 stars because our waitress was not very attentive
The inside of the restaurant is very nice modern and very clean the staff was friendly and the service was fast
I ordered Rare beef Pho and it was great the broth was fresh and full of flavor the meat was the most tender beef I have ever had in pho and there was a generous helping of beef and noodles
We had the calamari appetizer and my mom ordered the Crisp and Crunch Rolls AMAZING shrimp tempura sweet potato wild berry cream cheese so good I may go back tonight and order it for take home
The service here is not the problem nor is the the saturation of tv's quite impressed with the fireplace screen it's the bad food
The guy cooking our order well he was nice and super fast
I just bought a used MINI Cooper S and a friend told me to visit Eurotechs for great service and prices with dealer quality repairs
Not only that they were very nice and didn't say Oh another Californian or anything; they just smiled and thanked me for stopping even though there's about 35 miles where there's no service so it's not like I had much choice
The service has always been good for me at this location especially from the I think
The wait staff were very friendly and answered all of my questions thoroughly
The service was just attentive enough but not intrusive
Good portions fresh food great service and comfortable atmosphere
The service at this location is usually above average and I've only very rarely had bad experiences there typically when they're very busy
I've had very few botched orders and the one time I got truly bad service I got a phone call and a personal apology from the bad server after notifying the manager
As far as restaurants go this particular location is one of the safest bets that I know of -great food great service and really consistent
The staff is friendly and helpful if you have any questions and there are always enough cashiers available when it comes time to check out
With regard to this location I felt compelled to write about their great customer service
Great service Vietnamese RestaurantI've been here several times and it is about time I gave my review
It is one of my favorite places to come to in the Valley because of the food friendly service and all this for an affordable cost
Service was very friendly and helpful
Service was friendly prompt and helpful---no complaints there
The staff was small and friendly and they had REALLY COLD BEER
Nice atmosphere and a welcoming staff
It was completely slammed while we were there but the service wasn't bad considering
With that being said I will still try this place again even with our bad service experience and give it a chance to get more stars as it has the potential for at least a 4 star if not 5
I thought customer service was fine--not great just adequate
Also one of my concerns when visiting the true food kitchen's another one in biltmore area is that the service is not up to par with the great food
The staff are very attentive and greet you when you come in
Wonderfully decorated with local artists artwork clean neat close parking and the service so far has been good
The location is great as the mall is a good place to walk off the extra mozzarella ;I ordered the small pizza with pepperoni and extra fresh mozzarella
The service was friendly prompt and the place was imaculate
This is a good little spot - i would definitely come back again- the service was great
The service was a bit lacking which was disappointing because they were not completely packed and should have been a little more attentive
They even brought out a nice traditional homemade ice cream dessert for the birthday boy - which we all shared
The service has always been great the atmosphere is nice and the food is mouthwatering
BUT its so good I order it anyway in hopes that its my lucky day
I've been dreaming of it since I got back from a visit to Green Bay last summer ;I was excited to hear that Culver's opened here in Mesa -- I don't eat their burgers but it' s nice to have a place for frozen custard -- there are so few places for any type of frozen dessert in Phoenix which is odd considering how hot it is and there are even fewer places for custard
Friendly staff and quaint child-like sports atmosphere with a lot of families inside
Friendly order takers give input on the food
The service is friendly and the atmosphere homey
My only true complaints are the interior often cold and mighty boring and the staff is hit and miss most often warm and friendly but sometimes I catch a big jerk
I was greeted by an extremely friendly smiling man I believe to be the owner who helped me with my order decision took my order then asked me to please sit down be at home
This YC's compared to the other ones in Tempe has a better selection of diet soda drinks at the soda fountain Sprite Zero Diet Coke and Caffeine Free Diet Coke and service is very friendly and speedy
VP the manager is one of the nicest guys around
and then this is where the service started to get slow
If you want to order a bike rent a bike change a tire or get your bike serviced you will definitely be in good hands with these guys
All in all some good-sized portions I had the half rack of ribs decent sides and very good service
The service was very good the ambiance was fun and open and it was definitely serviceable
Sometimes the service is a little slow to start but it is basically seat yourself so when they are busy I can understand it being difficult to figure out who just sat down
so we ordered the artichokessoaked in a lemon-basil olive oil--tender a bit greasy the foie grascrispy with smoky-sauteed mushrooms and sweet cubed apple the clamsAMAZING--only slightly spicy with a kick of lime and cilantro nice and buttery with a hint of white wine and the butternut squash raviolia bit of a letdown--the squash filling needs FLAVOR--more sweetness more spice something
I have only been there about twice in the past two years but both times the service was just REALLY bad

Let me start of by saying that I've had my car serviced at the dealer for a good 5+ years

That was also pretty good but then again I usually never disagree with dessert

I then ordered the braised steak with slaw and tomatillo avocado sauce that right there was some good stuff
The tea was good and the staff were helpful and quick
Don't come here if you're looking for good service
they were very nice about every thing but 2 phone calls plus discussing it with the waitress should have been enough even then they attempted to convince me it was fine as it was canola oil they failed to mention that shell fish is fried in it all night every night
The service is polite the food is very good and the price is reasonable
I read that some Yelpers have had trouble with the service here but I have always found it to be at least adequate and often quite friendly
Joes New York Pizza was great the last time we ordered
But the staff is friendly and food is delicious
I went here for breakfast with my wife in December 2009First off the waiter we had was friendly and accomodating and the menu has all the standard fare for a breakfast restaurant

All the waiters suck really bad and need some training
The staff is wonderful great selection of drinks but the food is just
I've read about some issues with the staff there here on Yelp but they were extremely friendly to us granted
great selection good prices friendly staff and a decent albeit small lounge area = 4 Stars in my book

They used to have this kick ass Salmon Sandwich that a few folks on our Tuesday night pub quiz team would order - then a few months ago they took it off the menu for no good reason

oi the pastry case was filled with a good number of enticing desserts such as cupcakes different flavored eclairs tartes and mousse
The restaurant is super clean and quaint inside even a big fireplace and the service is great
But it isn't just good food management  servers and even their valet guys understand what good service is
Great prices great flavors toppings and a friendly staff this place has it all
Sure it's not nearly as fancy pants as the nearby JW Marriott but for less than half the price free shuttle service within a 2 mile radius large new rooms complete with kitchenette and the best part a ginormous free breakfast buffet including some glorious whole wheat belgian waffles this place is sooo worth the price
I was a little worried about the menu at first but the great staff broke everything down and showed that the food is the star of the show and not the menu
Service attentive and friendlyPrices on the high side
Give me a rude waiter some fantastic food and reasonably fair prices and like a Vietnamese hooker I love you long time

they have a fabulous menu a great vibe and service seems to always be spot on
I got the impression this place put more emphasis on looking cool and hip on paper than good service and execution
The wait staff provided much needed coffee but also a recommendation to take a peek at the breakfast buffet that was underway
The manager is less than nice even at the best of times
I was at Zipps recently for several college ball games where thank goodness Megan our server was amazing because the rest of the service was horrible

+++'s FREE fast WiFi so you can check the scores and your girl that's with you who gets bored after the 1st Qtr can social network; OK cheap sports bar food breakfast burritos & other stuff before 11a and under $9; plenty of TV's; plenty of seating if you get there early; friendly although not speedy wait staff who put Hooters girls to shame; good relatively clean crowd although a little more than a healthy dose of the mid-western/north-eastern boys who think their team is THEIR team and those mid-west girls with the witch-chin beady eyes thin plucked brows stark nose and brown straight bob that wear banana republic clothes they're still hot and I'd take one on the chin for 'em
- - - 's bloody mary i ordered was a bit too peppery not sure what the bathrooms looked likeIn sum a good sports bar for guys & girls that want a place in Old Town that is down-to-earth and will have your game on just don't expect to hear it over the regional fan din
But the thing that will make me never come back was the rude manager who asked my friend and me to move away from the bar and carry our conversation else where because we were in his way
They always have the best most fun and friendly service and I just love the pellet ice I sware it makes the drink taste so much better
A real shame because the food and service are very good

Patrick's day and it was a little busy but not too bad we got our seats right away and our waiter brought our drinks and menus out promptly
The hostess was very friendly staff was wonderful and Frank was a great character

Plenty the waiter couldn't hear us we couldn't have dinner conversation we couldn't see our food not good for eating nachos and it was completely impractical for the average client
I shamelessly flirted with our waiter and he had a great sense of humor about it
I ordered the southwest breakfast burrito I think that was the name and I substituted the chorizo with bacon and had them add mushrooms instead of the jalepeu00f1o cream cheese
Although I have spent thousands of dollars at this shop on bikes and service my recent experiences were TERRIBLE; both with the hip-hop gangster looking kid up front Dennis and the owner who didn't want to undermine the incorrect information bad attitude and poor customer service his novice front-man had been providing

I ordered the Enchiladas Suizas chicken with a tomatillo cream sauce and tried my friends Cochinita Pibil slow roasted pork

Despite my brother and my waitress' somewhat snooty responses to my question about the amount of mayo in the tuna salad sandwich It's very good

Realizing that however that late dish was comped without our asking by someone who I assume was the owner/manager which was a nice response to the situation

The only complaints I have is that it can seem pricey if you order a few things and also depending on day it can be kind of slow to get your order
That was nice & the service was attentive but the food is a little blah overall & the price is a little high at $9
The service here was super friendly nice and helpful
but the service was so bad that I can't give it more than 3 stars

Sometimes the service can be a bit slow and when people don't clean up after themselves the place gets pretty messy

I have dined here many times and it has been great but the general manager is not very good
The service was ok and the people seemed friendly enough
The only downside to this place is that if you get there a little after noon for lunch the service slows WAY down

Service is friendly enough although it's not the fastest so I don't recommend dining here if you're cutting it close trying to catch your flight

Drinks    A     Excellent wine knowledge and service technique was                         displayed by the waiter coupled with a good selection                        makes this a great place to enjoy wine Service   A     Good service as explained above *Ramsay Test  Chef Gordon Ramsay says that if you are going to make and serve a simple dish it needs to be executed with perfection
So I sent it back and the waitress was very nice apologized and took it

I was really looking forward to a Salmon Burger but I don't like bad service much less no service
aside from a really clumsy and spacey but really nice waitress the food was AMAZING
The staff was very friendly quick and attentive and all seemed to thank us as we as we finished up and walked out
We where not told about the paid parking however we where rebated our money for the parking the people at the desk where not very friendly pretty snobbish the bar that is not owned by the hotel closes at 10pm we where ignored repeatedly by all staff then told it was closed
Good service lots of waitresses flying around and everyone seemed to be having a blast cheering on their teams

Very friendly staff great collection of books and I totally dig the cafe and the culture passes that let upto four people enter select museums for free
Food came fast and the waitress was very friendly
The place is kept incredibly clean staff is friendly and Teharu fills a nice niche for a super casual quick sushi place
Beyond that though this place is super clean unique in some of the design attributes and the food and service are quite good
Best buy has probably the worst service on the planet so I pretty much just made notes on models and prices from there but didn't get any good information only spoke to one guy there who had no knowledge of really anything
I told myself they work extra hard over their sauces and got over it - I was there it smelled good and other customers were eating and ordering
Not the friendliest service but not rude either
The staff is always very friendly and helpful
The waitress was present at first but slow
We ordered the employees were nice the food came out pretty quickly and they have sweet potato fries
I'm not sure if that's common knowledge but I thought it was pretty cool Overall great service great food and it was a pretty stress-free lunch
The service was great and the wait was short but it was a work day
The desserts were good too - warm choc cake salted caramel pudding and the peanut butter
Great selection great staff and great prices
My beer was served very cold the service was great
Wait staff can sometimes be slow and waiting times are long immediately after work hours but it's usually worth the wait
Service was quite good portions were large we each took some food home and priced were OK for the quality
The wait staff tries to work fast to take your order & get your food out before the previews comes on
Price  Not badService GoodAtmosphere  GreatFood  GreatWhile slightly more costly than I'd pay for a typical sandwich lunch it's worth the cost
I've been going to this location for a couple of years now and never had a problem with the quality of the haircut or the staff themselves always friendly and great service
The ambiance was amazing the waiter was very professional and friendly and the food was amazing
The ambiance plus great service really makes Veneto a destination worth seeking from anywhere in the valley
Of course all the ambiance and service in the world means nothing without good food
On this Friday night at dinner time they were able to have our 2 pizzas cranked out in under 20 minutes with a good lineup of other orders and the phone ringing

Good food consistent service easy in and out
Despite this little mishap the service is great
Our waiter was extremely knowledge and I not only walked away with a much better understanding of wine pairings and the wine making process but I also recived a great lecture on the ins and outs of truffles
5 stars as everyone has said the service was a bit slow
Yes the service is slow and not necessarily the best
My last visit everything was great until my wife received  her order of lamb with risotto unfortunately the risotto was undercooked and after her mentioning that the waiter did take plate back to the kitchen

As an update to my previous review I have since learned that the staff here was extremely rude to my wedding coordinator and the caterers on the day of the event
The staff here is wonderful the rooms are beautiful and impeccably clean and each room has its own little secluded balcony with a great view
I've had an occasional waiter/waitress that I could do without but even they aren't too bad
The location is great the people are fun and fun to watch as are the TVs the food and service are both very good the prices are outstanding the Bocce Ball is different and it's always packed
The only downsides were that service was a little slow though quite friendly and my husband thought the water had a bad smell/taste and he couldn't drink it
On Friday our service was as good as it gets
Service was extremely attentive the staff very polite and the food was consistently being replaced
The staff were pleasant and courteous over-all a nice afternoon
The staff is always friendly and knowledgeable about their coffee which is a major plus for me
The whole staff is wonderful and friendly and while the salon is located in the heart of Scottsdale you never feel judged or surrounded by snotty holier than thou attitude
They have a nice menu selection and the staff here was pretty darn cool
For a fast-food joint I never expected a simple order of sweet potato fries to have so much punch either
I have heard their paninis and salads are great but if I'm going to Delux I'm ordering the burger
I have been to Delux several times and their extensive beer selection creative drinks and consistent great service makes their experience just that much more enjoyable
If you are looking for good food solid service and a nice atmosphere then you probably want to avoid this strip mall hangout at all costs
Generally the staff is pretty inattentive
Too bad - good concept compared to Subway but can't seem to make the sandwich per what is ordered
Largely unaware on entering that Pane serves dessert it was with much delight that I realized soon after sitting down that three options were available that day and while the flourless chocolate cake I saw emerge from the kitchen to the table next to me looked quite nice there was simply no way I was passing up the Organic Vanilla Bean Rice Pudding with Candied Pecans - another simplistic stunner with creamy Arborio rice imbued with a rich vanilla custard flicked with whole vanilla beans and a few pecans for crunch
service is good some busy days are a bit slow but nothing horribly bad
To this day it is my Wife's and mine go to place for birthdays anniversary's or just to have a great time w/GREAT food & GREAT service

The service was very friendly and fast the restaurant calm and clean and the food pretty good
We had dessert as well which was pretty good
Most of the time that I've eaten here has been work-related wine tastings but the service has always been attentive and prompt

The service was fast and friendly I ordered the combo plate and was surprised how quickly it came out
Great service despite there being 30 of us in our group so I was impressed at how hard and efficient the staff was
You get tons of multi-colored tortilla chips yellow good called cheese a side order of sour cream that was pretty big a bun of sliced raw jalapeno if you want your butt to hurt for days after eating it and some guacamole
There were only four other tables that were seated when I arrived - my waiter was attentive and struck up a conversation
Each time I've been in I've received personal service from friendly wait staff or bartenders
The managers greet customers as well and the staff seems to be a great team
I ordered the Manzi panini and thought it was good my wife's sandwich was much better
The food was very good the staff was helpful friendly and on top of things plus they elicit the Alice Cooper image in a very accurate way although they did a not bring me a snake-thank God
I would have only given this restaurant 3 stars due to the dirty plate and the lack of green peppers if it wasn't for the fast friendly service and the good pizza
T Cook's is one of those rare places that can genuinely say everything is good when you ask for their recommendationsMaybe it's just me but the atmosphere ambiance service and food combine in subtle but effective ways to create a meal experience that you really don't find very often

I don't care for fires and I think I could eat 3 orders they were so good
His was so good he ordered another burger
No but it was good enough to finish it - I was STARVING by the time we ate   The wait staff was pleasant enough but I can get much better pizza with no wait back home
Also our waitress came by to apologize for the pizza's taking so long we honestly didn't even notice and gave us another order of free calamari and any dessert we wanted which was a great bonus
then you order a nice after dinner coffee
Great food great prices great service great space
The meal could not have been more amazing and the service was just as good
One person working cash register and creating the food orders - not a great idea in my opinion
Had good chips/salsa took a few minutes to get our drinks then once we ordered food was out in maybe 15 minutes at the most
I ordered the Eggs Benedict which sounded really good with the fried potatoes
the service was fast and friendly and the server was very knowledgeable about the sauces
The staff there is incredibly friendly and they have everything you can think of including stuff you have no idea what it does
Overall everything was so well-taken care of and the staff were all very friendly and pleasant
The atmosphere was warm and intimate the service was great and the chef/owner so hospitable
What's even better is that the mini desserts are really reasonably priced so if you are looking for a dessert for someone to celebrate a birthday anniversary whatever this is a great place to go
Ruth Chris why does your food have to be so average and underwhelmingThe restaurant is very nice inside and they have a great outdoor patio for drinks when it is nice outIf you go ask for Bruce he is the best server that I can remember having for any restaurant - was exceptional and I dine out at many high end placesHaving not been to a Ruth Chris in 4 or 5 years it was time to give it another shot i remembered the food being very average and being underwhelmed by the steak which was the case again - The steaks were cooked correctly I feel their steaks are bland especially compared to other chains like MasterosThe desserts were very good and the highlight for us both the sin cake very dark chocolatey and the bread pudding with raisensWon't be going back however the location and the service are fantastic so if you do enjoy Ruth Chris steaks you will be happy here - go see Bruce and he will make sure you have a fantasic time as we did even though the food wasn't up to our level of expectation
but that's a quibble not a criticism Jim's takes me back to the days when I could sit down at the counter for lunch next to Hugh Beaumont and get an open faced roast beef sandwich for lunch served by a wise-crackin' waitress that always calls me good lookin Even if it never happened that's how I remember it Hon
Overall food was good and service was sub par
It has a very pleasant cookout atmosphere and the staff are wonderful but the bottom-line for me is that the cue is not that good
Great for dessert but not so much for dinner
Also the pizza is not bad the prices are fair the salads taste fresh and the place is bright and welcoming with comfy hotel room art and a steady flow of people getting their orders to-go perhaps to avoid my hero server
While the manager or someone did reach out via Twitter a kudos the bottom line is that the experience was so bad that no one in our group would even consider returning if it were free
The food was excellent the service was good and the space was clean
The food was good and even though I was with a large group the service was great
It is refreshing to be the recipient of some good customer service
The service was perfect friendly confident fast and everyone helped - 3 waitresses and a busboy were nearly fighting to keep our coffee full
The water bottles can be a nice touch but they need to be clean and water spot free in the bright daylight greasy fingerprints from crappy waiters man-handling them look disgusting
From the friendly staff to the euphoric aroma that overwhelms you as you walk through the doors Oreganos is a place where you immediately feel at home
We ordered the medium spice which had a nice and tang with a little heat that creeps up on us after we devoured our first piece
For appetizers we ordered the potato chips and mussels which were both good
We ordered the hummus which was a good portion and comes with spongy semi toasted bland bread
The service was friendly and timely and that seems to be the standard any time of day
Never have I seen such nice wait staff at a cafe these gals were so pleasant
The bar staff is faster if you want drinks but when you sit at the bar you also get to hear about how poorly everything is run because the bar staff Ryan will air all the dirty laundry
They play great music have good service and oh did I mention a beer tap at your table
Marginal service and marginal foodPROS the bus boy was busting his hump and doing a damn good jobCONS food was on the tail end of warm
Kinkos use to have great customer service and a variety of paper to choose from for your printing needs

The service was great and my food arrived quickly
The hostess was very friendly and the staff prompt and friendly
Everything was awesome including the service though it had a slow start in the bar
This is the third time I have dined at Province and always it is wonderful meal and great service

We ordered immediately and breakfast arrived quickly
Aside from the positive visual aesthetic the service was great
Waitress was awesome friendly and knowledgeable
After being seated we were slowly greeted by an underwhelmed lack luster waitress named carrie only to find out half way through our meal
Service was always very friendly and warm
The staff was attentive and made good suggestions
The waiter was a nerd but he was very good at his job and i liked him
The bartender was friendly and service was great
* The staff is really friendly* They offer a bunch of varieties of pho an pack the veggie pho with lots of broccoli and bokCons* It's not located in the best area of Tempe* The broth wasn't extremely flavorful definitely beef based* You get a small portion for the price of the pho
Their desserts are great too and the free cinnamon crisp-y things they give you with your bill are very tasty
The service is so warm and friendly and very accommodating to your every need
By the end of the meal we were both in a terrible mood our waitress had sucked so bad
Culinary dropout is also kind of small so we waited a while to get a table but once we ordered the food came out ridiculously fast
The food was amazing the staff was sweet and KNOWLEDGEABLE they could answer any questions and helped me even if I was being a little indecisive and the atmosphere just added the cherry on top the energy and vibe in there was just great
The service has always been excellent friendly and knowledgeable about their offerings or suggestions about what to try on the menu
I have been here several times over the past few years and other than being overpriced the food and service was always good
Anyway don't expect great service though I won't complain too loud - I guess under certain circumstances I can actually be patient
Otherwise the place is pretty nice inside - our waitress gave everyone coasters
Scores with the trifecta of great food good service and killer ambiance
The food tasted great but they totally messed up my order
Impeccable service the great atmosphere and above par noshes is what keeps me coming back
No extra plate charge no sighs just good service
Good balance of dining room to bar area great DirecTV service for games playing and loved that the owner makes the rounds throughout the place to check on everything
The staff is a young group and provided great service
The one vending machine there was out of order and the main lobby did not have a little shop that sold drinks or anything which would have been nice to have
Service has always been both friendly and speedy - just note the hours before heading over because we've stopped by on occasion and it's been closed
The service was good fast friendly and reasonably priced
The service was a little slow but I couldn't complain too much since the atmosphere was really keeping the kids happy and fascinated - giving us time to talk and actually eat
I ended up ordering another glass of wine don't remember the name and it was pretty good
I can't say enough good things about this place and that includes all the staff
I will say the staff was very friendly and understanding of the situation and waived the cancellation policy
The service was great very attentive and the atmosphere was wonderful
The food and service were good but for the prices and what you get I would intend to disagree
The prices are reasonable the food is good and the service is top notch
Pita Jungle on Apache is the kind of place I want to love art on the walls specials under $10 good location a hip vibe and an eclectic and healthy menu but due to poor service mediocre food and other better restaurants  in the vicinity I can't bring myself to recommend Pita Jungle on Apache whole heartedly if other options are available
Meat service includes 15 different types of meat here of which I tried about 8 and they were all on the decent to good range
The only downside is that the service isn't always great
My first impression was the outstanding service of the host she was exceptionally warm and friendly
The food was not good the service was bad
It was very busy because of the holiday so I expected slower service
Surprisingly the service was not very slow given how busy they were
My salad was good so if you're a fan of wedge salads order it
The service is ok/good but occasionally we had to flag our waiter down
The service was standard and the price was a bit more than we like to spend on a simple breakfast; $22 and change including tax $28 out the door including tip
And you know what it wasn't that bad if you ordered it without the overpowering garlic crust
Let's start with the bad- service is slow
I kept finding myself thinking any day now a lot during my visit for our waitress to come back to get our food to get refills and to get our check processed so beware of the slow service
they are slow but when you get the chance to see your waiter they are nice I recommend this restaurant it's A-OK
I told her that it was good and then she suggested Pumpkin Creme Brulee for Dessert
Both mornings we waited a good 10 min for anyone to take a drink order and another 10 min before we actually received our overpriced cups of coffee
I am expressing my great DISAPPOINTMENT with the service I received from The District in October 2009
And also the manager had told me and another colleague there's hardly any business on Thursday so it was great to have an organization interested in having a mixer at The District
The place was already crowded with other guests which is great for them HOWEVER the manager never tried to accommodate all our guests which they knew we were coming
As for myself I was very disappointed and had expected great service
CLOSEDQuality always-being-tweaked menu attentive staff and hands on management
Service was good and the atmosphere is comfy
We ordered the Seabass Adriatico hands-down my favorite - moist flaky filet topped with a toothsome dressing of tomatoes and basil Pork Loin with Fig Compote simply grilled lamb chops great with a squeeze of lemon and Pescatore Diabolo a fiery assortment of seafood and crushed red pepper over a tangle of fettucine
I ordered Pad See Ew which had very good flavor but very few noodles
As for the business the guy on the phone was friendly when I called to make the order and woman behind the counter when I got there was also friendly
If you are looking for great food and great service this is the place to come its like finding an oasis in the middle of a desert
Management likes to interact with their guests to ensure satisfaction with all orders which equals great customer service
I've been here several times now and the food is always delicious the wine selection is very good and the service is always terrific
The other few times I've had the slowest rudest service of my life
took her WAY too long to take orders and empty glasses were left without refill for a good 5 minutes right in front of her it was NOT crowded or very busy  she had a blank stare on her face that screamed first time working in a restaurant
The staff was attentive but not overbearing and you can seat yourself
The seating is homey small and service can be a bit slow
Good service and fast in by 9am and out by 5pm
The servers are friendly and very knowledgeable of the menu - which comes in handy when trying to decide what to order
Veggies were fresh and the service friendly
Food service was quick and service was great
We were seated right away in a nice booth and our waiter was very nice and clean cut
Whole Food is too expensive to have this low of quality and bad customer service
Our waitress was super friendly and informed
I was really impressed by his service throughout the meal but that was really above and beyond good service
I'm kind of disappointed that they either have staffing problems or just like taking their time because their food is quite good
On another plus the staff is very friendly and I've never had a case of bad service
Our group ordered the calimari and brushetta to start and it was good

Service was great and the decor was very fitting
I will give Kaz another try down the road but rude guests and clueless service staff are intolerable to me
She is professional and her staff are extremely friendly and well-trained
The staff is friendly and I've never been in like for more than 5 minutes
For a place that sees as much foot traffic as LGO and for as little space as they have in the market/counter area they do a great job of controlling the line and making it so you don't wait too long to order up
I was there during that odd hour in the morning when it feels like you may have missed out on prime breakfast time but it's too early to order lunch
I was fortunate to have a great wait staff on both occasions but then again the restuarant was empty
The car buying experience was great and the staff was very nice
Warm friendly service excellent food at low prices served in a very nice establishment
The friendly wait staff and welcoming hostesses are all on top of their game and even attractively well dressed
The customer service was the best I have ever seen in a fast food establishment
Many places could learn a lot by going in and experiencing this good customer service
They give you great service it's clean and nice they give you great extras and they have community family events
Don't get me wrong it was good but it wasn't the best fried chicken I've ever had and the customer service was ridiculous
The place is pretty small but cozy and the staff were so friendly
I ordered the white sangria which was good
I know that a lot of the reviews talk about the service but I thought the service was pretty good
The decor was very well done the service was attentive and the food was wonderful
Groupon brought us in and we were immediately greeted by the owner and very friendly staff
Great pizza fast service and close to home
This kind of thing I predict will be the demise of every deal-of-the-day site the company selling the deal bears no risk of having to pay refunds if the business providing the goods or services doesn't perform
I usually order the Thai Basil their signature dish and it is so good every time
And with great customer service amazing amenities and a super convenient location it's one of my favorite places to be
hard to even order different dishes when it's this good
I found the food very tasty and the service was great and entertaining
My friends were already there when I arrived but I sat down and ordered a drink that was not only very good but on the table within two minutes
We pleasantly enjoyed our second time around in a booth with beers and shared a delightful ceasar salad and the soup of the day-brocolli cheddar I can't complain about this little airport bar/resturant since their staff was so quick friendly and the food was pretty tasty
The staff is friendly and apparently the whole crew from a North Scottsdale store moved down to this spot to open it
The wait staff service was poor at both extremes -- painfully slow one moment with the server hovering over us the next
The service is always very good and fast but the food isn't that great
The service is pleasant with a casual atmosphere - the decor is nothing to write home about but when the eats are good - who cares
Wonderful for lunch nice for a casual dinner and the wait staff is generally terrific
Ambience- Pros- Modern clean Cons- dark and tables too close to each otherService-Pros- Attentive polite concern Cons- Food came out a bit too slowly maybe because of ARWFoodPros- flavorful food presented in simple yet appealing styleCons- nothing really stood outFirst course-1 meatballs with polenta - meatballs were moist and polenta had good flavoring and consistency2 prawns with beans- prawns good grill flavor seasoned well beans were also creamy and well cooked3 cheese artisinal board- good quality cheese with some fruit compoteSecond Course1 cioppino- good seafod flavor seafood- clams prawns and octopus were fresh and the tomato broth well seasoned  I add lime and chilli powder to give it a kick2 Wagu brisket- well cooked and seasoned favorite is the grilled cauliflower according to hubbyThird course dessert1 ricotta fritters- dry and boring after 1st bite average tasting 2 chocolate flan- nice presentation inside little jam jar
I'm borderline retarded and I can still wait tables and have made a good living doing so
I'm gonna rate each dish even though I didn't partake in each-Mozz Sticks good I would order these again

The service is friendly there for the most part
On one or two occasions I felt like I didn't fit into the bartender's urban scene and felt a bit uncomfortable but for the most part I've had a lot of great conversations with the staff there
We sat down at a nice leather booth and waited for our waitress
We got there and were seated right away and got Lauren as a waitress  she took great care of us
The food & service were good but they add an 18% service charge tip onto each bill for the wait staff to share
We generally tip in that percentage range for good/very good service so it wasn't an issue except that we don't like to be told what to tip
My wife and I felt pretty bad after hyping Cibo up to friends for the past couple weeks only to be treated fairly strangely and shabbily by our waiter
Read Nader A's review for the full story but the gist of it is there was a rude miscommunication on the waiter's part and he was so steadfast attitude about not admitting his mistake that it cost him any additional tip he might have received
Service is a little slow just because there are only 2 of them but it never seems to matter because the food is always great and served to you with a big smile
Wine service here was attentive and table service was just as accommodating with our wishy washy group
This is just a fancyoverpriced rude staffed store that won't give you the time of day unless you're dressed in your very best Gucci
|To make a long story short too late I know after 8 hours in a torture chamber filled with sales managers closers and finance guys I drove off in my bone stock Wrangler SE at a payment of $383 and a really bad headache
Servings are large service is always pretty attentive and they are fine with substitutions
I did not find the chicken good at all service was slow and the plates came out one at a time minutes apart
Great prices and I did shop around  but most importantly great service and attitude
The tomato gin soup is crazy good and if they happen to have the cold sweet corn salad as a side dish don't think twice before ordering that
Desserts are also good as you'd expect from a place that lists them first on the menu
Service is always terrific and the atmosphere is very nice think Houston's
I'm am thrilled to find a locally owned shop with great GREAT customer service
The staff was really nice but considering how dead the place was it took a really long time to get our food and the waitress forgot to put my friend's salad order in so it arrived with the main courses
The waitress we had was VERY friendly and accomodating too
The service is fast friendly and the prices are great- especially knowing that their portions are typically huge
The waitresses are good sports and know how to be nice to the mature crowd as well as families and bikers

The staff is friendly and always fill up my cherry coke coke with cherry syrup AND extra cherries

So our waitress at Durants told us that this is another good spot to try
The owner and staff are great  and always accommodating
My second time there I ordered the kung pao chicken which was good but the soup of the day wasn't all that great
Very fresh colorful presentation great tea great service nice atmosphere
This was the last thing I was going to order and now I know I'm going to have a hard time ordering next time cause I know how good this dish is
A little pricey for a hot dog fries and a drink but the quality is great service is good and the place is very clean
and most of all with a very nice view to the phoenix area The service is definitely top-notch and food was excellence as well
While this has nothing to do with Chicahrrones its fried Manchengo cheese and is really good but extremely rich which our waitress  did warn us about
The staff was great & they kept checking to make sure we had everything we needed which is great b/c sometimes when you are outside it can be easy to be ignored
Although I will say that the service was awesome the good ends there
This was a bit of a disappointment because we would've taken advantage of the included extras breakfast omelets dessert and cocktail hours
The service at Roy's was second to none though at the Blue Sage it took them a good five to ten minutes to clean out table top and bring us drink orders
The wait for a table was a LONG one but when we were finally seated the waiter who served us at breakfast was pretty friendly and with a NY accent you could cut with a knife - music to our ears
Service was great with plenty of attention without being annoying
However the staff is nice at this location
I called to order take out on my lunch break and sure enough by the time I got there my food was waiting and was nice and hot which seems like a tall order for most take out
My husband and I attended the grand opening free breakfast and loved the ambience of the PEOPLE who staff 'our' local store
The staff is very friendly and they bring your drinks out to you
My only complaint about the Scottsdale location is the waitstaff they are all plesant but I find them to be slow on service refilling drinks clearing plates etc the Glendale location has a much friendlier outgoing staff
The waiter was so friendly and incredibly patient with me as I could not make up my mind and was ready to order three or four different items
Good food great service and lots of gluten free options
It was good but small so we ordered another to split between the 4 of us
The service is ok nothing bad and nothing over the top

I look forward to trying other things here also especially the lasagna and all the staff are super friendly
$78 for two before tip we had great service
We both ordered coffee which we agreed was really good
We both thought the service was great and liked the atmosphere of the place

The desserts look great but I'm  never overly impressed when I get one
The service is always very helpful and nice

The AB was the usual 2 eggs toast & 1 side- I had the hash browns for my side although the waitress recommended the beans instead as they would make me scoot down the highway faster
Between everyone's mediocre food and our terrible/rude/impatient service we will not be going back
It has a great selection and seems to staff people who actually do crafts
Since I was going there every day I noticed quite a few things~ the friendly staff regardless of the hour or time of day the diligence in keeping the health club 100% clean without feeling intrusive and everyone I came across was a pleasure
Great staff great decor and atmosphere very reasonable prices convenient and fast service
First of all the service was extremely helpful and attentive
Apparently the beers though were very good and the next round that's what everyone ordered
Though I feel tragically uncool in my saturday afternoon bestwhich may as well be pajamas I bravely step up to the counter say hello to the nice girls and order my delicious sandwich
The waitress was also extremely friendly when we were checking out we asked how to pronounce the name of the restaurant and she started teaching us some Spanish
Cutie waiters might be a good place to look
Although the food is still very good I love the grilled artichokes French dip sandwich and baby back ribs the service has gone downhill
The service was so slow but the woman was nice and offered dessert because one of our members is a long-time customer
Our waitress was very nice but didn't hover
I will say the food for that was great service was top notch and the coffee cake was so unbelievably good
I cannot say enough nice things about the staff here
The AZ Regional Manager is rude and completely uncooperative
Seriously you have good food; please back it up with some basic customer service and humility
The service was bad that night but I don't blame them they were packed and we weren't eating
Went inside on Saturday morning and ordered the Country Breakfast burrito
Everything seemed freshly made to order and the ingredients all tasted nice
Fast forward to Santa Clarita CA where we ordered and they brought the wrong dish
As mentioned by others the service was a bit slow and for those of used to old-school sushi places where they just place fish on a plate the presentation was fussy
Anyhoo whether you bring your own polish or not this place is great priced very reasonably conveniently located and has great service
If/when I try their eyebrow waxing service I will update my rating---could be a 5 star-er if they do a good job with my brows
Again the service was nice but you might want to bring your own sushi if you're going to eat here
And dagnabbit sometimes you just NEED to have a triple order of fresh hash browns in the middle of the nightMay be a little bit too brightly lit for my tastes especially in the wee smalls but the food is consistent and the service alway polite and attentive without being pushyOh btw always make sure you tip a little extra to the good peeps working the overnight shift   ;
So go online reserve it - they'll send you an email when it's available and it'll be waiting on the shelf for you when you get there-you can have up to 50 items out at a time used to be 10 at a time for CDs and DVDs but not anymore-parking there's always plenty of spots available and it's covered particularly important during the hot summer months-free internet-super friendly service
too bad the service almost gave them an aneurysm
The staff was nice and the crowd was was laid back
Service is always attentive even if you sit in the bar area which makes that a nice option when it's a 45 minute wait
The drinks are good and their desserts are tasty and well priced
It was awesome that they were open for one and the food and service were very good
The pulled pork is excellent the sides are even better and the service is always friendly
We were clearly there for happy hour on a Wednesday night which I do love goes until 630pm but found it a little rude that the waitress came by six minutes after the mark to ask if we wanted a second round
Ambiance and service are good - not great
One star is for the nice service and the other star is for being a local chain
The worst thing about it was the wait staff wasn't very attentive and didn't do much except refill the cups when they noticed they were low which wasn't very often
The dim sum was plentiful and there was a lot of variety - however unless you watch for the carts that just came out of the kitchen and only order off that one there's a good chance you'll get lukewarm or cold food
Not only do they preform top-notch weekly service sweeping clearing the baskets and making sure the chemicals are right but they are great at communicating
Great service and a new take on fresh local food plus a little cocktail lounge on the weekends when there is a long wait for a table
I ordered the half sandwich and chicken and corn chowder it was so good but I couldn't finish it because it was so filling but not in a heavy greasy way - just very satisfied with a delicious meal
nice decor and the staff was pleasant and had great suggestions
I had thought that all the ___berto's were the same and having been to Filiberto's once getting my order wrong cold and dealing with the stench that was clouded around it gave my past self a bad image of all taco shops but every day I would pass I would see Poliberto's full of people at all hours
The service for me is usually speedy and most days friendly although sometimes the person at the front seems to not want to be there
Rebecca was just what you would expect the staff at Durant's to be knowledgeable genuinely friendly unobtrusive and unflappable
Service is friendly and they have a decent variety of subs
We had a really friendly server and we ordered our meals right away
All in all great food and great service
The beer is cold the staff attentive & the Paddy Melt good
So I got the restraining order quashed and headed out to Sonora Mesquite for some of the best food I've had and I've had some good stuff believe you me
Bad service  bad food  small portions of over priced bad food
The service however is really friendly
Bartender/Manager Brian has a great attitude and works hard
For coffe lovers- try the Viet coffee - it's brew French style = Do not come to Da Vu00e0ng expecting a clean restaurant and good service- because you will be very disappointed
So at first the service seemed great the staff seemed friendly and we were having a great time
We ordered one express lunch which is a great deal - half salad/soup with 1 pizza that's approx

We went on a Saturday night around 7 pm and it was not that busy at all beautiful decor and a very romantic setting For those who were complaining about the lighting they might want to get their eyes checked it was fine The menu offered a number of tasty meals I had a flat iron steak and my boyfriend has the roasted chicken with gnocchi it was amazing  We sampled some different wines and had a great waiter Frankie he was very good never let our glasses go empty and had lots of recommendations for us we can't wait to return again
While there was a huge line and they were definately working very hard and on a sunny spring day - the service was extremely friendly

PROS Early hours as early as 6am great doctor nice staffCONS The Owner will not let her doctor's take self pay patients
Friendly cheerful service despite being crazy busy on a Friday night
I ordered the meatloaf not really sure why but it was pretty good but a little heavy on the onions
They had a great time and the waitress gave one of her friends training wheel chopsticks and a fork when she wasn't keeping up with the others
They are a small restaurant that sometimes gets overwhelmed by its own popularity so we have had slow service while trying to handle a big rush
The service isn't that great unless you sit at the bar so if there are open spots by the bartender grab them
one of my friends had been here before and been served by her and remembered the waitress had badmouthed/talked about her and her dining group to a nearby table
The staff was friendly and the service they provided was top notchUpon leaving the owner took the time to show us their next door dining area that opens at 4pm
The waitress was extremely attentive and was nice enough to remind us that the kitchen does eventually close so we should probably order
He was pretty helpful in helping us order since they had so many good looking things on the menu
It's never been very busy when I've gone so the wait staff has been very attentive
Every time I go back I check to see if it's been added to the menu and in fact the first time I ordered the crispy spicy pork that's what I thought I was getting it was deep-fried spicy pork bites -- delicious but not cooked in sauce like the entree currently on the menu which is great in its own right
I've only been a handful of times and not on the weekend but got great service
Other than that I enjoy going there for coffee food and friendly staff
Service a bit wonky but we still had a great time
Fry's may offer good prices but you can't put a price tag on good customer service
Great way to end a meal without gorging on a big dessert
First off It's a very relaxed atmosphere and the customer service is great
They offer breakfast lunch & dessert crepes & they are Delicious
Dessert was good I just wish that they created ones that were a little more complex in taste like the rest of the menu
Hey it's not much to look at but the owner is super cool and the pressing by her staff is very good
Anyway the waiter was friendly and the food drinks and refills were delivered rather quickly
I would definitely dine here again because the food is excellent reasonably priced friendly service and most importantly
Interestingly this store has some self service checkout lines but for some reason I find it to be slow
Smaller portion probably not a meal for most but it was so good I would order it again
Our waiter was very attentive answered all our questions about the menu and made some great suggestions
~Decor * * * * * note the striking array of chairs and seating along w/ additional patio seating make for optimal outside and inside digs~Pricing * * * * * nothing here is expensive and considering the quality of the product sold very economical~Service * * * * * the barristas are helpful friendly and good natured perfectly willing to explain the menu and offer tips advice please tip them
i've always liked ihop as a kid but now that im older i watch where my dollar goes and when i have poor service im not giving up my dollar to anybody with that said we entered this IHOP we were seated rather quick by the host our waitress came once asked about our drinks we never saw her again this was early sunday so myself and my family promptly get up and exit no one attempts to ask what's wrong the host was really the only one concerned but made no comment in fact she kinda looked as if that happened before this is not good IHOP
BUT you know when the FOOD is GOOD when you are asking the waiter for more bread to scoop up the remains of the sauce on the plate
If the great service and prices aren't enough it is located right down the street from home
Back to the restaurant at hand  the problem with Aiello's is not the food which is remarkably good for the price and it's not the service which is fine
WoW what a mistake I forgot how damn quick the service was & how GOOD the food was
You go up to order at the counter there's a salsa bar in the corner with a LOT of different salsas most are not that great
All in all its kind of uncomfortable service/restaurant wise self serve but the tacos are very good and you do get chips and a variety of salsas
Not the most friendly staff and the cost is kind of high for a place like this but its pretty dang good
I'm sorry but there is just no excuse for bad customer service
Other than that expect tasty food and great service
Two words Classic Elegance It is so nice to sit in a restaurant and have a fully trained staff wait on you
It took a bit of time for us to get our server but in general the service was a bit on the slow side
Service can be rude but I don't expect hearts flowers and puppies in places like this
The service and food are consistenly good

I ordered the potato and bacon soup that was really good though I have to say it didn't look appetizing
mmmService is hit or miss at this location but never so bad that we haven't wanted to return
They were doing some sort of major cleanse thank goodness- they needed to get rid of that stinky stale smell and we got to witness and experience the personalities of some of the other staff
They have the Big Ten Network the service is pretty good and they can make a mean salad- I'd return if the need arose
The atmosphere and staff are really great here
I really mean that the staff is hard at work under the supervision of Chef Eric who leads the crew through its paces on a busy night the friendly nature of the staff adds to the ambience we felt a though we are in the front row of a show watching intently as our meals were prepared before us
He's the only person working here we met who gave a damn about good service
All staff were efficient friendly courteous
We ordered the stuffed deep dish Numero-One-O pizza and honestly although it was good it was just TOO MUCH CHEESE

The staff was very friendly the whole time including when we walked out of the theatre
Second service was amazingly slow though I get the impression it was an off day
The staff was friendly but I've seriously never waited so long to order or receive my food
One point for friendly bar staff on the non-music side
I will NEVER go there again and am shocked and disappointed at how rude and unprofessional all of the staff was especially the manager
A couple in our group ordered the deviled eggs with caviar and they weren't extraordinary but fairly good nonetheless
From the list person to the drink people to the waitress and every other employee we encountered there are SEVERAL or all the cute boys looked the same don't know which one all were pleasant nice helpful
we got the O'Riva Pizza - large to take home leftovers and it was good - not a traditional pizza at all and probably not the best pizza i've ever had but would i go back definitley would i order the same pizza you bet
They are kid friendly laid back and have just the best service
The staff is always friendly and helpful

He did a great job & gave us great service

Food can be great at times but can also disappoint depending on what you order
Service is usually quite attentive and last night was no exception
Our very friendly waitress came over right away and offered some advice on the menu
The server was attentive and quick to return to check on us and take our order
The wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable if not a little inattentive but that could have been me as I was there by myself so it may have just seemed that way
Our waitress was great at refilling our glasses and being available
Although they looked at us like we were crazy when we wanted to order off the menu at 1115am it was a great experience
The definition of bad training and customer service
Justly famous for their good food and friendly service
took about 30mins take our orders another 40mins to get our food and a good 45mins just to give us our checks
short version come for ambiance at the risk of incredibly slow service
The freshness of all the other ingredients and the great customer service just put this local chain over the top
I am not even a dessert guy but the warm brownie squares gelato ice cream and chocolate sauce is just too good to resist
Great food great prices and great service
The staff here was amazingly friendly and welcoming
To top it all off the staff is emotionless and bordering on rude
5 to 4 stars but the service was great so I bumped the review up
As far as the fries go I must have been there at a bad time because I ordered a large fry and it wasn't even as many fries as a large fry from McDonald's
Pretty decent bar staff and generally great service
Beer is plentiful and cold service quick and attentive and bonus a check in discount for Yelpers when we visited
Back then the waiters were surly the food was good and the 99 cent margaritas would knock you on your tukus
99 but you'll still get the same great food and the same surly service
It's been my experience that if it's a slow night and you have a female server then your service will be top notch
The decore is a nice 50's diner type with very friendly staff
I always order a wrap and my favorite would be The Big Daddy egg cheese potato but I have never had a bad experience
Will be back soon the service was great as well
Tried this place out recently and had a great experience partially because of the great service we received
I know you can't really base an opinion off an oil change but being in customer service and being able to read people I got a good vibe from Gene and his crew
He was due for a bath and the staff here were very good about explaining all the features of their u-wash area
The staff were once again very attentive and repeatedly checked to see if we needed anything else during our wash/dry drill
From the moment the reservation was made the staff were courteous friendly and helpful
All in all great experience except the very slow service
well I will start out by saying  I am a whole lot of biased against breakfast food so my review is based off the BLT I ordered
But the ambience is nice and the staff is friendly
The service was a little slow at first but I think that was because the server was tied up with another group
We ate here a year ago and haven't been back since because the service and food was so bad
Initially I was going to give this 2 stars for the bad service but then our food arrived
Just had an excellent dinner here the other night - we had great service on a very busy night the Final Four games were on too
5 stars but I rounded up because of the great service friendly staff and enjoyable ambiance
Anyway no trace of attitude this time just good service and excellent food
Our waitress was very nice and we even used the $5 off yelp check in coupon
We have been going here for several years and every time the only thing consistent is the rude staff behind the front desk

While the teeny bopper staff were not the most helpful or friendly I found what I needed
GOOD  With all the times that I have stayed here their service was always wonderful
The staff is really friendly and seem to really enjoy their jobs
Our table service was friendly as well but on the slow side
not for me =  Anyways karaoke room at half off with some free apps and a server that handled my group's orders and with all day hh going on and 2 hours of fun and bad singing = hella good fun
I ordered the Bento B and it wasn't too bad
consistent food consistently good service a decent wine list and a feeling of occassion
We had a great waiter who was very knowledgeable and helpful
Such a nice change from other restaurants where the servers don't seem to care about their customers one bit The server immediately sent the Manager over to open our coupon
The service was good our waiter was very sociable and had many suggestions
I usually get dragged to a yogurt dessert after eating ridiculously large meals so thank goodness it's lower in fat
Waitress was quite attentive but maybe that's because I was alone and she felt sorry for me
The manager Tim came to check on us a few times which we thought it was really nice
I called customer service and they were GREAT
THANK YOU for great brownies and great customer service
I can't say enough good things about the staff at Crosswinds and my 3 other kitties will be lifelong patients there
-Looks like a fast-food tex-mex place but it is a casual sit-down full service restaurant
Still 5 stars for Souvia Tea excellant selection helpful friendly staff and extremely tasty
Great personal service when we checked in
The service pre-judged my table of college students and didn't make that extra effort for the great tips me the boys usually dish out
The staff is genuinely nice and care about the animals and owners
The staff is always extremely friendly and accommodating
Yes I will admit the service is slow but if you go with a group of people you will hardly notice - Being that I'm a SoCal girl I naturally have to compare Lolo's to Roscoe's and might I dare say that they are almost equal in my book
The staff was friendly and the food was quickly prepared and hot when we drove it home
The staff can always offer a good suggestion if you are willing to try something new to drink
The english pub interior/intimacy and the staff are great
It is one of those places where the pub is a perfect setting for good friends to catch up and have a drink; they the staff don't try to entertain you that is left up to you which to me is a good thing
The service is usually good but the last time I was there the server was terrible
I can deal with bad service when the wait staff is new
Service was also great; the bartender checked on me several times
The complimentary duck fat fries eliminate the need to order appetizers-The beignets I had for dessert were good but not mind-blowing
We had great service from that point on
This was about a month ago we stayed The staff was ever so friendly and always there to help
The answer is yes i am going back to try some other stuff on their menu the service was quick and the waitresses were nice the food was good especially the juices and the atmosphere was whatever
The staff has always been really nice and helpful
While this family-run restaurant is not going to blow you away with its beauty or ambiance you will keep coming back for the food and the friendly staff
The price is great for the awesome amount of food you get one order is usually two dinners for me sometimes more
Sever was nice enough to admit that he told his group to go in take orders and bust food ASAP so they can leave for the night
With plenty of seating around the bar we were immediately approached by a friendly waitress who had our drinks back to us lickety-split
We got a nice booth inside and had another friendly waiter who brought us samples of the house Sangria which I also ordered
The atmosphere is nice great friendly staff and good food
The decor is funky love the chandeliers the wait staff is friendly and fun and I love the outdoor seating area
The waitstaff are always attentive and friendly have answered questions I didn't even ask thank you psychic bathroom directions buddy
This is a true east coast deli with lots of choices and a great staff
So overall it not bad as everyone was super nice but not the best service I have ever received
This buffet doesn't offer as many food choices as those of Pancho's or Camarones but the food the service & the price are all good & it's a comfortable place
The inside was clean and the staff was friendly
Great coffee not so great customer service
Considering that this is basically a stationary food truck I would expect numbers being shouted and food flying out the door fast and hectic rather than piles of customers standing around waiting for their orders to roll out one by one every few minutes
The food was OK service was great but I won't bring my friends here
I give it two stars because my waitress was really nice
It was good but the bun or something added way too much sweetness it almost seemed like a dessert
I'm pretty sure I've had the same waiter everytime I've been there and he's always been great
One woman responded to my dad's and my attempts to get the attention of the staff and was kind enough to let us in and order some much-needed artery-clogging goodness
SUMMARY Service was excellent staff are all friendly and quality people
but our last trip to the Orange Table was remarkably bad as far as service is concerned
as was our cream soda; but the highlight of this visit without a doubt the fact that our waiter is a glorified Youtube/Reality TV star well not in a good way
But the service is friendly and the atmosphere is homey
-*  The service was friendly & attentive
Their staff seems to have a high turn-over rate with the exception of a couple great food servers
For an entree I ordered the VigAssBurger and it was very good
Our waitress was also very speedy and friendly which is very odd for a very busy night
Our service was great although I did feel as if our server was a bit of a beer snob and talked down to us until he realized that we knew our stuff too
The staff is friendly and the aromas in the air is pleasant
Being a Dessert Diva I would say it was a nice way to end the meal
Everyone was so nice from the nice young man who seated us to the two or three waitresses that alternately handled our table one took our order two refilled our coffee another took our bill
When our waitress asked if she could get us anything else I said another Matt's Big Breakfast
Great atmosphere great chips/salsa great 'bulk' food service
great service when we sat at the bar last month
Friendly service with knowledgeable waiters
Our waiter was very friendly- if he was unable to answer one of our questions he promptly found the answers for us
While the food is good the service decor and organization are somewhat disjointed
Though it pains me to say it service is slow
Service slow - We're talking AGES here
And if you expect bad service maybe you will have a great time
The buffet is the only way to go here because the meals are overpriced and  portions are small  Now the service is horrible inattentive at best  I don't feel welcomed and the servers I have had were flippant and the last time argued with us regarding the tea we were served tea that was old but he insisted it was fine
So if you are just looking for some good indian buffet with out service not a bad place
The service was also great I had just finished a spin class and was drinking water faster than a elephant however my glass never went lower than 1/3 even after 10 refills
The food and drink were great the service a little spotty especially since there weren't that many people in there
The young staff was friendly and helpful in taking your order and money
The service was pretty fast like under 5 minutes for two pulled pork sandwiches 1 side of beans and 1 side on mac n cheese
The place looks great and the staff is great I wouldn't dismiss it but Republic doesn't get a fervent recommendation either
We ordered the cheese pizza which is a really inexpensive but delicious tasting Margarita pizza sooo good
The service has been bad 9 out of 10 times
The saving grace though is there's one waiter who's always really good and will do it for us no problem
The waiter was nice enough to leave one menu behind incase we wanted more food I didn't see the front page of the menu until I was about half-way done with my wine
Two thumbs up for good service good food good location cleanliness and an all around good experience
I couldnt believe the complete lack of service courtesy and the outright  rude employee who needs a serious training course on customer service
The atmosphere here is very nice and the waiters & waitresses and super friendly and attentive
I thought the food was quite good although the portions were a bit small even though I did not order for the small plates menu
The service was very friendly and attentive not overly attentive
My husband is a private chef and dined along with another great friend of mine who is the General Manager at 5th and Wine a few blocks away
The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is welcoming but the ordering system is confusing and needlessly complicated
The food is delicious the service is friendly and the portions are pretty large
The staff here is very good too they are super helpful if you aren't sure what you want get things out quickly if its not packed check in on you rare for a counter order place and they are just good all around
Someone ordered the halibut which would have been my second choice and it was a great piece of fish
I can usually find something good no matter how nasty or base a buffet or made-to-order
There have been a few negatives  The food is a bit pricey for what you get and we have experienced slow & somewhat sullen wait service on occasion
Two of us also shared the ribeye steak 14 oz medium rare was done great along with some sauteed green beans and fingerling potatoes and our waiter was really nice to split the plate for us
He missed me ordering their below average breakfast selections and less than okay coffee so as lunch was nearing he asked that I please move to smaller table the place was not busy
The food at Pita Jungle is really good but the service at the 2 locations I have been at is always the same horrible
I don't typically order calamari because everyone seems to have a version of it and it's usually not very good
I get annoyed with bad service far more than I get annoyed by bad food
Also the waitress was friendly and helpful when choosing off the menu
I say Gilbert is your strongest location in Metro Phoenix and Uptown Phoenix is your weakest bad parking/not as friendly wait staff but as a team you're hitting above
Interesting desserts and juice/teas and great lunch specials
We ended up ordering the deviled egg appetizer as i had heard it was really good
The staff while certainly not rude was missing something
While the area itself was great the service wasn't
Simplify the drink prices tell the staff to work a little faster and get that extra stairwell up pronto
didn't really even register with me that this place is kid friendlyI usually sit at the bar or the bar area and drink their lovely fishbowl Dos Equis until I get hungry enough to order their wings or hummus platter
Our waitress I think her name was Kelly was knowledgeable and friendly
What isn't cliched are the authentic homemade pastas and attentive service
If anything great for a 1st date because if you have a lull in conversation you can bond over the surprisingly bad service
My fiance ordered a burger which looked really good
I ordered the Extra Hot because I think I'm a badass with an iron stomach
Service was good margaritas were great
I ordered a salad and apparently their lettuce wasn't looking too good to serve; so the manager came down and apologized for the situation
Big time bonus points for the guy at the counter who took my order talked to me about the Creature From the Black Lagoon and was in general very nice
Not the quickest service all the time and can get busy during lunch but always consistently good
This is a great local business whose owners care about making fresh flavorful and thoughtful ice creams and other desserts
Service was awesome and the restaurant looked nice and clean but probably will not go back again
Sushi was fresh and great tasting service was kinda slow but it was a very busy Friday lunch rush
Dinner was a little pricey but for the great quality of food and service I'd say that it was worth it
I would never order a souffle at Mickey D's and eating sushi out of a fast food container just seems
I have to deduct a point for service though the last 2 times we dined here it seemed to take forever to get drinks and the servers aren't very good at explaining dishes nor are they personable
I don't think it's worth a trip from somewhere far away there are great coffee houses all over the valley but if you're downtown I would go in and order a drink
Still service was relatively fast and friendly so if I worked nearby I can see how this could be an alright spot to keep on one's lunch circuit
All of the staff was fantastic  very friendly and helpful
The fun vintage atmosphere combined with an excellent wait staff good mix of cocktails and a great fairly diverse menu makes this place a 5 star in my books
Great Value Great Food Great Service = Zero Complaints
The customer service guy was super nice and gave her an extra $5 for her trouble in the refund of the difference and called to have the set brought up
The staff at Firesky are all so nice I know it's a hotel and that is just the way they are supposed to be but this felt like genuine nice-ness
I'd give this place a 1-star but I kind of liked the sandwich and the staff was friendly
I rolled in solo to this nice little place just after sundown and ordered the Machacha Taco duo with flour tortillas
I wouldn't say the food here was super excellent this is Arizona after all and there are some great Mexican places but it was good and the prices were reasonable and the service was prompt and cheerful
Also the sides are huge and really good mashed potatoes broccoli and spinach with garlic is what we had ordered
Other than those two things the staff was friendly enough so I wouldn't hesitate to go back
good cheese and fresh mushrooms and olives so I would order pizza here again IF they have a thinner crust option

I am pretty reasonable and it it were my place I would accommodate customers more so if a person who prepaid it would make sense you accommodate them with a reservation however Binkleys stance is we have your cash now let's fill the place with people who are yet to pay and the idiots who prepay can wait till lastThis place may have great food but great management with a ficus on service and customers

Service my wife and I received was so bad that I decided to pay the $200 cancellation fee JUST to get away from them
Both times my wife and I went in we were forced to wait around and both times and was rudely greeted and helped by the manager
I have also found the service to be no worse than good
get the iced green tea - apparently it's much popular than their regular tea - it was quite nice there were several refills to be had through the course of the mealwe ordered 3 of the large pizzas to share between four people it looks like all of their pizzas are thin crust - yukon gold potato funghi and the Salsiccia the sausage one apparently with Schreiner's sausage which is a local sausage placepotato pizza 2 - it was okay for my first potato pizza - the potato slices it was very thinly sliced and it was more leeky than potato-y which was a little disappointingfunghi 3 - the mushrooms had a very strong taste but not like a shiitake mushroom it was a surprisingly nice flavorsalsiccia 3

The service was great a beautiful African women and she was such a sweetheart
The food and service were good but not excellent

Our waitress there I regret not getting her name was superb and nice
It was a very pleasant experience from the food to the nice and friendly staff
My other friend who had a walker had a lot of trouble maneuvering in and out of the tight table the put us at near the front and though the staff was trying to be nice they didn't know how to deal with it

The wait staff is very good at garnering the up-sale they were very friendly and professional

Finally one person got the Kobe bone in rib the half order with the blue cheese grits now that came out hot and it was good - so at this point - because of the slower than expected service from the primary waiter and the fact that the main dish was blah - the overall agreement by my group of five mixed group men and women was a solid 3 stars though if you just came for cocktails and appetizers and they have a good list of starters then we would rate it a solid 4 starts with 5 star potentials if they work on the operational workflow of the kitchen to get the food out hot
It's great and all that you're encouraging your staff with incentives but as a customer knowing that policy
I think it's a great corner but it's a turn off when I'm told that I cannot have the choice to sit there because it's the manager's discretion

The gentleman who serves as waiter is just great friendly happy and very helpful
Update Went for dinner this time and the service wasn't near as good prices were much higher than food value and as such it wasn't worth the bill price
We know now that you should order the specials those are generally good deals and come at lunch
Along with great food it is a family owned customer service experience
well it was when I was there3 the service was pretty good considering how swamped it was and I told the nice server I was in a hurry and she was able to take my order from soup to nuts in maybe 10 minutes even though their credit card machine was down4 I ordered a gyro and their orzo pasta salad the gyro was mediocre and bland but the pasta was wonderfulI will definitely try Carly's again when I am not rushed the interior is hipster funky low key and the staff was very friendly

As mentioned in just about every review the staff is incredibly friendly and always willing to make a recommendation if you ask
2 Bad service - Honestly I think their service is great but people need to understand one simple fact much of the staff speaks very limited English
I would have hoped that a restaurant manager would realize that the few customers they may have at a slow time are just as important as those on a Friday night rush - standards are standards you either have them or you don't

I originally found about El Tlacoyo Located on the West-Mesa/Tempe border from a good friend many years ago who spoke fluent Spanish learned while serving as a missionary in Mexico
How they break the mold Incredibly friendly staff and regulars
The staff were quick with recommendations and never left us hanging and the atmosphere made for a great dining experience
However the price seems much more justified when everything is so FR-FR-FRESH and the staff is so attentive
I have talked with many others with the same experiences slow service and great soups so I am relieved to find that my often obligatory second visit may be skipped in this particular scenario

The service was ok - nothing great - we had a table of 6 and it was the tail end of lunch so the place wasn't busy
the main complaint is that we were having a discussion about a friends dislike of eggs - when the waitress chimmed in and said yeah I hate eggs - maybe because i work in a breakfast place and I know what happens with eggs
All in all great food GREAT PRICES and great service
The service was good and the food was outstanding
little birds chirrping around the trees and a nice waitress
You get the preprogramed Have a good work out when you check in and the have a nice day when you leave but I'm not sure any of the staff speaks any other English words other than those phrases because that's all I ever hear them say
I admit it was extremely good and while I would have a difficult time ordering it myself if it's put in front of me I'm sure I would eat it again
Next time we'll save room for dessert because the gelatos looked great
The nice girl at the counter helped me order something which turned out to be a Peach and Mango Smoothie w/ Boba

The service was tense frantic and way too slow for an urban work lunch - we were there for just under 2 hours

Drinks are good and service is excellent especially if you are ordering food
Their waitresses seemed snooty but it seems like a nice cozy place to go with a small group of friends for intimate conversations
Aside from a few missteps the salad debacle and our waiter being fairly inattentive you can make one heck of a delicious burger here for a totally reasonable price
The only reason for the 4 stars was the slow service and they were kind of rude about it
We did grab a quick meal at Trattoria del Piero which has an impressive menu and serves local organic food / drinks all day long including casual breakfast and lunch and more of a full service restaurant in the evenings for dinner

The service used to be awesome but now it is inattentive and sloppy
We were surprised when we asked the waitress who was super nice what was good she said Not the waffles
Service is good but they could use another register during lunch hour as the line extends outside of the restaurant during lunch
They were so good that we ordered 'to-go' order for the dumplings
They are very friendly here and willing to accommodate your food order to your liking
The service which was amazingly good when they first opened has also slipped and we found ourselves feeling somewhat neglected at times with a forgetful waiter
I ordered one of the early bird specials a small NY with a cheese enchilada and thought it was pretty good - but at $9
it really did used to be great food with great service but this last time it really was just decent food with acceptable service
The price points are good and the service is friendly
I ordered wine and they didn't offer to let me taste it first just poured it into my glass and walked away luckily for me it was good tasting
But if you know what good pizza is supposed to look and taste like and you appreciate service that keeps your drink full the whole time stop by and order a pie
But nothing against the place itself because they had great service and were genuinely friendly
I know this restaurant can make pretty good New Mexican food but something has changed at this store - either the manager is cutting corners by saving money on spices or she is just incompetent because this place is capable of better service and better food I just haven't seen it in a long time
The customer service has always been great as well
Just accept it and the slow service as part of the experience - don't worry be happy
The only reason I didn't give it a five star is that sometimes the service can be a little slow and make sure you tell them you like the sake hot
But at Ace you've got good service easy parking no lineups and competitive prices so why not support the underdog once in a while
I basically order the same thing at every breakfast restaurant I go to it makes it really easy to form an opinion
The service is fast friendly enough the food is cheap and tastes great if you are looking for a traditional diner breakfast
As far as the Service it wasn't that great but l i'll give them the benefit of the doubt since its new and they have Teens working up front
everything was very clean and service was extra friendly and quick
Our friendly waitress brought us our bento box and I was surprised at the size and variety of side items
It is easy to navigate and the staff is unbelievably helpful and friendly
maybe he would've been a better server if the apparent drugs he was on weren't a factor and when we confronted the manager she was rude and obviously didn't care that this staff sucks
First visit last weekend Saturday night/late dinner place was almost full got in and seated quickly staff was friendly and helpful
The good Great service nice decor in the seating area very colorful n peppy place okay food
The staff was friendly and I was quite impressed
For breakfast I ordered a breakfast burrito with six toppings on it; sausage cheddar cheese jalapenos ham onions and peppers
The service is great and the atmosphere is quiet a bit dark so no one should be sitting at the table with sunglasses because that would just be creepy
The waitress had labile mood and was very rude
You must try this very strange combo that is surprisingly so good and cooked to order
It was nice to see staff party heros actually working instead of standing around talking to each other loudly and unprofessionally
OMG this place has the rudest staff I've ever encountered
Long story longer the manager arrives to talk with us about this no-so-nice experience
Plus the staff are super nice and are willing to explain anything or set you up with a sample to try new things
The service is awesome and it's a great place to chill among good friends and good drinks
I guess most people aren't there for the band so whatever The bar staff was just ok until you tipped them nicely and then the service was bumped up a notch I'm guessing they aren't usually tipped well
Their food is good not the most amazing but they have big servings and the service is always good
Room service is a bit ridiculous add a 20 percent gratuity AND the food was not so great
Between the friendly and stylish staff the people the stung lights on the patio and the wooden benches surrounded by catci pots they nailed it
Service was good consistent with the fellow CBs I've been to across the country and food hit the spot
This place is beautiful the staff is happy always a good sign
Definitely a good spot to go for dessert maybe after a first date
I sat at the bar and would say that the staff was very helpful and friendly

The biblical verses on the walls were a bit much for me but if that's what it takes to run a pleasant fast food restaurant then so be it - I'd definitely go back for frozen  custard - if you're a frozen dessert fan you'll be impressed
You would think with as many reviewers complaining about slow and disorganized service it would improve by now but wow was I wrong
Not only was the service slow this past time for lunch but the food runners confused orders and brought the wrong dish out
The staff has always been very friendly and helpful
One great thing - a full service grocery store within walking distance
The place here also has a really great little cafe upstairs and staff are located everywhere and seem to be friendly and helpful
I love the staff they are so friendly and willing to help
The cocktail waitress was great chatty recommended some great drinks I can't remember what they were but the one I had was Grey Goose Orange and raspberries
It doesn't do me any good if I'm there at 300pm and I can't get full service until 400 or 500
I ordered the quinoa salad which was actually pretty good although the dressing had waaay too much acid
Good fresh food excellent service so I was pleasantly surprised
Anyway it's just a hole in the wall but they are friendly I ordered the nachos to go and got my order fairly quickly

It was clean they got my order right however the food didn't taste as good as I remembered
The person who took my order was incredibly rude
I will definitely order from them again how can I not; they are fast inexpensive and THEY DELIVER
Perfect starter or dessert for breakfast
The wedge was good even though I ordered the dressing on the side and it didn't come that way
The service here is quite quick so it's a good option for take-out
Our waiter was very friendly and didn't mind that we were taking up a table in a very full restaurant just to share a piece of pie
The atmosphere was very nice too and next time we will go before we eat dinner and order a little more
The staff was excellent the music was great and the diverse mix of people sitting in the outdoor patio was friendly and fun
The food is good the staff is great and the beers are fantastic
but because the service was so SLOW that it took forever and a year for us to get our food
Also have a LOT of time as service is very sketchy and pretty slow
Each time I'm there the staff is unhelpful and unfriendly
The service is great and the staff which I think are the owners and immediate family are welcoming and genuine without fail
whatever but i NEVER get good service here i always get seated outside in this hidden corner
The service was friendly and the boss was helping some VERY nasty people at a table near us and trying to be accommodating as best as he could
some beef wrapped in asparagus= soo bad I took it back Spicy Tuna was over minced like mush All in all the meal was good but for 70 bucks I left hungry and pissed The waiter was soo weird and creepy
I did go back a second time and had good food and a waitress with a name with like all syllables
Lucky for the rest of us these other places also try to have good service
My boyfriend and myself have over 30 years in resturant and customer service experience and I always take a moment to compliment great service however this time  I was so incredibly disappointed that I felt it was necessary to speak out about how not only was the food FAIR but the lack of customer service was borderline pathetic
This store is very clean and orderly the sales staff was great
The decor is sort of homey and random with a dash of countrification; we were seated on the patio at our request and received good patient attentive service

Sitting at the E61 Bar is always a must -  faster service and it is fun to sit relax and talk with the Baristas

The nice thing about it was that you can order breakfast foods all day and it still tasted good
Staff is super friendly- our server forgot to deliver apps we ordered and made it right by providing free apps equal value for our next visit
I ordered a great-tasting Greek lager Marathon IIRC
I certainly don't mean this in a bad way as he was a fantastic waiter almost as enjoyable as the host who entertained us prior
We had ordered some crab puffs and they were good but they had forgotten to give us the dipping sauce which would have made them that much better
Friendly staff claimed that they modeled the place after Portillos in Chicago

Part of why I like Buffalo is the staff and good selection
I found the staff to be friendly and they answered all of our questions
The employees are great and put customer service e first for buiz
Extremely fast service they made our meals directly to order; took literally around 2 minutes
5 if I could but I'll round up for fast service
I also like that the dim sum is made to order and good -  Plus they just added noodle soup and it's as good as any place I've ever eaten at in LA or SF
The service was really great and the appetizer was great but the entrees and dessert weren't that great and then being made to feel like we were ripped off at the end
Our waiter was a great help and super nice but when I approached someone on the management staff in regards to the untidy bathroom the mans response was Don't worry about it we have someone on it
Overall the level of professionalism customer service consultation and promises that were made were great
Homemade amazingly delicious saucesFresh high quality ingredientsFast friendly serviceGreat prices and generous servingsThey have a drive through These guys know how to pack a to-go sack

Great service from a mom and pop crew who have been at this for years daily specials and fair prices make this a stop for lunch you will not regret
I loved the atmosphere the service was good and this is just a really nice alternative to all the chains restaurants around
The service and atmosphere were quite nice for an airport however
It is so good that we ordered it both nights
I would order it again because the flavor was good
The service was good especially on a Saturday night
Although it would greatly help the situation if they didn't have only one worker doing the register taking orders and delivering food from the kitchen
After I was finished the manager Mike came out to great me and check on the service so far
He was just checking on the service and ensure I had a good evening
The waitress was attentive but not intrusive
I find the staff friendly the environment comfy with all of it's earth tones and an overall awesome little place to go when you want something hearty
But the atmosphere is great I've never been to a Potbelly's anywhere in Illinois and I've been to many that did not have the kindest and most reliable customer service
The waiter was friendly and a lil bit of a smartass which was actually really refreshing and really nice but MAN he was WAY off his game
If I have to pay over $60 a head the service better be fucking great
It's really unfortunate for them as my whole family has since moved on most of us to Dr Gail Bass who is equally fabulous and whose staff is friendly professional and efficient
The staff was friendly service was fast and the entire time I was there there was a steady flow of people coming and going I guess this 5 & Diner is the spot to go

Good coffee the staff was nice and my coffee cake was good
The staff was super nice and knew the regulars by name
Everything is extremely prompt and the service was friendly
Besides having great customer service their food is good too
So we sat on the restaurant side and had pretty great service
The negatives are the service is  terrible and the managers seems to walk around a lot but don't seem to have a clue what really needs to be done to make the restaurant run smoothly and make the guests experience a good one
It really seems like the staff doesn't pay attention to the details of making your dining experience a good one which in my opinion is a direct reflection of the management
The pizza was good but we stayed until after happy hour was over and my friend ordered a slice of pizza
The staff are all really friendly and the room has good acoustics for the type and scale of performers brought to stage

My wife ordered the Sundance special hamburger and got a plain one that wasn't very good
Despite the poor food we had a good time and will return for the entertainment but doubt we'll order dinner again
In summary Very friendly staff but WAY OVERPRICED FOR DRY CLEANING AND LAUNDRY
I had enjoyed the following less 475 calories dishesMussels - nice red sauce and cooked perfectlyFlat bread  I had both the Reuben and Chipolte shrimp with crushed pineapple WOWCab Chicken - nice healthy great flavor came with golden beets which I have not had before very pleasant surprisePeanut butter and Chocolate mini dessert and Red Velvet Cake miniThe FlatBread I have to say is hands down the best alternative to pizza I will never fill guilty again

We ended up canceling desert tipping really good because the waiter was amazing
Lousy fairly expensive food but pretty good service

The service isn't memorable never great but never bad either
The ambiance service and food make it a great place for a fun lunch with girl friends or a lunch meeting
I have to say that although there were many happy people eating here and the staff was incredibly friendly we didn't think the food was good at all
I felt very at ease the first time I walked in because of the very clean place and friendly staff
Although our waitress said they normally do Reverse Happy Hour only at the bar she willingly asked her manager and told us it would be fine to order appetizers from our table - great service there
I swear service at Filberto's is slow but this one seems to be slower then usual
; The service is usually really good Gary and mother are a lot of fun and the drinks averagely priced
In order to judge just how good they were I went for the simplest meal on their menu
Ok so this place has amazing service even better food a great wine and beer selection and has a perfect ambiance
Service is great though but be creative with your menu because there are like 100 places that show football around here and most have specials that make the joint worth going to at least
I'm willing to give it that excuse because both the service and the food were quite good
I went there for lunch the other day by myself and it was fast service but there were tons of regular types in there drinking and chatting up the staff
Brown is great about letting you try a sample before you place your order

The wait staff is friendly helpful and knowledgeable about the menu
Service was very friendly and the food came out quickly
The dark quiet atmosphere and great service of the place is a big plus to me too so I say eat-in if you can
The service was fast but I wouldn't say friendly
I've eaten here a few times and like the atmosphere the decent food and friendly service
I ordered the Chicken Pesto Sandwich which was good but a little hard to eat being so big and the Tuna Sandwich both $12 for myself and the Bf
The staff is unbelievably friendly and extremely passionate about their craft
This new concept of saladwich was good but not really what I ordered
+ A great happy hour+ Great atmosphereUnfortunately these great plusses are often overshadowed by these annoying minuses- Long wait for a table even when several tables are empty- Rude/clueless hostesses- Rude/clueless manager- Crazy overzealous water misters that soak your table outdoors- Most uncomfortable outdoor seating
Ever- About 2 really good waitresses and about 10 clueless waitresses - Wait staff has no idea what is in the specialty rolls- Long wait for food- Confusing happy hour rules- Tables really close together- Disappointing desserts- Disappointing appetizersSo basically you have to do the math and see if the +'s outweigh the -'s
The service was prompt and friendly minus 1 star for the bland mojitos
They have plenty of seating and the shop is always staffed by friendly volunteers
Service was good and the server very helpful
Just because the business is slow does not mean that service has to match its pace
Fuchsia is a great place and I am so happy with the service we've gotten

Just about everything I've tried on the menu in four visits has been tasty  the portions are very generous the menu prices are low low low the service is excellent and the staff is really nice
Summary A nice comfortable little restaurant with an underrated happy hour and friendly though sometimes hard to understand service
Friendly bartenders and waitstaff ample parking
OK service took some time and from what my girlfriend says nice stiff tasty martini's
Christopher's and Nocawhich I thought is where the crew from Circa wentcomes to mind also as food at a higher price with great service but mediocre steak
The service was marginal with my requesting for water and all but the guy was nice and gave us some free rice upon my price inquiry
but for the overwhelming amount of blackberry seeds which I don't particularly like this would be a great dessert on its own or topped with ice cream
I am not talking about critiquing the food service or ambiance I am referring to the haters who are more often than not rude and demanding if not just ignorant refusing to read the menu ask questions and just expect everything to be as THEY think it should beand if their expectations aren't met want it for free
Pros Great Pizza Cheap Beer Waitresses that don't stank great appetizers decent prices perfect ora Great UFC bar you can even bring your mom and dad here Cons I'm not there with a cold draft in my handThe S
- asked for ranch and received a snappy response- people next to us tried to combine tables and was met by a rude waitress telling them they can't do it and almost to the point of yelling at them gave them no option except sitting in tables next to each other in a snappy fashion
Now this doesn't mean the service was bad the food was mediocre the wine selection limited the decor unpleasant
The service is friendly the prices are reasonable and the selection is fantastic so I will definitely be back
Anyway the people working at this location are super-friendly although the staff does tend to be more motivated when a location is relatively new this one is about a year old and the food we got was to be expected
I do love BK's French Toast Sticks for a nutrition-less but delicious Saturday morning breakfast and my husband's sausage muffin was good although he ordered it with egg and cheese and didn't get them
On a Friday night a hostess/server greeted us after a good 5 minutes of waiting by the door and asked us if we would be ordering food since the kitchen was backed up
His staff are all so nice and welcoming and helpful making one feel at home and they truly care about you as a person
Large place indoors and out cool artwork on the walls free wi-fi ask for the password slip when you order and good background music
The service is fine and the wait staff quite friendly especially the bartenders
The staff is great to chat with the atmosphere is great also - it's always busy with college kids and families and I love it because they're open so late on the weekends
But overall a very friendly inviting place; service was lovely and attentive and everything was great
Why bother with friendly service if you are a merchant selling things
The service has always been good and the food fresh
The food is edible to bad the bartenders couldn't produce two identical Bloody Mary's if their lives depended on it the waiters don't know whether to stand or crouch to take orders your table is never cleared regardless how full of dishes and worst of all - you are either Dude or Hon
All of the waitstaff was very nice to my friends and I even when we started to wear out our welcome

Our waitress was friendly and very helpful

we visited Prado  3 times this week and we were pleased with everything that we had speacially the service was nice our server took his time to explain the food to us before we order so it was clear to us you know this restaurant they dont write everything in the menu you need a server help to order and their manager was cheking every table and greeding them which is nice
and the dessert ohh my god it was so good
I found the service staff to be friendly knowledgeable and efficient without being overbearing or pushy
But at least the Del Monte hasn't lost it's roots in the community and the service is still good

Fair Trade Cafe is renowned in Phoenix as the premiere coffee shop in Downtown a place to meet friends or make new ones hear the eclectic but usually superior music choices of the friendly and colorful staff and find an office-away-from-the-office

With the fabulous drinks and pleasant wait staff good times are to be had here
The waiter was funny friendly & very helpful
It was so nice of you to take the time to take our order and then let the waiter go home because he had been there since lunch
How about being the last table for the guy who worked 2 shifts it was so nice of the manager to let him leave but hey how about taking the time to have someone FINISH the open orders
But the worst part is that your staff is just not good at their job THEY DONT CARE and that is a result of MANAGEMENT not caring
The wait staff was very friendly and attentive our glasses were always full and our server came by to check on us regularly
We still tipped our server on the full price of the meal as it was certainly no fault of hers and her service was great
The food was great the service was great and I honestly think the issue with the delay in getting our food was an isolated incident not the norm
*  The mac and cheese is pretty good sometimes cold but that doesnt' stop me from ordering it each time we eat there
The first time we ordered this there was waaaay too much balsamic on the caprese but the ham & artichoke spread bruschetta was absolutely to die for melt in your mouth must have every time you go there good
I ordered the Sunkissed Roll and it was pretty good
The service is nice until one lady a waitress spoiled it
We enjoy the food and the waiter is really friendly
Everything is so nice until one waitress destroy it all
It doesn't matter when I go there or how crowded it is or isn't - the service is always slower then I'd like
Service is good the girls liked to flirt with my male friends which 'Hey it will make the boys tip well and passing out free samples does help sell the food

YesPrime rib no casino buffet should be without it plus you get an offering of creamy horseradish or the plainer intense oneCheese selections snob appeal to have a cheese course after my main and prior to dessertBerries & creme anglaise on puff pastry this was soooo good I sat here an extra 15 min relishing this with coffee14 flavors of gelato/sorbet go ahead that really nice counter lady will kindly scoop several mini tastes into a platter for you
Good location good service good steak good fries good bread good cocktails
But weak drinks bad food and poor service are not a good combination
Edit It seems to be a common thread among the bad reviews that if you go on the weekend the service sucks and during the week it's great
The food takes ridiculously long and the staff is extremely rude arrogant and condescending
The host was friendly and my waiter was attentive
I understand RnR will have both late night hours and breakfast service
The staff was very friendly and they have punch cards
Now for the food I ordered the vegetarian tacos which were so good The vegetables were not your basic veggies they gave me carrots spaghetti squash ear tree mushrooms bok choy and parsnip
It was crowded and there was no clear understanding of how it worked no table service at breakfast
I hope if you try this place you get good service and the $16
Woulda been nice if one of them had suggested that instead of just seeming annoyed that we were standing in the order counter/lobby area
The atmosphere is great the waitress was amusingly surly
After dinner I can get a dessert I feel good about while my SO can go to Haagen-Daaz and suck down two giant scoops of ice cream while he complains that his boobs are getting bigger
And if you like their macaroni and cheese which IMHO is heavenly cheesy goodness skip it as a side and order a quart to go instead
Service was very good albeit the server had tables on the patio and on the opposite side of the bar
I can go to the location out in Prescott and enjoy the same friendly service and amazing food that they offer at this awesome location I chose this one because its closer to me
The drinks were great and the service was excellent
Last but not least is the friendly staff
The cramped dining room has been an irritant sometimes the Hostess has not always been that friendly Chewing on a workers ass not mine the waiters get overwhelmed and forget about you at times but I've never been disappointed with the food
The chicken in Black bean sauce from this place is bordering on sublime and they do a really good job with fresh live seafood vegetarian dishes and various types of Chinese barbecue like Char-Su and Spare-ribs
I ordered a bagel and wished I had just gone to TJ and picked up some wild Alaskan lox organic eggs organic bread organic butter and I would have gotten it all for the price of their lox & eggs breakfast plate with plenty of quality food stuffs for 4 other meals
Seated at a tall table with some plush booths on the side and surrounded by five televisions the waiter was fast with the iced teas
The stars go to the service-all nice helpful and not in a scary generic way
Great venue great location great service ~ A+ in my book
If not-the Biltmore is great and filled with history and wonderful diversions throughout the grounds-book an Ocotilla room as if provides multiple hospitality services including an extended continental breakfast and hot and cold apps with beer/wine complimentary and honor bar
Service very attentive waters & beers always full bartenders are great at making recommendations for beer when your being annoyingly indecisive about  which fashion  you plan to get inebriated
The service was friendly and the place kept clean
This place has potential and service is still great
Service was very good and the restaurant has a feel of a hometown restaurant joint

The owner is friendly and energetic and is quick to get your order in with the kitchen
Great customer service great selection for my beer brewing needs and reasonable prices
Thankfully I was in a good mood or the lack of customer service at the very beginning would have soured my whole mood - I had forgotten the printed off copy of a coupon for a free appetizer that had been emailed to me so I asked the waiter if there was anyway they could honor it if I showed them it on my phone
When my date and I went there the service was genuine and the atmosphere was nice
Prices aren't too bad and the service staff must be trained to upgrade
The waiter James was very patient with me and friendly he certainly put up with my barrage of questions
I'm giving it a 2 only because the decor was so pretty and the staff so friendly
at least at this location in the T&C Center I have found--excellent customer service--very good cleanliness inside bathroom could use a little more cleaning but not awful--lines that move efficiently and a staff that's on top of it for the most partProbs w/ In N Out - hamburgers are often undercooked yech fries are sometimes a little soggy
Great flavor and we always also order ranch to vary the dipping options

Some of the staff is super friendly while others have attitudes
Then we put our drink order in and she decided to send about 10 to 15 minutes talking to the hostess the sushi chef was nice and found the female manger working and she brought our drinks to use and said that she would talk to Jessica
My company sends people here for training I am going to tell all my co workers to pass the place up or just don't tip the horrible waitress Jessica with the bad red hair
The background music was at the perfect level for conversation and the staff was friendly
This is a great dessert segue way as you wrap up next door at LGO

I didn't really want a Fat Tire however it seemed really inappropriate to ask the Bar Tender for their beer list The service was fast crowd chill and mellow and the bathrooms disgusting

Even the kids menu has been good my kid has tried the cheeseburger and the chicken nuggets they all come with drink and dessertIf you want to go to a nice restaurant to have an excellent time and great food I recommend you this place is superb and the service is always friendly
I guess I went in when it was slow because I was seated as soon as I walked in the girl waiting on me was ultra work efficient took my order got me my drink and before I knew it BAM
I mean Thai spicy for a guy that grew up in the southwest eating chiles for breakfast lunch dinner and dessert
What could have / should have been a friendly relaxed opportunity to give some good customer service came across more as a don't care attitude
was so rude I think most of his staff quit on the spot
Once again the unbelieveably rude manager was hitting on some um VERY young chicks
Service was good and our waitress recommended dished for us that was very helpful due to me beeing half blind
The wife had the Thai Tea de-lish was her response to bad that did not include free refills  I had the fresh brewed tea and started with the wings as an appetizer they were really good and that sauce was fantastic wife ordered the Thai Noodles  nice I had the yellow curry chicken and as a chef I must say I was not expecting the potato that  were sliced corrugated and the carrots were as well with a corrugated fine peeler and the sauce was real coconut milk and heavy whipping cream the chicken was fat free breast meat it's the little things that make a Great food spot and they have that here I forgot to even taste my wife's dish so I'm limited to speak on it but it looked really good too
We ordered the spinach and goat cheese croquettas good gambos al ajillo good the pollo colonial the star of the meal some other items and the brussel sprouts with thyme way TOO much vinegar drowning the sprouts and no thymeFor dessert we ordered the cheesecake with figs in a red wine sauce - this was amazing and I would return only to eat this and the pollo colonial

I think what really makes this restaurant better than some of your other fast food Chinese type locations is their friendliness and service
I always liked the bar and the small couch seating area now the bar is just as amazing as ever with friendly and knowledgeable staff and the entire place is mostly conversation groupings with comfortable arm chairs and couches with a few tall tables here and there
All the gals working here are very friendly and the service is great
They offer have size pitchers which is nice when you don't want to order a whole pitcher or just a single beer
Rachel was our server and even with a full restaurant she gave great service
I've ordered LOTS of cakes and other baked goods from Tammie Coe Cakes
Sometimes I even order them and then decorate them myself with fresh flowers or other goods
The service is a hundred times better and the management was so friendly and inviting
Now i'm not positive but I'm pretty sure Mcdonalds has a company policy where large orders that take this amount of time are required to pull around and wait to have their food brought to them to allow small orders like my Large Diet Coke which takes 13 seconds to fill fast food service
Service was there but nothing I couldn't find at the local fast food joint
The appetizers ware also great and described adequately in the menu and everyone except my uncle who ordered the lasagna and wasn't impressed was so happy by the end of the meal that we all indulged in either a specialty dessert coffee or the excellent dessert special Chocolate Soufle with vanilla ice cream which was flawless and had a great presentation
I really want Au Petit Four to succeed but they need to overhaul the quality of their food and the attentiveness of their staff
Good thing our watiress was at our table less than a minute after we walked in and took our order quickly
The staff is pretty friendly and helpful too so that's always a bonus
Yes the decor is good yes the inventory is gigantic but there is nothing like poor service to turn me off to a place
I do not think a place with such great service can be so lacking in their actual product
Couple that with truly tasty food and the nice staff you got yourself a dynamo place to eat
Decent place friendly staff but poor wine list
Too bad the staff doesn't realize they ruin people's stays when they can't deliver a quality experience
We ordered a bottle of chardonay and a beer for Eric and had a great time out on the patio
Service is decent - our server had to check with the kitchen when asked what kind of lettuce our salad came with - but the people are friendly and the cookies they bring with the check are a thoughtful touch
& see how they are these daysLet's do the good first  These Sweet Tomatoes aka  Soup Plantation restaurants are properly managed which means that the food is fresh kept properly stocked everything is the right temperature & the staff is friendly
The reviews that talk about fast service are spot on
Good breakfast great service and nice neighborhood eatery atmosphere
I thought the service was fine not very friendly but efficient
I love that they don't give me a sad look when I order they just deliver a great dog that fills the length of the superb nan bread
The food is great; they cook everything fresh to order right in front of you
But if you like a little place where the service is good drinks are strong food is great and the atmosphere is spot on then this is a great place to hang
The staff that were off for the night were eating and having drinks out on the porch and they were all so friendly
They didn't have any coconut rum so our waitress asked for a different drink order in the end we decided to do a Long Island Ice Tea and adding pineapple juice since I originally wanted a Surfer on Acid in short it was so good that I could have had 6 and ended up on the floor but been a very happy camper
so the price combined with the food and the bad service- i won't be going back
We ordered the crispy rock shrimp and braised leek appetizers which he paired with a nice white wine for us
We ordered a nice bottle of Arizona Stronghold red wine to go with our lamb and chicken entrees

The wait staff is prompt and courteous and they always take good care of me
However the service was very good and the food was very tasty
What a great space with a great menu staff and atmosphere
Yes the service is slow this is *not* fast food take-out or Starbucks

As soon as we walked in we were greeted by friendly staff and all around people were seeming to have a great time
These rolls are big and split in two  I will be coming back to order just spring rolls a great deal for the money
The day I went there it was not as busy as I expected so when we waited a good 5-10 minutes after finishing eating to then ask our waiter for our check we were slightly disappointed
Great staff without an attitude which is rare in Scottsdale
While the server was nice I ordered their goat dish
It was a good 20 minutes between ordering lunch and the food being given to us

This place wrote the book on bad costumer service
Friendly service is always the norm here and they usually have what I'm looking for as far as accessories ammo knives & other miscellaneous items
The service was very good and we did not have to wait long for anything
Yes the work is great but the customer service is pathetic
The staff was friendly enough but the place was dirty food on the walls and the parking lot is a joke
We ate the whole basket of bread which was great but overshadowed by our terrible service
We ate everything so again the food was good the service was awful
Oh and maybe if the jerk who was our server had put aside the desserts for us when we ordered it over TWO HOURS before the time when we actually got dessert that would have been nice too
The desserts were good the pot de creme was the best the rest of us got a 'tiramisu' which tasted like cookie dough ice cream
The staff is very friendly and I noticed that they knew several customers by name
The service was attentive but not overbearing
To top it all off they had little to no air conditioning so it was brutal to sit through a combination of bad food crummy service and high heat

I ordered the shredded beef burrito and it was quite good
They do have pretty good snacks and dessert type food at the food stands which are everywhere
When I sat down I ordered a nice Bahama Mama Hurricane and jokingly asked for a side of beach to go with it as she was walking away
Tommy Bahama should give this waitress a raise for having such good customer service skills that she goes out of her way to think of something like creating a makeshift beach for a customer
Great vibe awesome wait staff great location incredible food wonderful drink selection and a cool patio area
The staff has always been attentive and friendly as well
It was really nice quiet and the wait staff was perfectly attentive
If you're looking for a huge chain style place like Brio where the food isn't bad with decent but sterile service and a room big enough to seat hundreds this isn't it
It's in a perfect location prices are reasonable food quality is good; but the customer service is bad beyond belief

This store has a pretty good variety of products my biggest complaint is the lack of good service

I have one gigantic overarching issue with this joint this Royal Coffee Bar Why make a coffeehouse serving really great coffee and awesome cookies and having a DJ set-up upstairs and free WiFi and a sleek loft setting with extremely friendly service
You stop the manager a tub of lard in horizontal stripes and ask why a valid ID that does not expire until the dawn of the next millennium isn't good enough for Rock Bottom

Service was excellent ambiance great sat outside beautiful night
We went across the lot to another restaurant and were treated to friendly service great food and good drinks at a real Happy Hour with happy people

however the thing that ruined our otherwise great meal was the management tried to rip us off on our bill not our waitress
Friendly staff and everyone seemed like a local who came there often
The service was decent - everyone was very nice but be prepared to wait for a long time
Got to give them four stars Above the crowed cooked to order food here is simply great

After explaining my situation to the waiter he told me to just go in a polite and friendly manner that left me feeling like the world's biggest asshole
The staff is a friendly bunch with familiar faces and the prices are just right
I am occupied by all the antique NFL memorabilia while waiting for my order and the staff is super friendly

Can't remember the guys name but ONE night the service was great/friendly/fun/phoenix
Healthy but great tasting food excellent customer service and great atmosphere
In a place this small it is impossible to have bad service
I still cannot give it 5 stars though because the salad they serve before the meal is sub-par and the wine we ordered was also pretty bad
We ordered the signature pizza and garlic bread so so so good
The host was friendly and the rest of the service staff was wonderful--fast efficient and totally unobtrusive sliding silverware and refills in as needed before slipping quietly away doing quality control checks after we'd taken a couple of bites of each course
Dessert's often the highlight of a dinner out for me and while both were good in this case with the chocolate torte being my choice it doesn't bother me at all that the first and second courses were the stars of the meal
There was a lot of great reviews on them both so we ordered them and were not overtly impressed
Nothing but good things to say about them and their service
I remind Polite-but-Unfortunate-Puppet-for-Stinky-Cologne-Manager Asst Manager that I paid by credit card and if I truly have not received the goods that I paid for I'll just file a dispute with them

They also have t-shirts with cool designs and the inside is very small but clean with super friendly fast service
The staff is friendly and helpful with your selection
Phone orders are always places fast and easy
Additionally the staff is fun and friendly even during high volume times
The waitress apologized for the long wait which I hadn't noticed because of the good company pleasant surroundings except for air conditioning unit whine and self-serve beverages
Service has been good every time I've gone but the average food just doesn't make up for it
My favorite thing about the bar besides the friendly and often hot staff is the atmosphere
Although Kobalt gets a decent crowd so the bartenders are usually pretty busy They have some good-sized TVs but they're usually on a TV station with the sound off and captions on or they're playing a closed-circuit loop promoting the bar's events or a slideshow of previous events and fun staff photos
Place has a nice ambience but can be rather claustrophobic service is good somtimes and absolutley terrible on other occasions
Staff is really friendly and service is great despite the demand they have
I've had good service even when it's hoppin'
I ordered a Breakfast sandwich and coffee
We ordered a variety of breakfast and lunch items which were all delicious
The waitstaff is amazing and the chocolate lava cake finished off every meal nicely
We asked the manager about it and very rudely and almost annoyed with us just kept reiterating that nothing was turned in and that her entire staff had been there 10 years with no incident
The waitress was nice and it appeared they were adequately staffed but our order took a long time so I must assume the kitchen was not adequately staffed
The technician always communicates to me about my vehicle and the staff is always friendly helpful explaining to me what needs to be done on my vehicle and the owner is amazing

Here at Smashburger the service was most certainly friendly
We also ordered some queso the chips for this are amazing it's a shame they don't serve the same chips as courtesy chips but I can undestand due to cost My wife pointed out to me that they were San Pablo chips which are perfectly good and distributed by my company which in a way eating here put's a few cents in my 401K
and our waiter was kind of sassy but in an amusing humorous kind of way actually he was very attentive
The staff is normally friendly and inviting
I must say I was shocked to read the reviews about getting bad service- every time I have been there it has been wonderful
Plenty of tables empty and a good amount of waitstaff in sight
A couple weeks later took a family group for buffet dinner friendly nice staff and much better with 'timing'
Service is swift and friendly; so no issue there
The staff are friendly and helpful and you never have to go very far to buy something to eat or drink
Not only that but then she very RUDELY tells me that  no one made us check in at 430am and it's not their fault we checked in so late after that we ask for the manager  connies  card and she tells us that she will make sure she calls us
General Manager Scott Petello is a good egg
The service was good even though we had a 2 year old eating rice and miso with his bare hands thus throwing rice grains all over the place
Service can be a little slow but they try to make up for it with positive attitudes and refills servers are always cheery and aim to please
While I find most of the staff passibly friendly some are frankly annoying

The place is cute service welcoming and attentive but not pushy and food was impressive as well
Our waitress Nicole was EXCELLENT some of the best service I've had in a long time and the atmosphere at night is great in the Phoenix Center
It was disappointing that the server wasn't more attentive in getting her order considering he delivered our meals after she was there and had a chance to review the menu
It's was fairly slow with 7 tables or so occupied however there was only one waitress
We noticed the food coming out pretty fast which was cool however the waitress was AWFUL
We ordered a milk shake because they are suppose to be known for great milkshakes but was we was served was a watery mess
The food was good but the service is the WORST
If you find a table the waitresses are very attentive and come by often to check if you're thirsty
Their drinks are usually pretty good and the service is awesome
So the service here is very very very very slow
The staff members were friendly and respectful

The gentleman who rang up my to-go order was SUPER nice and hospitable
My husband decided to torture me and order it as his starter and he said it was very good
This restaurant had dirty menus dirty plates/glasses slow waiters the food was unedible and the kitchen was slow
This is such a poor example of no service and bad food
here without having to do bottle service which was great
The topper to the experience is that they had some only a few but good choices of beer on tap & offered a great deal on ordering a pitcher vs an individual glass
I'm sure it's too late now but it probably would've been a good decision to build a back stairwell or install some sort of old school dumbwaiter
Other than waiting a little longer than we should have for some of the food to come out the service was great
Overallgreat servicegreat ambiance this would be a good date spotgreat HHI'll be back

Pro Good portions quick service TASTYCon Stingy on the red-eye gravyWe heard about Over Easy on the food Network and Guy's Triple D
It's a great spot to pick up even if I just walk in and order because what I assume is the owner a middle-aged Asian women who dresses professional is SOOO nice and helpful* with the menu and there is a small bar really small like 4-5 seats where I can order a draft and hang out for the 10-15 minutes it takes to make my order
*definition of soooo nice and helpful She answered all our questions regarding level of spiciness and confusion over which entrees included noodles or rice patiently and with a smile; suggested one of the most delicious fried banana/ice cream desserts I've ever had; and one time she realized we weren't finished with our beers when our tightly packaged food was place on the bar so she spent five minutes undoing the tie to poke holes in the to-go boxes so the steam could escape and not make our food sweaty
Also the service was attentive but not friendly at all

That's all i ask Friendly Service & Good Food
The basics like refilling drinks smiling addressing people as sir/mam apologizing if items are forgotten are basic elements of good service at a fine dining restaurant yet it was lacking here
If you want an example of great service go to Durants
We're pretty friendly people and damn good tippers but apparently not much leaves an impression on the majority of the staff here
Come here for some consistently good food knowing you are supporting a local business and don't get too upset when the staff downright sucks; it's not you
They also don't have a good system for giving you your order no receipt is given and you stand around looking at other patrons when they say #1 No tomato you are left wondering if that is yours or someone else's

I can't say enough great things about our waitress - can't remember her name but she was awesome
The entire staff has a great attitude

Also I kind of felt that we did not get good service maybe bcuz we were the only latinos  and it was not that busy
Pros  The bartender who made my mojito was on point - she was smiling provided quick service and the drink was good
I felt bad for the staff though because their business has slowed because of the construction on Central for the light rail
The service was excellent when our server was around  but like others have said the service is slow
Service was a little slow they may be in the learning process still

I've heard the soups are good and the desserts looked awesome but I'm not sure if I'll return

The really good part of that dessert though was the coconut gelato which I found out they order from a local gelato shop
Nothing special to be honest but she wasn't rude or anything just average service
I did all my ordering with Kelly via email and she was great and told me she was making a special V-day box of cupcakes and card

The service was friendly and the place was clean but the chicken itself was terrible
What's great about The Grind however aside from finally hiring some decent staff is that all of the food--not just their famous coal-fired burgers--is pretty fantastic
The Grind is a great little neighborhood spot to belly up to the bar order a well-crafted cocktail and enjoy a plate of coal-fired deliciousness
Honestly the restaurant is nice the wait staff was fine the food was edible
They have so many free things to offer and are really pretty good about their customer service
Ambiance was very chic and classy yet still a nice contrast from Coach & Willie's across the streetMy hostess/waitress was very pleasant and helpful Tori S
Food great Service not so great other wise four starsTurkey bacon wrap and the onion rings were not typical for sports bar food
Our waiter was good and checked on us often except when we wanted bread and he forgot to bring it to us
I'll let it slide though because he was so good otherwise and brought us tons of other yummy food and drinks quickly after we placed the order and I applaud him for that on such a busy night the end of restaurant week this past Sunday
Fries are typical the sausage platter was actually pretty good and probably the best thing to order if you are looking for some more traditional fare
The service isn't particularly good - our bills got mixed up it took forever to get our fries and you could sit at the bar with an empty glass for far too much time
Service has always been attentive and the restaurant has some really beautfiul details
The food we ordered and received was good and I'm sure the food we ordered but didn't receive would've been equally as good

Staff were very friendly and knowledgeable
hardly but regardless of ill fit names they had all around great food service was touch and go but in the end its the food that counts
I don't feel that I ever had 4 or 5 star service here the servers and bartenders need to be more attentive and NOT hang out towards the back of the bar which is the service area
Even after I shared a Chocolate Monsoon Soynami for dessert I could still walk out the door feeling good about what I put into my body
Not sure if this is standard with all Hilton hotels or if this is just one bad manager at a struggling hotel but when given the opportunity to do the right thing the Pointe Hilton did not
All in all I had good service my feet are shoft she removed more callous than I thought I had and my french manicure is pretty alot better than I can do myself but not the best I have ever received
Center Cut Sirloin was a nice thick cut and cooked medium rare exactly as ordered
Needless to say I was not very impressed and would rather go to Krispy Kreme for doughnuts and if I ever want coffee I already know that Dutch Brothers is the best with really friendly service as well
We always have great service and a fantastic dining experience
The only reason it doesn't get 4 stars is because the service tends to be a little slow/inattentive
I ordered the two-egg breakfast with bacon
sorry if that sounds sexist but I'm a woman and I know what good service looks like
Their staff is friendly and knowledgeable
I must say while there wasnt custmers she was cleaning and arranging the toppings so it was very nice to see staff working not just texdting behind the corner looked like she had pride in her job
However the one time I tried this location the service was pretty bad it took forever for our food to come when the place wasn't even that crowded and when things came out wrong neither our server nor the manager were very apologetic
Nothing in the store blew me away dresses or service but it was a good place to start and I had fun trying on dresses for my wedding
The service was VERY attentive - my waiter almost ran to the kitchen when he heard orders ringing for pick up

The portion size is good and speed of service is great
I will say that i do love the staff and they are always very nice and loving to my dog

Since we ordered before 11am on a weekday I got my breakfast 2 eggs bacon and two huge pancakes for $3
I can't really speak for some of the other reviews as far as wait times etc because yesterday when we went for breakfast about 1045 we had good service and right as we were leaving probably 1130 or so it had gotten SO busy it was so crowded we could barely get out the door
45 friendly staff was busy with lunch time crowd but still kept my soda full
We ordered the chicken wings as an appetizer and if I'd have known how good they were going to be
they're right off of the strip and the service and the food were great
Burger Studio reminded me of the Rocky Point of burgers faded menus sticky counter tops slow service bathrooms out of order and condiments stacked on tables that looked like they had been sitting in the sun for years see pics
This place has a business model based on selling in large volumes hence the low prices like wal-mart so they're gonna have to reduce costs somehow so-so quality food not-so-attentive staff and slightly smaller than average portions but it's still a solid bang-for-your-buck kinda place
For those claiming to be left to fend for themselves due to an inattentive staff most of your sushi-related inquiries can be answered by this thing called the menu that sits on the counters
The staff is always friendly and does their best to make sure your experience is enjoyable
The market fare is counter service but when I was ordering the cashier was very friendly and courteous and brought my food to me out on the patio
The service was not good at all You could totally tell that our server did not want to be there and she was quite annoyed with something and it came across to all of her tables
Vincent's pizza is not bad but it's certainly not tasty enough to endure the shady business practices and poor service that accompany your meal
In contrast I would warn anyone who chooses Vincent's to expect mediocre over-priced food served by rude incompetent children and management that doesn't concern itself with service
First the staff is so incredibly nice
Service ~ very nice and friendly however they were not very attentive to our drinks
We had a nice waitress although don't remember her name

As always the service was pretty fast and friendly
The service is quick and the waiters/waitresses are very prompt and friendly
Nice things about this Walgreens-Open 24 hours-Not too scary to enter during any of those 24 hours-As reliably good speedy service as one can expect at a Walgreens-Clean and neat-Well stocked - whatever they carry they are never out of it-Next to the best UPS Store in townWord of warning entering the parking lot is like being a ball dropped into a pinball machine - don't lose focus or you'll get smacked
Don't be afraid to ask questions about the menu either the staff is very knowledgeable and the owners are very warm friendly people as well
We got there and at first the service was a little rude but luckly for some reason we ended up with a new server who was fantastic
2/3 stars the service was very good my wife had the eggs bene which she really like it came w/ a side of fruit
I've come here on several different occasions and the staff is always friendly and  helpful

They even served us breakfast as soon as the first of the kitchen staff arrived
Although the atmosphere is sweet on the surface and the staff was nice- the place lacks in cleanliness
Our group ordered a few cones and while my rasberry sherbert was good- we'll likely be going elsewhere for a sugar fix next time

Our waiter Clark did an incredible job of guiding us to some great selections
I did try the Blue Red & White Corn Enchiladaswhich were really good still I felt really satisfied that I had won the I ordered better than you did award

I think it would be nice if the waiter or waitress was aware of what the seasonal vegetables were for that day and let the customer know so they could make a decision based off what they were offering that day
Drinks are excellent and fresh and the staff has always been friendly
Service was friendly but we did not have any silverware on our table when we were seated and had to ask for it after our entrees were served to us
Everything is fair priced and the staff cracks me up and is super friendly
The service is slow but go expecting that and go with cash because they are old school and don't accept plastic
The staff is attentive and they know the menu well enough to riff with you on pairing beers with what you order from the food column
And as long as residents follow the rules and pickup times it's a great service I think
There are two things that keep Maizie's from being five star in my book1 - It is so warm that I felt like I was having early onset menopause2 - They are in an unfortunate location if you are going northbound on Central because you have to flip a biatchHere are the things that make Maizie's pretty awesome1 - $3 Burger Night Monday2 - $3 Beers during HH3 - $5 Bruschetta that is freaking amazing4 - Awesome bathroom with tasty smelling orange lotion5 - Cool looking bar6 - Big open windows7 - Cool Aesthetics8 - Kung Fu Girl Riesling9 - Friendly accommodating staff especially for our large party10- Lot's of options for everything Food Wine BeerI really liked Maizie's a lot and I cannot wait to be back

Service is quick but not overtly friendly not rude either
The staff and congregation are always friendly and welcoming and the church is involved with several charitable works in the community such as the Justa Center  Finally the premises are beautiful
the rest of the meal was good but the temp of everything was like it had come off the buffet we also like our Indian HOT so we ordered accordingly and there was NO heat in anything we got so they brought us some hot sauce to add to it and that was super mild as well  my dinner also came with dessert and coffee or tea I ordered tea but it never came and my dessert again was brought off the buffet
We saved enough room for dessert Bread pudding best ever  american neapolitan ice cream crazy good and birthday cake were our desserts The so-called birthday cake was a triple decker yellow cake with chocolate frosting
Service was cheerful and prompt we had a very early reservation and the whole place was nicely decorated and comfortable
Given the comments from diners before us we may have just caught them on a bad night or ordered the wrong dishes but we wasted $45 on our meals
In fact we just ate at the home base in Flagstaff this past Sunday for breakfast
The saving grace is that the maintenance staff are actually genuinely nice people

The staff is very friendly and I like the quiet convenient location

I also think that the service is great
Presentation is pretty nice service is very good and the outside patio is a nice place to eat
This place is only open a few hours out of the day and when you go the lines will probably be long and the staff will probably be somewhat nice

The service was slow the waitress was not the least bit friendly or personable
Elie's gets high marks for being a family-run establishment and for having super-friendly and likeable service but  it falls a little short in the food department
I will definitely be back great food and the staff was very friendly
Because of this the service was a little slow but we were okay with just chatting and enjoying our drinks
Our server was exceedingly friendly and helpful and service was prompt
Besides the fact that they serve great bougey food have incredibly witty and awesome wait staff and sometimes have half-off bottles of wine I totally fell for My Florist Cafe's atmosphere
I've made a few dated returns and they were cool about that too so I'll keep shopping for the sales and friendly staff
Compare the friendly staff to the surly workers at the Marquee
The food was good the service was not so good
If you're in a rush or are frustrated by slow service to the point it impacts your food enjoyment this place may not be your cup of tea
I will give this place another try just because its so cool and the service is so good
It's simply amazing how you can take a restaurant that has pretty good food decent ambiance and have the service people knock the rating from a four star to a two but indeed it happened tonight and it happened at Stingray
good thing I snuck in some of my own snacks so I didn't die of starvation between waitress visits
We came here once on Valentine's Day for some wing-shaped aphrodisiacs my life clearly oozes with romance and experienced exceptionally slow service and various forgotten meal-acoutrements
I always go back if I had bad service/food the first time in case it was a fluke
Our waitress was nice enough but after we told her we needed a couple minutes to look over the menu - she didn't come back for like 15 lol
Now slow service doesn't really bother me
However I think the problem isn't that service is slow more so it's inattentive
As far as the staff they were all pretty friendly and the service is pretty decent
Service- I guess i went at a weird time as I was the only one in the place  so every thing came out fast and hot
This location is ok the staff is friendly if a little forgetful at times
Also Susie the office manager/receptionist has been with Tempe Tune-Up since I can remember--at least 15 years I'm sure and is also super helpful and friendly
On the way out I mentioned to the manager that they should really get thier act in gear and he told me and I am quoting The good news is we are opening up many locations all over the valley to cut down on your wait time and better accommodate
I liked the selections they had and the service was great although they didn't have to do much since I took it home
He checked back for payment two or three times while we were still enjoying our dessert - it was a chocholate cake with ice cream which was pretty good not worth the price but good

I spent year's in the restaurant business and I don't know which is the most disappointing - slow/cold food poor service or the inability to locate a manager
When we were seated we got a very nice waitress we already knew what we wanted so we ordered
It was nice to have a moment to chat before we had to think about ordering
there were a few times that we really wanted to waitress' attention to ask for napkins or get a to-go box and it was really hard to get but for the most part a good experience
Putting my love and affection aside please check your slider buns before service mine were a bit stiff tonight not bad just not up to the level of amazingness I'm accustomed to

The staff guy was really friendly and the other clientiele were older women scoring bargains on furniture and I saw some other hipster girls stocking up

The service was really good and our waiter had a great sense of humor
The combo bartender/waiter/cook had a great friendly personality and our burgers were ready promptly
I used to love this place but that's because I was a teenaged vegetarian without a car or the good sense to go into a restaurant that wasn't staffed by hipsters and next to a killer record store
They have great happy hour specials the menu is diverse you can order gluten free pasta and the atmosphere is top notch
Service is always good at North so I find it hard to believe no one witnessed me take the plunge as I returned to my table for cocktail hour
The fastest service we got was when we received our bill

Super friendly staff I live supporting small kick butt businesses
The waitresses  consistantly revolving door of attractive young bright-eyed co-eds or were co-eds til Financial Aid ran out--but they can take a deliver an oderThe hostesses  younger than the waitresses too dumb to take more than your name basically flunkee waitresses too pretty to toss to the curb so they have been given a safe jobThe bussers  diligent tidy always smiling and pretty much the same few guys for the past five yearsThe barista  attractive metro fast with his hands and with smiles to the aforementioned waitresses makes a mean BC Coffee Iced Hazelnut infused coffeeThe patrons as deliniated by time of year and morning
Initially we were drawn in because we were looking for a good Latte/Espresso but when we smelled the food we had to take a seat and order breakfast
The service was a little slow since there was only two servers but I'm understanding
The knowledgeable staff  are good looking friendly and always anticipating our needs
Although I'm really not that much of a breakfast person I was surprisingly impressed with the quality service and overall vibe of this place
One of the only reasons I deducted a star is because although the wait staff was friendly they were a bit pushy and really wanted to get our order in
I ordered a traditional breakfast Mama's Big Breakfast I think with scrambled eggs and cheese really thick bacon my favorite kind and pecan pancakes AMAZINGLY GOOD

The service was really great friendly and attentive
It's not my top pick but every time I have been here the service has been great staff super friendly and sushi fresh
Other than that the price was decent service was quick and attentive
We ordered some Mussels to start and those were very good
Though our waitress was slow and we waited quite some time for our drinks she was very amiable
The chill atmosphere and nice staff makes it a great stop and it needs the publicity so I'll keep spreading the word and hope that it really works out for this space because it's genuinely a neat place that isn't much like anywhere else in the area
The store is clean the food is good and can be good for you and the service is never lacking
The service is friendly and efficient
While the wait was unfortunate they did what they could to make it an overall good customer service experience

The service is really great Margaret works very hard at making you feel at home in the restaurant
The service is friendly and they keep the tables pretty clean unless you go during lunch rush at which that point it becomes an utter zoo
One other really nice thing they did is write Congratulations on the package now that is personal service and made me feel really good
The overall ambiance is great w/ the unique furniture trendy dressed waiters/waitresses the rock music in the background
For dessert the green tea cheesecake was very nice to end on although nothing to be wowed by
Great for groups although I'm not sure if it's good for 2 people just because the portions are large so you could really only order 2-3 items
All in all decent food good service and I will definitely come back to this place
On a positive note the waitresses upstairs are very nice and not fake
Maybe because gratuity is included on large parties she just didn't care to give good service
Their staff are the same super friendly genuine prompt and I've never had a bad experience with staff in fact Management has always been flexible and helpful
Our waitress was fairly attentive and happily agreed to have the sushi chef pick a roll for us in addition to the godzilla tail app Alaskan roll December 29th roll and spicy tuna roll
Also the service was pretty good we didn't have a problem at all
By the way the staff is ridiculously friendly and kind
I will say that the Shrimp Summer Roll appetizer was really tasty and light the jasmine rice that comes with the entrees is perfect and that Thai Pan's service is great
The server was slow and only listened to half of what we requested never dropped off syrup for my sister's order
Too bad we were too stuffed for dessert I would have loved to try the gelato spot next door
I ordered shredded beef tacos because my sister had tried them at the Litchfield road location and they were great there
The waitress was nice but she kept calling everybody baby which was a little weird that she was saying it to my stepdad in front of my mother
I will say that the restaurant is very clean and the staff is friendly but the food tends to be either bland or odd tasting and the service is painfully slow even when it is not busy
Poolside service is great and the Mojito's are excellent
Spa service is awesome and a great escape from the sun because it's underground
From the initial greeting at the door to the ongoing service to the final goodbyes called from the bar when you are leaving the door we appreciated it all
They have great service and decent ambiance
Service is slow -- three courses in two hours -- but you won't mind since you can watch the chef cooking from most tables and it is an exceptionally comfortable place to eat
Service was spot on friendly accommodating and attentive and we even got to meet the Director of Romance Robert who made me wish I had known about this service before
I had the two taco special which is about $10 and comes with a small side order of rice fluffy white rice with corn in it nothing special and a small container of re-fried pinto beans also nothing special but they look nice on the taco plate
I also had the steak taco I guess it is the Condessa taco that has the spice and olive oil mix on it and it was wonderful especially with the oil based salsa that tastes like it is made with oil dried crushed papers and salt excellent and I also ordered the grilled squash which while not amazing is a nice addition to the meal
I wasn't expecting muchand was very pleasantly surprised that even though we took the place by volumethe staff was very  friendly and well prepared
Service was relatively slow and the main dishes were mediocre
I would return to Delux for both the food and great service

The fries are good and a small order is more than enough to satisfy half my bag was filled with fries in addition to the cup they placed into it with my burger
Service was prompt and very friendly even though they are only open for lunch until 2p they reopen later for dinner at 5 they still seated us at 130
However I have to say that my companion ordered the filet-- also medium rare-- and said that it was really good
Zero attempt at customer service here the guy manning the check-in desk was much nicer to everybody
Although the place seems kinda snooty the staff was friendly and proficient
Summary nice quaint place with friendly host and staff
Once it gets going they have quick service outdoor nice for this time of year comped 2 drinks so that will ensure we try it again
Tying these together however is its straight up authenticity top quality coffee and baked goods and friendly service
So far we have LOUD rude and indifferentAs I'm perusing I see a youngish guy come in and go up to her and ask about an author I listened to see if she offered better service and she did
The filet was exceptional and the service was good also
The attentive staff are at your table giving you impeccable service and enhacing your experience with through knowledge of the menu
The beef chicken and pork are all superior to any other fast-service and most sit-down Mexican restaurants
I will say that the staff was friendly so that's the positive though there should have been more staff working the counter because it got backed up
Yes it's nearly double the price but at Postino you receive A 4 LARGE pieces of bruschetta cut into thirds for 12 slices total each slice about the size of one QCOM bruschetta; B Easily triple the amount of toppings on each piece C something flavorful that you'll actually enjoy eating; D A beautiful presentation; E Table service from friendly knowledgeable staff
then go somewhere else for lunch where they have taken the care to give you superior ingredients prepared with skill in sufficient quantity to justify the price and with friendly efficient service to boot
They have super friendly staff that are engaging and welcoming
There was no place for the staff to hide and compare notes on bad tippers or to avoid refilling your water
The food is always great the atmosphere is comfortable and the staff is incredibly friendly
The only reason I gave O&I 4/5 stars is because the service is consistently slow
Agan great service on either side of the restaurant but the full dining portion is rather slow
However I am open minded and I do love a great product and service so True truly nails it
It is well documented that the food is great match that with attentive crisp knowledgible service and hip yet comfortable dining room and this place rocks

It's not good when the staff argues with he customer telling him he is wrong for not knowing what a gourmet burger is
We ordered an order of regular caesar salad and the spicy mambo caesar salad to start which were very good
Also the staff was always nothing but helpful and friendly when I lived in the area
Because it was lunchtime the place was busy but the line moved quickly enough and the people taking the orders were friendly
I enjoyed the baconburger I ordered - quite a stack with crispy bacon two patties plus the condiments I ordered lettuce tomato pickles ketchup mustard and the fries were great - thicker than at most places adequately salted and a nice balance of softness and slight crispiness

They also have a nice atmosphere cool patio with great misters friendly staff and a big plush couch

Fantastic enormous patio with cozy chairs next to fire-pits tiki torches bag pits waitresses that seem to constantly be stoned an owner who tells me that I have a beautiful head decent breakfast and also a great dinner
The staff was all friendly and knowledgeable and the guy who I am guessing is the owner had some really amusing shorts on

But you'll have slower and less friendly service
She told me the service was shockingly bad
The food great and hopefully the service will match soon
Staff was friendly free breakfast buffet was good
Beware of the Manager at this place because if he condons this type of sales strategy then he is guilty of customer abuse and bad sales tactics and the employees are just following his lead

We were in line to order and only had two people ahead of us one of the LGO girls approached us and recommended that we go outside and place our order with the barrista AKA coffee lady because it would be 'faster'
Our waitress was nice but seemed to be in a rush and was very hard to understand

TLDR  Order the Prime Rib French Dip for a good sandwich
I for sure received great service - NOT the kind you normally expect to receive from a big box shop

The bad news is not only did our food take a long time majority of the orders were wrong

Food tasted really good service was wonderful tables were clean
Service was prompt and very friendly even though I came in just in regular jeans and an old t-shirt all clean and whatnot but super casual and everyone inside was preoccupied between their prada and platinum credit cards
The design is modern with service minimized to the essentials for well seasoned business travellers like a small bar breakfast area 2 room split suite with euro-type decor with male color tones self check-in kiosks and 42 inch Plasma TV with HD programs

There are also about 10 menu items which can be ordered a la carte I have tried the breakfast burrito which is excellent and the cold buffet which offers a variety of breads a ton of very fresh fruits oatmeal ceral and even Atlantic salmon
This isn't the greatest place but the food service and drinks are decent
I don't know if I'm just being pretentious but why do we expect so little from fast food restaurants anymore I can't feed myself in a drive thru for less than $7-8 which would buy me a much more appetizing lunch at some other restaurants I find that no matter what this location always misses something on my order If I'm lucky they just short me the condiments that they asked me if I wanted over the speaker otherwise they will just give me the wrong order or neglect to put sandwiches in the bags usually our exchanges are silent because have a nice day or thank you would be borderline on some form of customer service
The staff at Armadillo Grill has always been great and I'm sure they will continue to be as I wiggle my way into becoming a regular here
Great happy hour great food and friendly service in a really chill bar equals two huge thumbs up from me I jammed them so they're both swollen
I always feel that tables of 8 are a good test for a restaurant's service

I ordered a red Zinfandel and it was good to see the proper glass brought to me along with a small carafe of wine allowing for the right pour to facilitate lots of swirling
This place is flushed with great imported foods and fresh made desserts to order up from their market
Breakfast and lunch cafe with good coffee each order receives its own French Press
i liked the limoncello cheesecake without absolutely loving it but it was good enough that i'd try something else from their dessert menu next time
My best option for breakfast drink is always OJ so I ordered one
And last but not least the additional bacon that I ordered was great

The staff was really great the rooms were clean and quiet the beds comfortable the water pressure in the shower was great which I find to be a rarity and the price was right
I do appreciate their 'healthy' options on the menu with calorie #s too and I do appreciate their salad bar that has a pretty good selection note that dessert is part of the salad bar
Their staff has always been adequate and friendly and the facility itself seems to run smoothly ordering and food arrival is pain free and quick and is fairly busy at lunch time it's near a mall and lots of businesses nearby but again their food is OK
great first impression until we were ignored by the valet service
The room service wasn't bad but much overpriced for the entrees we received
My advice to the Restaurant; you have a great food I'd recommend you also match it with great service
Our waiter was good at first brought us hot fresh bread that was pretty good but when he brought our appetizers of grilled mixed veggies my boss practically choked on a staple
We went last night and the service was good but 2 people ordered burgers medium rare and they both came out well done even a little burnt
Was a really big fan I hadn't ordered Matthew did and I ended up eating it allMongolian Beef - was good your standard Mongolian beefMu Shu Pork - Very good and something I noticed a couple days later usually the wrappers get hard and you can use to eat left overs the next day These wrappers were perfect 2 days laterI think in the end it probably depends what you like and what you order

Hailing from the Tohono O'odham Nation and serving up her style of Indian Tacos around the area for nearly twenty years and now at two locations I opted to head to the original Fry Bread House West and having followed my GPS from door to door I found the location with ease on a relatively dingy stretch of 7th Avenue and allocating parking with ease I made my way into the unassuming low-lying restaurant where I was greeted by a short line and then by a curt but friendly waitress who took no time in requesting my order and name before handing me a plastic cup to get my water and suggesting it would be perhaps 10 minutes before my food was ready
With the ingredients a standard store-bought admixture of traditional taco toppings and a bit of hot sauce to taste this was a good choice to understand what the Indian Taco was all about and perhaps to understand why diabetes and lipid disorders are so prevalent in their population as well
our waiter was really friendly & super attentive

I ordered the Strawberry salad which was very good
Though our waitress was generally friendly service was incredibly slow
Overall the food was fine but the super slow service makes me wonder if this isn't a better place to phone in a to go order rather than dining in
Service has always been good and the lunch specials very reasonable
Great service better atmosphere but still not stepping away from the geriatrics but overall I was happy to give El Chorro another shot
Their personal size pizza is loaded with cheese and toppings and is good to split as an appetizer or order and devour by yourself

We finished with some kind of passionfruit mousse dessert that was SO good

Don't let the dumpy exterior fool you this place is clean service great and you will come back for mas
Anyways the service is slow let me repeat S-L-O-W
Our waitress was a super friendly girl who really had a sincere interest in talking to us which is a departure from Southern California where all service staff do is ask if you want more diet coke
I've also tried the Doctor's Ordered eggs dish which surprisingly flavorful for something that is considered healthy and the Huevos Rancheros which is good but too heavy for me
I've had great waiters he made me a tinfoil rose and totally crappy ones took our order had someone else deliver the food and then didn't come to check on us at all
More than that every member of the staff is friendly helpful and knowledgeable
OK so first off the service was good and the place was clean except for the area in front of the soda machine
I have to say while the food is bad the service and free refills of horchata did make me at least feel they deserved the one star I gave them but wish I could have gotten a refund
The staff is friendly and helpful it is as if they enjoy working there imagine that
The service is prompt and friendly but on busier days especially at lunch they can sometimes be slower

When going here before a Diamondback game don't expect fast service
The drinks weren't too expensive and the bar service was really friendly
Staff was friendly and quick and restaurant was bright and clean but unfortunately we probably won't come back
The server was really nice but made some noob mistakes like not writing down the table positions of who ordered what
I get all my service done at Camelback Toyota and they are always super nice and never try to rip me off even when I try to act dumb on purpose just to see if they will try to rip me off
Never having dealt with a Discount Tire in Phoenix before only in Texas and their service has been great all the time I came in not knowing what kind of service to expect
The prices were not as heafty relief and although there were a good amount of people the next day waiting for their cars to also be serviced it took exactly the amount of time they'd told me 45 min

Great service so don't forget to tip
Tonight we were seated promptly and never waited very long for anything--the service was fast and top-notch
I ordered what turned out to be the smallest full rack of ribs in Arizona described above--the mango to the sauce was too slight leaving it fairly generic altho the fries and slaw were pretty good
Sure a couple of the waitresses are brain damaged but the food is good and you get a frequent diner card with every  sixth or tenth meal free
I have two full cards but haven't had a chance to see what the free breakfast includes and which waitress they give me
Their staff was very friendly - we must have been asked about 5 times if we could use any help or if we wanted a bag for the items in our talons I mean clutches
Socially it's not TOO BAD service is alright but all I can say is Don't expect much
Great joint for out with friends on the way to the bar or I would think for happy hour but not for a family dinner my Grandma had to barrow a flashlight from the waitress it was so dark
I ordered the Filet Mignon I'm a picky meat eater so filets are usually a good safe bet for me and a Caesar Salad I ordered this because I thought an older classic steakhouse would make an older classic Caesar
The staff is cheerful and the west valley desperately needs more vegetarian-friendly restaurants
The staff was very nice and helpful with my smoothie selection I asked for an opinion on what to get and wasn't disappointed
I plan on going there many more times to try as many things as possible because frankly it all sounds good and I have never been disappointed with anything I have ordered
BUT this one on Stapley has got to be judged by the perfect service and their great people
It took about 10 minutes for our waiter to finally approach us  but after that he was attentive and pleasant for most the meal
I will say that the dessert plate ups were nice
What I found instead was really bad service and rice dishes that are made better at pho resturants
They have a great tap selection decent bar food and fabulous customer service
Service Our server was attentive and recommended we add another drink before happy hour was over I appreciated this
Applebee's is consistently good usually I order the 2 for $20 but I choose the 7oz sirloin

Told the manager at the time how bad it was and the food they served wasnt food
It's nothing super-special just good food good service excellent prices
The service was great during both my visits
and while the flavors blended well it had the distinct taste that freezer-burned baked goods have and that was enough to put me off of ever ordering dessert from them again
Still the fast friendly service and excellent breakfast/lunch menu is enough to make me rate this place 4 stars
The service is mostly good and friendly depending on who serves you
I was there for breakfast this morning and ordered their Honey-cured ham and brie frittata which was excellent but it seemed to me that there were only half as many home fries as usual
I ordered the house burger w/mac & cheese - it was good but I've certainly had better at several places
One friend ordered bacon wrapped shrimp - she said it was good but wasn't happy with the serving size 5 shrimp
Another friend ordered the tuna w/ a side of mac & cheese - he said the tuna was good but they went overboard on the soy based sauce
More on the wait staff - they seemed friendly but possibly new
Positives  decent beer/wine selection I liked the atmosphere open air bar & grill type of placeNegatives  bad service mediocre food pricey dinner entrees kind of a boring menuWill I go there again
Staff has always been superb from greetings to goodbyes

We were there again last weekend for the football games and made it in time to order our favorite breakfast items - eggs benedict and the braised pork dish with beans potatoes two eggs and fresh warm tortillas
The food is good but I'm getting tired of the piss poor service
That's a good $30-$60 a week you just lost from my orders
The service was great the reason for 2 stars
Bad customer service I say with this location
Short story - great products pricey pushy sales staff
The food was not particularly good on our last visit there and the service was rude and not helpful at all
I even emailed them afterwards to give feedback in hopes that they would redeem themselves by showing some good service that way
But the service last time was so bad that I won't go back
We ordered a very good sake from their extensive sake menu to accompany the meal
All of the staff was very friendly stopping by to chat with us and see how we were doing and the manager seemed genuinely interested in our happiness
This particular visit was not so great because my Grandma ordered lamb chops but they turned out to be too spicy for her so she asked for a less spicy version and they were very nice about it

She made appropriate suggestions was fast in processing our orders and had a very pleasant personality

I felt bad for Jill as it seemed like she was waiting on quite a few tables at once and it took a very long time for her to come take our dinner order

but companies simply cannot rest on their laurels and assume that bad service is ever OK
Great prices diverse menu friendly staff some language barriers present so speak slowly and just yummy
Wonderful food excellent service great atmosphere
I continually ordered the shrimp po'boy and it was great
Fun staff great food and a line out the door keeps the masses coming back
The service is also kind of iffy sometimes but in spite of everything I keep coming back so it must be good
Our waitress was typical of what I expect from this type of establishment the most attentive thing about her were her half covered breasts
The fries that came with my food were actually pretty good and the iced tea was huge so I didn't run out when the waitress never returned
Desserts-Seasonal pumpkin cheesecake very fluffy with a rare naturally fresh pumpkin flavor one of the best of its kind-French white chocolate bread pudding loved the spongy texture and the smooth silky blend of sauces drizzled all over-White chocolate brownie unique and has my stamp of approval as wellOther dishes-Blackened mahi topped with crab meat and tomato creole sauce I don't usually like blackened fish but this one was thoroughly enjoyed-Israeli couscous unexpectedly delicious and with the aggressive rate at which I fed myself I might as well have sniffed the couscous grainsService-Very good-Our waiter put stars in my eyes after giving us that heavenly pumpkin cheesecake for free since I couldn't decide on a dessert or 5
The staff was very nice and there was even a worker who would quality check the food before bringing it out to the customers
Service=5 Ambiance=5 Quality/Taste of Food= 5 StarsI greatly look forward to going back
Each time I have gone the service has been great and we watched our smoothies being made with no problems or concerns

This food was ok but not great & you have to be careful how you order here or the prices are HIGH
His entire staff is very good at what they do
hopefully he was in the kitchen alerting the staff about the bottom of the plate rims which according to the server protrude and are fragile
The food is great the restaurant has a very cool atmosphere the wait staff is extremely friendly and they offer great daily specials
I ordered the steak and it was good too but my fave
On another note service wasn't that great but they were in the middle of shift change so take that as you want
Our waitress was not very attentive at all when she did come around to grab my empty glass of soda she did not ask me if I'd like another instead she brought me a glass of water
Insanely good food paired with top-notch service ambiance and the loveliest hostess
The smoothies are sweet and sugary however and lean more toward the category of milkshake dessert than the desired must-over-dose-on-vitamin-C-NOW goodness
I ordered the rose infused lemonade which was a bit tart but good
I highly recommend Paddy O' to everyone I know due to the great selection excellent service and top-of-the-line products
And don't expect the staff to take responsibility for the bad directions on their appointment form because they are not responsible for anything
The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is fun and lively
The service fell into the same trap good but not noteworthy
Beautiful place great rooms amazing service delicious food relaxing spa and a ton of cool activities
I ordered a pint of the Kilt Lifter which was a great deal during happy hour
Esther helped us order our dishes and was attentive but not overly so throughout our meal

The staff was great service was excellent and the food was spectacular
I am 5'0 so I require a lot of alterations and it is essential that I have a good alteration service
They have nice private dressing rooms with real doors I refuse to undress behind nothing more than a curtain everyone on staff is competent and very friendly the prices are reasonable and they are almost always able to complete your alterations in less than a week
Everything else aside the customer service is great
On top of excellent service and treatment as read in my previous review John's an insightful very sincere person who is genuinely one of the good people out there and those are hard to find
With friendly wait staff good prices and fantastic food you can't go wrong
Bang for the Buck 2/5- I believe there are better places in Phx that have more creative dishes just as high quality food and good service
I guess if you invite 30 other people to create noise in your bedroom when you are intimate with your partner this is your kind of place ;-Service 5/5- very friendly and accommodating
The meals are always good and I don't always order my favorite I bounce around the menu to see how there other dishes taste as well and haven't been disappointed yet
Our service was good at least I can say but then again we were one of the two customers around   - Enjoy
Featuring a rich tomato stock rife with offal bones tender hominy and myriad spices plus a quartet of onions cilantro lime and pimento pepper with which I was free to further season as I like this was a portion easily big enough for two but so good that those who love tripe should probably just order one of their own
five of us from the office went out to celebrate a new client contract and Rosita's is close to the office - the margarita's were good the service was good the food was good and the chips and salsa were good
Once I had my hiney on a chair service was great

Our waitress arrived immediately and was very attentive
Good food nice crowd and friendly service
It's clean the staff is very friendly and their salsa is awesome
the hostess was very nice and took the time to explain the different sushis and the waiter made sure I had a beverage while I waited for my food which was excellent
At our first lunch the service was only acceptable because the waitress was having a bad day and while I doubt she meant to be condescending she was
However we all have bad days we were extra pleasant to her and she did smile when she served our order and she asked how the beer was
So if you're looking for good food at a great location making the slightly high prices acceptable and you don't care that much about correct menus good service or managers that give a care Local Breeze would be a good choice for you
Our waitress was great - there when we needed her not in our face
I generally do not allow people to give me bad service
The staff particularly an elderly lady is really nice and helpful
After getting a few beers from the pretty bartender she was actually really really good-looking hottest girl on staff setting a false precedent for what the talent would look like we made our way past shady regulars at the bar with their necks crook'd to the lounge finding a couple of tables near but not next to the center stage
When I sat down a seemingly nice server came over took my drink order hot green tea and brought it over pretty quickly
But enough about the great desserts which we got bagged to go at the end of the night by the way

Good thing is I work directly across the street from there and work with many clients and I make sure I tell everyone how gross their food and  service is
The service is hard to bet and the staff is very friendly
Scale of 1-10 single visit5 Food5 *Drinks*6 Service8 Atmosphere6 ValueI'll go back because it had a quirky-factor that I liked and b/c I need to try a burger to really gauge the food but there were no drink specials sorry cheap domestics doesn't cut it and my overpriced Frito Chili Pie wasn't good
The service was also slow and uninformed but she might have been new so maybe that'll come up too
It's truly a gem hidden in one of the most obscure centers the food is good and the service is excellent

We first went to the sales window and upon realizing that will call was on the other side a staffer driving a golf cart gave us a friendly ride to the other side
I ordered a medium and it was a little juicy not bad for a fast food burger but I would still say that 5 guys or Smashburger is a little better
but it isnt dirtythe staff is not friendly but not overly happy seeing how they have to deal with late night drunks and they all to common family that doesbt quite know what they want and ask there advice as if the employees give a sh*t
The service was prompt and friendly although I never knew who my server was exactly as there were 3 people behind the small bar and if you made eye contact they checked on you
Then there is the service  it's always so friendly
The service is always fast and friendly and the taste is the best
The place is really unassuming and quaint the staff is extremely friendly and truly have the desire to make you have a special evening and the food is really the star

They rarely get my order right but whatever i get usually tastes pretty good
brings back good memories and the waiters/waitresses were always fun to chat with
Great waitress also and the patio here is clearly key and late friday seems perfect with hardly any folks there
If you want to go out of the box and try something good at a very good price and have great service go here

Thai Iced Tea- a must to quench spicy Thai food Panang Curry- flavorful over ricePad Thai-  not the best I've had but goodPapaya Salad- tasty but not our favorite Shallow Sea- delicious seafood dish scented with lemon grass in a light broth worth a tryWait staff was very attentive and the owner/chef even came out to inquire about our meal

The staff is super friendly and the smells are intoxicating
I followed it with the 32 ounce Porterhouse T-Bone order medium rare this was not so good $60
It is a little older and a little run down but still a very decent place and the staff has always been very friendly when I am there
I loved it because it was not only a great brew house but it also offered deliciously consistent food that was served by a friendly staff
The service was pretty good for 2 waiters vs
This was after she repeated my correct order 2x and claimed she was so good at waitressing she didn't have to write anything down
Pro Nice ambience/ good menu selection / good serviceCon the Viet
On the upside the service has always been exemplary; the staff is friendly and extremely fast
What we ordered Ham and biscuits=Fresh Baked Biscuits Virginia Ham Poached Eggs Champagne Hollandaise see pics $12The ham was not ham but extremely cheap and salty prosciutto I put it aside the rest was quite good although rather tiny
unfortunately the service was sub-par to put it nicely
I ordered it with the sauce on the side which was definitely a good idea as it was pure sesame and chili oils and the spice and oil would have swamped the delicate flavor of the fish itself
The location is spotless the toppings fresh and the staff friendly
A very friendly waitress greeted us immediately and was attentive throughout our meal
All the staff were friendly and helpful and they get pretty busy you wouldn't believe the boxes and boxes of books and things that had accumulated since we first got there

Speaking of service sitting at my table waiting for a server to take my drink order i was able to read the entire menu but when i have to ask for a refill on my tea from the hostess that's bad
I hate to do this after so many good reviews but the service was not the best I've ever received
but a restaurant has to maintain great service
Overall I had good service and lovely experience on the food
The service and friendliness is still very good but the food yesterday was mediocre at best
The waitresses should be able to just walk over and hold out the Bad comment jar and make them pay up

Staff here is friendly and fairly knowledgeable
I ordered the BBQ burger and it was pretty good My wife had the grilled avacado chili turkey melt which was okay
Our booth was comfortable and our waitress was friendly
They're pretty good about getting you drinks and most of the staff is pretty friendly
On the flip side the staff wasn't quite as friendly
Now I will say that they aren't ALWAYS super strict about that catch and sometimes as long as one person at the table orders they consider it good enough
Overall good food decent service kinda spendy but fun
A good suggestion to avoid some of this is to order online
I like the eclectic mix of items and will go back but will not expect good customer service

This time when I arrived 11/2011This time I was irritated because I got a sandwich and it was OK not to great and not something I would ever order again
Long waits on the weekends/nights coupled with few employees and an un attentive wait staff makes this place fall by the wayside in my book
Had the creme brulee for dessert and that was great as well
The staff is friendly the food is consistent
The small bistro has a cute and easy going setting with a very nice and friendly staff
The sandwich was great the service was awesome the place was clean and comfortable
Good burgers be warned that that bleu burger is a little intense okay pastas and good service
The staff in that section are typically very knowledgeable and make great recommendations

If you need to order food for a group this is a very good and affordable option

Love the style love the decor the service is actually great
the staff has always been very fast and laid back and the decor is mellow and unassuming
The flavors were diverse and satisfying the quantity generous the service friendly and personable from our server to owner-chef Esther who came out to greet us and the price before drinks a very reasonable approximate $10 for a very satisfying meal
Staff is always friendly but they are not there to kiss your ass if that's what you want go to a larger corporate restaurant where one small complaint will get your entire meal comp'ed and you'll have a manager there with his nose up your arse for the rest of the evening
There was one waitress who was friendly and professional
Atmosphere music contemporary and service all good

This place just needs a good general cleaning and a little training for the staff
Our waitress Bonnie was very nice and her outfit and attitude was a nice compliment to the cowboy atmosphere
So 20 minutes later we asked the manager if there was a nice way she could imply the table was reserved or ask them to move to a two-top so we could have our table this was after the hostess offered that we could stand over them until they moved
The staff is very friendly and they get you in and out in a hurry

We normally order To-Go but the restaurant has a nice interior
E ordered the steak empanadas said they were good but needed a sauce of some sort
Off that I ordered 2 sides the mixed veggies standard grilled veggie medley--liked it good but simple flavor and the garlic spinach too salty
I ordered the goat cheese fritters because I was curious about them served with peppercinis in a honey sauce--good combo
I don't remember anything about our server when we dined in so I guess it wasn't bad but I was very happy with the service I got at the bar
the service here is terrible awful slow confusing and a whole bunch of other words I'm not going to list
I wanted to give this place at least 3 stars but the bad service completely overshadowed my experience at this restaurant
The wait staff and the owners are always very friendly and helpful and the food although nothing fancy is always good
The wait staff was super attentive and took care of me all night

Overall a very solid place with great service that will provide a very pleasant night
Other than my usual order there are lots of other great items on the menu
If I had to pick nits and I do I would just say the service can be breathtakingly fast - so if you're going to linger over martini's make sure your waiter knows not to fire your order until you're ready
Nice waitress and all of them here wear Alice Cooper-like eye makeup while working which adds to the fun
It's a charming place nice staff and I can see how it's popular

The service was friendly and attentive - despite the fact that I had been traveling half the day probably looked like hell and should have been hidden from the general public
and i eat a lot of hashService is a bit slow HOWEVER when the food tastes this good you understand why its slow
after seeing the staff i understand why the service may be a bit slower but its still good food and awesome people
There is only one bad thing about this place the staff is all 70lb teenage girls which can be annoying because they seem to be in quite the hurry to turn tables oh
Staff was friendlythe patrons were an interesting mix of leatherrubberand joe q public
It's a wine bar/restaurant and we started with the Smoked Salmon Pate which wasn't too bad considering I don't like salmon we also ordered the Roasted Goat Cheese and Chicken Pockets and these were phenomenal
Other than that the service was very pleasant and attentive
This is not to say the food wasn't good or the service was bad it just didn't stand out to me
We ordered a cheese plate with olives to start good but kind of pricey for what you get
The staff on the bay seem really attentive and nice
This was a nice experience friendly staff cool concept
We hadn't planned on ordering any food but decided to go with a cheese plate after our server gave us a good sales pitch
There are good things though- the waiting staff is always pleasant but with a  lack of personality
To add insult to injury they charge high prices for the bad food and slow service
The music rules I love trance though and seriously most restaurants I think have the song soul sista on a loop--the trance rules the schools and the service is always good
My only reason for not giving this place the 4 stars it earned with its great food is due to the service
So the pizza was good but I had ordered a cup of soup and it was still cold
This place has great service most of the time
+++ and some dudes but all very nice and good serviceFood- decent- it didn't give me poo-cano and they use a lot of cheese which is never a bad thing unless you are my Dr

As I was reprinting it we had two couples walk past talking about the worst customer service ever never flying US Airways again rudest they've ever been treated etc
Nice job Lady at the Customer Service counter who's name I'm really tempted to use here
Fair warnings about this place the service is to good and if you do not like that type of thing with 10 people fawning all over you you might not like it here
Good and friendly service but food tastes like it's been frozen and heated in microwave
The food was AMAZING the service was phenomenal and all the staff was extremely warm and friendly
We ordered a late night snack upon arrival and breakfast on most of our days and unlike most hotels they promptly delivered ALL of our room service meals within 20 minutes of ordering

The dessert was HUGEand very richVery good though

The staff is very friendly which probably can be acclaimed to the fact that the owner is there nearly whenever I am there
Foremost our waitress was really nice
A great waiter/waitress can usually make or break a restaurant experience
There were only about 5 other people in the place which is good because I like to have my choice of seat and don't like to wait for drinks and service
Our waitress was quick and friendly and I have no complaints
remind them how your service was so bad you actually got drunk passed-out and sobered up thanks to the slowness  of your lame waitress
The staff is all super friendly and knowledgeable and there are lots of other wonderful little items and gift ideas
Everything was good and the service was pretty good
They had a lot of staff which is nice to see instead of having too little in a busy place like downtown
What we liked-Central to downtown Scottsdale-Very beautifuly lobby and relaxing pool/outdoor area-Nice rooms and bathrooms-Free wine hour from 5-6-Free upgrade to a nicer roomWhat can be improved-If you sit in the area where the pool with the sandy beach is there is virtually no pool side service unless you go and find a person to serve you
I also found the staff and their friends at the bar unfriendly
Our waitress was really nice they were quick the food all came out at the same time and everyones was correct
When we asked our waitress she said 'its so quiet tonight that they're just really fast bringing out the food
An out-of-the-way joint with good food good atmosphere and good services without the Scottsdale attitude
we did leave a fair tip because the service was good
Great service too but the food left too much on the plate to be taken seriously as a $100 burger joint
For an appetizer we ordered oysters and they were fabulous I mean REALLY good - beautifully presented large and very fresh
After lunch the waitress who was friendly but not overbearing brought out a chocolate mousse with ice cream with Happy Birthday written in chocolate sauce for my mother

All in all good eats in a great atmosphere with a very friendly and knowledgeable staff
The waitress wasn't very friendly and seemed to be uninterested in being pleasant
The place was pretty empty so I don't really know why service was so bad
Ingredients are fresh service great and atmosphere really kinda special but once again the pizza isnt that out of this world
So long and short I have to believe is that you should communicate with the waitstaff as to what you enjoy in a pizza without presuming that it comes with things we take for granted like a good red sauce
They were both rude and had all the staff looking at me weird
I know good down home service and food and this is it
THIS is what good service looks like Phoenix
One person on the staff is super nice the rest haven't found what they are good at in life just yet
The service is great everyone is very friendly and the atmosphere is awesome
THey always try to get you a seat as quickly as they can and the staff is above friendly
And the waiter and staff were extremely friendly and helpful
I am a fan but the service was abnormally slow and confused when I went there
So bottom line its a runned down place with no personality other than ghetto; no care or effort put into the appearance; malfunctioning equipment and tacky everything else; kids seem to have fun; staff was hard-working and friendly; overpriced; not fun for adults
- A bigass piece of delicious tilapia that was still good as a leftover lunch- Cajun shrimp creole- definitely worth trying- Excellent service helpful informative efficient and not overbearing at allWell worth a visit
The staff were very friendly and helpful and the breakfast was well-prepared and always had enough variety to keep the kids and adults happy
Their food is good bar food and the service was quick and efficient
At least the server asked if there was something wrong with the dish and we said everything was fine because we didn't want to make a scene and be rude in front of our dinner guests especially because they seemed to like what they ordered
Maybe it's the smell of fresh cut lumber or the uber-friendly staff who are typically over-anxious to assist you with your DIY endeavors
Service was friendly and professional

The environment is great albeit slightly confusing as far as the flow of service
The service was really laid back yet authentically friendly
5 stars but I'll round up for great service and great view overlooking the pool area and some nice hills
Service - fast and friendly which is impressive for such a popular place
You order at the counter take a number sit on chairs that might fall apart at tables older than your great grandma
This is as good as it gets for the Phoenix Valley Brings authentic feel with its service design and especially food

Our waiter was Sam who was spot-on and so courteous and friendly and efficient-great
I called this Tempe location to inquire about the exchange citing the date of purchase and the cause of wanting to exchange it and the gal on the phone I imagine the manager was SUPER nice and understanding - she told me she hates when that happens and that of course they'd exchange it and to come on in and she'd take care of it for me
The service is very courteous and overall the restuarant is very community involved which is super nice as well

Staff is very friendly though I almost always get take-out
Excellent coffee great service and a wonderful trendy vibe without all the pretention
It would appear that the staff's attitude is simply an extension of the owner's as we've seen Terry who certainly recognizes us from Inferno and from his sister property Rhythm & Wine yet will not even greet us or most of the other customers skulking around the restaurant rudely demanding that staff change the television channels as he stands around idly seemingly wishing he were anywhere but at his restaurant
The people who work there are nice and friendly and the service is quick
It was the bartender waiting on us so the drinks came out super fast and really hit the spot after dealing withe the garbage service over at Macayo's

All in all a very good meal and the service was excellent
I ordered the dark meat chicken teriyaki combo comes w/ rice & salad since that was my craving at the time and the BFF ordered 1/2 chicken 1/2 beef teriyaki combo it's not on the menu but the lady was nice enough to accomodate the request
The lady working was not only very nice & helpful when we ordered but she also went above and beyond what one would expect from a fast food type place
It's a more fast food/sit down place so I'm not looking for an experience but I don't want to feel like I'm putting the waitress out either

Don't be fooled by the semi-authentic see and streamlined Thai Basil/ Thai Rama chains--- Thai Hut although not as nice looking as those places has better food better prices and better service

Thinking back we should have ordered more because it was so good and I wanted more but everything was delicious
We were promptly seated service was extremely attentive and the food was melt-in-your mouth fantastic if I could give it three thumbs up I would
Our waiter was really nice at first but seemed flustered and as if he wasn't getting the help he needed to keep up with his tables
Our food came out a good 35-40 minutes after we ordered

-pBut seriously Lux is a great place to go for that cup of coffee you're craving but consider yourself warned as others have mentioned; Lux is almost ALWAYS busy so seating and even waiting for your order can be rather inconvenient think Grand Central Station busy on weekends
Yes the service was slow; my glass was getting refilled faster by the misters than the actual waiter

That's a fair and true statement and given that the food is very good factoring in everything quality of food service atmosphere you get what you pay for but I'm going to give extra credit because this place keeps it real and doesn't try too hard unlike other places
During our several visits to this location we've had good service excellent people-watching and tasty food

The service is still super friendly and welcoming

The waiters were so friendly and so much fun
These last few times we order my Chinese salad than Chinese Chicken Salad with only 3 small slices of chicken which originally came with a nice large sliced up tenderloin of chicken

The only problem I have is that when you go inside the service is kind of slow because you have 3 people working the drive-thru and only 1 person working the inside cash register
I like the bulk prices clean store friendly staff
As an update to my last review though I have not been back I did want to acknowledge Steve - the owner - who reached out to me and apologized for my experience and said that he has identified the team member that I complained about in my last review and others have complained too and he will be working with him to ensure a nicer customer service experience
The beer selection left a lot to be desired but the Stella I ordered was cold and $7 for a 20 oz beer isn't bad

They turn the food around fast and you can always call ahead for a pick up order
That capability is great as long as the cashier rings up your order correctly which mine was not
Now for the bad  we never got around to ordering a main because of the ghetto Muzak that was being piped onto the outdoor patio area inside even in the bathrooms you could not get away
how nice it is to hear such words as you contemplate which raw fish to order
One of the keys to noting a good business are when you don't know WHO the managers are because everyone takes accountability for the store's success

Plus the staff knows the menu pretty well and they make really good recommendations
But as someone who does not living in Arizona and as someone who doesn't go to MLB baseball games in Southern California due to the fact it costs so damn much people bitching about the slow service or any other little inconvenience when it comes to seeing a game here
The stadium staff as mentioned by other reviews are mainly made up of senior citizens who were super friendly and helpful
The wonton soup was pretty good definitely the best thing we ordered
The wait staff are very attentive and are true professionals
They are usually understaffed with servers who are hard to pick out from patrons since there is no dress code to distinguish and waiting 30 minutes just for a table to have a simple breakfast is not cool

I really don't want to drive very far to get my planting needs yet I have driven even farther and gone to great lengths to try to replace my relationship with Baker Nursery and I always come back - simply they have the best plants in the city the plants and shrubs are priced fairly the staff is friendly and knowledgeable and they don't mind my questions

Overall bad food bad atmosphere unless you're 4-8 years old way too many crying 1-3 year olds when the lightening and thunder starts up and rude manager
The guy working at the counter that took our order was super friendly he took the time to ask us how are day was going and what have we been up to and stuff

The waiter was nice but did not belong in the service industry
Overall I think they did a great job with the space if they tweaked just some small things with some of the food items they could make them much better and as for service - contrary to popular belief just because you're in Scottsdale doesn't mean your staff should be wearing Ed Hardy t shirts and calling customers dude

Owner and Chef Cynthia was at the hostess stand helping direct people and she was very friendly as she directed me over to where my order was waiting

A casual place with about 15 or so tables inside a quaint market that you can peruse while you food is being made  I saw some past reviewers complain about how long it took to get your food while yes there is a wait it is because your meal is being made on the spot when you order it anyway walking through the market is a great way to spend that wait

It is a small restaurant nothing much to look at but the service was super friendly and amazingly fast

Making short work of the Soulfood plate my primary server Joseph stopped by to say ice job and asking if I had room for dessert I think he was surprised when I said yes - and even more surprised when I ordered two; one for here one to go and both eliciting a slow whistle from the gentleman to my left who said to his wife that boy can eat - and much like the savories what I ate next would be outstanding

I have been going there for 16 years since moving to the valley and was extremly disapointed with the last visit I ordered an eggplant sub and the eggplant was hard as a rock advised  the waiter who was very polite and brought the order back the next time the eggplant was just as hard and this time cold  I ad vised the cook behind the counter  who rudely told the women behind the counter to return my money and did not even apoligize or offer me something else this does not seem like a way to obtain repeat business

The service was good because they asked us how we were doing and that was pleasing

I am torn between rating this place a 3 or a 4--We spent 65 dollars plus tip and could have easily spent 20 more for just the 2 of us we went away not really full but the food quality and taste and service was great--then again the seating was cramped and outside would have been more tolerable with just an oscillating fan
okay Lola you're getting your 4 because the Sangria/Service/Quality are just that good
At that point I get a refund and call in an order to Matt's Big Breakfast for pick up

The last thing we ordered were the Spicy Korean Ribs this was my least favorite but still good
Also all the waiters waitresses and I think the owner Dana are always so friendly and welcoming that it makes you just want to stay there longer than intended

Conclusively friendly young staff quick service and amusing albeit a little on the tasteless side of decor and I'm glad I made a trip down to Chandler to try this place out
Upon ordering she told me You could do that - but it's not gonna taste very good in a pretty b****-y tone mind you
I've actually worked in the service industry before and there is a way to let a customer know that a certain dish might not be as palatable that doesn't include a rude and condescending tone
I do still continue to shop here though and recommend it to anyone wanting great service
Rolls were good but the rice was a bit on the dry sideService was excellent but the sushi did take awhile I assume this is because of the new-ness of the placeI did LOVE the fact that they had fresh wasabi extra charge and it was pureedI did LOVE that they had Vietnamesse iced coffee and sweet green tea
But I have to admit the service was really great

* The restaurant here is nice and the room service is good too
I think it's incredibly important to recognize great service when you get it and I'm glad to see others as well- the excellent service more than made up for the mishap in the steaks so it's the service that made this a 5 star review
I ordered the Sauerbrauten it was good but not the same sourness I am used to
They are definitely on the slower side at getting out your order
Our order is always taken so promptly and the staff is so nice with the kids
they're also all very sweet if the service was bad every once in awhile it happens when you've been somewhere so  many times it seems it was a kitchen issue and the waitress is quick to apologize

Extra star because the staff was amazingly nice and I almost felt bad for how disappointing the food was
Wait staff owners daughter and an middle age lady was extremely friendly even under the madhouse pace of trying their best to serve everyone
The beer selection isn't anything mind-blowing although it's not bad either but the fact that you can order 1-liter beers that come in enormous beer glasses larger than your head is a novelty we can't find much of anywhere else
Service is always excellent - we generally end up talking to our server for awhile when we're here blame the 1-liter beers and they're always really friendly and outgoing
The wonderful aroma of smokey goodness filled the air while I waited my turn to order
There was one friendly waitress while the other one gave weird looks

Great customer service - those women should be ashamed of themselves
The staff was friendly and energetic the food just WOW
Then came dessert usually we'd skip on that but one of the friends said sure why not what we got was ice cream tempura which was just a nice scoop of ice cream battered in panko flakes and cut open you NEED to try this it IS the icing on the cake

Pro's- Beautiful spacious rooms and beautiful hotel lobby- Great central location- Great for business travel- Friendly and professional staff- Right by the train line if you need public transportation downtownCon's- They charge for parking - They charge for internet use- The hotel property is very nice but the surrounding blocks can be sketchy- The indoor pool is far from remarkable- The hotel lobby takes on the smells of whatever is cooking in the kitchen which can be good or bad depending in what's cooking
The service was attentive and friendly without being overbearing
I was at the counter and service was pretty good a touch cocky which fit the atmosphere
it wins one star back for the excellent service and very friendly staff
Service is relaxed not slow to clarify on other reviews
It was so rude and disrespectful she was trying to argue her point to us which clearly showed that the server did not put in our order immediately which is probably why the server apologized to us umpteen times
So to the restaurant it's your typical fast casual restaurant you order pick up your food with a number get your own drinks salsa but a waitress comes around to refill your drinks or clear away empty plates

The staff is intelligent friendly and efficient
However she was pretty good about keeping an eye on the line and taking the orders of people in the order they arrived despite all of us lounging around the counter haphazardly
I also find myself paying for others to ensure they'll go with me again   The ambiance is fantastic and wait staff is attentive and friendly
The coffee and pastries are excellent and the staff is friendly and personable
The staff was nice and accomodating but I really wish that I was informed at booking that they were going to have a fashion show and  a live extremely loud band poolside all evening

I think the waiter would have been more attentive had we ordered drinks; the service was provided on circumstance I say this because there were older couples and a table of women in their 20s who were showered with attention--I felt neglected before our food even came out
She loved the food liked that they didn't hesitate when she special ordered her Rigatoni with a different sauce she liked the atmosphere the mixed drink was potent my lasagna was very good and we loved the side of meatballs we both ordered
I thought the service was great and the pretty attractive young man working there had a palpable appreciation for baked goods
TONS of beer and alcohol selection great menu and wonderful service
It's nicely decorated and the service is always wonderful
It's hard not to order the pizza but I've also tried the meatball sandwich and the pasta which are both also very good

Slow egregiously mis managed grossly expensive poor customer service

The food wasn't bad either and the service was excellent

The bartenders are usually friendly depending on the night that I go and are prompt with their service and the music ranges from mediocre to enjoyable but when you are drunk and I assure you the Tokyo Teas that I order are made extremely strong you don't pay attention to the sordid details
They have an excellent beer selection and the staff is knowledgeable and has given me good recommendations for beer to try
I asked the staff how they make their espresso so damn good and they said they don't do anything different; they say it's most likely the roasting machines that have been seasoned with so much use that makes it so good
Only complaint is that service was a bit on the slow side
What it does have is a friendly wait staff plenty of seating good/ok live music and a great bar selection
The service is kinda slow and they take awhile to come for your orders

Great hummus & bread had the spicy pepper Dessert a pazookie they don't call it that for obvious reasons didn't knock my socks off  but pretty darn goodVenue seems ideal for groups of 3-6 or so but can accommodate what looks like 10-12 is a good max sizeI look forward to promoting your venue to my friends

The service is quick and about as friendly as it gets for a Vietnamese restaurant and the prices cannot be beat
You'll get service with a smile great quality food and low prices
The prices are on the high side but I figure you are also paying for the waitresses looking good
SERVICEJoe and Ashley mostly Ashley took great care of our mostly ESL pack of drinkers which must have been quite a challenge as Ashley gets quite a bit of attention from male patrons due to the combination of the attire all the girls wear at this place and the particulars of her physique
I wouldn't feel bad ordering seconds after seconds
Despite the bad attitude and completely unaccomodating service we managed to rack up quite a bill between all of us

For a long time I was happy to pay the high price for a great pie but on a recent trip the poor service left a sour taste which has prompted me to visit the MANY other great pizza joints in the neighborhood
Service is great the waitstaff is friendly and attentive
Incredible pizza great ambiance and terrific service
Great service great food and really nice ambiance
This is my dilemma it's not that I hated it or thought it was bad in any way However the food was ok definitely a place I would order pizza from and pick it up and take it home
We started with the spiedini and also ordered a Sonny Boy Good Fella and the Arugula pizza
On Service-food and beverage is not a natural skill but it would be good if they trained their staff to be more attentive and friendlyThe food Poor representation of real Korean food
Lowes is so much nicer than Home Depot customer service always seems better too
the staff was all very friendly and we had one of the best waitresses ever
I'm a huge fan of the modern decor bright colors moderate prices and friendly staff
I know my dad had a steak and it looked and tasted good but I would never order it here
As we sat down a friendly waitress came and took our drink and appetizer order
If we had stopped after the meeting in the 111 degree heat after I was all sweaty and relaxed having kicked meeting ass and I'd ordered a really good Margarita it's entirely possible I would be singing this place up and down the 202
They had so many types and the store was loaded with other goodies fresh baked bread pizzas to take n bake and they have fresh to order sandwiches
We were greeted by an Unfriendly senior Latina waitress not bothering to look our way as if she was too tired to deal with another tourist as it was getting late 7pm
Food  and honestly they  need to get rid of the front staff even if is is family a lazy group of unfriendly zombies
Expect great flavors fresh ingredients good service and a place to buy in bulk many of the components of the meal you order there
I think our waiter's mom just died or something because he was in a bad mood and never smiled all night
For dessert we were presented with a complimentary rice pudding also good
Although the food was very good the service was mediocre at best the server really had a o care attitude
Service was great -and wine selection even better
It was still early enough that it was not very busy and our waiter was both delightful and extremely attentive
The service was decent and our waitress was nice
Now for the food and service we had a crabby waitress but even she couldn't ruin our great ribs tender rolls and interesting prickly pear cactus fries appetizer
Very attentive service both times I've been there
I always find them a bit rude and disinterested in customer service
We were greeted right away in a friendly manner we were shown to a table and service was AWESOME QUICK and FOOD WAS DELICIOUS AND TASTED FRESH
We had a wonderful meal were NOT rushed by staff everyone was super nice and we ended up having a great evening
safe food good service expensive without hugely breaking bank but expensive enough should that be the impression you are going for
They make a big deal about the meat being fresh never frozen 100% US raised and cooked to order and they're pretty tasty but this is a fast food burger not what I like to refer to as a backyard burger
The counter service has been good each time I've visited but I have to give a shout out to my favorite Luther who broke it all down for me and no doubt made my first visit to the Metro location go smooth
I could easily see giving 4 stars with a good waiter
Immediately after sitting down I could tell service was going to be slow with all the other tables waiting to have their orders taken
All in all the only bad experience we had was the forced valet service
The waitress we had was excellent she was knowledgeable very attentive but not annoyingly so
My wife ordered the lemonade to drink which she said was great and couldn't get enough of
The management and service is very friendly
This is in sharp contrast to the service at Lucky Strike across the way which I've found to be downright rude at times
An overall great atmosphere good portions and a friendly staff will definitely bring me back to Nick's again
The service was a bit slow and I found the atmosphere dark and depressing
My goodness everything we ordered was very tasty
It's amazing how a place with great food decor and ambiance can mess it all up by crappy waiter service
The customer service seems to be semi friendly
This is especially evident at Chelsea's Kitchen where it appears they have implemented the Houston's-style service approach which is a Good Thing
I was on a budget so I sadly only ordered a salad but a very good salad it was
I have always found the staff to be extremely friendly
Nice big portions piled on plates that I'm pretty sure were clean the staff hollering out orders to the assembly line that never seemed to cease
They play great music - mostly classic rock and the staff were all very friendly and accommodating to my freakish diet needs
This place pushes out some delicious food Red chile burro with rice and beans is better than any I've had and their Nachos are soooo freaking cheesey and good you'll want to order both for one sitting
Service has always been great and friendly I think I have eaten there about 25 times in the last year and I have always been extremely happy
The bad I was standing in line to pay and the assistant manager was going through his routine with the customer in front of me
Frankly the place wasn't that busy and he had a lot of people on the garage floor so I'm not sure exactly why the customer service was so bad
My wife ordered a breakfast burrito that she was enamored with
I love the layout the decor the staff the coffee and bar drinks their baked goods - at least I did until I tried the cookies
I ordered chicken and waffles and the Bo ordered a breakfast burrito
We stuck with happy hour food and did not order dinner so I cannot review their food but if you're looking for an upscale yet highly affordable happy hour this is a great spot
The first time our service was beyond slow and orders all screwed up but they made it right
Friendly atmosphere and the staff is trying
That all being said the food is fine service was slow and all things were done with attitude been there twice and had the same experience with different people
You may be lucky and get a friendly waitress - but there were none in sight when I was there
The staff was nice enough and since it was my birthday I had gotten an email with a buy one get one free deal
As a token of good faith - the waiter offered up a second desert for free in lieu of my birthday email offer - let's see - a $5 desert in place of a $25 meal - nice try - FAIL
We got there a little too late for breakfast but we were happy to order drinks Brooke- a mojito yum

The service is always fast and everyone is always very friendly
It can get busy on weekends but it's a very nice little place to enjoy some good food at good prices and with friendly staff
usually VERY fast unless there's a hella rushService so friendly that it's almost scary
and if it just wasnt for you then fine but I have never had them myself and cant imagine I would ever order them because they looked good or good for you
A common theme between this restaurant and their Peoria location is slow drink service and I cannot understand how that can be when the place is 70% empty at the start of lunch service 11am
Great customer service tell me I'm making a mountain out of a mole hill I really want to hear that after you served me dog food
It was so good I ended up ordering another one because the first one was devoured so fast
It stands out in my mind how friendly and courteous the staff always was which as I know now isn't always easy when you're dealing with little smartasses like I undoubtedly was as a six year old
The fabulous coffee and friendly wait staff we have always encountered here is what seperates a great local business and chain restaraunts
The setting is lovely rooms are sumptuous one year we did get one that was pretty rickety and needed a do-overhowever staff is very friendly and generally accomodating
Had the Pastrami sandwich and Tomato Bisque Our table also ordered the Ahi Salad and the vegetarian chicken salad along with edamame and truffle oil fries off the snack menu  all was very good
My fiancu00e9 and I both ordered their KK's breakfast which consisted of three pieces of fried chicken two waffles we both added pecans to our waffles cheese grits and scrambled eggs with cheddar cheese and onions

I guess its possible but I order so much variety that it pretty much rules out having a bad experience because a single item wasn't good that night
The atmosphere is pretty basic service was friendly and the food was pretty good and reasonable
The price is also good especially for how much food they give you in one order
It should be stated in fairness that the counterperson who took our order was enthusiastic and friendly
The service was prompt and professional the food was delicious and as ordered and the atmosphere was nice
We managed to top it off with dessert lemon meringue pie and creme brulee and both were pretty good although I was honestly too full to enjoy that course myself
They are seriously understaffed/have just 2 will call windows the guys checking IDs were soooooooo slow/drunk/chewing a wad of tobacco about the size of a baseball
After the wheeling and dealing of the clearly commission based staff I had to be rude and say Look I just want my computer to receive my email
Service was attentive and timely waiter was very knowledgeable and we were very impressed with the quality and flavor of the food

The service has always been good for us and friendly
the food is great and the service is quick

Overall I would rate this a five for quick service good wash and even a pretty good hand dry
The waitress was 93 years old and rude as they come
We placed our order with a very friendly server that was a natural at making small talk and joking around instead of coming off as peeved that we were taking too long to examine The Daily Guano
The staff is very friendly they typically hit their 5-7 minute statement and it's one of my favorite burgers anywhere now
If you like top-notch Thai food a great ambiance and excellent service then this is the restaurant for you
This place is definitely one of my favorites in Scottsdale and its not because the staff is the best or the rooms are the nicest its the amenities and other little things that put it over the top
While I wasn't concerned about it he noticed his own service was too slow and he promised to make it up to me
The atmosphere was laid back service was a little slow but I wasn't in a rush
So the slow service wasn't a negative for me

The menu has a variety of options to choose from with lighter fare fresh rolls soups and salads to more traditional Thai fare curry dishes noodle dishes fried rice and more and of course desserts that sound oh so good
I will take my business somewhere that understands what good customer service is
He told her if the appetizer she ordered was not enough as an entree the soup could be brought out fast but he never asked her again if she wanted the soup

Regardless I would definitely recommend checking this place out Great sushi laid back atmosphere great service and great prices

The service was fast all the servers were Chinese goes without saying in general but after visiting a few Scottsdale 'Chinese' restaurants it's no longer a given
The service was good and the employee who helped us was very fluent in ramen knowledge
The service has always been decent if not GREAT
I ordered a beer and soup then I asked for a group shot with the girls and was so rudely denied I immediately got up and walked out without finishing my beer or waiting for the soup

But that's about where the good service stopped for the day

I noticed the place is not very clean and in general they seemed to have allot of staff on hand we had a good server but there were allot of employees standing around being worthless for the most part
The service here was really good and they were very friendly
I have had other stuff from here since I've worked and lived nearby for the past 10 years and it's otherwise decent service and passable fast food but with so many other affordable and decent Mexican joints around with drive-thru windows this isn't worth it for lunch or dinner either unless you're in a real time crunch
But they do get a star because the service was very attentive
Staff was friendly owner was available and attentive
Clean nice massaging pedicure chairs and super nice staff
I hope that as time goes they will upgrade the greeting area with friendly staff promptly honor your reservation and the waiters become more knowledgeable and considerate of every patron

I have had the same waitress the 3 of 4 times I have gone and all I can say to describe her is rude

The waiter Orlando was cute and attentive to our 8pm theater time
I ordered the Pseudo Stroganoff; a vegan dish made with seitan that was quite good
The service is always great the food isn't anything to really rave about
Anyway the service is nice and the food is reasonably priced  and it's in a pretty good location
While our service was attentive enough our waiter kept attempting to talk us out of what we wanted to order and tried to sell us something different
It didn't knock my socks off but it was a pleasant experience with attentive service decent ambiance and moderate prices
The building was cool and full of character and the service was very friendly

looking sad we began to walk out when the very nice and generous hostess or manager
We ordered from the happy hour to start - tofu REALLY good but only 3-4 pieces 2 samosas yummy for not being fried and my bf got the 3 chicken wings he said they were spicy
Luckily the waitress said under her breath that they are NOT good and then said after wow I should really not have said that I appreciaited it though
While the food is still easily the best chain fast food out there the service leaves much to be desired
Unlike the other Culver's locations I have been to the staff at this location are not very friendly
Yes the place is nice but it is true the service needs a lot of work
Great so I asked if they sold Roast Duck which they did and had asked how early I should place my order since I wasn't sure if they would run out
Both times the food was ultra slow coming out I actually thought the girl forgot to put the order in the first time this happened
I feel bad because they probably get tipped out off the crappy tips that people leave the wait staff
We even approached the blond manager to ask for service and she was completely rude and had a total lack of desire to help us
Second from the hostess to the manager to the cook who waved at me from the kitchen EVERYONE was warm friendly polite helpful and dare I say downright CHEERFUL
It was everything as advertised ambiance very casual  GOOD Food excellent service   Adria was very good and made good recommendations  and fair prices

Service is good and they work quickly and efficiently
The service was top notch and the food was all around great quality
Aside from the typical fast food stuff which I'm not a fan of they have some random restaurants that boast high prices small menus and ridiculously slow service
I went in unannounced didn't tell anyone about a previous bad experience and I was given some of the best service I've received in town

Not a bad meal overall I tried my girlfriend's BLT and it was to die for and will order that if I go back there
I found the restaurant to be much cleaner than on my initial visit and the service was so attentive and so quick
But definitely try the Vito specialty Deep Dish it is good pizza and I would go back for sure   The service is good as well and it has a very homely feel to it I wanted to try the tiramisu but was so stuffed after my one piece of the large which fed 4 of us with 4 slices left over mmm  I did have a piece of pizza bread and a sliver of fried zucchini though both of which were pretty good
It's clean the service is fast and the food is tasty and healthy unlike most everything else in that shopping center
For the ticket price and the rooms and service this is a good deal
Service was on our side and I can only say they were kind and friendly all the way same as FAST
Very cheap prices and friendly staff even though I would honestly expect a huge italian guy yet I am greeted by two awesome women help round it out and keeps Schreiner's at the absolute top of my list
The waitresses who BTW are very good promoters & up-sellers of their food and products definitely make the limited menu items sound better than they actually were
I was impressed with how friendly the staff was and the food was pretty good too
Either I was spoiled by the great customer service in my area or the service here is really that horrible

Eating inside is incredibly loud but the service is great and it's completely worth it
Went there tonight after an unexplained hiatus of a few months I was on hiatus not Corbin's and I realized that dinner was good the previous lunches and dinners were good service was good atmosphere is good
In summary Corbin's isn't blow-your-socks-off good but they are consistently decent reasonably priced and have decent service
We had a $40 Groupon and ordered 3 nice dishes

It's very clean organized and the staff are friendly
Office staff was generally very friendly for a bit they had this smooookin' hot girl in there which always made paying rent a little less painful

OMG it was so good we rushed back over and I ordered some tacos and have been hooked ever since
But the service is always good so I feel like a jerk for not tipping which results in fewer visits here
Otherwise the food is ok for what it is but the service is slow
It's not crowded service and food selection are still great and it's cheaper
This is one of the best hole in the wall diner/sports bars I've been to that was actually fun great burger and the staff are all very friendly a little slow but friendly

We were convinced that our waitress had to be an owner or manager based on her attentiveness but she said not
Really great service and food and what seems to be a major selection of adult beverages

When they dane to answer you you will  get a rude and surly answer similar to If you weren't smart enough to order it that way your lossThis kind of customer service does not earn your money no matter how hungry you are

The service was as great as I remember and the people were just as nice as I remember too
When we got there the waitress was nice & even took the time to tour the menu with us

They had a great variety the dim sum was not greasy and the service was decent
They blamed it on the manufacturer and slow demand for the piece but the manufacturer said in an email to me they were surprised at that response and couldn't find an order from Ladlow's for the item
The service can be a bit awkward in my previous visits with refills indeed taking some time and I have to feel bad for the waiters who have a limited amount of work to do since clients basically choose their own menu barring some dessert choices that I haven't nor may I ever choose to take
The service has been very good so far with friendly bartenders and servers who are pretty prompt in delivering the drinks which is no small feat given that each one is handcrafted and unique
The service overall was really friendly and prompt and I didn't have a whole lot of complaints on that end

Service was friendly and it was very clean
Miyahira and staff it was a very positive experience in a bad situation
As far as decor the restaurant does a good job of sticking to an anti-doctor theme with signs plastered all over the restaurant warning you of the unhealthy nature of their food mandatory patient gowns for all diners and waitresses dressed as cute nurses
With that and the friendly service in mind I can't justify any rating lower than 2/5
David was our waiter and had lots of great recommendations
As always presentation was spot-on and the service was great

4 stars4 The sushi chefs here do not take sushi orders verbally which is de rigeur at good sushi bars
They really fill your sushi order one by one and it's slow going

The staff doesn't appear to have a high turnover and is friendly and prepared to offer suggestions or chit-chat

Their breakfast oatmeal served with raising brown sugar and milk is some of the best I've ever tasted so much so that I asked the waitress what kind of oatmeal they used Quaker Slow Oats is what was explained to me
The coffee was excellent the service friendly without being too friendly and the restaurant itself was very clean and nicely if simply appointed
Even if I go for work with a large group the service is good the food is great and the prices are very fair
While the staff is very friendly sometimes it seems as if the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing

It was a bad combo of new kitchen guy/bad waitress
Overall great pasta and decent prices with good service
The guys ordered beers and us ladies had non-alcoholic beverages so not sure how their Margs are but as I could see many people ordered them so they must be good
We all ordered the same thing pretty much two of us got red enchiladas pretty good
What I love about this place is the staff is friendly and they have their own NRGize Cafe that i love getting the shakes from

Pros=interesting concept great food and serviceCons=seating is very close to other diners
Didn't comp the drink I didn't drink I felt obliged to tip both the waitress and valet modestly but overall arrived almost a half an hour after my friends at Chelsea's and it was a very bad experience all around
3 hours  versus lifetime of amusement   it's worth itDTraffic control is really good and unlike BOB where  waiting for 20 mins is usual we've been  orderly  walking  get car and out in that time

Friendly staff prompt check-in free Wi-Fi free breakfast free parking business center comfortable rooms that are very very clean and a 42 flat panel when you just need to kick back after a busy day and unwind by squeezing in a little ESPN Sportscenter before bed
Quality of food overall was good but it was really more about having your dessert and eating it too just in terms of everything being full on fat+flavor
The casual atmosphere is right up my alley for a weekend breakfast and my yogi omelette / protein pancake orders have stayed consistent too
This is the 2nd time my Wife and I have been here and we've experienced wonderful very attentive service and our dinner was great
While the hotel itself is beautiful and the rooms extremely nice finding a helpful staff member was a hit-or-miss

+ 1 for the chocolate -2 for the overabundance of arugula and not enough tuna +1 for the bread + 1 for the fast service
We got recommended the Hawaiian Breakfast and the Breakfast burrito so we ordered that
The lady taking our order was not the most friendly person you will ever meet and the bar section was to close to the dinning room section so you get the full effect of being a loud drinker without having to pay 4-5 bucks for a beer
The service staff is extremely helpful and attentive
The bartender gave great service and made great food recommendations
We tried it out again for breakfast and I even dared to order the bottomless mimosa after the OJ nightmare the first time and they were good
All the food we've ordered has been pretty good because of the plates it seems like small portions but they are actually decent sized
Great atmosphere love both the patios good service and good food
Service was good---meaning I just got off a plane and wanted to get drunk fast and they made it happen
The only reason why I don't give it 5 stars is because the service could be super slow and the waiters tend to forget about you
request for an extra fork resulted in server immediately handing one from another unused placesetting at another table pace of service timely but not rushing and waitstaff frequently attentive
The place was pretty empty but the drinks were good and the staff was nice
1st sat at the bar and just had drinks with a friend the staff was nice and quick
Hotel front desk - very nice and speedy service

The service was good and the place clean with plenty of seating inside and out
I had a good laugh at this while I waited on my orders of there classic money island dogs
They were serving hot cereal Skillet scrambles baked pancakes and hot coffee drinks along with all the other goodies they create in their 65' Airstream trailer turned kitchen and cocktails from behind the bar of what the owner told us used to service Chicagoans before during and after prohibition
i didnt think i would have to give a department store like this a bad review and it comes down to customer service
Scramble is mostly a breakfast joint hence the name where you order at the counter pay and take a seat while you wait for someone to deliver the food
Ordered from the Happy Hour menu and there was not one bad item on there
The service was b+ However when you factor in the reasonable price ~27 per full steak entree including salad and fixins and great atmosphere it rounds a complete and excellent experience
Even though the service was imperfect it was mainly because our waiter was overzealous to do a good job
I had the Tiki Bastard cocktail very tasty also had the Pain KIller which had a little too much ice but it was good I feel the atmosphere is very laid back and the service was really good we had a large group and Misty our server was on it
I cant forget to mention the prices for the quality of the food and great service the prices are very lowtry it
While we were dining I noticed most people were ordering what looked like a steaming large cauldron of mixed grilled meats and fish  I found out this dish is called Malcajete and it looked great to try
once they sell your table before talking to you  they become exceptionally rude not just the waitress but management as well
Before I was even done talking to my friendly Hyundai servicewoman Donna the guy from Enterprise already walked in saying he was ready to take me to my rental car whenever I was ready
the staff were really friendly and i'm sure could hold court on any conversation
The service is great and the servers we have had are very nice and welcoming as well
My friends and I ordered their Pizza Bianco which was good but not great
Customer Service was AWEFUL on a scale of 1-5 food was 1 drinks were ok the only good thing was the atmosphere which is NOT going to change my mind about going back there I've had much much better fish tacos @ Rubio's & Baja Fresh for fraction of the price & didn't have to go to dinner somewhere else after leaving which we had to do after leaving Tortilla Factory
There are Plenty of Great places in Scottsdale with Great food Great service Great drinks & Great atmosphere
So if you want BAD Service Over Priced & Tasteless food & like to waste your money this is the place for you
I wasn't too impressed with the menu selections either btw there was like 5 salads and 6 sandwiches for lunch but i guess it is BREAKFAST clubThe omelet wasn't very good - I'm not sure if it was because I should've ordered a meat along with the mushroom or the 1/4 lb brick of cheese inside but overall it was bland and the cheese was just ridiculous even after I pulled the excess goo out
All in all - the service was great the hash browns were good and I loved the strips of red and yellow peppers in it but did not like the menu selections which were pretty limited and the entrees
We ordered  a 12 pizza with a great sauce mozzarella goat cheese sun dried tomatoes and grilled chicken excellent
Lots of combinations on the menu to make anyone happy good portion sizes and fun waitstaff
Great service great food make sure you add this to your list of places to try
We ordered our food which was ok we did have the couple appetizier then short ribs good but our califlower came out 10 minutes after we were served our ribs
He was incredibly slow in delivering drinks we only ordered iced tea and only came by to refill once
Our waiter Frank was also wonderful and knew everything about the menu and was very attentive
One expects slower service with a party this size but I guess we were out of sight and mind
The appetizers and desserts were especially slow in coming and adding insult to injury those who ordered their desserts to go were served a good 10 minutes before those who wanted theirs served
The service was good and our food came out fast
After getting a good look I decided to call and talk with the manager Debbie to tell her how bad the cut was and I'd be back for a refund in about 15-20 minutes
My experience  4 visits sitting in the bar = great service
1 visit sitting in the dining room = painfully slow service
I did voice my opinion to the Manager he was a nice guy so no disrespect sir but train your staff
To be fair the last time I was there  the manager noticed I didn't eat very much and asked me why & when I  told her it just wasn't very good she was very apologetic immediately refunded me and offered me a free dish of anything on the menu
Lastly the service is great and the people are extremely friendly

For fast food it is good/acceptable as long as you don't come during lunch time during the week or order the salads
We shared huckleberry tart for dessert it had pastry cream and less huckleberries than I was expecting but it was good  soon we were ready for the check but they bring us out these tiny BAKED chocolate mousse that tasted light as chocolate air

As others have said here I have been pleasantly surprised with the decent prices the friendly prompt service here
This location is not open weekends but maybe that is what keeps them amiable and I have been willing to work around that fact for the good service

It's a casual place with soda machines and a friendly efficient staff
Service was great - since we told them it was our first time coming to the restaurant & we were locals they gave us a 20% card for our next visit

The staff was friendly personable and consistently showed a sense of urgency with every table
The prices I can forgive if the service is at least going to be good

Service was on the slow side but I would say normal for any restaurant serving tables outside
; Check-out people are friendly and quick; Overall staff is always helpful then again it could be because I'm a gal and they probably think I'm helpless and don't  know what a #10 bolt is or how to install a toilet

Im not a big fan of mexican rice so I didn't partake in eating it however the fan of mexican rice at the table liked it but not as much as the fajitas Conclusion - Excellent Staff Great Food Its Tex-Mex
The staff is friendly and informative at both places but Supremo has more of a feel of a roach coach that just happens to be inside of a building while Sabroso embraces the general restaurant and service concept better

The wait staff is super nice and even noticed I had dyed my hair since we are there that often

Z Pizza has a great atmosphere the staff is always very friendly and they deliver in a timely manner downtown
Staff was friendly and relatively attentive although I watched our meals sit in the window for at least 7 minutes while several of the wait staff danced around each other filling little cups with dressings and other condiments
Our waitress was a bit distant personality-wise but wasn't rude
Other than that you'll be sure to find great service engaged employees and most of all great food
This place is great from the restaurant to the to-go service to the grocery store
I love the service by a waitstaff that has worked there for 20+ years - they are on top of your order attentive not obtrusive and very knowledgeable about the menu
They serve breakfast so that's a plus; however you would do better to order lunch at breakfast time
Ray's selection of frames is great the store is very cool and you can't beat their customer service
what else can I say it is a great service
Places that make good food and offer the kind of customer service these places do and family owned is always a plus for me
Again the management was great but they really need to take a look at who they having working in service before they lose more customers
The waitstaff has been very helpful and friendly and although they understandly can't speak with authority about all of their beers they were always willing to get me one of the owners - who are beer gurus - to answer my questions
service is awesome; they are so genuine and friendly
THE SCOOPThe staff here were great from the folks that checked us in to the housekeeping staff
The breakfast was definitely impressive made to order eggs bacon french toast you name it
This guy was not helpful with the menu and I hate it when you ask what is good or what is your favorite or mabey the most ordered dish and all they say is everything is good not sure what the best is
She made me think that if she is in such a genuinely good mood her staff is probably top notch
I was a little confused and didn't know how to order my Sunday breakfast first we had to find seating from there get in line order and then apparently you go pick up your own food inside when they call your name

The staff is super friendly and nice the classes are fun and it's always a pleasure to shop there
However due to the slow service our wine bottle was empty long before the food came
The gnocchi was very good and everyone else seemed to enjoy their order as well
Awesome-The staff is pretty cool-You almost never need a tee time you can show up and they will usually fit you in no problem-No dress code a huge plus while playing in the summer-A pretty forgiving course wider fairways-Cheap hotdogs in the snack area and they pump the AC pretty cold in the lounge-No doglegs on the course I fucking hate those-They don't seem to give a shit when you smuggle your own beer on the course-No punk kid cleaning your clubs 2 seconds after you are done playing so you feel obligated to give him a tipThe Con's-A good portion of the grass is fucked up
Bordering on two stars but the room is nice enough to keep it at 3
I went downstairs for breakfast and it took forever for the waitress to come over so I went up and got my oatmeal and fruit
I also ordered egg cheese and ham on an english muffin from their breakfast menu which is served all day

The pasta part was just ok- Beignets really good crispy small balls but more sweet than savory cheesy- Peanut butter chocolate pie my fave dessert combo which I liked a lotMidlights- Key lime pie I'm a big fan of key lime but in this version the flavors weren't distinct enough so I'd call in just okLowlights- Menu on website doesn't match menu at the restaurant so hub was disappointed on no prime ribFood was fine and hear it's fun for drinks so might try going there sometime when I'm in the area
Our server was OK he was kinda slow in between courses and when we wanted to order but since we were hangin' with friends it didn't matter too much

It's not the cheapest in town and there are some full service restaurants around that may do the chicken better I would still choose LoLo's or Tuck Shop for chicken and waffle over LFC's chicken and waffle - but as far as fast food fried chicken goes - LFC is worlds better than KFC Popeye's or Church's

For desert we ordered a cannoli and instead of one large one they brought out two mini cannoli so we could each have our own these were very good with the shells having just a hit of cinnamon with very good consistency on the filling they definitely used ricotta instead of mascarpone which is how I grew up on cannoli
Friendly service not too crowded we didn't have to wait but we took one of their last empty tables inside and good well balanced food I will definitely be back
First the wings were huge which was good because we only got about 8 for the 1lb order
Comfort foods should always be generous portions and have a nice home cooked feel to it in order to be successful
I could go without that part because people are just piled up and it makes it go a lot slower since you can't put an order in because 10 people in front of you are just standing waiting for their dogs to cook
It's intimate so I can actually talk to my friends and not over the music has great wine and liquor list priced reasonably relative to other places great service and knowledgeable staff
The staff was friendly and accomodating - service was quick and they accepted a coupon I had from localdines for $30 of food with no issues something I recommend grabbing if you are headed here anytime soon
She turned us off so bad that no one in the party decided to order anything
We sat down and got our menu's it was the dinner menu and WAY too expensive for us - we thought about leaving just then but decided to order drinks and an appetizer oh yea no drink menu so I guess you have to wait for the bill to see how much the drinks were but then the waitress who was very nice suggested the lunch menu - much better but still priced a little high
If you're ever in Central Phoenix near 7th Avenue and Thomas and need a bite for breakfast or lunch 5th Avenue Cafe may really surprise you with their homey atmosphere friendly service good food and low prices
Nice selection on the menu too bad I can't stop ordering the burger long enough to try other things
Line can get long fast because cashiers stop taking orders to make a milkshake if someone orders one
But we enjoyed the Gallo Blanco had a great service great drinks and tacos
fussy wait staff and not particularly attentive
Service was friendly and my chopped chicken salad was delicious i was pleasantly surprised that i liked the buttermilk dressing as i am usually not a fanit really complimented the avocado blue cheese bacon and chicken
The staff was very friendly and our waitress was sweet
My colleagues ordered some pasta that looked great but those were somewhat small portions
Overall food and  atmosphere were great but the service was exceptional
service was great but on a wknd be prepared to wait
However the service is fvery fast and friendly so if it's busy you don't have to wait too long for a table
On to their staff nothing but great experiences I can order fast and take a seat and just wait for my food
Fill that out with minestrone soup hot sourdough with butter and attentive service and you have a great meal
I don't often order seafood in the desert because of the freshness factor but I thought I was safe at Carlsbad
The service was good thankfully; and they offered to replace my meal with something else
If your order doesn't fall into the abyss you can expect delicious heavily-topped like I like it pizza in a very clean but familiy-friendly setting
And service wasn't as bad as advertised at least not for me
Service was fast and helpful probably because they're a little over-staffed
Service - Our server was particularly friendly and my coffee never went empty
I was warmly greeted and the staff were attentive and friendly
I wanted to mention this to the staff but they were so nice that I didn't have the heart to say anything
The food is decent service was a little slow but maybe thats cuz after a few drinks my brother kept asking our waitress 'When are you gona open one of these in Northern CA
My experience with customer service was pretty good
Oh and their staff is very friendly and helpful
Server was GREAT and the food was GREAT and the manager was GREAT
Service was good and friendly but the pizza sub-par IMO
Their house-brewed beers are great--the first time I came I ordered the sampler where you can try them all there are quite a few choices or you can ask for a taste of one you think you want
The service is usually good and the food is surprisingly good for a brewery
the food is great -- try the vegetable medley -- and the staff is excellent
Great service fun atmosphere and I will definitely be back to enjoy another one of their delicious meals
Not really impressed with the service but the food was great
Our reservation was later we were sat at a bad table and before we could tell the waitress we weren't satisfied she was gone
Like I said the food was good a couple of surprises we would have liked to know about but the service and experience was marginal
The bar staff is great and it's important to note this place does everything Good
But the service was pretty good considering the crowd
I have been to this location a few times and the service has been good
The hot salsa has a nice flavor and may be worth getting a side order of chips with
The bartender/waitress finally came over and had such a bad attitude
I'll grant that the place seems clean and the staff are friendly enough
You should provide good service if you are expecting a tip from any customer and shouldn't have to ask for it
The staff was very friendly but unfortunately the food was mediocre at best
I know you shouldn't expect great service at a buffet but is it to much to expect that when your not busy to show us to or seat within 5 minuets of us coming in instead of you watching an afternoon soap
Pros-nice ambiance-friendly service-nice menu options-fair prices-hot sauces on tables are awesomeCons-carne asada is smoked with mesquite I think and tastes likes it's been covered in bbq sauce-not the biggest fan of the chicharron de queso husband liked it though-service was a little slow they set themselves up for failure on this by giving you tiny ass water glasses-coke is served by the can for $1
Been going once a week for a few months the staff knows us and are very friendly
Service is faster than any other restaurant we've been to downtown
Staff was super friendly and we were seated by Larry Lo-Lo White himself
The staff was friendly and seemed to know their menu pretty well
It was as we were getting fine dining customer service in a fast food style restaurant
Overall the food was great and the customer service made it that much better
The service was outstanding everyone was very nice and the food came out quickly
My service rep is Donna and she's always been great very considerate of my needs and works with my schedule and budget
Friendly welcoming staff is always a plus to me
A waiter came and let us know which was really nice of him
Be prepared to wait for a table and once you sit the service is slow but if you know that going in it's fine
They have a good selection of wines and the staff can be helpful if they aren't preoccupied or busy
The wine list has a nice selection and is broken into their regular list which is basically what most people will order from and a special list where the entry price on the wine is $120+
They took a single order and split it across three plates nice touch
It wasn't bad but I doubt I'd order it again
There is no lack of rum in the cake and to top it off they light some Bacardi 151 and drizzle the burning liquid on top of the dessert which makes for a nice presentation
The service the first time was a 10+ out of 10 with the 7am server being very friendly very helpful and made the whole experience even better
This past Weds morning it was good nice perfect service and friendly
Service is friendly and they box their cupcakes well so as to make sure they arrive safely at their final destination
The service is great as well really friendly waitstaff who ensure your order is taken promptly you get refills when needed and your food is serviced hot
The restaurant itself is nice good atmosphere and the service has always been good
The waitress that day was not so attentive and we had to flag her down a couple of times
-Nice patiocomplete with shade and misters-TV set up is great and the staff was very accommodating for football Sundays-The staff is great
The manager even went out of his way to make sure we had a great experience-Complete with a very nice crowd of regulars the Mayor even bought me and the boys -It's a Saints bar-Pretty good food except the nacho cheese is grossMy only complaint is that it's a family barI like kids but not when I'm at a bar
The customer service in the store is good
I thought overall the service was great
Not only was our waitress extremely attentive but the manager stopped by to make sure we were enjoying our foodI give The Flaming Kabob 3 stars
In addition we ordered the brushetta - mmmm mmmm good
there's even a vegan spigot2 Toppings galore--everything sweet and salty under the sun3 Really comfortable space with outdoor seating4 Super friendly and helpful staff I picked up nine cups of deliciousness for a meeting and the girl behind the counter did everything in her power to expedite the process so I could deliver with minimal meltage5 Great price
went from friendly waitress to unfriendly waitress to other food and drink deliverers who had no idea who ordered what
Both the sandwich & the slim-cut peel-on fries ordered well done were good generously sized & a good value
I had no idea what to order from their expansive menu I never know whether to order breakfast food or lunch food at places like this
The staff is friendly and the maid service is good
the service was friendly but it did seem like they forgot about us at some point
2% which could be my new favorite beer it is a unfiltered wheat bock amazingOne of the nice touches is that they have the proper beer glass to go with each beer they have on tap in the appropriate sizes and the largest karmeliet glass i have ever seen and they have a lot of imports on the list so they are doing great in the strong ale category - which is my favorite type of beerAs i was looking at the menu I asked if they had foie gras because i saw a picture on their facebook page and Mario told me they always have that as an off the item menu and it could be prepared however I would like it - which sounded great to meFoie Gras torchon with toast points honey comb apples cherries - also had a lemon tuille and some micro greens as wellThe honeycomb was a very nice touch because it got the sweetness however the bonus was the nice texture it added to the overall My friend ordered Heirloom Tomatoes and Gioia Burrata and i got a taste of that it was a great salad and had small bread sticks and fresh pesto on it as well very light and refreshing - just the thing after foie gras for my main i ordered the crispy half duck it was confit duck style the skin was very crispy and it was a huge portion - the duck was very good the crispy duck skin fat had lots of flavor with it - and i was happy to have confit again since i still dream of the chez dumonet duck i had in Paris this summer - my only change i would have made was the side items it was served with i would have liked dauphine potatoes - with that said it was the best duck i have had in AZ and i was happy it was not just seared duck breast My friends ordered the spinach Gnochi Black Tagliolini Mediterranean Sea BassI tried the Sea Bass which was was very good with the skin on crispy and crab on top the pasta dishes all looked amazing although i didnt get to try them i will certainly be trying them on my next visitrubee while i was there quite a few people ordered the crispy ribs - they looked great and everyone said they were deliciousSeems like there will be specials each day as well based on what looks good in the market everything coming out of the kitchen looked great - finally a place with an awesome beer list and delicious food - looking forward to seeing what they do with their cocktail list will certainly be back and it is nice they have parking
The staff upfront are generally inattentive and often chatting with each other rather helping customers
I read a few things below about not-so-good service and I'm having a hard time believing it was the same restaurant
The lady who took my order was very receptive and made some great suggestions including not being too exploratory with my food on my first visit
Our waitress was really friendly attentive and patient
My mom ordered the deluxe breakfast sandwich which she really enjoyed
I have been to different Arriba locations and the food has always been consistent and I have always had very good service here
The bartender promptly served me immediately upon arriving and even bought one of my beers to make up for the bad service
Our waitress was a little slow we had to flag her down every time we wanted something which was a little annoying and she didn't know what a Kir Royale was
The next evening we all hung out at the pool and it was really great that although the pool closed at 10 pm we hung out past midnight and the hotel staff was totally cool with it
THIRD DATE Regardless of my initial bad first impressions the staff at the Saguaro really managed to change my entire viewpoint
Even the custodial staff is SUPER FRIENDLY & CARING
Let's get back to basics here - when you go to a restaurant although its great to have good service ambiance etc the real reason you go is for the food
We did have great service and a really nice time but to rate this place anything under a 5 - just for the quality of the culinary experience would be unfair
The bottom line at Fuego Bistro - although service was very good and the place is really cool - is the food
And it was -- great thought out menu and helpful but unobtrusive service
2 stars for the torta dessert - not that goodAmbience and service are great
Pretty fast service for  a line out the door on a Saturday afternoon  it was already past one and people were hungry  big orders in and out and lots of people
The service was excellet and attentive so 1 star for that
They also have stiff drinks in large amounts at reasonable prices great food and good enough service considering how busy they always are
The lady that took my order was very nice
Excelllent staff really affordable spay and neuter and clinical services; took very good care of my prized kitten no problems at all
Service great  decor a step above the Valley norm and presentation make this one of the best all round Thai meals I've had in the region
The staff has always been friendly and never messed up an order
It was so good that I have ordered it every other visit plus I bought my own panini grill for home so I can have the Urban Picnic-style sandwich for dinner once in a while
the staff was friendly and the restaurant was clean and small but cozy
tott's provided a great experience with great service and tasty food
I don't consider that good customer service at all
I have ordered many items off the menu and I have never run in to a bad one yet
The service could not have been worse--everyone seemed slow and apathetic
I really enjoy McDonald's from time to time but unfortunately they were unable to keep up their end of the deal - great fast food and service
Staff was friendly upbeat  and made great suggestions
I was greeted with a very friendly staff with prompt fast service
The staff is friendly though and they're helpful
Their macaroons are good so if you're going to Essence I say just order the macaroons and leave it was actually the only worth while bakery good that I thought the price did it justice
The ambiance was relaxed but intimate with dim lighting candle lit tables and good service
The interior is clean the staff friendly the patio could definitely use some attention but you just cannot get past the food
I also noticed that some of their wine was bad the waitress went through several bottles before finding a good one and they don't seem to be keeping all their wine/beer in stock as some of it was unavailable after ordering off the menu
Always good service  and little to no wait but make an appointment if you feel more comfortable
We service was a little slow even though we were the only ones in here but the food most definitely made up for it
While the food was very good and the proportions were satisfying the service was not good
The quality of the pizza tends to be somewhat inconsistent  and at times can be quite good while at other times we've received a soggy crust with toppings that look like the kitchen staff must have had a contest to see who could stand on the other side of the kitchen and toss the most ingredients onto the crust sadly most of them missed
but we ordered a TON of food and a TON of drinks well they did not me Its a great first date or special occasion type of place a little pricey for an every day dinner kind of night
Yasu is a nice quaint restaurant perfect for a date or gathering with good friends seating is intimate and the staff is attentive and friendly
Mmmm  Service was very slow and I had to stop a manager to ask where our food was luckily they brought it out just then
I never went to a sit down Pita Jungle so the slow service seemed liked an eternity
The staff are generally pretty friendly and Dominique the GM runs a pretty tight shop
I like the idea of every bottle is only $125 for service there is no drink over the price of $8 and that you have great people that work for you
Also when we went to get our drinks and also the entire time we were eating there was a self-important looking manager talking with one of his fellow collegues rudely standing dead center in front of the soda fountain
The service was great both times consistent and friendly
I have never really had good service here but the good food makes me not mind as much
If you are all about great service then skip it
Then came the friendly bartender service Adam who informed us of their happy hour and 1/2 price happy hour app specials etc
I have only dined in 2 times and the service was great both times even though it was pretty packed
The food in the dining area is good and the service is solid
I would not agree with other reviews however of the great customer service there
Some of the employees do give great customer service some do not
Safeway generally does not have the best overall pricing they are generally on the higher end of the pricing scale their reputation has always been the great service
They have always provided good customer service
The service was very slow and the place was empty except for maybe 2 regulars
In fact despite the extremely busy and loud atmosphere his excellent and attentive service made it feel like he was our personal server - and I noticed that he was giving everyone around his end of the bar the same service
I didn't find the customer service very friendly
We decided on the drunken bread a our appetizer a recommendation from the very friendly and attentive waiter
As for myself I usually have trouble deciding what I want and when I asked the waiter what he recommended he told me that one of the dishes I was debating on was actually his favorite so I ordered the papardelle with slow roasted pork sauce
The staff are great people always welcoming and they have great food great specials
I must say they have very quick service and great prices though
Great ambience friendly quick service and fantastic food
We were seated on the patio and saw a couple waiters roaming around the patio area so we figured that we were good to go
The food is decent so it gets an extra star for that but with service this bad when the place is slow I can't imagine what it is like when a football or hockey game is going on
The first sign that it was good was the staff
The service was perfect and the food was great
I've been here four or five times now and always had good service
The service was very good and our waitress Noelle was really helpful and took very good care of us
Service started off slow on a slow night and then ended up downright dismissive
Saturday we a had pretty cool waiter who was attentive enough but I bet it was because he had other tables nearby so we were easier to wave him over
Every time I come I cannot resist ordering something with pita and hummus and it is always roaring good
Overall not a bad experience- I would probably try it again and hope for a different waiter
My friend ordered the Jamaican Jerk Chicken and it had great flavor as well
The goodReally nice and helpful staffFree parkingClose to lightrailFree shuttle within 5 milesBig pool and jacuzzi with lit up waterfall at nightFree wifiOnly have to walk across the street to eat and drink at FEZThe badParking is a walk from the hotel entrance when hotThe bed was not the most comfortable even after realizing we could adjust the air levels
consistent service even when it's busy and great food
Our waiter was cheerful and attentive and kept those water & wine glasses filled
We also ordered carne asada tacos and a burrito and enchilada combo -- all were great
Plus the staff is always very friendly and the place is always immaculate
All of the staff I encountered were great
Great food and lots of it friendly staff who are happy to explain anything on the menu and one of the few places where 2 different atmospheres are offered
Lately their customer service has not been great
The drinks on the other hand was great including the martinis that served as dessert for our little party
rather a nice neighborhood drinking hole with an excellent staff welcoming owner and an outdoor patio that seals the deal for me
Food came out fast - cooked to order and nice and hot
The service is great but rushing is not part of the experience
The staff here is really nice and welcoming
The staff was soooooooooo friendly helpful and attentive
The waitstaff bartenders and security were GREAT
The service was wonderful our waiter was fast with the drinks and bread great for suggestions I ask even when I know what I'm getting to test staff and above all he was friendly the whole time
I had heard this was a great little place long before it was visited by the Food Network's Diners and Dives but I think perhaps the publicity while perhaps has brought in more business has done a number to the food quality and especially the service
When we finally got the food which was mediocre by then we didn't want to like the food as the service experience was bad
I found that if I had to describe the attitude of the staff in two words I would use rude and stupid
The veggies are fresh and flavorful the bread is great and the staff is really friendly
good eats good wine and excellent customer service
I like the atmosphere OK the wait staff is friendly enough and the food is decent
Everything I've ordered has been average-to-very good but the menu doesn't excite me much -- which could very well just be a matter of taste
The staff were all great even though we kept their arses hustlin' beers over to us from across the way
+1 cheap drinks+1 for peanuts-2 for half-assed and rude service
-complimentary valet is offered-the decor was nice-the food was ok-the service was indifferent with no sense of urgencyRead on for details
The staff is friendly at this restaurant - I'll give them that
Service is always pretty good even if the place is packed
I thought the food was fabulous and the service was pretty good
I have to say that the waitress was very helpful and the food was pretty good again I am not used to Ethiopian food
I ordered the beef tacos and those things were GOOD
I have never had such great customer service over a fairly minor mistake
There's also a good chance the service will be spotty which is why I knocked off one star
But here's a great thing when you're not in the mood to deal with being squished into a little bench with some strangers or searching for your waiter to get the water refill you needed 10 minutes ago you can always call in your order pick it up and bake it at home - then sit down with your favorite beer or wine and enjoy your meal in privacy
With the abundance of creepy men rude bartenders and staff and lack of any respect for anyone other than the VIP guests
The place is immaculately clean the staff is knowledgeable & friendly and the dogs are well taken care of
I ordered it Thai hot which was great to open up my sinuses and keep my tummy warm
Desserts were good Caesar salad dressing was very very anchovy salty and I LOVE anchovies
The decor is nice the staff is welcoming and friendly
I ordered the slow cooked pork with beans and rice and it was delicious
it's super cute and modern but what's so great about this place is the staff
Here's what we orderedVeggie breakfast burrito - this was definitely filling
Our waitress was actually really awesome- she got us our drinks quickly and was super friendly with our touristy butts
Service and food is always pretty hit and miss but we kept coming back because when it was good it was good
We ordered their filet tacos which always come out cold but the flavor is usually pretty good
We complain she sends the manager over and she the manager who has known us for a few years now is very snarky and rude to us about it
The service was great and we enjoyed the outdoor patio very much but the sushi itself - blah
The sales staff was not too pushy and pretty friendly and accessible the desk staff was a bit superficial
The service was great too friendly yet sassy
The staff is friendly the service is fast and the food is magnificent
The service is friendly but real cut and dry about things
My waiters have been nice ready to give advice and accurate on food choices
Who needs dessert when the mac and cheese is that good
The waiter knew what was going on and knew his stuff suggested a great margarita for a price I deem worth it
they have a great app list perfect for ordering a few items and sharing with drinks love it go here once a week
The service was great the food was excellent - now I know why it is always packed now
The staff is always friendly and helpful not to mention many of them have really cool looks - one girl has no eyebrows only metal studs
I ordered the pork loin ordered chopped and creamed corn which were extremely good
A couple of the reviewers noted how good it was; I may have ordered it on an off day
Never had anything but a friendly reception and quick service
They feature a GREAT selection of beers as the reviewers who came before me have said and easily the nicest bar staff I have encountered since I moved to downtown PHX
This is a wonderful place to eat with good food a good atmosphere good service and great desserts
Again great service exceptional attention and really affordable for the amount of food you get
Can't believe how bad this place is as far as order accuracy and priority
Friendly staff but didnt know anything about what they were selling
The staff was super friendly and always very helpful; they even knew me by my last name and greeted me every time I passed by the lobby which I thought was a great personal touch
I know it's the same staff as Drip and they are super nice
The service has always been good and even the cooks are friendly
When I was ready to place my order she was very rude & sighing as if she needed me to speed up
So my one star meal was balanced my what seemed like good food at the rest of my table and good service= three stars
EXTREMLY FRIENDLY STAFF that went out of their way to help us
Awesome happy hour and late night specials every game you could want ask and they'll put on whatever you want to see and I've never had bad service
It seems I've become quite the regular as the very wonderful staff remembers me and treats me just as nice every time I come in
The service is good as well but once again it's nothing special
The staff were super friendly and it was clean
Walk inside clean comfortable friendly service and some of the freshest Mexican food I've eaten
So you're telling me i'd get faster service and better pizza if I boarded a plane for Manhattan and even get to eat my favorite pizza -BEFORE this place can seat me
The service here can be nice but when they are attentive the wait staff is extremely courteous and kind
The food was great the service superb and the price tag reasonable
And whatever you do the first morning don't order breakfast in and plan on being romantic with each other we had someone knocking at our door every 20-30 mins 5 times in a row
I do recommend the Boulders for a nice short getaway great rooms food and service and at reasonable prices
Service was great around the pool and we enjoyed some snacks poolside too
Our waiter was a young lad likeable enough but had way too many things to do to really give great service
Service was very good throughout the meal
Service was great seeing that they let me in after they were shutting down
Our waiter was attentive but not intrusive
I've only dropped in to this Rack a few times and it has been very organized has very friendly staff and a great selection of both men's and women's wares for sale
I guess maybe i'm a snob but bad service really ruins things for me
I like Pita Jungle I really do lots of good food good service
This place combines Great service with Good prices and personable people
The wait staff was nice and the food came out quick
And on top of it the staff was great quick and very accommodating
Additionally the staff is very friendly and helpful and the decor of the bakery is bright and cheery
Having never visited any other locations but this one I can't tell you whether their customer service is across-the-line good but every time I walk into this place no matter how damned busy they are I always get a happy and nice greeting and am always helped within the first few minutes of stepping in
The hostess and waiters are extremely nice and helpful
However we had some very bad service from our waitress
But the bad service just did not prove anything
I ordered a medium rare steak and my girl ordered chicken tempura we both were extremely pleased steak is how I grade restaurants and my steak was cooked correctly and meat was of good quality with a very nice sake list so good rating from me
Our food was tasty and our service was great I had the sirloin & fries - when I ordered it they told me I could get other steak on the menu too if I wanted
We were greeted at the door and the host was nice but as soon as we sat down the service just stopped
The service is good they take very good care of you
UPDATE After several more visits I am downgrading by 2 whole stars for two significant and persistent reasons unfriendly service and painfully slow service
waitstaff is typically friendly pretty funny pretty funny crazy
Service was quick and friendly and the outdoor area is super comfortable
The service was pretty good the waitresses are very attentive to their guest
The sweet and sour chicken is still the BF's favorite and the service is still very good
Service is always awesome and their delivery is always great
I would order this bad boy over the original
The food is good the service is mediocre
We went in and were promptly greeted and shown to our booth the service was more than attentive cleaning plates from the table as the last bite was still in my mouth
For this place being an asian restaurant service was actually not bad
1 - Very slow service my water glass was empty more than it was full the whole time
Usually premium stores come with good customer service but that is not the case here
Water tastes like it's reclaimed have to ask for plates twice inattentive wait staff waiters literally throwing menus on the table and what really boils my blood
This could be a really cool place if the owner paid a little attention to his business lowered the prices a bit it's on the high side for a beer and burgers place and greatly improved their service
Great service decent Irish grub that makes you want to drink more Guinness authentic pub atmosphere and live music certain nights
The waitress was very nice and attentive
My co-worker ordered the spinach salad to go and when we brought it to her she inhaled it so I think the whole menu is good to go
The service was very friendly she was funny and charming and a good server too
The staff here is always friendly and helpful and who can not smirk at the high-heel easy chair in the Central Ave
When the feature of the dessert menu is chocolate chip cookies and a vanilla malt shake you know you don't have a great dessert menu
I also need to commend the attentive wait staff and pleasant atmosphere especially when the weather allows you to sit outside
The service and atmosphere were great as per all the Joe's establishments
The bf and I ordered the same thing two breakfast croissants and two lattes
I think this especially impressed me b/c no one was pushy or too cool for school; the staff was just friendly open and willing to chat
Since some of the family members hadn't seen each other in awhile we sat for some time after we finished eating just chatting and catching up and a few of us noticed we were getting some rude looks from the staff and management as if to say ok you're done get up and leave so we can get more customers in here to make us more money
They have food as well The crowd is mellow and the service is great
The rest of the staff is Hair Stalgia is friendly as well
The service has always been good and the people who work here have always been really helpful to those that are just a little confused
Problem is they forgot to hire anyone who can cook or provide nice table service
Delux is good atmosphere is cool service is great and if you sit at the long high top'd table you will make friends with the people sitting next to you
I was very pleased with the customer service all three of the reps that I had the pleasure of working with were extremely pleasant and helpful service was quick the car was clean and in good condition and they had the lowest price I could find in my area
Though there were only 4 parties there when we went service was painfully slow
The wait staff was also great - water and margarita refills were speedy and overall level of attentiveness was just right
Never tasted a bad dish and loved the service
The Bruchetta was dry and the waiter called me a liar about my response to having a dish before stating we just added that 3 weeks ago  I don't know I just never got the right vibe from him and our service took over 2 hours and we didn't have a good time with our waiter
In any event the staff was friendly but the rest of the museum just looked boring
I had a bad service experience and ceased coming until my wife talked me into going again
I will say staff has been friendly every visit and they are very willing to  special order anything for you
The food is delicious the atmosphere is cozy and the staff is friendly and helpful
The ambience is the room is comforting there's always music playing for guests seated at tables lots of space friendly customer service fair prices and quick service
Oregano's use to be my favorite place  but the last few times I have been there food  service is not very good I think oregano's need to focus on good customer service and food quality control
I doubt we will be back Grazies is still number one on our list great food and service
In addition to traditional lunch fare sandwiches & salads they also serve breakfast and have a full working bakery that churns out cookies brownies pies & made to order cakes
I'm sure there's lots of other things that are good about this place but the poor customer service in dealing with the main reason I came here stained the experience
They stand for local sourcing of organic and natural foods artisan breads and friendly-outgoing customer service
You definitely get all that and great service at Nello's
I'm not cheap but I think that's pretty steep even if the food and service were very good not spectacular but very good
They have a pretty good late night menu too that I used to always order off of when I got off of work
I will say the staff was very nice and extremely helpful
Great staff friendly and they really do try to help you out and answer all your questions
Food and drink service was equally friendly and efficient
I ordered the ribeye and it was very nice although cooked just a little longer that I would have normally wanted but it tasted great
The combination of the great service the owners seemed like lovely people and the QUALITY food waffle fries + perfect hot dog make me wish that there were an Uncle Al's in California
Overall I have to give them three stars because the service is apart for the sales techniques very friendly and knowledgeable and the overall decor though kind of a cliche is at least pleasant to the eyes and I feel like I can roll in high without having a bum jack off in the corner

I have stayed at less nice hotels and had much better service with concierge this hotel should realize what their clients might be interested in and do some research

We ordered the hand shaken margarita and its a pretty big serving with lots of the good stuff in it
The steak fajitas were the bombThe only downside is the service is just way too slow
My folks wanted to order sushi so I let them and sure enough the rolls they ordered as well as my sashimi selections were just not very good
The service here has been great every visit with a staff of girls all in their twenties that are hip but not in an asinine way that some of these other types of places can be
Yep Moto is a great place as long as you don't order the sushi
The menu items are too good to pass up to order something that is sub-par or average
Scale of 1-10 single visit7 Food9 Service6 Atmosphere7 ValueStandard Atmosphere deduction for the television atrociously breaking up what would otherwise have been a nice quaint place

The staff is friendly and very knowledgeable about the plethora of clubs within walking distance
I ended up ordering the duck which was good with the cherry sauce
Regardless we felt like we got the red carpet treatment the customer service was that good
They still have a couple kinks to work out - some of the wait staff was a little green but I certainly wouldn't hold that against any of them on day 2 as they were all working hard to make a good impression
The wait staff is very attentive but should have told me the happy hour specials as I was alone with my computer and ended up paying full price for a beer and appetizer at a dead time of  the day
Slow Service    Cold food    Incorrect orders    If you like hot tea
good luck getting more hot water    The staff doesn't check on you after receiving your meal    No WiFi service    Dirty silverwareI dislike this Denny's so much that I actually logged in to write about it

The bread and pesto is something both my wife and I always look forward to as well as the friendly and very attentive staff
Oh the staff are all really friendly too

The service was friendly and prompt very responsive but not intrusive
I decided not to buy anything bc the service was so bad
The staff are friendly and always willing to help
All the wait staff were very pleasant and attentive

Immediate friendly service good food great prices

I've gone a lot of Saturday nights and had great service most of the time although there was one night the service was incredibly slow
That said everything we have ordered dumplings samosas stir fries sandwiches has been good just not quite outstanding
Service was a bit slow but I've learned that this is standard fare in vegan/veggie places so it didn't bother us much
The people watching plus artwork on the walls made the time pass quickly and the staff themselves were incredibly outgoing and friendly
All in all a great vegan spot to get something comforting but can be a little pricey for a quick service style place
The staff that runs the place are very nice and they will even let you sample the 5 different Root Beers they currently feature
The customer service is bad the people they stick behind the archery counter have no clue how to set a bow up

I didn't really try any of the food but friends ordered breakfast burrito and an some kind of omelet

The place was a quaint little shop with a whole lot of sandwich selections and the staff is friendly and welcoming
Food's great service is great and it's only a 10 min
The atmosphere was very nice and the staff was great
maybe they had a new cook and waitress that night because we have heard from others that it is good
Fast food is never healthy not even when you're ordering a salad
But it's good and their menu is easy to order from
The drinks & guac/chips which were good arrive 15 mins after we placed the order & our dinner which was fair arrived 2 mins after that
I also feel like I made a good healthy decision by eating here instead of fast food however my order only took about 10 minutes to make so still pretty damn fast
To her credit our waitress kept our drinks full and she processed our check/payment quickly and she was chirpy and smiley so good for her
Depending on when you go as with any popular bars that draw lots of people you have to wait a bit for service but they are quite friendly
The service was fast and the place was full a good sign
The wait staff was attentive without getting in the way

The bar staff was friendly and made me feel comfortable dining by myself
The short rib was good it wasn't my order so it wasn't my taste
A lot of places are putting desserts in jars its fun but I think the vessel led to the idea of deconstructing this conventional dessert which brought attention to each component which could have been good but didn't work out that way
Overall really good restaurant really good food pricing staff service etc
Very cool bar with very nice staff and servers
So what sets this apart from other burger places besides the GREAT service
The service isn't the friendliest but it's certainly not rude or curt
I sincerely wish that this restaurant finds its footing once again because it has always had quite a few things going for it like good quality food quick service and some great ambiance
I've never had a bad service experience here
It can be a little slower at times but the staff is always nice and attentive
The first time I was greeted by a friendly girl who upon learning that it was my first time offered up samples and directions on how to order
Though the food was good the service was horrible
It was packed for lunch today but the two waitresses who ere very busy were on top of things as well as being friendly
Understaffed the staff there doesn't care about service the ones who will help you are either rude if you cornered them for service even to throw money at them or have that broken soul thousand yard stare
Service fair pace was bad between courses - long waits
The service is great and so is the atmosphere but i'd eat in a cardboard box if i had to just to eat the food
Here is what was just OK*Service our server was nice enough but he got distracted chatting with other employees and customers and often forgot to check back with us to refill waters remove dirty dishes etc
They have a good selection of beers and the staff is very helpful
The atmosphere is great and the staff friendly
Other than this incident service was pretty good
The only thing that salvaged the service                        grade to above a failure was the manager's quick actionFood       B-  it's good but nothing to write home about
My lady threw down the Fez burger order this one and I got the tan tan chicken  pretty good
Dr Eric Clyde and his staff are great personal and effiecient
I have never gotten such bad service from a restaurant manager before
I went through the drive-through this morning and orderd the #1 breakfast combo 2 donuts and a regular-size coffee

it just goes to show you that no matter how great the food or the presentation if customer service doesn't excel the reviews will suffer and that is all the guests will remember
Then I ordered the chicken enchilada stack and it was pretty good and I had a cup of the white chicken tortilla soup and that was the best I have ever had
We went out of our way to eat here for a reason it is consistently great food great service & great atmosphere
Service was attentive and the host / restaurant manager was great unfortunately don't have her name - see also my engagement comment
Dried tomatoes can be great if re-hydrrated properly but that wasn't what I ordered and these were just dried strips thrown on and way too many of them
I wasn't impressed and would not order it again  The tofu was pretty good though I would have preferred the tofu to be cut into smaller pieces and the sauce to be a little thicker
I like this place - it's close to my house clean friendly staff items in stock
Our server seems nice and attempts to take our order

The staff was nice and friendly despite the fact our order remained so elusive
The price they charge for a bowl includes drink and dessert which is nice
The people are very friendly and helpful plus there were plenty on staff
The busy part is probably a good thing though because that means their food drinks and service are always awesome so people come back for more
Food presentation was nice and service was prompt
We finally got our table and here's where the 3 stars come in - the service was not good its the kind of place where the servers seem put out by you and it was very
Hanny's would be a lot of fun for drinks music and people watching and while the food was good I don't think we'll be doing dinner again based on the service
I ordered a pizza for dinner and it was bad
Everything was great except the service
The service and food have improved and I have been back a few times for breakfast

-SERVICE all of the employees that I encountered were friendly
****Four Stars for good food and friendly service
Service started off great and then went aloof from there as if we did not exist
Borrowing from another review service was indeed ridiculously slow and indifferent
The staff is very friendly and accommodating but frankly the food we had was good but not great
While I enjoy the fast-casual concept of ordering at the counter and having your food delivered to you this seems to be a hot spot during lunch and it's sometimes challenging to find a table
We waited a few minutes for a table and were constantly being said hello to and asked if we've been helped by a friendly friendly staff
This is a really good pizza but its not worth the wait or the nasty hurry you up staff
I went because it was located very close to my hotel and the staff were friendly but 10pm is so early especially on a weekend night

Again Great drinks great service great happy hours and great style but I never have any luck with the food here
The owners are great service has always been great it's always clean and orderly and the food was birthed by Satan himself because it causes feelings of lust and gluttony

Somehow with the disgusting 2-stall girls' restroom no parking high bar prices no good waitresses and pint-only beer options this place maintains it's hipster popularity as the place to be in downtown Tempe
The staff is super friendly and the place has a casual vibe to it
The hostess was super friendly and let us sample what ever we wanted as well as gave us pointers on what we should order since it was our first time there
I guess it's an OK place to hang out they have a patio and a cozy interior like TT Roadhouse's decor but bigger and not as cool  I thought the choice of beer was lacking the service slow and obnoxious
The white guy behind the counter was kind of unfriendly when we came in we hadn't done anything but walk in the door hadn't even opened our mouths to order yet and the guy seemed like we were really putting him out by being there but the Hispanic guy cooking and serving was really nice to us which is what kept my husband from walking out on the bad first impression
First off the staff was very friendly
No more banana breadFirst Bad Service
Service is great sometimes and fair others but with food this good it easily makes up for it
Service for our big table was great - and again we were blown away by the delicious and authentic German food
The staff is super friendly and the little pizza place is nice and clean
They have a simple menu we ordered a variety of items all of which were prepared well and tasted good
Atmosphere is fabulous service is outstanding and attentive and the food is scrumptious

We knew in advance to bring our own wine but I agree it would be nice to be able to order a cocktail
My husband thought it was overpriced for above average but not great food - if I can talk him into going back I will make sure and order that Samoa tart
She made the comment that since the place was filled with mostly men and many attractive ones I might add the servers were probably more inclined to offer them more attentive service since they tend to tip more
The staff is here is always friendly and usually pretty fast sometimes they have lines out the door so I cut 'em some slack
The food was pretty good - once we got it - but the service was very slow
5/29/10Came in after a failed attempt to dine at Zin Burger next door I ended up ordering only the sweet potato fries there- not good

Service a little slow considering we were the only people there
All that I tried from the soup salad sushi hot dishes & dessert selections were good & I particularly enjoyed these items*  The Hot & Sour Soup
if by chance you want the blandest food this side of england this place is for you but if you want any form of mexican fare you'd be better off going to taco smell and I am no fan of fast food whether it be from north of the border or farther north of the border
It seems they have lost a lot of their bar crowd business but at least they are turning things around in terms of service and the pizza is a good late night option
The only bad thing about this restaurant is when your eating and it's not busy they seem to be spying on you and makes it a lil uncomfortable for  you peeps that can't stand that the staff is looking at your every move
Our waitress Angie was delightful and very nice

Unfortunately the service was really slow
Very laid back gastropub with a friendly funny/entertaining staff
At this time this place pretty much sucks - that is unless you like to wait in line hang around with the type of people that would party at a country/rock nightclub located in a strip mall deal with bad service and have no place to sit
The service was good - but that's got to have everything to do with the fact that the place was pretty empty
Basically Cadillac Ranch is a generic strip-mall restaurant/bar that has decent service when it's slow and edible food
Again great service and prices and a great group of guys that work the front counter
However  the staff were very accommodating and the they did good in the foot massage so the 3 stars

The first time I ordered take out here was during the lunch rush and the service was great I couldn't have asked for better they even waited for me to get there before getting my lemonade so the ice wouldn't melt but I wasn't on Yelp at that time so I couldn't review it
I have ordered a bunch of different items and they all are great
The staff and management are friendly and helpful
I am not sure if it is just poor customer service training or if they are intentionally rude but they aren't friendly or helpful
Again no proof but my gut tells me that the mean unfriendly staff member who took him in the back room hurt him
Now I am officially drooling I'm sure everything else is just as good but I cannot stop ordering these darn chops

I decided to try it out anyway was seated by a friendly waiter and ordered the hot & sour soup they were able to sub in chicken instead of pork - bonus and the waiter recommended the house chicken to me

Before the pizza the Handmade Mozzarella Local Tomato and Basil with Extra Virgin Olive Oil was simply stunning and if the food alone was not good enough the service is a definite match to the gastronomic sensation
Our server was nice but overall the service was slow
Also the waitress wasnt too attentive and the music was so loud I could hardly speak across the table
They pay their workers better than other fast food places and make everything fresh and granted my experience is limited but even though it may take a while to get my order I've never had communication difficulties or an actually unpleasant cashier and I'm sure there's a correlation there somewhere
The staff is very friendly and the prices are reasonably cheap in my opinion
The restaurant was packed and extremely busy so service was verrrrrry slow

The good  nice big room pretty location very clean polite staff feels like a 4-star hotel & service except forThe OK  Bed is good not great; pillows felt kind of odd location is rather remoteNeeds improvement Free TV channels should be way easier to locate and navigate shower head was covered in hard water depositsReally pissed me off  The ludicrous $16 per night facilities fee which they add on top of your nightly fee

The staff is friendly and that's the only reason this place even deserves one star

Let me begin by saying it is always nice when the service is so good that you almost don't have to ask for anything
Service wasn't overbearing but it was nice to know that they appreciated your busines and wanted to make sure that you didn't go without anything
If u have not tried chelsea's Kitchen then you have not experience amazing food and great service
The service is indeed GREAT and overall a fun night out at a decent Brazilian steakhouse
- Good service water was refilled 3 times naan was replaced immediately upon decimation
The maragaritas are great made with fresh ingredients and the owner and managers really love food and care about the quality of what's going out
And as for service I always thought that it was good
The atmosphere is cool and the service is great
My friend did order the soup of the day which sounded pretty good
We've been here twice and both times we've had a good experience the only reason why it's not 5 stars is that both times it took 10 minutes for someone to come to our table to get our order
Great customer service perfect dining area
This lightly dimmed pizzeria is nothing like the other high top table pizza places the staff and waitress' are really friendly with along great customer service
I ordered the side Chef Eric's Caesar salad and thin crust cheese with pepperoni I highly recommend For GREAT pizza
Everyone that worked here was extremely friendly especially our waitress
We were seated promptly by the friendly hostess and given our menus which were promptly snatched away by my friend who decided to order for all of us
But the staff is great the drinks are perfectly chosen and the music is generally pretty amazing
Since she had never been here before and we were both starving we decided to order 3 items and split them soup of the day grilled mozzarella kabob and salmon davida yes again it was that good
Salmon davida refer to previous reviewAdam our waiter was outstandingly friendly and got our items split in half without any hesitation
Our waiter was awesome friendly fast and knowledgeable
Even when it's completely dead the staff is friendly and nice
I ordered four tacos so I could get a good sample of what they have to offer
The wine list is nice and the service was good too
Very friendly and prompt service and great prices
Our waiter was friendly and made great recommendations
A quick summary for my latest visitPros- convenient order-at-the counter setup- self-serve drink station- brown and white rice mixture- friendly and gracious ownersCons- too much napa cabbage in comparison to green vegetables - wish the owner/chef would be back in the kitchen vs
The waitstaff was friendly and attentive but not overbearing
But at its worst the service is slow and the bizarro factor knocks it down to 2 or 3 stars
All in all I enjoyed the experience - hanging out in line from 350 til 5pm when they opened and started seating meeting the friendly wait staff not the hostesses the down-to-earth wait staff with the t-shirts and aprons getting close to celebrity saw the lady from The Practice and Lie to Me - Kelli something - and her husband that was on some kid show that I'm not familiar with AND Mayor Gordon and his family came later and paying a hefty price for dinner but not really feeling shmucked about it
From start to finish the service is great and the atmosphere is fancy and nice
I'm thinking ok he probably thinks that is high and will give me a good deal The WEBSITE ADVERTISES $29 LOCK OUT SERVICE
He has a great bedside manner and his nurse Maria was friendly and makes a great first impression as far as the medical staff is concerned
The wait staff is attentive and professional
The service was a little on the slow side we had to flag down the waitstaff once or twice to get their attention but they were plenty friendly
The burger itself was good cooked just as I'd ordered it and was pretty tasty too
The food was good but not fantastic the service was mediocre and the prices were a bit much
The vegan food is enough for me to *want* to return but the great service pretty much guarantees that I will
At that point you're not providing good service it's just amateurish crap
It's a shame too cause the staff here is pretty good
The wait staff and management were really nice and you could tell that they really care about making this restaurant work
I sat at the sushi bar ordered a couple rolls both were not good
The wifi quality coffee smiling employees and friendly service are only a fraction of what makes this place awesome
I have to mention our waitress did a great job making sure to apologize and take the charge off the bill because it wasn't edible
Last the dessert the apple pie was very good not the best I have had but solid apple pie
The food is good and the manager is friendly
I'm sure if I went there first thing in the moring I'd get a smile and some good customer service but now it's not very bloody likely
Our waitstaff was courteous and attentive enough
Great food great staff and it feels as if I'm at my grandmas house for a home made meal
I have always had a great experience when I eat here I normally start with their infamous Chambord margarita and then order lots of appetizers to share among my friends
Booths are comfortable bathrooms are clean and our service from Jasmine was attentive too
My issue is the fact that the sushi is overpriced for what you receive and the service is not that great
The waitress was so cute and friendly
I go here quite often and I am impressed at the selection prices and friendly service that I have experienced here at this little resale shop
I have ate here 3 times and I had always had great service
Service is very important even if they have great food bad service can ruin all
I love their pizza as long as it is fresh if I can offer any advice only order what u can eat since the food does not taste as good the next day
I just expected a good breakfast and they delivered with great service both times
If you want an iced coffee rather than hot with your delicious breakfast order the iced coffee at Over Easy
My steaks have always been cooked perfectly the coconut shrimp is delicious I prefer is sans the sauce since it covers up the crisp and sweet flavor of the coconut too much for me the servings are plentiful and for the most part every time I've been here the service has been from decent to great
The staff was very friendly which I did not always experience during my previous visits to Hazelwood's
He sent out Cecilia who made the adjustments and ordered new rollers which work great
This small shop is big on great coffee and friendly service
She was just to-the-point and spoke in a manner that was commensurate with the unacceptably slow service we were being provided
I dare say that the professional response especially when as is the case here the customer actually IS right and the service actually HAS been unacceptably slow is to say Ma'am you're right and I am so sorry
I've never had problems with service they are very friendly a little slow if anything
The staff are curteous and service is fast
Good food and a friendly staff typically make for a positive dining experience El Bravo delivers on both fronts
The shop itself was adorable and the service was friendly
I wanted to like it and like I said the shop and staff were super friendly
Polite and great service is one thing but overly fake is another
The staff was very nice and service was quick
Otherwise selection is good on the whole but customer service can be a little iffy at times
On top of all this the staff was super friendly too
Their staff is very friendly helpful and quick to serve you
As if it wasn't bad enough you can order cups of gelato you can also bring home tubs and cake
Their friendly staff helped me pack ice on top of the gelato and by the time I got home it was still cold although a little runny but still delish and needless to say made me and my girlfriend very happy
The waiter was great with helping me figure out what to get
our waiter was a diva and not in a good way
last time i pay $17 for a gross burger and rude service i don't care how effing cute your patio is
White Chocolate Grill does nothing to help my bad habit in fact I can't leave this place without having a dessert
While their food is good it's the desserts at White Chocolate Grill that really stand out
The service has always been pretty good although food can take a little while
The bread was absolutely fantastic- I ordered a side since it was THAT good
I was greeted by a super friendly staff got a tour of the office and then we got down to business
Service was good drinks were refilled and the bill was brought promptly
Service  Our waiter TJ was very professional knowledgeable and attentive
I don't mind spending money on a nice meal but the quality of the food service and atmosphere doesn't justify the money spent
The staff was superb and friendly and the food particularly the fosolia was delicious
Also the staff is always amazingly friendly
I wasn't a big fan initially of their style of  order at the counter and find a seat but they do a good job of finding & having a table ready for you by the time you get your order in and I don't mind getting up to get my own coffee / water / iced tea
Ordered a vanilla latte with breakfast the last time i was in and it was fantastic
The staff was very great to work with and the night went off without a hitch
They are also good for to-go orders and it's usually ready in minutes
I almost dinged them a bit for the hostess taking a while to come to the front of the restaurant to great us and for the slightly slow waitress
The wait was about 25 mins but it went by quickly and when finally seated I found the service to be good
Hospitality as opposed to service is hard to find in today's world of fast paced conveniences - and the woman - behind the Starbuck's counter whose name I don't know yet she knows mine took my breath away
A great experience all around and we highly recommend this service
I would love to know what a good chicken taco is in your opinion I cant think of any besides maybe the California tacos at the now closed Chuy's but the ones my sister ordered from here were full of chicken and topped with a nice chipotle/ranch like sauce which is similar
They are very good at getting our orders right too
Service is quick and friendly and they look like they're having a good time behind the counter
Not only was the food good but the dessert was just sinful
The only negative about the place was that service on the food was a little slow although it was pretty packed so I will take that into consideration
The staff is mostly attentive and helpful
I ordered the steak sandwich which was also very good but not as good as his burger
She was very nice and sent over a round of desserts and invited us to call her before our next trip back
GREAT GREAT BAR Fantastic Patio A little Warm BUT Great Service Drinks and Food
Greeted Immediately Staff Friendly Funny and Nice NO ATTITUDE what so ever  Really a Pleasant and nice Afternoon in North Phoenix
For hors d'oeuvres I ordered the Olive Bowla great variety of Greek olives served with herb crackers and the musselsboth Jamie and I's first time trying mussels--sauteed in garlic served in-shell and so wonderfully buttery they melted in my mouth--though Jamie wasn't as fond of the inherent mussel-y taste
Waitress was friendly and helpful - she brought out a sample of Heffenweisen
Also the Pima location is my favorite the staff is extremely courteous friendly and cheerful
The staff is great too - chipper and polite and cute
Not the kind of place you get fawned over it seems unless you're a regular but the customer service was certainly nice and I got the food rather quick
The staff here is very friendly and they are always willing to look up a movie and find it for you
And it took a good 15 minutes to get a water another 15 to get my drink and another 15 to get my order in
All fresh all hot all tasty  if you are in the mode for Mexican a la USA without needing to shoot yourself for going into On the Border Service really good on the Sunday AM  kids eat free  food is generic to a fault and if they were to the cheaper side of the street it would be 3
But I think it's great to take a break from the norm and explore new places once in a while - and also to step back and hike for hiking's sake and not think about this climb is going to burn x calories at y heart rate in order to leave me with -z% body fat
As I said most people usually just stick to the service road to go up and down so you have a good chance of having the whole trail on the south side of Shaw Butte all to yourself
went here with my Mom and the food was good but the service could use some improvement
Great place to go and always great service
My dining companions ordered a wedge salad a wedge of Iceberg lettuce = B-O-R-I-N-G Caesar salad with grilled chicken pretty good so I was told and bean soup with hamburger meat
The service was friendly but I just wish they had given a bit more thought to fish/veggie options
The staff is friendly and will readily help you find what you are searching for
We had a Canada Day shindig here and it's a great little neighborhood bar with fair drink prices and super friendly bar staff
For these reasons I do not recommend going to Sacks when you are on the go and need fast service
She was VERY gracious and it was great to see such a personal touch and high level of customer service
The hours are great the staff as geeky and awkward as you'd like them to be and the people watching when reading and typing just gets too boring is on par with the mall or any airport I've been too
Not only were we thoroughly impressed with the cuisine the service was great
The service is outstanding and everyone is really friendly
I went into this UPS to ship my package and the service was great when they were getting my money
Anyway I would have gladly paid for any error on my part if the customer service was good
I am sooo fed up with bad customer service
The service is attentive but not stalker; the decor is primarily traditional with golden splashes and photos of dignitaries
First of all I like the system of ordering at the counter for casual lunch and dinner places but there's something about breakfast that it's ill-suited for
Breakfast is just a full service kind of meal at least to me
The atmosphere overall was poor full disclosure - it was a Wednesday night and the place was empty but the service was very good
Our friend who ordered it was not a fan but I didn't think it was bad
While the food was good I was disappointed with the service and atmosphere
It usually takes a good 10-15 minutes to get my order
As if that wasn't enough of a good thing they offer interior design services to ensure that your space is the most fabulous it can be
The guy who we ordered food from was friendly kind and prompt
For good measure we ordered some coconut pancakes on the side with the omelet
Didn't help the movie I was dragged to sucked but the service was actually really good
Good food good service and nice environment
The service is kind of slow because of this but look past it your about to get a fresh home cooked meal
It LOOKS like a table service restaurant and the dining area is nice enough to be one
The staff is always very attentive and friendly
Fast friendly and efficient service in a clean and casual environment
Our bartender was fabulous and friendly BUT he didn't know what a Moscow Mule was when I ordered it and my boyfriends Manhattan tasted more like watered down whiskey with muddled orange
Great atmosphere amazing service and food that makes your heart happy
The environment was nothing that really stands out from other bars nearby but the service was great
The service was great--that is once we were seated
duck fat fried french fries with white truffle dipping sauce warm rosemary and truffle bread fillet mignon awesome Pinot and great service
We had a great time the decor and service rocked
Service was great and overall I had a good experience
The table service was friendly and attentive too
- Service was good- attentive but not annoying
The service is always friendly and prompt the drinks and food are just as good as I expect every time I come in and the store has nice comfy chairs in addition to tables--perfect for hanging out with a friend reading a book or typing a paper
Our bartender/waiter was super friendly along with the other staff that helped us out along the way we had great conversations with all of them all night
Oh my goodness the chicken was yummy but that corn bread stuffing was amazeballs that I wish I could order that up as a side dish
Amazing food great service will be back for dinner and would love to try their happy hour
The staff is very nice and best of all my wife doesn't mind hanging here for awhile
The atmosphere was plesant and the service was not all that bad waiter was at our table a little too much interrupting conversation
I have never seen such a consistent kitchen staff as I have at AZ come in at 7 pm or call in an order at 1229am and the food will always be good
I know its really just a bar so I feel bad complaining about service but sometimes it really flat out sucks
fast personal service great pricing and wonderful eats
The one potential drawback is the service isn't always fast
Staff/service isn't too bad either and you don't get quite the same riff-raff as you'll find out in the main part of Arrowhead Mall
Prices were good food was good atmosphere was good  service was good minus a few missteps and the sangria was good
They need to work on their customer service skills and put the store back in a more user friendly arrangement
The staff at the front desk mentioned that the food there was pretty good
I arrived during happy hour and the wait staff was very friendly and accommodating
We ordered some boneless wings that were pretty good and Miller Lites that were on special for $3
However good customer service does not excuse the overwhelming sense of disappointment we felt at spending $3
I ate here on a Sunday afternoon and was impressed by the food quality very friendly service and speed of service
This place is very clean the staff is usually friendly and it is never busy here
The service was awful it took forever to get some service I'm guessing this place is a go up to the bar and order The bartender was rude and talked over us without listening much
In short I could see how the other offerings on the menu may be good and given the ambience and service another experience with different food may give better ratings but ya gotta do your ribs well if you are going to call yourself a BBQ restaurant
Service is always good the portions are a nice size and the atmosphere is great
This will always be a neighborhood favorite  good food good service and good people
Service here is great; fast efficient and no-nonsense
A manager-ish person who didn't introduce himself asked how we were doing which is always nice
Bad news ironically because this place has a high demand the staff has a you need us more than we need you attitude and trust me this shows
They brought us the great basket of warm breads we ordered bottled water for all and a bottle of some 06 Sauv Blanc that was mighty tasty
He was nice enough to split up our tabs without us asking but he charged me for my friend's 2 orders
I researched the menu online but wanted to make my to go order in person to get a good feel for the atmosphere
Sadly this was forgotten about with the bad ordering experience sub-par food experience and the over the top bill for it all
I have been to this location a few times and tonight the service was excellent as it always is the steak was not as great as last time - it's hit or miss
The service was fast - our waitress was pleasant and went the extra step to put a candle in our apple cinnamon beignet & ala mode
Overall I am always happy with the great service and how they handle if something goes wrong with the food
We came here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and the service was good and the food was great
The service is outstanding probably because they pay more than other fast food joints
I really loved the great sense of humor and laid back attitude the staff had
i'm not gonna lie-the service is great and the breakfast is really good too-i usually make my own omlett but have also had the salmon lox on a bagel w cream cheese their yogurt and granola w berries pancakes
i've never had a bad order or anything like that and it is reasonably priced as well-so if you don't mind waiting for breakfast-give it a try
I dare you to find such great service in any other music store these days or most other retail establishments for that matter
The techs and staff were very open and friendly with answering any question you have
The staff here is super friendly helpful non pretentious and good looking
I have been to this place many times and the food is still good staff is still friendly table is still clean
Our waiter was nice but swamped so he kept forgetting our drinks and wouldn't return to the table for long periods of time
Overall the atmosphere was nice service was friendly and knowledgeable and food/drink was above average
luckily it came in a tiny delicate stemmed dessert fluteanyway bottom line Noca is a bit pricey but worth every dollar---the service is friendly and helpful without being patronizing the atmosphere is boisterous yet cozy and the food is
LOL The staff at this location is also very friendly
The staff here are very caring and friendly and I make it a point to drop in whenever I am in Phoenix
not much choices for food after security but Wendy's was priced about like any non-airport store so not bad and lady taking order was nice
Most ordered pizza but the pasta with red sauce looked pretty good too
Service for what it was was friendly and efficient as well
Beers hot dogs and sodas are outrageous but they have something of monopoly on goods and services once you go inside so there isn't much that you can do about it
The staff really could not have been more friendly they were helpful but also just joking around making you feel right at home
The wait staff was attentive and informative
Staff are generally friendly but sometimes when the waitresses see us comin' I think they know we are only doing take-out so no tip for you
The employees here are great & always give excellent service
This is by far the most entertaining trail I have ridden in the Phoenix area and only Schultz Pass in Flagstaff is faster
-The pasta is generally over cooked-The desserts are pretty meh-The breakfast is also very meh
Ordered a carne asada quesadilla which came dressed with a chipotle dipping sauce the quesadilla was great by itself and extreme when complimented with the chipotle dip
Here are my ratings of each dining point I consider when going hereService 5/5 Fast and very helpful Even the chef will dig up custom stuff and cares what people think of the new entrees
Service was good prompt polite and efficient and the place was clean and tidy
Could have used some MEAT - maybe I could have added chicken to it but I failed to notice it was meatless when I ordered it - MY BAD
All-in-all nice store great staff and an easy to access location
After he left the staff was so unbelievably rude when they called that I got so flustered I handed my husband the phone
after just one visit the nice waitress remembered our faces and brought out the chili sauce we requested at our first visit
I can't speak to the service since it was a very quiet Sunday night and our server was quite attentive
Our night went from questionable service to seriously one of greatest in a matter of minutes all because the manager cared to make the difference
Their prices are fair portions large and service friendly it's just not for me
Great atmosphere great food and great service

I've had the eggs/bacon/hashbrowns/toast meal which is hard to beat and the pancakes which I scarfed down without giving a second look a the appetizer that I had ordered which was also very good
What more could you want than delicious traditional breakfast very low prices and friendly service
I ordered a simple breakfast with eggs bacon and hashbrowns and I was happy enough
Service was great view of the mountains and location on the patio was fantastic
Also for take out the service was super quick and friendly

From @AZvern to @audreyrlwyatt to @TheDottsyZ to @ThomasWSmith to @lupnacca to @chrissyP71 to @cutepup8191 we all had a great time and enjoyed the old school food and service very much
Unfortunately this time the service although friendly was really poor
Service was great its is a tiny place in the corner and the parking can be a struggle but well worth it
Service has been hit and miss but always friendly
Got a nice table on the patio and order the made from scratch sangria and looked over the menu which seemed great
Members of our table also ordered a Cobb Salad which was good and Jambalaya
The staff is very friendly and helpful too and there is an on-site restaurant for you to have lunch at after your game
So last night the service was good I'd say at minimum an A- which is a great improvement over the previous 4 visits
The music is my favorite part not sure if it is just the days I happened to go but it was nice being able to dance to David Bowie The Doors The Postal Service and many many more exceptionally mixed songs
The wait staff is extremely attractive and friendly

I love deluxe and also places like Stax which is good but not great deluxe is great btw not Stax either way the food was great not the service or annoying people next to me but i cant hold the restaurant responsible  the people behind me made me want to stab myself in the ears with an icepick service was crap but
The staff was very friendly and helpful
The service was so slow and priced drinks way to high two vodka/red bulls that = $25 and one of the most horriable things that the server we did have lost my friends credit card
This bar has everything it needs to be a huge hit a great rooftop bar with a pool view of the city a city vibe delicious cocktails trendy furniture friendly staff and did I mention delicious drinks
However up to that point and after that point the service was great
I've been to Vig Uptown several times because my BF likes it but last night he said his potato pancake was not very good and the portion size of his carne continues to decrease every time he orders it
I will say that the Vig has great sangria tasty specialty drinks and I've always had good service
The staff were friendly helpful and very knowledgeable about the food and wine offerings
The even cooler part was when I got there my first item I ordered and received was a nice cold Kiltlifter
I ordered a martini that really wasn't too bad
Needless to say we loved this place not just due to the amazing food but also the atmosphere may be in a shopping area but still nice and cozy and the great staff who were very friendly
Although we skipped dessert I still think $100 tip included was a great value because of the upscale diner atmosphere the Kierland location and the decently priced drinks
-  Had a couple of desserts and they were both good
The NOs-Loud music-Pulled Pork sandwich  too dryWhat makes my experience at Texas Roadhouse even greater was our waitress Jessica

Service was friendly attentive and made me feel right at home
The staff was reasonably fast despite it being a rather packed house and was unfailingly nice
Friendly service and great bang for the buck though not really legit fusion food
My entree was good though I'll definitely order something new next time
As a landlord I need good honest services for all my maintenance because it is even more costly to fix a rental house because your tenants does not take care of your house as good as you
I have only good things to say about the service dept
Their staff is both friendly & professional
Pros Great Donuts and hot chocolate Great Service  Friendly most of the time Open early Convenient location great prices cleanliness - for the most part OK Customer service
If you like quickstrikes and limiteds this is the place staff is not overly friendly but the kid that looks like Pharell is nice but coming from NY most tier 0 store employees are jerks so it's expected
BAD SERVICE ALL THE WAY AROUND - DO NOT USE THIS STORE OR THEIR WEBSITE IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN A GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE
The general lack of interest shown by the waiter on this left us with a bad feeling
They also have events a decent kitchen and happy hours so it wasn't bad but the staff just never seems very genuine
Oh well fat is flavor and after all I was splurging The staff The waitresses were all very nice they must pool tips because we were helped by several girls throughout our meal
The dessert just wasn't as traditional as I would have liked-I like a ton of espresso soaking the ladyfingers but it tasted good and was served up generously
Maybe it's because the place was pretty busy but we noticed the service from our bartender/server was pretty slow
They are clean comfortable and the staff is so incredibly friendly
Service was good and the decor is busy and lots to look at

We ordered the seafood trio which was nice and the fried mozzarella which was also good
The service was very nice and the restaurant was full of people mostly Caucasians
Cons- Can get crowded during peak hours Not insanely kid friendly  not unfriendly- but the restaurant is smallish and my child can be very friendly with whoever is sitting next to her and sometimes the fries are too good and I want to order more
Located in a very upscale part of town  it keeps up by having very good ambience and very professional service
Visit #1 I ate here for breakfast and immediately felt welcomed and at home by the staff

Staff The waitress was friendly and didn't mind answering questions because it was our first time
Burger was great but the service wasn't so great
I fought back the urge to just leave and go somewhere else and ordered  the Good Ass burger which was avocado and bacon so you can't really go wrong with that
firstly they get 2 stars cause of the good effort and the sincere service of the wait staff who are obviously anime fans and like all things Japanese  but seriously very attentive and good service only reasoin why i give them 2 starsoverpriced and very average broth
I am removing one star from this place because of the extremely slow service
This is an order at the counter place so you expect it to be a little bit faster
The staff is always helpful and friendly although it does help to show some boob the geeks like that I've heard
The service is not bad but it could be better
I ordered the taco combo one ahi taco which was good however the crispy chicken taco was very bland and tasteless

We sat looking out over the patio and Yoli and Vanessa owner/cook and waitress/front of house from what I can gather were immediately friendly and welcoming
I'm not a fan of cole slaw but this was good and I would order it next time

his way of controlling his domain to me he was a little arrogant and a show off to his new young girl employ we ordered the cheese and meat platter with four different options the big push was that every thing was made in house although he was pushing the prosciutto which I said oh you do that in house he said no they get it out of Idaho / oh but then mr cocky was wrong then we finally found out it was from Parma  ok good but i have had this 1000000 times he also was talking  how fab the cheese port salute was and we should try it
ok kid this is not my first dinner out port salute trader joes yes it is good but I have had it as well as I sucked my martinis he did become more tolerable  we did end up with the in house made chorizo a couple of nice cheeses and yes in house pate which was very good we split a beat salad the mussels  I also ordered the open face lasagna but by the time it got to us I was full so we ended bringing it home I will say by the end of the night we had an enjoyable experience and I got use to mr cocky who all and all was a good  wait/bartender
the staff is so friendly and they genuinely care about your service not to mention very appreciative
Fine the waitress said she couldn't close my bar tab after checking with the bartender while she was getting our drinks and she didn't even ask my name to make a good attempt at pretending fine it was an hour and a half wait to get fries after ordering them fine the onion rings came out cold after waiting one hour fine the ham/egg/cheese sandwich came out cold probably sat at the window for a bit less than an hour fine the med-rare burger came out med-well fine when i tried to leave to eat at local bistro they offered to comp my food if I left that I never received I went back as waitress said food was almost done my big mistake fine they comp'd desert I didn't want that came out undercooked and had to  wait again for them to make a second attempt fine they dropped and shattered a plate on one of the guests at our table

The wait staff is nice and attentive and they don't rush you out
All in all I agree with everyone who praised the atmosphere and the happy hour prices but the slow service and dry burger won't have me rushing back to Indulge again anytime soon

The sit-down experience isn't so bad though - it's actually quite pleasant and the staff is very nice

It's well-lit well-laid-out has the nicest staff in the history of chain stores and has pretty much everything I want or need from a grocery store except that it's not a Trader Joe's but what can you do
The waiter was attentive but continually gave us new plates and also referred to me with the awkward pet name of dear lady

The food has been consistently good for decades but lately I hear and see a waiter who talks disparagingly about the owners and their other restaurants in Vegas
Not the greatest wine selection but it adds the allure to the feel I was talking about   Service well it was there and they were on top of things

1st time I ordered 2 Entrees i thought would be a great gauge to measure their authenticity and style

The gaucho chefs were a little slow on service but our server was right there to take any request to help speed up the process
The staff is amazing especially Mich Mich so nice they named her twice
Our waitress was devoid of cheerfulness and was slow
It's a pity such a great venue falls short simply because the manager doesn't manage a competent staff especially since I learned it now has extended hours and turns into a wine bar open until midnight
The balance of bad service versus cool vibe and good food leads to a barely mediocre 2
The gal taking the order was quite friendly and I put in my order for a regular philly with whiz
All in all from ordering to receiving the food it was close to 10 minutes which is okay but could be a little bit faster
The staff are extremely friendly and polite

The front of the counter is a little unorganized and I can only imagine what it's like when it's busy but the staff was nice and accurate
So I very nicely asked the gentleman waiter who was walking by for his help and help he did
While the menu looks pretty good I think breakfast might be the only saving grace here the lighting for dinner the service and the food were all exceedingly below par

I went on a Sunday around lunch time so seating was immediately available and the wait staff was polite and very attentive

The staff is amazingly friendly the food is always fresh fast and delicious and the ambience is interesting but always pleasant and usually quiet
That thing is so good I just wish I didn't get full every time I go so I could actually order one
When our waiter accidently forgot to bring out my boyfriends beer which was really no big deal he followed up with a complimentary drink as well as a small beer for me so I didn't feel left out  We really aren't the type to care about a lost drink order but it's really nice when someone goes out of their way like that
Plus their staff is actually nice and super helpful
They seated us right down on our reservation rights and our waitress for the night was attentive but not too attentive chatty but not too chatty
And that's coming from a person who usually doesn't care for service--Food trumps service for me but when service is outstanding it's plain as day and greatly appreciated
or rather having ROOM for dessert outside of the Cinnamon Roll BUT I can say great things about the Dessert Martinis
and it wouldn't have been so bad if someone wasn't ordering one every few minutes
Our food was pretty good however our service was not so great

Fred Harvil was very friendly and helpful to work with and we really appreciated his service
I like the decor service from our waitress was good not so much for the table next to us  and the menu had some great sounding dishes on it
Service was so-so waitress certainly wasn't enthusiastic This place is akin to a typical tasteless truck stop breakfast joint If you want great service tasty fresh food go Matt's La Grande Orange and Orange Table
+I'm sure it depends on who helps you but when I signed up they didn't try the hard sell on me to get a physical trainer etc+friendly and helpful staff-I have only attended the spin class once because it fills up quickly and you have to sign up on a waitlist-the machines aren't the newest
So the breakfast menu was great and we liked what we ordered
The restaurant was pretty empy though and for being so slow I can't say the service was better

Second we have a seat take a look at the menu and the server greets us by the way nice server but kind of spacey he takes are drink orders and recommends a few dishes
Originally was going to give them 4 stars but downgraded to 3 stars because one staff member was particularly rude to our group for no reason
I really like their meat section and the manager specials can be a really good deal
This allows the place to not be crowded have plenty of seating and give the staff time to be friendly & conversational with customers instead of just rushing you through the line of people
There were some pro's about this place Service was decent and some of the food was really good
and had a really good fresh flavor the chips were nice and crisp the jalapeno cream sauce that came with my numero ocho 8 combo was delicious with just the right amount of spice and the fideo that the hubby ordered was different but I really enjoyed it hubby said it was too plain for him

Great service ok food average chips and salsa
There are a couple of people they've hired recently that are friendly but the old staff seemed dour and off-putting -- never happy to see you
So if you don't need a smile from the staff to have a good workout and you know how to substitute different exercises because the machine you want is already taken then this LA Fitness isn't so bad
The staff is a bit on the trendy side but overall is attentive
My buddy ordered the Pork Chop breakfast with potatoes
an outstanding beer selection and a very friendly staff
This is a tuff review because I LOVE  the drink I get  but on the other hand I would like to know why the people that work there are so unfriendly and just plain bothered to serve you or take your order for that matter  forget it if it's a little complicated they just walk away if you start to change it up a bit
I can handle a line for good cupcakes and good service
Not bad but they're certainly not mind blowing and between the parking lot the prices and the staff they'd have to be a lot tastier to earn back my business

This is the eighth Souper Salad I have tried around the Valley & it earned the usual 4-Stars for it's clean cheery atmosphere good service & fresh tasty food
My favorite burrito to order at any kind of Mexican restaurant is a good old fashioned breakfast burrito with ham cheese and potatoes
So I ordered the ham breakfast burrito which I think at Los Favoritos their specialty is in fact the breakfast burritos I could be wrong
The burrito was sooo good I've ordered burritos from everywhere around Phoenix and this breakfast burrito was among the best
The next time I go I'll make sure to order something different than a breakfast burrito
Great portion free chips clean restaurant friendly service
It didn't take super long to cook and our waitress was very attentive

I do feel I would have enjoyed this place more if our waiter was a bit attentive
On a good note the other diners around me seemed like they had my waiters attention
I've also ordered ceviche tostadas which are good but HUGE two was too many as well the shrimp soup caldo
Another mention is that the service is usually a little too good
But that's definitely better than never and the waitresses are always nice and helpful ; I think they have pretty good happy hour specials here but we're never in time for them
The staff is attentive and personable; not plastic like some 5-star hotels
I can't imagine what the bill would have been for a diner atmosphere in a strip mall bad service and semi-decent food if we had taken any of the waiter's suggestions
We don't mind paying for good food but the prices do not match the du00e9cor or the service of the place
With only two servers running ragged we waited quite a while to order and then to eat and our server who was a really nice guy forgot our dressing
The rings were very good although not hot and fresh enough but I can chalk that up to a busy kitchen and wait staff and give them another chance
The wait staff was very attentive and not over bearing

The service was good and the food was very fresh
Their staff is nice and the interior is awesome compared to most dives
4 stars- Chicken crispy and well seasoned but not too greasy tender meat inside- Cornbread sweet moist mongo muffin with crispy edges- Waffles like that you can get them cooked with pecans in the batter though wish they'd make em a bit crispier- Fried okra I always order this when I see it- Fun drinks 4 different flavors/colors if kool aid and super crazy the way the southerners like it sweet tea- Atmosphere dinery slick red booths- Service very friendly and food came out quickMidlights- Mac and cheese I didn't care for the sour creamy taste of this particular version but my cousin loved it- Red Velvet cake we're a fan of this type of cake but this rendition was just ok
Moist soft cake was great but the flavor was lacking Lowlights- Long wait even Sunday at 230 there was an hour wait- Ran out of banana pudding the southern hub's favorite dessert he was looking forward to ever since he saw the commercial
If you have a Nello's in your area for the value and service they are a great choice
The wait staff was extremely attentive
The machines are very good plenty of cardio machines and staff on hand to help develop a training schedule
00 not super cheap but not bad and because you order at the counter I didn't feel compelled to leave a tip
They hire general manager's like Blake who I may add had been the rudest and most condescending restaurateur I've ever met and I've met a lot

The omlettes are extremly good and very good service
The waitress was nice enough and attentive enough
I'll give the waitress the benefit of the doubt and chalk it up to a perfect storm of me being anxious about being late for an appointment and annoyed that she was taking so long and her having bad timing or being busy
The food and conference service was nice
Their shuttle service was efficient and friendly also
The lounge was smoky and dark as most lounges are but the service was also friendly there

Instead let them get the door for you and take comfort in a delicious meal served by friendly staff who will greet you in Spanish but just as easily will answer you in English
The waiter was nice but never offered to refill our beverages
I've never been to a restaurant that has that much LACK of service its amazing how many people actually come back for more bad service I guess its because of the food which I can understand
Service is always pretty good and the managers are always roaming about helping aid in good service
We also ordered pizzas and it really took a LONG time for the pizza to come out not sure if it was our slow server or a busy night but either way it took a long while
Took a star off for pricing the decor is nice  but it seems that in order to confiscate for the high priced interior design they had to up the sushi prices

My girlfriend ordered the Vegetable Panini after threatening to order a regular green salad for 10 dollars at the burger place she bragged about at the last minute and I was irate with her after she continued to ask for bites of my burger and expressed disappointment with her sandwich which I later thought was pretty good after trying it but nothing compared to the burger

The service was professional prompt and attentive without being overwhelming
Short version of the story was that the manager was rude and I had to swipe my card again for another 60-something cents for the pretzel bun upgrades

While visiting Spinatos recently I couldn't help but notice how very friendly the restaurant staff
The friendly service continued until the moment we left and it left a lasting impression on me
Staff is normally friendly but the Spinatos staff definitely woke up on the right side of the bed and you can tell that they truly love where they work
well enough to almost overlook how bad the food is referring to onion rings nachos and burgers+the staff is friendly enough
friendly enough to almost ignore the rude bartender who wouldn't serve us at 1am mind you the two of us were sober and coming back from going out and wanted a drink before the two block drive home claiming they were closing down even though she took two other customer's orders since we had popped inIf you live within walking distance of this place like the apartments or houses around it it's okay
And it is sit down service provided by a friendly staff

Service was kind of slow but it was a beautiful day and we sat outside so it didn't matter that much

The interior is cute and clean and the staff is friendly
I rated this salon as just average for a few different reasons1 Although the staff is friendly they overdo the up-selling and were quite forceful with my friend who did not want a design on her toes or a manicure

In my many many years of dining out I have never experienced such terrible unfriendly and unwelcoming service
I guess some people could be offended that the staff sit down and eat in the bar when it is slow but I'm not one of those people - I think it adds to the charm
My wife ordered the Penne Primavera which was very good
Some of us ordered sushi - which came out quite fast others ordered other lunch specials that took anywhere between 30 - 50 minutes to come out - if at all

I've ordered the Vegas and the lobster rolls in the past when going there with other people and they didn't seem to be that great
I did not like this store as much as the other one for these reasons1 The layout of the store does not flow2 Things are a mess out of order very unorganized and hard to find3 They seem to charge more and give less4 The staff was not as friendly They took about the same amount and type of stuff from me at the Country Club location did but only gave me half as much credit here
Any other fans that haven't visited the country club location should give it a try I think you'll agree Things are much easier to find  navigating through the store is more user friendly and the staff seems to care about keeping things in order
Overall a great shop with nice and funny staff and it doesn't hurt that they all know their stuff
The staff there is truly nice and I like the personal service

For my side I ordered the pasta salad which was good maybe too many onions for my taste but still good

Service has been mixed from super nice waitresses who would fit in at any 5 star place to surly and unattentive ones who need to be flagged down for even the basics like drinks ordering asking for check refills
They don't serve fountain drinks  They had great customer service and the cuts of meet were good
But the thing that really made our experience great was waiter

But at least with bad service you still can feel like dinner was a win
My roommate and I have a bad habit of always ordering a majority of the menu when we first try a new restaurant
We ordered sodas and found out that only one extra refill is free which is not good when you're eating some spicy salsa

While it was not the greatest Mexican north of the border it was way above average
We will bring the kids and return  Good food and great staff
However that being said I live close enough to order takeout whenever I've had that sort of bad day that needs Mexican food in decent quantities  The foodAlbeit a little unhealthy and definitely Tex-mex rather than Mexican and pretty standard fare in that regard this place is just ultimately satisfying

Our waiter was kind enough to allow split bills and there was no problem in mixed up tabs or anything which was great
I was going to put 4 stars since it wasn't really bad the place was huge - but the service SUCKED BIG TIME
This time I ordered the tortellini with pesto cream sauce after reading reviews that it was good

As others have said the place is not fancy but the food is worth a try and the staff was very nice too
But this Sweet Tomato's is SPECIAL because they have GREAT SERVICE
The staff is friendly but not too friendly which is acceptable and probably preferable to over-attentive in my opinion
I must have sat in the lucky section because we had a fairly attentive waiter throughout the night
I ordered one of their garlic pizzas and it was nice
Not very friendly for a place with service where I was trying to read a menu
The incredibly chilly and relatively unattentive service

For $45 we could have had a much better meal at many other Valley Italian restaurants  The service and wine were good but that hardly matters when the food is not

Went here for our company dinner/happy hourWhat I liked-friendly staff pretty quick to serve drinks n food-good bar-very clean and plenty of seatsWhy no fifth star-the food seemed about average-for a clean place kinda has an identity crisis
Now on to the main points-Meal will set you back only $4 to $6 bones per person cash only-Chicken may be ordered white or dark and is the most flavorful and crispy grilled ignore the red-dyed skin it will be the best grilled chicken you have ever had-Carne Asada is always cooked to perfection not overcooked or stringy or chewy always is Carne Asada greatness-Not only do meals come with your choice of flour or corn tortillas they come with perfectly salted pinto beans not refried fresh salsa and red onions that seems to have been soaked not pickled reducing their flavor to a delicious subtle onion instead of a crunchy onion
Very very friendly staff from the the very moment you walk in through the kitchen yes KITCHEN
Service was great - reading other reviews - we may have just been lucky but seriously everyone was friendly and prompt
On my second visit it was much slower and my order came exactly as I ordered it with all the condiments
I am vegetarian so I only eat the curly fries and I knew that this was what I was going to order but that didn't mean I didn't want to check out their menu to see if they had any other goodies

I ordered steak and eggs a classic which was like 7 or 8 bucks in the back of my mind I knew there was a hitch but instincts aside I was still hyped sadly like most things in my life disappointment  The Steak basically was badly seasoned deli roast beef stacked over my horribly cooked eggs my plate was over flowing with watery steak juice it really should have been served in a bowl it was gross I mean gross the coffee drink was good kinda girly and the decor was aiight
The service was slower than I would have imagined for how empty it was at the time we went but our server was friendly and kind
Service was again on the slower side but nobody was a pretentious asshole or anything
The staff is extremely friendly and even during the dinner rush the food comes out in a reasonable amount of time
It's near the Biltmore and not even 50 yards away is the Gelato Spot which makes for a great dessert
We had a great time and enjoyed the fantastic service and prices
While some of the staff is extremely helpful and nice there are also some very rude staff members
The service was overall bad and the waiter argued with us about the amount of cheese that was on the order from my friend
I was like thinking my friend works in the medical field and has to keep a good customer service attitude when people are throwing up on him so that explanation didn't seem adequate to me but oh well they were going to comp us one slice of pie in addition to the two free slices we ordered from their promotion
We stood outside in the heat and talked after because the atmosphere of bad service inside was so bad lol

The staff is friendly and also knowledgeable about what they carry as it's all hand picked by them

The decor and service were great but the food was not inspiring at all
I'd give it a half star if I could and that would just be for the friendly staff

These far-reaching Gods of Cafetopolis you see Whose minions such as Paneracles and Chipotle have erected from sea to seaDesired like the vendors beyond the Acropolis offeringsCafeteria dining serving Gyro and many such thingsThe fare was befitting of above mentioned ilkTwo stars at best though service was silkThe dolomades came hard the hummus was tastySpanakopita came fried as the cooks may be hastyFalafel were shaped as tater-tots wouldPasty inside the two were not goodSalad lacked olives but for a dollop all groundFeta was sparse with no pungency foundDrachmas went quickly when food was just orderedHigher quality Greek food the price could have affordedEnglish majors
Sandwiches are large so instead of ordering a whole one plus an additional side of salad like overambitious diners like moi it's a good idea to do a half and half with a portion of the ambitious mixed greens salad that is chock full of pears pecans red grapes and gorgonzola cheese
Service was friendly and quick and happy hour appetizers are half off
Unfortunately service while cheerful and courteous was slow
But I was wowed by the nice and attentive service the promptness of their same day service and the quality work they did
Heaping portions hot food friendly but not overbearing thankfully staff
The staff was attentive and friendly - Alan was our server and took great care of us
When I called the waiter over to tell him that the Ras Malai had gone bad he said that I thought that it looked a little iffy but brought it out anyway
The service was prompt helpful and friendly and the food was delicious and inexpensive
It's nice you can custom order your pizza just be aware that it will probably come out even more expensive than if you order from the regular menu
Once seated we had really great service but the food was lacking
Service was super slow and unorganized they don't have a website and google maps gives the wrong directions and when my friend requested information on possibly renting out one of the private rooms they couldn't provide him with any no prices or anything
The decor is very nice and the staff are attentive  After dining here one word sums it up  meh
The waiters do a good job of refilling beverages but this doesn't make up for the lackluster fare

The staff at this location are great always friendly and fast
+Cheap food and drinks Our waiter was very nice and came back to check on us in terms of drinks and food
Our waitress was attentive without being over bearing and helped us pick out a wine and beer for the group
One day can be alarmingly overwhelming and blood-boiling like my first day when we were overbooked and the guests we were getting in all had cancelled flights [very curt and beyond rude to the staff usually]]; the next can be culturally fulfilling and flat-out honorable like getting free tickets to the Rolling Stones or a sincere thank you from a long term guest here for brain surgery who credited his quick recovery to an incredibly attentive staff
That said the staff was very friendly and service was awesome for a 2-woman crew on a busy Sunday morning
On my first trip here I had a very good one I beat the lunch time rush hour and I ordered a bacon cheese burger
I have had some bad experiences with local cafes in the past but I will be back to this location in the future as long as a certain waitress is there to help me Erin -
these guys have really stepped up their game a notchback in the day it was subpar reallybut i ordered a spinach and sausage pizza a few weeks back and it was great not too much cheese and good thin crispy crustnot many places around the area are open latecome 1am you have a choice between various disgusting fast food chains ex$pen$ive $ilver mine $ubs or these guys which when you line em up isnt much of a choice at allgood job fella's now just dont mess it up
The service is usually very fast for pickup it's usually ready in 15-20 mins and delivery no more than 30 minsunless you order delivery on a sat/sun night then it can be an hour and a half  to two hours wait
While it was good I wish I would have spent a little more time studying the menu because I would have ordered something different
The staff was NOT friendly NOT helpful and NOT helping
The 4 of us ordered 4 appetizers the squash ravioli the carpacchio the artichoke heart risotto and the fried gnocchi and every single one of them was truly great
The line was out the door but once we got inside the staff was so friendly and upbeat they really moved the line along
The service here is slow the margaritas are ALL mix and the food is bland and a complete waste of your money
Now that is all I order here and all I ever want to order because it is so good
The wait staff is usually quite good although one thing I don't like about the restaurant is that it is very loud although I guess that is to be expected for a place like this
The server was very nice and helped me order since I was not familiar with this cuisine
I then spoke with the district manager and she was just as rude

I ordered the Stuffed burger once and it was also not that great and overpriced
The crepes fries and sandwiches are great and the service is always really good and so is the environment
the staff is friendly and the grounds are beautful
Topping off what makes this place great was the service totally on the ball friendly but not hovering

Service was good - they were very friendly but when we asked for a menu they immediately pushed us towards the buffet special saying that the food on the buffet line contained the best items off of their menu
Service was good everyone was nice and I loved the du00e9cor of the restaurant
Looking at the menu we really didn't see what we thought we were going to see we got some recommendations from the staff and ended up with Meatloaf very good by the way and a dried out pork chop that was covered in a chipotle raspberry sauce gave me a great idea for my next BBQ they stated this dish was there best/fav
for the price I paid I expect beyond great service but eh our waiter was okay
I see many of the regulars asking all the time what is fresh and good and the chefs will be very honest about what is good and bad and they will order/serve accordingly
The patio is very nice for sitting in a garden type atmosphere and the service was good and very friendly
All of the staff were so great to work with
The staff is very quick and friendly and the location is good as well as the diner atmosphere
There were definitely some bright spots and I'll come back to try more the great service and friendly atmosphere didn't hurt
Really the only bad thing I'll say is sometime the front desk staff are a bit moody and don't seem to want to deal with you
Service was prompt and friendly and it only took several minutes to deliver our meals
My son had an omelet that was plump and full of veggies/meats the hash browns were perfectly crisp eggs made to order were on target and their iced tea was good
Seems like the ratings reflect the niceness of the owners and staff members versus the food
They have amazing food especially good appetizer options for group events the wine selection is wonderful and the service is the best I've had in Phoenix hands down
I've always had phenomenal service at Bombero's but there is one server Tim who you should ask for - he is friendly quick and has an amazing memory
I've always had great service here though I show up very early so I cannot vouch for what it's like when it gets busier later in the AM
The food was good but not great and our waitress was friendly but lacked a professional attitude
The chorizo was good although I order it from the same place they do which I learned from a NewTimes story good job on this dish it was yummy and I enjoyed every melty piece of cheese and chorizo
What I really liked was the veggie taco it has grilled veggies like squash and corn and mushrooms and it was so good but by that time I was stuffed with all the chips that I couldn't order a few more
The wait staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about the crazy huge selection of beers
slow bursting with attitude screw up the bill and screw up the drink orders
I've always had great service here as well
I came here last night with my family for a birthday and the service was great the Rosa pizza was my favorite and I REALLY enjoyed the caprese salad
The facility is always clean the staff always nice
Scale of 1-10 multiple visits7 Food7 Service8 Atmosphere6 ValueThe food is hit or miss some mini-burgers are great some are meh; and the sweet potato fries don't even come close to places like Delux
Food = very goodService = not bad though it took 20 minutes to get the check after we were done
That's not a bad thing lord knows I love Fez and have enjoyed Hula's it's just a fact you need to know in order to have a proper expectation of the food
pizzas pasta salads as well as great looking sandwiches and desserts
SERVICE The server was friendly and kept my iced tea topped off and as is appropriate for a new restaurant I think asked us for our comments on the food
The property is a little older but the staff keeps the place tidy and in good shape
AND THUS THE FINAL JUDGMENT---------------------------------------------------As a well-run cafe serving organic ingredients with friendly and efficient service I'd say Essence is a nice place with great food
Lunch - 7-20-11THE GOODEnjoyed the atmosphere not to mention hot waitressesTHE BADNo AC

BTW 2 waitress that night there was a pretty young brunette and she was nice enough started serving our table in the beginning then just left
I had heard a lot about it and I don't know if I just had a random bad experience but today I went in-around noon to get a take out order
The waitress was very nice-been there awhile I'm assuming and she's a doll but other than that-terribly horrible experience
The food on the buffet isn't as good as if you order fresh off the menu so don't judge Royal Taj on the buffet alone
and soon were greeted by a friendly waiter
Our waiter suggested I also add a few shrimps to the dish as well which didn't turn out to be such a great idea because the shrimp was way overcooked
However the staff does a good job with keeping the top sellers and newly released books up to date and providing lots of choices
While I am a fan of their breakfast I will have to say that it didn't matter which Mimi's location I was at they definitely lack in service our waiter/waitress was rarely around and if you needed refills on your drinks you had to flag down another employee just to have them ask your waiter/waitress for you
The food did not blow me away but its good and the service is very friendly and efficient
4 stars for the great service and unique take on Chinese/Jamaican/Mexican fusion
It's a chain restaurant but EVERY ONE of these places has good food great service and an extensive menu good for big parties/bad for indecisive people

I've only ordered takeout but the food is as you'd expect if you've eaten at either of their other 2 locations which is to say its good
Had a nice experience with pleasant service
Thank goodness we tasted the green peppercorn sauce prior to ordering because that was frightful
Not to mention great friendly service and their water is definitely not tap water
You just know you are going to get great food when the place is not much to look at from the inside or the outside which means the ONLY reason they are still in business is really good food & service
Excellent staff and there was even a nice old guy there that made a balloon animal for my daughter who loved it
Overall the service wasn't too slow considering how busy it was and I didn't have any trouble getting refills

Service was as good as it can be when every table is full
Not only are the waitresses EXTREMELY attractive but also very nice and always remembered our big gang of fools
UpdateI'm steeling a star from my review because of slow service on my second visit and the reprinting of the menu so there were only a few drinks to choose from

I'm sure the waitress can't be having a good day everyday like the rest of us but she still always manages to give her costumers a great smile
The slices might be a bit thin but as the costumer I feel good because I feel like I'm getting just a bit more than what I ordered which makes me appreciate the place

There was quite a bit of good things in the air and on the plate that warrants a second visit and if I order just right I suspect I will come away with a very happy four star experience

It was a slow night in the world of sports and a terrified-looking family in a corner had to ask the staff to change the channel away from a grizzly UFC-type thing set in the jungle

We were headed for a perfectly nice 5-star lunch at Prime but he saw this place on the way and got into his head the notion that a shitty unclean interior with apathetic if not rude waitress service and mediocre food was what we needed instead of the spotless interior eager-to-please service and delicious food waiting for us at Prime
The service was great ice T glasses kept filled
This is a great place for a short lunch or a business lunch but I wouldn't order several pies if I was hosting a Superbowl party or had people over
Awesome ambiance friendly staff delicious food
I'll certainly come back here for lunch because it's right across the street from my work and their patio is nice especially those chairs at the high tops but they just need to make sure orders don't take as long to come out during the lunch hour as many people only have an hour they can take off

I'm always shocked by how slow service can be even when the place is empty but other times I've noticed that it's just poorly organized why is my server working tables half way across the restaurant

The staff is very friendly very professional and very helpful
The only reason I didn't give five stars is the price of the salads when you add meat to them $18 I had one once and although IT WAS GREAT not worth $18 I don't know if the salad was smaller than it should have been or not I still remember the $7 extra to add the  salmon maybe 2 oz  also we've found service hit or miss when an unexpected rush of business happens  but had mostly good service
THE SERVICE I've had some slow experiences but no 'bad' experiences
HARD folks to find good restaurant staff here
I think some of the staff at Bliss/ReBar needs to get a little more fire under their ass and quit worrying about looking pretty to everyone but I wouldn't say anyone is outright bad

Chips and bean dip are consistently room temperature or cooler service is generally inattentive
The wait staff here is beyond friendly and knowledgeable our server Sam was what you would consider first class in every aspect
The bad part was that 1 they weren't busy and 2 because of the open floorplan I could see both waitresses just standing behind the counter chatting it up rather than tending to me
But the menu looked good- salads and sandwiches with a french brasserie kind of flair and I like that so I overlooked it and ordered the vegan salad and a diet coke and put my game face on

I can't even remember which cocktail I ordered but whatever it was it was only one and it had a bit of influence on the lovely tip our attentive waiter received

The staff is friendly and helpful and will take time to explain the menu if you need it
I was underwhelmed by the limited menu but understand that it has to be that way to turn the tables as fast as they need to in order to accommodate the crowd waiting outside

The staff is friendly and efficient and if you have a specific request they have always provided it
The pizza was really good the customer service was horrible price was okay
The chef was nice enough to split each of the orders without me asking them to do so
They have a nice selection of wine and staff are eager to give their recommendations
Also and certainly worth mentioning the service was bad - unfriendly staff and I felt sort of like I should be grateful that I could grab a table rather than feeling welcomed
The service was very friendly and efficient too
Next the service very attentive staff not only our waitress but the entire service team checked in on us throughout our meal
The staff there is always so friendly and ready to serve you with a smile

The staff has always been very friendly helpful and interactive

It is nice to have menus posted where you wait in line so read up decide and order when it is your turn
The service was good the food was good not stellar but certainly not bad they did have the Bushmill's girls walking around with free shots which was a big plus

I've been to 3 separate locations NC AZ CO and they are all clean with friendly staff
We stopped in to grab some six packs for a party and the waitresses act like you are bothering them when trying to order so when they left or finally buggered off I just ordered from the bar and the bartender was nice and gave us a handful of oranges
But again it's an awesome place to bring a book and relax for a few hours and the staff make it a nice atmosphere too
The service is lackluster with unfriendly wait staff who clearly don't want to be there
Contrary to some of the reviews I've seen posted my experience with the wait staff was rather good
Staff was friendly but may of been a little more helpful
The service and ambiance are so good I forgot that I was still in AZ for just a few minutes
Seriously one of the better fry bread places and it's clean inexpensive and the staff is friendly

When dining with a group of people I suggest ordering many plates and splitting them - then you'll have a smorgasbord of goodies
Good food and a cool laid back atmosphere go a long way but annoyingly slow and inattentive service go a long way too
But today I braved the crowds and must've had that get out of my way IDGAF look since I didn't have my breakfast today vibe since I zoomed to the front of the line and ordered right away and even found an empty table
As far as service goes the people working here are very nice & they actually listen to you request

No matter how busy the restaurant becomes and on Sunday it is packed  the staff is always friendly and welcoming
Even more remarkable is that even at its busiest read Mothers/ Fathers days service is speedy and attentive and the kitchen never seems to slow down
Service is usually pretty efficient and friendly as long as you get a familiar face and not the hipster-of-the-week
Van Slyke ordered up and graciously shared the flatbread appetizer with marinara which was pretty good
In reality the guy was more than happy to make us the requested pie -- super nice fellow with fresh ink on his arm that offered us excellent service and didn't complain as we proceeded to nerdily occupy his bar for the next three hours
So I asked the nice manager guy if they rolled the dough out; it happens that they feed it through some kind of flattening robot before loading it into the fancy rotary oven
I don't know why they had to go ahead and screw up perfectly good food with such terrible service
The act like the good food gives them carte blanche to drop the ball on service entirely
***Edited on 10/07 to add the following The staff at Matt's must be reading all the Yelp's about their poor service because I went back there today and they were really NICE
There is one kind of bitchy slow mean waitress who was not there today - so maybe everyone is in a better mood on her day off
Service is always friendly no matter how busy and loud it gets and they're always there to get you another drink
The atmosphere is beautiful and service was great

00 for a weekday lunch but only if it is a nicer place with top notch service and food
One good thing is that the staff is nice and friendly but supposedly Equity Residential managing/owning company doesn't give their property managers enough power to work with their tenants
I used to live near the Gandalfo's in Bellingham Washington where the store was clean the service was great and the manager was a pleasure
The staff was calm collected and friendly
Service was friendly enough for bored workers--the bus driver kindly waited for me to park my car and get on board
The service is great and last time I was there the bartender was amazingly friendly and treated me like we had known each other for years
One thing about this place is that if you order steak or prime rib they use very little seasoning so it is great for true steak lovers who don't need to drown their meat in sauce and seasoning to enjoy it
Finally like others have said the owners not so much the staff are on the rude side
We have always encountered friendly service and excellent food
In the beginning there were a few inconsistencies in the service but that's forgivable since the food is so great and they are a new restaurant
Typically you will findA wide variety of salads and appetizersSeveral Pizza choicesSix Pasta dishesSix Entrees A GREAT dessert menua nice wine list If they don't have exactly what you like or you have a special dietary restriction ask if they will make it

The wait staff was friendly and did their best to duck out of my line of vision
I had a great time altho I must say the kids movie did not require a lot of concentration so the staff walking back & forth were not a problem for us
I only deducted a star because the wait can be very long and therefore the service slow
Instead I will say that this Starbucks location is as expected pretty similar to all other Starbucks I've frequented except for one thingThe service is ridiculously slow
I have got to say what a fab little place with great customer service
Service is somewhat inattentive; can take awhile to get drinks or a soy sauce bowl with wasabi they should just have these on the conveyor
Pros-Wings and tons of sauces my faves honey BBQ asian zing-Offer low-fat ranch regular ranch and bleu cheese for wing dips-Good happy hour food and drink specials-Tuesdays - regular wing specials-Thursdays - boneless wing specials-Service - I've ALWAYS had very accommodating servers and bartenders including changing TV channel to a different game-Calorie counts on menus - make better informed decisionsCons-Noise level - it's CRAZY loud in here even when there are no major games on-Misters do a better job of cooling down the area OUTSIDE of the patio than they do cooling the actual patio area
The atmosphere is intimate and cozy the service outstanding the Pho merely good but the the prices were rather high which is why they are only getting three stars
The sushi chefs are both Caucasian and in typical Barcelona style Danny of Danny's car wash fame and fortune has a legion of staff including the obligatory blond bartender in push up gusseted body corset two bouncers in black shirts doing nothing and several waitresses in black tops looking for a good tip by blowing in your ear
The wedding ceremony was small and was held outside in a cute area that was quite hard to find but the staff were very helpful and friendly for someone that was very lost
Our attentive waiter recommended the guacamole
The bartenders and staff are really great though the drinks take forever mainly because they go a little over board with the fruit muddling and the like
The service is good bartenders and servers make recommendations and I haven't been let down yet
The service was friendly and quick as well
We ordered the Hawaiian Pizza which was very good our son order from the kids menu only 3
The staff were super friendly and I was very pleased with my pedicure but my friend had a horrible experience

turned out they knew each other so we had great service from that point on
Bouncers and door staff have never been rude and don't strike me as the typical roid-monkey variety which is a plus
Our waiter was very attentive and really seemed to care that we enjoyed our time there continually checking on us while refreshing drinks and offering suggestions; he acted more like an owner than just an employee
The service was great and the menu filled all of us up despite the smaller portions
Everyone was really friendly and the wait staff was very knowledgeable about the items on the menu
The staff was friendly although they seemed to lack knowledge and confidence I'll chalk this up to it being a new restaurant
Either this team knowingly has bad customer service/communication and doesn't care to fix it or their management doesn't know what's been going on
The service is very friendly and attentive especially for a sports bar
We were lucky to have a great waitress who answered all our questions made good suggestions and was sure to check in often
A good thing if you can't bring yourself to leave between lunch and dinner service

The rice was forgettable but the lychee nuts made for a nice dessert
Best side to me is the potato salad but all are very good & included in your sandwich order

Towards the end service was better and and our server was nice and prompt
Great atmosphere massive humidor probably as big as they get and incredibly knowledgeable staff
The service is friendly spot-on and I've never been disappointed with the food
I hate to say this because the Lady that worked the station at the Yelp in Bloom party was really sweet and friendly and maybe that's what I was expecting the service to be like
Great patio very warm interior great service and great food
I ordered a hot and sour soup with tofu Tom Yum which was good

Ingredients were fresh and my favorite part is the fast service
Our waitress was super friendly and very good at getting us set up with our meal
With my coffee being readied and having already perused the online menu I would be ready to order by the time Samantha returned and with the time just before 700 I opted for two dishes both garnering a good choice and sat back to read the paper and listen to the overhead radio while I waited perhaps fifteen minutes for my plates to arrive
With service efficient and friendly throughout my stay and coffee maintained near full along with my water my two plates would arrive simultaneously and having heard some Food Network call Over Easy the best breakfast in the state while the posters on the walls hailed Fieri's commentary I started first with their signature item of Waffle Dogs three chorizo spiced pork breakfast sausages on sticks dipped in the house waffle batter and fried to a golden brown and dusted with powdered sugar
Moving next to my second selection the better of the two by some degree a half order of Caramelized banana & pecan French toast was delivered - a dish that would clearly be tasty based simply on ingredients but actually a nice preparation with the single slice of buttery brioche crisp on the exterior and custard like on the inside topped with fresh bananas crunchy pecans and a thick caramel sauce that tasted good on the toast and equally delicious spooned into my coffee
Overall a nice place with good service I cannot say I'd go out of my way for Over Easy but considering its location I could certainly see it making a great breakfast spot after a morning skate - goodness knows it would have trumped the Denny's or Bob Evans I frequented after hockey as a lad
It was so nice to get such great service and nothing felt forced or phony as sometimes is the case in hospitality management
There's just no substitute for such great service and I loved how beautifully the hotel was decorated
Sucker Punch Sally's Diner off of Mill and University is open 24/7 that you can order breakfast lunch or dinner any time you want
When we asked the waiter about our order he very rudely informed us that our food would be served when it was done
Nice to know that the waiter waited 40 minutes to put in our order and no we did not order any appetizers
the food is good but the service is better
Just wanted my damn watch to fit good thing there are a MILLION other jewlers who understand good service
Valley Thai spot the service is prompt and very friendly

While I recovered from the workout Angie the pet friendly waitress attended to SWD with ice cold agua fria
The service was great the waitress was very helpful and nice
Also the waitress wasn't that friendly and the overall customer service wasn't great
They were nice and didn't try to hit on me like some of these cheap oil service places I don't have a big ego  I'm positive it happens to most women who walk into those places
I rate this 4 stars for excellent food great service and general cleanliness
The group I was with ordered queso dip w/spinach as an appetizer which was actually pretty good
The service is friendly but kind of slow and not very attentive everyone who works here is nice though so I guess they make up for there shortcoming by serving with kindness
It was pretty good-we got the house cheddar biscuits to start which were amazing and then i ordered the Smoked Chicken Artichoke Sandwich and my friend ordered the Pork Loin Sandwich which i'm definitely ordering next time
The service was awesome very attentive and the flavors were fantastic
Very mediocre Mexican food but good service
Despite having some communication difficulties since it was hard to hear each other speak We were outside on the patio at a table and a live band was playing our waitress did a good job refilling drinks as needed and getting our orders in
I believe the owner took our order and he was very nice and accommodating
The service is great my water glass was constantly filled
the place is great for lunch and breakfast kinda slow service and cheap diner food but worth the price tag
The 15 to 20 minute wait goes fast and the only thing that is faster is the service
The pool is also very nice and you can even order food to the poolside tables
The place has great atmosphere and a cute patio area to sit outside when it's a nice day service was prompt and courteous
I wasn't feeling super good that day or I would have ordered a martini and dessert so I'll have to go back

The order took around 15min for a take out which is pretty fast

The food was very good service spectacular ask for Dane

The staff is super nice I especially like Natasha and Lauren since they answered hundreds of questions I had

The wait staff was great though attentive and helpful
The Bad is how slow the line is when ordering your food
The staff is very nice and the service is good too bad the food does not match

The bar staff is very friendly and always ready to give you a refill
I ordered these two items a la carte so they come with a serving of rice and naan- which is a pretty good thing as far as value is concerned at Indian places
I ordered the Hawaiian  First I must say the service was great
The service was also a little slow especially for the bar area were service is usually quicker
The person in the next booth was raving about how great the service was he had a different server so maybe we just had bad luck
Formerly known as Sonoran Brewery I still miss the name Sunup still has the same great food beer and service
Our waitress was friendly but seemed pre-occupied and had a hard time keeping our order straight

Waitress wasn't very good but I think she was new
Nice staff cool atmosphere decent food
The staff was friendly but a little slow at the bar to say the least I ordered a couple of Long Island Ice Tea's which made everything warm and fuzzy
I would have loved for the black pepper reduction to be a bit thicker and for there to have been a bit more as it paired so well with the pork and I would have really loved for there to have been room for dessert though I'm pretty sure Chef Beckett had little control of that detailIn all Beckett's table will take it's rightful place among the most well regarded restaurants in Greater Phoenix and become a must visit destination for fooderati
everyone was extremely friendly and our waitress was totally attentive
Tottie and her staff are extremely attentive and friendly every visit
The food each time has been pretty good however the service is always lacking
Our waitress was nice that is when she was around
My only major problem  was the very VERY poor service it was slow and the waiter actually forgot to bring back the check and credit card
Nice server but service was a bit slow due to the crowd there
I rarely order fries but will always bogart one of two of yours if you order them and they're better than fast food averageWhat I don't like
The service was fast and friendly and as we all know I am a slave to fountain diet cokes
Wish they had a couple of different salsas  the one they have is really hot and I like hot but it was to hot It would also be nice if they gave you a small bowl for salsa when you order and pay for the chips and salsa  the tiny one ounce to go container is kinda hard to eat chips and salsa out of
A good amount of meats if that's what you ordered and fresh vegetables as accompaniments
The room service is great the food is tasty -- it's the perfect place to unwind
All the staff were very nice and professional

Ordered the breakfast buffet and Bloody Mary the first day which would warrant 3 stars

My grandparents had a bit of a time making their way through but the staff was very good about assisting and getting us a table near the door
Bar staff was slow we didn't get our food and when we complained the waitress was rude
I enjoyed stopping in being greeted by staff with smiles; staff that could make a great drink and fast
Most people I think are just used to having their orders taken rather than the time-saving option Chino takes when they get hardcore busy which they occasionally do and when they're not they're nice enough to help you and give you samples
The issues that I have are the really weak drinks don't even bother ordering a cosmo or margarita especially since the drinks next door at Z are amazing and the not so great eye candy behind the bar which has been in place for years
This shack goes through its spurt of being good and average but to be honest through our venture with this business we have never had an awful experience with the staff or the food AND the price is soo affordable
We DID happen to get great service last night but that isn't the norm especially when you're sitting in the please-completely-neglect-and-or-forget-about-me section known as the patio
The service was really good attentive the also have a party room with an absolutely MASSIVE TV in it as well as a nice indoor and outdoor lounge
Breakfast of champions right thereWe also ordered Hot Wings and Teriyaki wings
Total including a 20% tip was about $27 not too bad for room service
The staff is courteous and the ambiance is good
Finally I asked the waiter for his recommendation for this lost patron he steered me in the direction of the osso bucco which is presented on the house made spaetzle I must say I cannot remember the last time I had such a great meal It was so tender it just fell off the bone and right into my mouth
Also what I'm pleased with is for the cheap price they have a great dessert area with an ice cream machine
Great for service but must play heck with employee costs
The only plus is that they do friendly staffs
Food AverageService GoodAmbiance Poor - feels like an akward size cafeValue GREAT
oh wellIf the service had not been good
So my impression was that these guys do not have their eye on  the ball here that they are expanding too fast that the staff needs training that you need floor managers that know how to work a floor that the timing in your kitchen is way off
Healthy affordable food great staff good atmosphere
The service is great and everyone is friendly
When you think it is done your server brings out dessert for your table; it is always great making the meal and experiance complete and satisfying

One basket is almost the equivalent of 2 small fast-food orders of fries
The food here is EXCELLENT the beer is VERY good and I've had both good service and slow service
The prices are low the service is adequate and the food is great
While I waited I noticed a few other customers wondering what was going on with the bad service at the counter
my typical orders are the biscuits and gravy grilled chicken sandwich or various breakfast combos but never the waffle - don't go there
It's not fast food and you may have to wait a bit as they cook your order but it's definitely worth the wait
I was also impressed with how friendly and knowledgeable the staff all were considering how busy it was
The wait staff is incredible the food unbelievably good
Well our first waitress was a little too friendly and just about sat in my husbands lap
We also greatly enjoyed the comfortable atmosphere created by the owner and staff
people this a freakin bar for goodness sakes a hole in the wall  its no Bistro Its no classy spot and you can honestly smell a stench coming from the place weather its the bleachy pissy smell  or stank coming off the BAD SERVICE
Keep it classy and go next door to Mill cue club  its nice inside great service smoking hot staff and cheap good drinks
the service was nice and friendly yet we had to ask for samples
The only thing I can say that was good here was the waitress
I do enjoy the food -- the Udon noodle is good but there wasn't any of the Japanese beer left for me to order
I ordered my panera usual and it was great
We were seated and treated to some of the nicest service I've experienced in a good while
For lunch we split the beef tacos and the chicken pita nini with the jalapeno pesto both on the recommendation of our waiter who was very attentive
The staff was all very friendly and respectful
I walked into this dirt hole holding my breath and tongue and willing to order something in the hope that I could find some good Mexican food good Mexican food is actually an oxymoron anyway I stood where it said order here
If the service is that bad I can't believe the food is going to sway me otherwise
I am sold on their Thai Iced Tea and order a small size to try and be good
Back to the fun office this is where this resort gets another star because it is great for families with young children because there are a ton of events put on by the staff for not only the adults but for kids as well
We were served so quickly and they did a great job remembering everyone's orders
I had the water boiled fish that I tried to order last time it was very good and lighter than the water boiled chicken I was given last time both those dishes seemed very mild and far less tongue Thrilling compared to the Chicken hot pot but they were also flavorful and were lightly tongue thrilling
Thought it's usually  crowded with Hipster ASU students I have yet to receive bad service
The waitress was super accomodating and nice
Their selection of music is extensive and their staff are friendly
I would recommend if you want a great glass of wine without food Cork is the place though our waiter Winston had difficulty remembering what wine was ordered at our table
The portions were huge there was a salad bar yep this seems eons ago and service was great
The waitress was great-the restaurant still never got busy and we ended up closing the place down that would be 10pm
The staff were all very friendly and my barista was eager to help me select the perfect drink
The staff is nice enough they work on a team work basis and tell you to feel free to grab any waiter I find that a bit irritating
Our waiter was super fast and friendly
District had it all ambiance service and great food
The service here is very friendly prompt and helpful
The cafe is very charming and comfortable we definitely had a good time getting dessert here
Room service - on time and pretty good 21% service charge
Now about the service which on my latest visit was ridiculously bad
I decided to try this place with my family and the service was GREAT
We immediately got our table for two and I ordered the Country Fried Steak Breakfast platter that also came with 2 eggs cooked by my choice 2 biscuits with gravy grit which was sort of plain but I threw some gravy in to try to make it better it was my first time trying grit and hash brown casserole
I got my order and the first thing I did was make a sausage mcmuffin the country fried steak was good and so was the casserole though it coulda been hotter and crispier but it was still great
Everyone is really friendly there is awesome outside seating and just good service
The staff was friendly even though security came to our room every night to tell us to tone it down
Great atmosphere the service is friendly helpful and quick
They get one star for having decent service and another star for having quite good portions
Their service is always amazing and their people are always friendly
I guess it's only redeeming qualities are that the staff are nice and you have the convenience of not having to get out of your car and getting everything through the drive thru
The wait staff is totally nice and I've never gotten a dirty look when I come back to my table with a plate laden with crab legs
The staff hostess server busers & manager were all VERY attentive
There were certainly moments of greatness ie the appetizer issue when they demonstrated an understanding of good service
The gist  Excellent flavor excellent customer service and great prices
Overall service was friendly and attentive even though there did seem to be a longer than normal wait for drinks to re-appear
All this being said the service was good and they were honest with what was going on
Pros nice comfortable casual room; varied appetizer buffet- we especially liked the Kobe sliders and the salads; the complimentary duck fat fries; the skirt steak and salmon entrees were both outstanding and perfectly cooked; delicious sides- grilled corn smothered in a zesty sauce grilled asparagus baked beans; dessert overkill with apple crisp root beer floats and chocolate slivers and pecan cookies; mostly great service they brought me the wrong entree at first
The staff was as nice about it as they could be and offered us free drinks to make up for the disappointment
Everything was great and I quickly wished I had ordered more cornbread smeared with that delicious honey butter
I'm not a huge fan of beans and potato salad and never willingly order them for sides but these were really good
SERVICE The staff was very friendly and quick to serve
But the food is REALLY good and very inexpensive; everything is freshly made to order and is very authentic
It's noisy it is great for people watching and there are a lot to see and if you're like me BUYThe staff always seems to be smiling and are helpful when asked BUT this will never be the Nordstrom of restaurants
Most of the staff has been friendly but today I had a very unpleasant encounter with a woman in the area where they sell discarded books
Service was extremely slow - starting with a long wait of even having a server approach our table
Sorry to say - we will not be back and instead will return to our other 'tried and true' Asian restaurants where we are assured both good service and flavorful quality food
Found a perfect spot for an early morning meeting Chompie's in Tempe is convenient with nice friendly-service and a great homemade corned beef hash
The food at Rubio's is great but I have to agree with Crystal it's the staff at this particular restaurant who keep me coming back
This place is do-gooder heaven as Cups is owned by Hospice Care Colorado the staff are mostly volunteers and all proceeds
I was greeted by a friendly staff and I looked over the menu and saw the managers special posted on the wall and had to try it
Our waiter wasn't very attentive and 2 out of the 5 orders were screwed up
The waiter also gave us a piece of the red velvet cake which was also very nice because the red velvet cake is excellent and some of the best around
All in all the great variety on the menu good service tasty food unique atmosphere  and moderate prices make this a solid choice for lunch or dinner
The sauce was actually super good but it seemed like they were in a rush to get the order out and it came out lacking
Service was pretty good and they had flat screens everywhere so you can watch playoff basketball
First off the staff are very friendly and I enjoy that the kitchen is open and visible and that it looks like somebody's mom and grandma are cooking
The staff at Chelsea's Kitchen is so pleasant - it makes the evening great
Overall - an outstanding evening - great food - great friends - great staff
We ordered room service the night before for breakfast the next morning
We both work in the service industry and are very sensitive to bad service
So what did I order that was so great
The one good thing I can say is service was was very good and prompt
When I was here there were a host of regular customers yucking it up & my service was friendly & nice
Sat inside with my main squeeze had a friendly waitress and enjoyed I had a truly delicious omelette with salmon asparagus and goat cheese hash browns and toast
What made it nice was our sassy waitress Sarah who still hasn't hiked Squaw Peak and playfully razzed us for having come from doing just that
The patio in fact was quite a-buzz with attentive staff with water pitchers
I ordered a beer The waitress even recommended one that wasn't on the menu yet nice touch and my sister who is much better behaved than I am ordered a water
Incidentally the service was quite good and responsive especially considering how busy they were
We ordered seconds of the Patatas Bravas - sure it's not the most exciting thing on the menu but when something's good
Great food fun atmosphere and wonderful service
Just so you know you can order lunch sizes at dinner which is always nice for people with smaller appetites
Beside the Groupon we ordered a popcorn which was also good
The waitress was so friendly and helpful the layout of the restaurant was authentic and kind of gave us a feel of the Venetian in Vegas with the high domed ceiling
The service was good the crowd was usually of the clubber variety
Their pool party rocked the service was near perfect the rooms were nice they have an in-house spa Japanese restaurant Sushi Roku and a lounge The living room
I've seen many complaints about service on here and while my service was not BAD in terms of inattentiveness it certainly wasn't normal
Service hads always been prompt and friendly and overall its just a nice comfortable joint to go and relax and know you are gonna get some great food consistently
Our waitress was very nice and always made sure we were taken care of without constantly interrupting our conversation
The staff was is extremely friendly but the place is a mess
Usually I sit at the bar and find the service to be friendly and top notch
Both times we have also had very friendly service
However the Manager is a really nice guy and seems very interested in excellent customer service
The wait staff was very attentive & efficient
It is also good for a cheap workday lunch and sometimes I'll take a gamble at the expiring today or close to it manager special section
I have found if you order some thing that They send off to the lab it's great
The only redeeming quality of the meal was the friendly service
The staff is nice but they need to have so sort of control on seating and people
As for the 5-star rating it's due to two things 1 outstanding frozen custard -- the orange creamsicle flavor of the day was outstanding and we've been enjoying the fudge pecan on a regular basis -- and 2 the customer service is always friendly and very informative
Service is good carry out is great as well
Service at both was friendly and efficient
We both ordered the breakfast burrito with coffee and decided to sit out on the patio area because at 800 AM it was a little cooler outside than inside the restaurant
The bad Our waiter was a bit spastic and came back way too often and way too quickly
When we arrived the place was packed with other baseball fans - so we got in line ordered an omelette and a breakfast sandwich along with oj and a mocha
The decor is very tastefully done ALL of the equipment is BRAND new and the staff is friendly
Nice decor lovely outdoor space with the ever so classy tequila bottle lights and good service
The service was a bit slow but they were really busy so I guess it was worth the wait
A few times I had less than stellar service but since the food is so good I continue to come back again and again
So if you're shopping here and you know the prices and the customer service that you're going to receive at this brand - it's a great location
All the staff I dealt with here was very nice and accommodating I think the number of stars this place gets is inversely proportional to the price you pay
I blame the strong drinks and great service at Apollo's
Sometimes we get good service and other times we don't
Our order is usually messed up but they are good about fixing it
- the place is super clean and smells surprisingly good- all staff members are knowledgeable friendly and actually seem to not hate being  there another rare find at a doctor's officeEven though this urgent care isn't close to my house I will continue to come here when I'm in need
I didn't see any meals that included pancakes a side of breakfast meat and eggs -- in fact the pancakes don't even include a side of breakfast meat so you have to order that a la carte
Anyways the service was really great they can't control how fast the food gets out most of the time
They have really great sandwiches that are high quality and very tasty and they come with great customer service
The food was good but the best part was Kailey our waitress she was exceptional
When my order arrived I ate the marlin taco first which was very good but could have used less cheese
The service is great the atmosphere is fine the food is adequate and the dessert is definitely a step or two above average
So we spent about $48 holiday pricing so ticket was $12 instead of $9 and that included a wonderful chair great service large popcorn Parmesan fries and two Coke Zeros
Because it was slower this particular day we received pretty prompt service
Not wanting it to sound like an insult I refrained from telling the waitress that the grub was ot bad for bar food
Finally don't plan to run in and grab a breakfast sandwich for the road- on average it takes 10 minutes by the time you order and get the food
I ordered a the 19th Street Burger which was cooked perfectly and came with a spicy sauce not sure if the sauce was for the Onion Rings but it was great of the Burger
Service was good for a Sunday night and they are open late
The staff was very friendly & even helped me pick out a wallet
The staff is friendly and helpful and the owner Bill is a great neighborhood resource
The staff was very friendly and attentive
and it's good for a free lifetime dessert every time you visit and have an entree
They are only open for breakfast and lunch but you can order any of them at any time during business hours
The serving staff have always been very friendly and accommodating and it makes the experience a very pleasant one every time I am there
I just ordered the cheese platter with nuts and dried fruits and the 3 cheeses I chose were very good
The only slight drawback was the service was a little slow
I love that it's been there for years and years locally owned with friendly staff
Yes the interior is run down but the place is clean the staff is friendly the portions are huge and the prices are very reasonable $7
And the food was really good - all four dishes that our party of four ordered were really good
It was a very good price for 2 appetizers 2 entrees 2 glasses of wine dessert and tip
The amazingly beautiful lobby and the attentive service are the best parts of the hotel
Per my standard I skipped the menu and ask the very friendly waitress/hostess to make a recommendation
We also ordered a bruschetta plank - for $12 you get 6 huge pieces of bruschetta a really good amount of food for the money
The service is slow but the ambiance in the restaurant is really nice
They have all three of the essential triumvirate of a successful eating establishment - Great Fun Atmosphere Awesome Food with Ample Selections  & Nearly Perfect Service
Service was good besides a couple of waiter blunders
I wanted to like this place because the staff is so nice it's off the charts
Again- super nice staff but overpriced and then the massage was blah
And the tSoynami's are really good but closer to a dessert than a drink
This place has great food good service and excellent outdoor atmosphere
It's fun to see people walk by and the staff is very friendly
Everything is fresh and the service surpasses that of fast food
The ambiance drinks food customer service was all great
Very nice to have a local bookstore fill the void left by the closing of Borders and Bookstar a Barnes & Noble store down the way
If you order the taco plate for a few dollars more you can get sides of their slow cooked beans and rice
Otherwise the service was generally very good except for my last drink which I think she forgot to order until I reminder her
I guess my money truly is no good here because I honestly did not feel the staff gave two fucks about me the whole time I was there
and while the service can be slow at some other's i have been to
i had an order of the sweet potato fries and it was nice that they drizzle honey on it but not nice that it was over-fried and burnt
The service is always great I came hear the first time with my wife for a date night and it was very good
The food is great the service is attentive and friendly and the owner's take tremendous pride in their food and customer opinion

The service has also always been good never had a complaint about it
Good bread which is why I no longer go to Subway because it's like eating ingredients stuck between two pieces of cardboard good quality and friendly service
The waiter was extremely friendly and did not take offense to our slaughtering of the names of the menu items
Our food came out quickly the service was attentive the prices were reasonable and I was REALLY impressed with the taste portions and quality of our dishes
The concessions and all of the staff are nice and competent
I just ordered there classic/ original cheese burger the burger it self was good but definitely not worth $13
The resort was very clean and staff were friendly
The employees are courteous and the service is fast
The service was great but the meat quality was definitely lacking
The resort itself is well maintained and the staff is very friendly
If you're particularly unlucky you may be served by the effeminate robotic waiter who avoids eye contact--he manages to be chirpy and rude at the same time the worst of both worlds
I called up to order delivery and they were super nice
The nice chic on the phone finished taking my order and told me the pizza would be here in 45 minutes
The kid at the register and the manager who greeted us at our table were super sweet friendly and helpful
Service was a little slow on our last visit but I have a good amount of patience that it didn't bother me too much
When we were seated our waitress was very nice and helpful
I truly adored her and can't say enough great things about her her staff and the Arizona Grand Resort as a wedding location - plus our honeymoon suite was hands-down the best accommodations my husband and I have had to date
If they cut your group off of drinking while dining at the Valley Ho I'd suggest not bypassing the waitress and ordering straight from the bar it'll get you 86'd faster than trying to dry hump your date in an 8th grade dance
The portions are reasonable the service was great of course it was pretty dead that night & the food is quite tasty but not gonna change your lunch/dinner plans regularly
So next time you are pondering whether or not to leave the extra coupla dollars c'mon you know you'll just blow it on something stupid leave it for your server when provided with great service
We don't think you can order anything bad here
I'm really hoping this isn't the best Chinese restaurant in Phoenix because the service sucked donkey balls and the food was nowhere near good enough to make up for it
Service was friendly prompt and professional
The waitresses are all very friendly and won't make you feel dorky if you are not a hipster or Scottsdale staple
The staff here was friendly and helpful I will give them that
Friends ordered beef tacos and cheese enchaladas and said they were great
Overall good service great atmosphere and good food
The beer selection is decent service is good and I really like the food
The place is set up for catalog fulfillment so everything isn't always easy to find if you are in a hurry but the staff is always available and friendly and they can direct you if you need help
Great food and service whats not to like
Plus side- the service was very good and I had a cup of the soup that was decent
Went to Gallaghers on a Thursday night for a blind date I can't really say much about the place because the date and I just wound up talking nonstop and only ordered drinks it was a great 1st date but not really great for our waitress who was waiting for us to order have to say on Thursday nights there is a trivia  night which brought out a good crowd but with the questions being asked my date and I felt like we missed the study class and jumped right into the test wow we only got one answer right  and that made us both laugh too
So went back on Friday night for a follow up date from the 1st smaller crowd but great service we actually ordered this time
The pricing is very reasonable for the quality of food you get and the great service
The food was all delicious but what really distinguished this event was the personable attentive extra-mile oriented staff
The girl taking orders was friendly and greeted us right away but seemed confused when my friend and I insisted on ordering and paying separately and was especially confused when my friend ordered a 20oz bottle of soda in addition to his fountain drink
The atmosphere was great the food was outstanding but the service was embarrassing
The front desk staff was quite friendly and my wait was short
The owner and entire staff are super supportive fun-loving and VERY GOOD AT WHAT THEY DO
When I drank my cocktail I think I had the Grapefruit Gimlet sort of slowly the waiter asked if I wasn't enjoying it
The staff is great here - the little tiny gal is super friendly and always makes a point to ask how I'm doing and how is work and how is my husband etc
But her customer service skills are great
The time wait apology drink order food order chat appitz comes food comes & a nice check on how we like it etc
Staff are so extremely nice and loving to the dogs
The waiters are attentive fill your drinks get the orders correct and offer suggestions
The service is better than what you usually receive in nicer restaurants
The service here is good not exceptional I find the people at Home Depot are USUALLY more knowledgeable
Normally I would be fine with this but when a restaurant like Bacon is charging a $15 check for a really basic breakfast and coffee I expect better service
The waiters there are also very nice and funny
Reasons we won't be back1We got seated right away our waiter brought us water menu bread and then we watched him say goodbye to Joe and WALK OUT THE DOOR
This location is clean and has relatively good service and the same Denny's food that you'll find at just about any other
Staff was friendly and even helped us out with mixing the sauces
Service 3 stars very nice attentive and not intrusive

The service is always good although this time our server was particularly flirty
Rooms were impeccable bedding some of the best I have seen and felt great downturn service bedroom slippers chocolates soft light soft music playing and of course the bed down turned
My husband's Marriott burger was good though and the food was served fairly fast considering it was room service
The staff was exceptionally friendly which was great and the wait for the elevators was never too bad
I've never had a problem with the service but I always just chill at the bar and the bartenders are great
Goober's prices are right and the staff is always very courteous and friendly
The restaurant looks great and the staff was very friendly but unfortunately that's where the positives end
Great food ample portions pleasant staff and reasonable prices with tons of parking and never a long wait
Service is quick and friendly likely because the the staff are paid higher the minimum wageFor those in the know there is a 'secret' menu that can be used to customize your orders
I ordered take out but their little after dinner doughnuts were a nice twist to bbq
I hear good things about the wings but I usually order something else
It's a very nice space with Scottsdale-attractive staff
Service is friendly even if a bit busy and absent minded
As Eric noted the service can be a bit slow but It's excellent food prepared with the best ingredients
if they don't have an album chances are darn good they can order it
Great place - the service was very good the bartender very helpful the food was delicious and the prices were very reasonable
I heard some people complaining about the slow service and the credit card terminal being uncooperative
The food is okay the service can be hit or miss and the beer selection isn't that bad
The staff is very nice which is a plus in these days of restaurant chains
It's clean and organized and you are not sad in there by poor lighting and rude staff
The owners are the nicest people and the staff is always pretty friendly
Our server/waiter was fast friendly and courteous
We also ordered the melted cheese thing for an appetizer and it was awesome cheesy goodness
Same predictably good food as Sens in a very pleasant setting with the always friendly staff
very good service also the decor is a little weird because this location used to be a 5 and diner also if it's slow time of day it's really quiet in the place no music in the background so it feels kinda strange
Good coffeeGreat sconesThey've done a good job on the environmentStaff is friendlyon to the cons
Thought I'd head over to Truckin' Good Food and place my order since a crepe normally takes 12 to 15 minutes to prepare due to all of the people lining up for their fix of French delights
I got an unbelievable price great service they were very niceall of them and they knew what they were doing
Fresh ingredients clean friendly service overall
Service was good and they have improved on the length of time it takes to get in and out of there
I didn't notice how long it was but thought we should be getting our breakfast soon only to have the waitress come back and tell my husband they were out of the benedict sauce
The waitress was good and apologized for the long wait
They also have plenty of equipment so Im never stuck waiting for an available machine Very Important  and the staff is very friendly
providing a comfortable and hip atmosphere great service and mouthwatering delicious stomach stuffing

This time around we had perfection for service and really good food
Unfortunately to get the good service U have to speak Mandarin/Cantonese
**Update** Since I posted this in Yelp Kona Grill's District Manager has reached out to me in an act of great customer service
Quite possibly the best Hot-and-Sour soup I've had IN MY LIFE and all of the everything else that was ordered was smack yo' mama good
Liked our waitress Theresa seems to be a good place with good people & friendly staff
Liked the variety of ways you can order your wings nice touch

Firesky is a beautiful resort nice pool service rooms and all
A fun and varied menu with good service
Staff was friendly as was with my first visit
My waitress was really nice about but I know she had no say in what action the manager would take
The owner and staff are always friendly and look forward to checkin in and seeing them when I'm able to make a stop by the place
The service is bad it's like you should be grateful to buy their food if they are busy
GREAT FOOD/BAD GUEST SERVICE  I go here often becuase of the cuisine alone
Other than that the staff are friendly and enthusiastic and the wings look amazing so I think this is going to be a great addition to downtown
He said it was a great place for him I think I did good picking it hahaSo we ordered the wings with spicy thai peanut sauce and beer bread the wings were so dang good it packed the right amount of heat
2 Get some fun friends together Oregano's is great in groups of about six - keeps all seating options open3 Grab a deck of cards or two you'll see4 Get the whole group to show up at 6 they won't put your name on the list unless you're all there5 Hang out and talk or play cards with your friends for forty minutes or so now you see why they need to be FUN friends6 About 20 minutes before your scheduled seating order two things DEEP DISH PIZZA and GUACA-TONY
We have never had a bad meal or bad service
The cobbler and the donuts were great and I ordered the ice cream sampler
The service is slow their coffee bar area is slow to be restocked and half the time I have to ask for refills on coffee creamer and other times its just long lines at like 7 am due to the slow service
Overall its not that bad of a place but Einstein's has become rather bland and boring over the years leaving me desperate for better service better bagels and a mostly generic feel
Besides that the service really was great and I did not regret my decision for choosing this place
At 5pm sharp the whole staff runs out yelling and hooting and the line moves relatively FAST
The people watching may not be the same but the food is great service outstanding and even better prices
Last time I was here with my wife and a friend we tried to sit at one of the high top tables next to the bar but apparently for no good reason you cannot order entrees at the high tops though you can at the bar
The service was very friendly fun to chat with and moved fast
The staff is friendly and quick to help you make up your mind and it has always been very clean and well organized
Over the years I have been to various Bandera restaurants numerous times and the food and service are always consistently good
Still a great people watching spot just for the confused self-service moments
I do appreciate how fast the service is - it's hard to plan on sushi on the way to work as it's usually a lingering meal for me - but I can go into How Do You Roll 15 minutes before work get a couple rolls to go and still punch in on time
The food is fresh staff friendly and informative and this provides a great alternative to fried fast food or tired subs
then she proceeded to go order two more at which time she declared that it was so good it's torture
And to top it off the guy taking our order was very friendly and the place was nice and clean
Can't remember the name of the Cabernet he ordered but it was f*#king good
He ordered some sides asparagus mushroom potatoes au gratin all very good but let's talk about the steak
I waited at the bar and the service was great
The coworkers were two very pretty young ladies and the waiter was your definition of a 'ladies man' but surprisingly I still received just as good of service as the gals
The guy managed to flirt his face off with the girls and provide attentive and prompt service at the same time
Order some of the nicer things on the menu not a stupid burger
And one last note about our waitress - she was patient and friendly no matter what the situation was
Service was great considering how busy they were
I have never had a bad experience with wait staff service etc
The waitress we had was very friendly and had our drinks refilled before they were empty even though they were fairly busy
The waitress while extremely friendly forgot to bring my table's silverware
The staff was great -- friendly conversational and attentive
Service They are pretty good about clearing your plates and refilling your sodas
We waited about 12 minutes or so before a waiter felt bad for us to ask if we had ordered yet
We get our drinks and the menu looked good and we figured out what we wanted to order but then another 15 minutes went by without any waiter attention and we decided to head off to another local place that we knew we would get better service
We've had good service and okay service
The atmosphere was very chill and the service was great
The outdoor patio is nicely shaded with misters and the staff is all very friendly and attentive
Our waiter was realllllllly slow like we sat down and sat and sat for a good 10 minutes when a lady walked by and asked if anyone had taken our drink order we said no she asked what we wanted
The food is great the beer is Great the staff is great
What a better way to spend the day than good service excellent brunch food bubbles and a best bud
As soon as I walked in the door I called them and spoke to a very rude manager
The staff is friendly and knows the menu inside & out and if you stick around long enough Chef David will probably swing on by to say hello
They have a pretty good menu we tried the fried ravioli appetizer and it was really good also the drinks we ordered were mixed perfectly and he definitely didn't skimp on the liquor lol
Their service is always great and when I was going in regularly they always remembered me and knew what my friend and I wanted to drink
The staff may be friendly & tell you they are here to help but I got worse service here than any of the Canadian Lululemon stores the fitting room staff kept disappearing & I had to go out of the fitting room 4 times to get other styles/sizes
Our waiter was very friendly and came over quickly to greet everyone and take our drink orders as we started dragging in
The service was friendly and quick enough but the selections were completely overpriced

Doesn't matter what you order or how busy or slow it is
It's the right price at a great location with reliable service
The staff is always friendly and will go out of their way to make sure all of your questions are answered
- The front desk staff ranges anywhere from extremely friendly to somewhat scary
Even though it was our waitresses first night she did a great job
The service is always friendly and helpful
The service was good and prompt but if I'm paying $10
I finally got up and this is why the inside table was good and just ordered from the bartender directly to get a fresh set of drinks
I will note that the bus staff was quite helpful and nice to see how they worked to sort of fill the gap keep the table clean of used glasses and dishes offered to bring fresh silverware etc
So back to the review 3 starts because well at this experience the wait service just wasn't all that great and it may be my only experience since a restaurant I do love the herb box is within walking distance but I think that over time as long as management is self-reflective this place may continue to improve
I'm looking at Alex F's review from 02/23 and see he went when they were not busy and the service was still not great
i really enjoy the ambiance and the staff is very nice and friendly
Service was friendly and charming if a bit inept
If I could find a great rate I would happily snag a casita for myself and some girlfriends and hang out over at the secret little casita pool hmmm no cocktail service though wait
I enjoyed my meal and our service was attentive as well - and that says a lot since our group went through a ton of water and iced tea
The waitress was very nice handed us menu's and announced that they had a new chef and tonite was the release of their new menu
I ordered the Pulled Pork sandwich which came in a great sauce with a kick and some slaw on a bun
I have been before on a Sunday evening when there was not much activity and the service then was quite attentive and the food was wonderful
So when I heard they were offering $40/pp during RW PLUS a free dessert normally $48/pp and no dessert it was too good to pass up
The place is crowded and every time I've been there service has been slow
Other staff were energetic friendly and helpful
I was still kinda mad about how rude the PCT lady was so I called back to ask for her manager
I gave this place 3 stars not for the food but because the staff is really nice
They've also ordered a bike rack for me and helped me install it because obviously I am no good with manual skills
They do not have the best views but the staff is insanely friendly and they will do whatever they can to make sure you have a good stay
After another round of drinks we weren't sure we could handle dessert but we shared a nice vanilla ice cream rolled in coconut and set in chocolate
It is less than a buck I get that but it is also a simple gesture of great service
Food was amazing as usual but service was so incredibly slow
I don't get why the service is so slow here
I will still come back because I love their food and they have great wine specials just wish the service was better
This review is based on ordering many things from the overall menu over a 1 year period however one item there deserves a 5 star rating which I will get toOverall most of the items are fairly americanized and not traditional which you expect from a fusion place - however most items are very average and for the price I do not feel you get good value here That being said the one item that does stand out here is their Shrimp Tom Yum Soup which i feel deserves 4 if not 5 stars - it is excellent and flavorful with a lot of shrimp - make sure to order a side of steamed rice with it medium hot and you will have a stand out dishIn general their soups are solid but the only thing I have not found better somewhere else is their Shrimp Tom Yum soupGo for the Tom Yum get your Vietnamese soup from Khai Hoan down the road a few miles
The Bad The Customer Service is seriously bad
We have gone to Papago countless times and have yet to EVER have good service
The beer outweighs the bad service which is why they get 4 stars and we continue to go to Papago
5 stars rounding up because of the desserts and the restaurant's participation in such a good cause

Service started out well with a nice touch of a choice of fruit for your water
Service was not astute nor attentive and sometimes baffling
The gentleman that I spoke to on the phone while giving my order was very helpful and nice
On his second stop by the table after I brought it up I finally told the waiter that the fact the salad was served on an ice cold plate which would have been a good thing if the salad was supposed to be cold likely contributed to cooling off the dressing
Everyone was very friendly that when I made the reservations they asked if it was a occasion and I told them it was a birthday dinner when the time came to order desserts no I didn't get the churros because as a birthday cake they served some sort of pumpkin cake with ice cream and pomragrated seeds on top that was just O

One of the waitress we had actually kept selling the place out telling us basically the food here is bad go somewhere else
A tad expensive for the quality but maybe it's a good thing the waitresses suck because I never feel bad leaving a lousy tip
Friendly helpful staff sometimes slow and forgetful but always pleasant
on the bland side but I prefer that to an oversalted fried ihop style concoction  Also the service could afford to be slightly more attentive

The benefit here is that the service was pretty good but if you're looking for pizza walk on by

The food is consistent and the staff are always friendly and ready to serve
The thing that always gets to me in an annoying way here is how surprisingly bad the service is

The service was attentive and friendly the food was amazing and the prices were reasonable though the bartender encouraged us to order waaaay too much food not that I minded We ordered-Edamame surprisingly large portion-Shishito peppers really good but WAY too large of a portion - I hate wasting food and we only ate like 1/3 of these - only so many peppers you can eat
-Flame Seared Sesame Salmon Nigiri - this was the highlight of the evening - this literally melted in my mouth and tasted so delicious I almost forgot that I was eating sushi in ScottsdaleThe service was really great - we sat at the bar which was large and spacious
I might end up buying some bottles because I thought they were so tasty- the staff knows their stuff- the caprese was great- it has a very laid back attitude when wineries and wine tasting usually exudes this air of elitism- would be cool to have a private party here which they do a lot of- tasting 5 wines for $10 is pretty awesomeCons- it is kinda weird to be the only people in the place no matter what day or time it is- i don't need to watch you put on rubber gloves and make my food you can do that in the back
The staff was very friendly and attentive
I would much rather pay more for the good stuff than order something like this crap

Good thing I like avacado because it ended up on my sandwich & I didn't order it and after telling the girl she said I thought you said
They also just call orders out as they're ready not necessarily in the order as they were placed so things can gets a little helter-skelter but in the end it's all good and the Chuck Box is as good as it gets
The service here is always friendly and fast
I don't like the bartenders attitudes but I will hand it to the security staff of all things they are the nicest bunch in there
Not somewhere I would come to impress somebody however The waitstaff however is generally very good
Most times the service has been spot on but the last time I was there 2 weeks ago the service was slow
As someone who works in retail I know all about what it means to offer good customer service and act professionally in all situations no matter how difficult the customer's behaving
When I tried explaining my case to the manager he was beyond rude
Thankfully the burgers were so good that I forgot all about the bad service at the counter and enjoyed my meal
We've always had great service; the waitresses are quick and attentive
She had also suggested the Ribs which we probably should have ordered too instead of the tillapia ---- the fish was good but just not as wow as the other food on our plates

1252pm Our meal arrives along w/ our check due to waitress' keen inference that we were now in quite a rush105pm Paid and out the door125pm Arrive at Aiport thank heavens for web check-in short security lines and a 10 minute delayIts too bad
Still this was slower service than any cafe to which I've been in Europe which is much more overt about eschewing expedience
Bullet points to the rescue The Good -Nice server and prompt service -Good ambiance -Great patio -2 of 4 meals were excellent The Bad -Sub-par carnitas--overcooked cold and no flavor to top it off -Bad fish tacos--cold and not much going on The Ugly -Plumbing issues in the bathroom
The tuna sashimi I ordered which was not very good was $21
Its so rare to get good customer service nowadays so I really boast about it when cust

It is a great quick option for something fast that is mildly healthy and low carbs if you order right
Worked my way up the counter and was greeted by a noninterested/rude teller who looked and acted like she had better things to do then take my order
Ok it's the rude service at the cash teller that I base my 3 star rating on if there was a 2 &  1/2 star option I would take that because at the end of the day it's a fast food business it's the tellers job to take my order and maybe answer a question or 2 I might have since this was my 1st time to this establishment and now I am left with the impression that really I don't want to go back and place another order
Great pita sandwich but bad customer service I don't see me going back any time soon
Although the food and beer were good the service kind of sucked
Christopher had PHilip helping as a waiter and he did a great job
On top of how good the food is their customer service is excellent
He made that dining experience so good that I wish I could write a review about him personally and suggest to his managers that he get a raise
I've never experienced service like that and really can't say enough about how great this guy and all other staff I came into contact with was
We also ordered a volcano roll and a rainbow roll the rainbow roll wasn't that good the shrimp on it was chewy and the avocado tasted a bit old
The meal was slow to arrive service was slow and the food was boring
One very nice waitress asked how things were I swear they time this purposely when you have a mouthful of food
They must have heard that people were having a poor experience with regard to service because the guy helping me out was really friendly and talked with me for a bit about the different teas they offer
everything I've had has been good quality another interesting touch is coffee ice if you order an iced drink they actually use frozen coffee cubes as the ice so even when the ice melts it doesn't spoil your drink
My amber ale from Breckenridge was good and my wife ordered the cheaper of their Pinot Noir's and it was also good
YUM on food Great for service and Place is clean
The service can be a bit slow and mainly because it gets busy towards peak hours and doesn't have way too many servers- but for me its' worth the wait
Probably not but it looked like they were doing a pretty good business with local traffic and the service was fast
Service was cheerful and probably could have used a little more help - not sure they were expecting the crowd they got last night but we were enjoying the music and not too concerned with how fast service was

The line always moves VERY quickly and the staff is always very speedy and friendly
and I love their fries when I feel like indulging but love that they have side salads and fruit to choose from too if I feel like being good Their dessert is probably my favorite part though
The only thing that prevents me from giving this place five stars is the inconsistency and slowness of the service
The place has a casual relaxed atmosphere and the staff is friendly but it often seems to take forever for the food to arrive even when the restaurant isn't busy or crowded
we basically had the place to ourselves but since there were so many takeout orders for superbowl sunday the cook service was a bit slow
Free valet until 11pm beautiful lobby lazy river eucalyptus cooled towels in the gym new work out area well lit w/ natural light lotion that makes you lose 10 years great service dessert bar in the lobby in the evening beds made out of clouds comforter made out of kittens and candy free wifi 5-star restaurants and shopping within walking distance 2 shower heads walk-in closet

Admittedly I have had good service there at lunch but not recently  and the few occasions I have gone for dinner have been OK too
Everyone here has been so supportive and encouraging and I can't ever thank them enough for what they've done for me I have to give a special mention to Jennifer who is the manager of Usery Park she is not only knowledgeable and friendly but is one of the kindest and most supportive people I have met

No thank you have a nice night thanks for the order NADA
Well to our surprise when we were picking out wines I guess we were not moving fast enough because the waitress roll her eyes at us
I called Adobe figuring that I could at least get the number for a good 24-hour emergency hospital from their answering service

Super cute great service really wonderful vibe
Not only does this place have great food and great service but they are caring people
Maybe your taste buds are poor but you are rich - you should still take people here   - Staff tip amazing pears from Aravaipa Farms which has a bed & breakfast only about 2

My BF gets the mocha - initially he got one on accident after ordering a hot chocolate - but this accident was a good thing
Nice friendly service and a beautiful patio
That right there was great costumer service and will make me a loyal costumer

The staff has always been super friendly and helpful when I've been ordering the cakes
The one bright spot was our waitress who was friendly and did a good job
That said when a good friend wanted to try FNB I was good to go - but in my mind I was somewhat hesitant wondering if it was one of those places that had a rush of good reviews then service ambiance and quality would slide
Our waiter Kris was friendly attentive but not hovering
Staff was friendly; nothing remarkable
It's fun and family-friendly your waiter will write his name on your paper tablecloth in crayon upside down so that you can read it then leave the crayons for you to go crazy with

I have been here twice now and both time the service and the food has been great

friendly smiles = friendly service and extra food
Great food plenty of sitting room good lighting and friendly staff
Despite their great croissants I swore I'd never go back to Scratch after about my fifth or sixth run-in with their bratty staff However FWIW the owners are quite nice
Their croissants especially pain au chocolat are truly five-star and the rest of the food is generally good but I'm still quite wary of the staff
I only order the Cafe Latte but given how good it is everything else must be good too
The staff is not very friendly  nor helpful
The food is fresh and the service is great
I used to always order the Portobello Mushroom Sandwich but I feel like they changed something with it that makes it not as good anymore
They have always had bad service but this last and final time was the worst
The Northern Italian cuisine is truly amazing the staff is always warm and friendly
This time my return back has got me ordering one of the breakfast specials which was the Salami Scramble
We ordered drinks from an un-friendly bartender and then waited another 20 minutes to even be acknowledged again
We sat there for about good 15 mins before the a waiter acknowledged we were there when he walked pass by a few times to wait on the table right next to us
My idea of a good breakfast is good service and an enjoyable relaxing time all three of which I did not experience during my visit

We orderedAntipasto - My bf's favorite vegetables were roasted perfectlyRosa Pizza - My favorite the red onions were not overpowering and the crunch of the pistachios were greatWiseGuy Pizza - Sister and bf preferred this one over the Rosa the Fennel Sausage was very flavorfulThe wait is a bit ridiculous
It was good but the service was terrible yet again
The staff was great  infact everything was really nice
They gave us a dessert on the house and we called it good
I sat at the bar and the service was friendly and attentive
Especially since Jim's good sized fleet has to be serviced somewhere and the service department generates a huge amount of the dealership income
later after ordering but the owner of the place knew of the issue and made it up for us by paying for our breakfast free of charge
PRO*Matt was really nice*Service was great*The sour dough bread with blueberry jam was really good
You don't come here for ambiance or good service
The waitress was friendly and attentive checking in on us every 10 minutes
Everybody is very friendly even when on the phone taking orders
Add in the great service and you have a solid pizza place for the south Scottsdale area
I still had questions so I left my order information with the nicer yet clueless on cakes lady in the bakery
Prices are a little stiff but I guess costs are high for premium strip mall space quality ingredients and good staff
However the customer services was great the manager even came over to say hello
The staff is very polite and attentive catering to you every need
Mondays the service is really bad please note business hours
Honestly there were so many choices in each category and everything sounded so great that it took us about half an hour before we could place our order
Waitstaff is friendly and seem to know everybody while the atmosphere cozy classic and fun
I asked once if I could order off the breakfast menu later in the day & they said I could
Uh when I asked about ordering the item that might have been a good time to let me know I was not going to be charged the posted price
The one that let's you think that ordering FRIED Calamari with artichokes FRIED catfish I think and FRIED Alligator is a good idea
You want a great meal anytime of the day come here; just don't come here for the service

It's just a neighborhood diner/restaurant where you will see your regulars the wait staff hanging on their days off and oh yea just plain good unpretentious food just like the decor and patron

I loved the modern and fresh look and the staff was helpful as well as friendly
The replacement service is great for the times when you get a bad dvd usually a cracked on from the delivery and they've never let me down with price selection or service
The sushi rolls are always consistently good but the thing that lacks is service
The waiter Able great with the service suggested I try the naked low calorie Brooklyn Apple
One of the biggest pluses Matt's actually knows how to cook hash browns I didn't need to order them well done they come nice and crispy as is
for my entree I ordered the shrimp puerto penasco--slightly spicy with soft mouth-wateringly good risotto--perfection
The wait staff was friendly and they kept the soft drinks filled
The service is always very friendly and super-quick
I agree with the reviews that indicate that the service here is not great
The staff was a rude however stopping in both days we were there to make sure we paid which we did  and were going to leave exactly at check out time which we did
That's annoying and bad service sure but the reason I'm writing this is that they were patronizing rude and just plain insulting
Either way are they really doing me a favor to follow up on the bad service for the crappy product they sell
The pool staff as well as the hotel staff are great and try to accommodate you in every way possible

The front desk staff was always really helpful and friendly
The waitresses were super nice even after having to deal with some of my pretty drunk  friends

We ordered a lot of food and shared with each other and I have to say that everything I tried was really good
I have eaten at this spot twice both times really great and friendly service
On my first and only visit to this restaurant I experienced a rare level of genuinely kind and friendly service
I want to go back for no other reason than the world needs the Blue Fins to keep some remnants of good old service with a smile
This place is a good model for any restaurant owner/manager who is struggling with getting their troops to provide more than sub-par service
This place is super swank great for people watching and the food/service are top notch
* roast corn = sweet and crunchy* potatoes au gratin = potatoey cheesy goodnessHere are the lowlights* the wedge salad is sub-par  and not steakhouse quality at all* the bar area is too cramped and it was a mess for our waiters and servers to maneuver
The staff were very pleasant and friendly
+1 for the great food +1 for a good mix of music -2 for lousy/slow service that started in the kitchen
If I hadn't had the sample of that I'm not sure what I would have ordered since everything sounds so good
I ordered a large pitcher of Blue Moon which if you have a three person group the price is pretty good
All that changed once we got a good dose of the service and food
This time the service was not only uninspired but downright rude
Instead of building customer good will and making us feel welcome this staffer decided to convenience himself and inconvenience us
To be perfectly honest the service we received was not very good at all
In a nutshell food is good service bad spicy factor too much
I have no complaints about this place service was great food was good and happy hour prices were decent
